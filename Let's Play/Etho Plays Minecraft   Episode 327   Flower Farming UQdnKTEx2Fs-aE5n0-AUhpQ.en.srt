00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
challenge
 

353
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,189

would have huge implications in that

356
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
would have huge implications in that
 

357
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,869
would have huge implications in that
because skeletons are the biggest

358
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
because skeletons are the biggest
 

359
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,150
because skeletons are the biggest
problem in uhc

360
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
problem in uhc
 

361
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,150
problem in uhc

so challenging anyway i'll be back in a
bit once i

398
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
bit once i

bit once i
get this worked out

400
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
get this worked out
 

401
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,430
get this worked out
all right so this is our current mob

402
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
all right so this is our current mob
 

403
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,310
all right so this is our current mob
sorter the mobs they fall down right

404
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
sorter the mobs they fall down right
 

405
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,670
sorter the mobs they fall down right
right there in front of the piston

406
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
right there in front of the piston
 

407
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,310
right there in front of the piston
ocelot makes the creepers run that way

408
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
ocelot makes the creepers run that way
 

409
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,990
ocelot makes the creepers run that way
villager makes the zombies run this

410
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
villager makes the zombies run this
 

411
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,949
villager makes the zombies run this
way uh and the skeletons we had just

412
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
way uh and the skeletons we had just
 

413
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,070
way uh and the skeletons we had just
fallen down there

414
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
fallen down there
 

415
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,750
fallen down there
they were the troublemakers because we

416
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
they were the troublemakers because we
 

417
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,430
they were the troublemakers because we
couldn't really tell them what to do

418
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
couldn't really tell them what to do
 

419
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,509
couldn't really tell them what to do
until now we have the wolves

420
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
until now we have the wolves
 

421
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,870
until now we have the wolves
to to boss them around for us so

422
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
to to boss them around for us so
 

423
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,430
to to boss them around for us so
i think we're gonna make another tube

424
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
i think we're gonna make another tube
 

425
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,630
i think we're gonna make another tube
for them to fall down

426
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
for them to fall down
 

427
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,069
for them to fall down
like around here and

428
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
like around here and
 

429
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,110
like around here and
i guess the witches will fall down

430
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
i guess the witches will fall down
 

431
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,870
i guess the witches will fall down
that tube because before it was the

432
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
that tube because before it was the
 

433
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,430
that tube because before it was the
skeletons and the witches mixed together

434
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
skeletons and the witches mixed together
 

435
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,389
skeletons and the witches mixed together
um if it if it all works perfect that is

436
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
um if it if it all works perfect that is
 

437
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,590
um if it if it all works perfect that is
of course

438
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
of course
 

439
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,910
of course
uh so that means the wolf should

440
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
uh so that means the wolf should
 

441
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,030
uh so that means the wolf should
probably go

442
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
probably go
 

443
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,670
probably go
here like right on this piston

444
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
here like right on this piston
 

445
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,829
here like right on this piston
because they'll fall down and they

446
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
because they'll fall down and they
 

447
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,829
because they'll fall down and they
should run this way

448
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
should run this way
 

449
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,550
should run this way
is the hope we'll see though what

450
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
is the hope we'll see though what
 

451
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,590
is the hope we'll see though what
happens here

452
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
happens here
 

453
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,030
happens here
um i guess block

454
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
um i guess block
 

455
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,230
um i guess block
trap door block

456
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
trap door block
 

457
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,790
trap door block
trap door this will be the place they

458
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
trap door this will be the place they
 

459
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,430
trap door this will be the place they
fall down

460
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
fall down
 

461
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,310
fall down
so i'm going to make a glass tube here

462
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
so i'm going to make a glass tube here
 

463
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,990
so i'm going to make a glass tube here
and we will try it out

464
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000

 

465
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,430

uh the leads do work they do work on the

474
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
uh the leads do work they do work on the
 

475
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,150

dogs uh

476
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
dogs uh
 

477
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,230
dogs uh
it's just that one dog is like weird and

478
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
it's just that one dog is like weird and
 

479
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,190
it's just that one dog is like weird and
defective or something i'm not sure

480
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
defective or something i'm not sure
 

481
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,750
defective or something i'm not sure
so i can move them around with these but

482
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
so i can move them around with these but
 

483
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,750
so i can move them around with these but
i got to get them up there

484
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
i got to get them up there
 

485
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,110
i got to get them up there
and that's going to be challenging i

486
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
and that's going to be challenging i
 

487
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,790
and that's going to be challenging i
can't really use the lead for that

488
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
can't really use the lead for that
 

489
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,829
can't really use the lead for that
so i think i'll just pillar up and

490

so i think i'll just pillar up and
 

491
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,230
so i think i'll just pillar up and

away from the dog but i think they'll
 

639
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,790
away from the dog but i think they'll
either go to the right left

640
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:02,800
either go to the right left
 

641
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,590
either go to the right left
or down here i don't think they're too

00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
or down here i don't think they're too
 

643
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,230
or down here i don't think they're too
concerned

644
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
concerned
 

645
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,910
concerned
which way they go they just want to get

646
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920

647
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,990

653
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,670

yeah t intersection will not work

654
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
yeah t intersection will not work
 

655
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,550
yeah t intersection will not work
properly

656
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:20,560
properly
 

657
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,030
properly
i think what we'll do instead we'll just

658
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
i think what we'll do instead we'll just
 

659
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,110
i think what we'll do instead we'll just
keep it aligned like it was

660
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
keep it aligned like it was
 

661
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,670
keep it aligned like it was
have the skeletons and the creepers go

662
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
have the skeletons and the creepers go
 

663
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,670
have the skeletons and the creepers go
to this one

664
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
to this one
 

665
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,990
to this one
so we'll put the dog with the cat over

666
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
so we'll put the dog with the cat over
 

667
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,509
so we'll put the dog with the cat over
there

668
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
there
 

669
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,629
there
and then we'll separate them again

670
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
and then we'll separate them again
 

671
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,550
and then we'll separate them again
at the bottom there i think there's a

672
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560
at the bottom there i think there's a
 

673
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,389
at the bottom there i think there's a
way to do it so have another wolf

674
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
way to do it so have another wolf
 

675
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,509
way to do it so have another wolf
down there to split the creepers and the

676
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
down there to split the creepers and the
 

677
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,910
down there to split the creepers and the
skeletons up

678
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
skeletons up
 

679
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,670
skeletons up
if we do this it might not even be worth

680
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
if we do this it might not even be worth
 

681
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,949
if we do this it might not even be worth
it to be honest

682
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:48,959
it to be honest
 

683
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,069
it to be honest
because it was working okay before

684
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
because it was working okay before
 

685
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,829
because it was working okay before
uh this seems like it's just adding a

686
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:53,839
uh this seems like it's just adding a
 

687
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,829
uh this seems like it's just adding a
lot of extra to it i'm not sure if it'll

688
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
lot of extra to it i'm not sure if it'll
 

689
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,990
lot of extra to it i'm not sure if it'll
do much

690
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000

 

691
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,990

okay i had another idea this might work

692
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
okay i had another idea this might work
 

693
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,910
okay i had another idea this might work
i'm gonna try move the cat

694
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:03,920
i'm gonna try move the cat
 

695
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,670
i'm gonna try move the cat
from there to let's see we want the

696
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
from there to let's see we want the
 

697
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,710
from there to let's see we want the
creepers there

698
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
creepers there
 

699
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,389
creepers there
right so we're going to move the cat to

700
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
right so we're going to move the cat to
 

701
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,069
right so we're going to move the cat to
here

702
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
here
 

703
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,990
here
hopefully the creepers won't run that

704
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000
hopefully the creepers won't run that
 

705
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,430
hopefully the creepers won't run that
way they don't really have anywhere to

706
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
way they don't really have anywhere to
 

707
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:15,829
way they don't really have anywhere to
run

708
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:15,839
run
 

709
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,670
run
to so i think they might not

710
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
to so i think they might not
 

711
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,189
to so i think they might not
but i'm not sure we'll see zombies will

712
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
but i'm not sure we'll see zombies will
 

713
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,069
but i'm not sure we'll see zombies will
go that way

714
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
go that way
 

715
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,150
go that way
because they go after villagers like

716
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
because they go after villagers like
 

717
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,870
because they go after villagers like
with with the fierce vengeance

718
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
with with the fierce vengeance
 

719
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,310
with with the fierce vengeance
so they don't really care if there's no

720
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,320
so they don't really care if there's no
 

721
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,550
so they don't really care if there's no
land to walk to

722
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
land to walk to
 

723
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,470
land to walk to
uh and then what we'll do is we'll put

724
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
uh and then what we'll do is we'll put
 

725
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,230
uh and then what we'll do is we'll put
the wolf over

726
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
the wolf over
 

727
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,430
the wolf over
there and that will make the skeletons

728
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,440
there and that will make the skeletons
 

729
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,829
there and that will make the skeletons
go

730
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
go
 

731
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,430
go
this way i'm pretty sure and not go that

732
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
this way i'm pretty sure and not go that
 

733
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,470
this way i'm pretty sure and not go that
way because that would be

734
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
way because that would be
 

735
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,790
way because that would be
the direction of the wolf i think that's

736
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
the direction of the wolf i think that's
 

737
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,910
the direction of the wolf i think that's
way to handle that

738
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
way to handle that
 

739
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,749
way to handle that
and the reason i was having the minecart

740
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
and the reason i was having the minecart
 

741
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,710
and the reason i was having the minecart
problem there has been a change i had no

or when it happened but you can push
 

747
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,509
or when it happened but you can push
minecarts off of tracks now

748
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519

 

749
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,189

763
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,110
might try to use an activator rail
that's a new feature where you can

764

which is what this is

770
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
which is what this is
 

771
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,710
which is what this is
so it drops them off tends to drop the

772
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
so it drops them off tends to drop the
 

773
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,870
so it drops them off tends to drop the
guy off on the tracks though like the

774
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:34,880
guy off on the tracks though like the
 

775
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,590
guy off on the tracks though like the
mobs

mobs
 

777
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,350
mobs
so like not off to the side

778
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
so like not off to the side
 

779
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,150
so like not off to the side
so that might be a bit tricky still to

780
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,160
so that might be a bit tricky still to
 

781
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,710
so that might be a bit tricky still to
deal with

782
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
deal with
 

783
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,789
deal with
but it's something

784
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799

 

785
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,150

that was heading today
 

899
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,830
that was heading today
i think i have to just build it in

900
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
i think i have to just build it in
 

901
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,950
i think i have to just build it in
creative

902
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:24,960
creative
 

903
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,310
creative
and figure out how it works exactly

904
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
and figure out how it works exactly
 

905
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,390
and figure out how it works exactly
to get anywhere with it so we're going

906
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
to get anywhere with it so we're going
 

907
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,470
to get anywhere with it so we're going
to start something new

908
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
to start something new
 

909
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,510
to start something new
and try do it quick i saw this so this

910

and try do it quick i saw this so this
 

911
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,990
and try do it quick i saw this so this
really surprised me look at this we got

912
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000
really surprised me look at this we got
 

913
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,110
really surprised me look at this we got
zombies and mobs every single possible

914
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
zombies and mobs every single possible
 

915
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,950
zombies and mobs every single possible
place they can spawn here

916
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
place they can spawn here
 

917
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,110
place they can spawn here
in the walls pretty much oh i should

918
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
in the walls pretty much oh i should
 

919
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,029
in the walls pretty much oh i should
have went down

923
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,710

yeah like every dark spot in the wall

924
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
yeah like every dark spot in the wall
 

925
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,350

has mobs this is
 

927
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,870
has mobs this is
this is where i got to build a mob

928
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
this is where i got to build a mob
 

929
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,190
this is where i got to build a mob
system uh eventually

930
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
system uh eventually
 

931
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,350
system uh eventually
like this is in the man cave by the tree

932
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,360
like this is in the man cave by the tree
 

933
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,470
like this is in the man cave by the tree
farm

934
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:10,480
farm
 

935
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,070
farm
this is such a good spawning area

936
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,080
this is such a good spawning area
 

937
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,830
this is such a good spawning area
it's crazy anyway so we are in

938
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
it's crazy anyway so we are in
 

939
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,110
it's crazy anyway so we are in
swamp land as well i'm gonna i want to

940
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
swamp land as well i'm gonna i want to
 

941
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,029
swamp land as well i'm gonna i want to
build a flower farm it's a very nice

942
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,039
build a flower farm it's a very nice
 

943
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,669
build a flower farm it's a very nice
simple project we can probably get done

944
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679
simple project we can probably get done
 

945
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,830
simple project we can probably get done
uh at least the technical part of it

946
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:27,840
uh at least the technical part of it
 

947
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,549
uh at least the technical part of it
today might decorate it later

948
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:30,559
today might decorate it later
 

949
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,669
today might decorate it later
um

950
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679

 

951
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,350

let's see i'm gonna head up to the grass

952
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,360
let's see i'm gonna head up to the grass
 

953
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,669
let's see i'm gonna head up to the grass
actually one sec

954
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
actually one sec
 

955
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,310
actually one sec
and look at this this is above that at

956
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
and look at this this is above that at
 

957
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,710
and look at this this is above that at
the surface just tons of mobs always

958
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720
the surface just tons of mobs always
 

959
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,350
the surface just tons of mobs always
under the

960
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,360
under the
 

961
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,310
under the
the snowflake here so when i build the

962
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,320
the snowflake here so when i build the
 

963
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,669
the snowflake here so when i build the
mob system

964
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
mob system
 

965
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,990
mob system
uh by the man tave this is where it's

966
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,000
uh by the man tave this is where it's
 

967
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,390
uh by the man tave this is where it's
going his head's on backwards

968
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400
going his head's on backwards
 

969
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,270
going his head's on backwards
or something so flower farm flower farm

970
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
or something so flower farm flower farm
 

971
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,549
or something so flower farm flower farm
uh swampland is the only place you can

972
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
uh swampland is the only place you can
 

973
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,470
uh swampland is the only place you can
get these blue flowers

974
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
get these blue flowers
 

975
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,990
get these blue flowers
and then we'll probably need to build

976
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,000
and then we'll probably need to build
 

977
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,230
and then we'll probably need to build
another flower farm in a flower forest

978
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,240
another flower farm in a flower forest
 

979
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,830
another flower farm in a flower forest
and i think that will get me

980
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
and i think that will get me
 

981
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,350
and i think that will get me
all the different types

982
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360

 

983
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,830

the grass is a different color here

984
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840

 

985
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,549

i just noticed that swampland it gets

986
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:18,559
i just noticed that swampland it gets
 

987
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,750
i just noticed that swampland it gets
greener here

988
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760

 

989
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,630

1021
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,390

quick just a very very tiny one
at two by two

1024
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000

 

1025
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,549

you used to be able to build a dark room
and spam bone meal on grass

1028
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,480
and spam bone meal on grass
 

1029

and spam bone meal on grass
and as soon as a flower or grass would

1030
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960

 

1031
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,630

grow on it it would get uprooted

1032
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:28,640
grow on it it would get uprooted
 

1033
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,390
grow on it it would get uprooted
instantly

1034
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:30,400

1035
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,669
instantly
that doesn't happen anymore

1036
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679

 

1037
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,750

then it changed where you could update

it seems that way so we're gonna use a

1066
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
it seems that way so we're gonna use a
 

1067
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,350
it seems that way so we're gonna use a
piston

1068
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,360
piston
 

1069
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,390

design that i came up with today

1070
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
design that i came up with today
 

1071
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,390
design that i came up with today
um that you've probably seen before

1072
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,400
um that you've probably seen before
 

1073
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,110
um that you've probably seen before
it's not a new design or anything um i

1074
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,120
it's not a new design or anything um i
 

1075
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,630
it's not a new design or anything um i
haven't seen it used for a flower farm

1076
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:22,640
haven't seen it used for a flower farm
 

1077
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,909
haven't seen it used for a flower farm
yet though

1078
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:25,919

 

1079
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,870

awesome so i have found a location for

1081
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,549
awesome so i have found a location for
our flower farm we're gonna put it right

1082
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559
our flower farm we're gonna put it right
 

1083
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,149
our flower farm we're gonna put it right
here

1084
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
here
 

1085
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,590
here
in the tree farm because this is the

1086
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
in the tree farm because this is the
 

1087
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,990
in the tree farm because this is the
only part of my cave that has swamp land

1088
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000
only part of my cave that has swamp land
 

1089
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,710
only part of my cave that has swamp land
is in this tree farm area and we haven't

1090
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
is in this tree farm area and we haven't
 

1091
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,950
is in this tree farm area and we haven't
built anything here so

1092
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960
built anything here so
 

1093
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,630
built anything here so
i think it's about time we start

1094
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:42,640
i think it's about time we start
 

1095
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,549
i think it's about time we start
expanding out this way

1096
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:44,559
expanding out this way
 

1097
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,630
expanding out this way
i feel bad like we have all these trees

1098
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:46,640
i feel bad like we have all these trees
 

1099
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,950
i feel bad like we have all these trees
and i never see them because i never

1100
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:48,960
and i never see them because i never
 

1101
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,950
and i never see them because i never
like i have nothing to walk to over here

1102
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:50,960
like i have nothing to walk to over here
 

1103
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,430
like i have nothing to walk to over here
so now i'll have something to walk to

1104
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:53,440
so now i'll have something to walk to
 

1105
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,830
so now i'll have something to walk to
um a flower farm and hopefully we'll add

1106
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:55,840
um a flower farm and hopefully we'll add
 

1107
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,630
um a flower farm and hopefully we'll add
more stuff

1108
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:56,640
more stuff
 

1109
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,789
more stuff
in this area eventually so

00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
in this area eventually so
 

1111
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,230
in this area eventually so
this is how it's going to go we're going

this is how it's going to go we're going
 

1113
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,789
this is how it's going to go we're going
to lay down a bunch of rails here

1114
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
to lay down a bunch of rails here
 

1115
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,070
to lay down a bunch of rails here
and there's going to be a hopper

1116
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
and there's going to be a hopper
 

1117
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,190
and there's going to be a hopper

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,200
minecart that goes around picking up
 

1119
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,710

1512
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:25,840
idea this clock has a limit of that
 

1513
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,950
idea this clock has a limit of that
speed

1514
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:26,960
speed
 

1515
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,110
speed
so i'll have to create a new clock or a

1516
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
so i'll have to create a new clock or a
 

1517
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,230
so i'll have to create a new clock or a
different clock

1518
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,240
different clock
 

1519
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,269
different clock
uh if this isn't quick enough

1520
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:33,279
uh if this isn't quick enough
 

1521
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,830
uh if this isn't quick enough
it might not work now

1522
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:36,840

 

1523
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,509

yeah that's the problem with

1524
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:39,519
yeah that's the problem with
 

1525
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,830
yeah that's the problem with
playing with timings on camera it's not

1526
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:41,840
playing with timings on camera it's not
 

1527
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,230
playing with timings on camera it's not
going to work then

1528
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,240
going to work then
 

1529
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,990
going to work then
um see do i have a piston anywhere

1530
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,000

 

1531
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,830

i do it's up there though take this out

1532
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:53,840
i do it's up there though take this out
 

1533
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,950
i do it's up there though take this out
all right we're going to make a

1534
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:54,960
all right we're going to make a
 

1535
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,590
all right we're going to make a
monostable circuit over here as well

1536
00:33:59,590 --> 00:33:59,600

 

1537
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,110

put it over here i guess

1538
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120

 

1539
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,950

all right that should do it

1540
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:06,960
all right that should do it
 

1541
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,230
all right that should do it
um i might need to change the timing on

1542
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,240
um i might need to change the timing on
 

1543
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,190
um i might need to change the timing on
that repeater to two

1544
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,200

 

1545
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,349

1547
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,349
it's not very uh it's not very friendly

so much better still not
don't know if i'm going to get it right

1560
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:36,720
don't know if i'm going to get it right
 

1561
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,270
don't know if i'm going to get it right
here

1562

1567
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,470

oh oh we got it we got it look at that

1568
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:56,480
oh oh we got it we got it look at that
 

1569
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,390
oh oh we got it we got it look at that
amazing it might not be able to get much

1570
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:00,400
amazing it might not be able to get much
 

1571
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,150
amazing it might not be able to get much
quicker actually

1572
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,160

 

1573
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,589

okay let's try it out now let's see if

1574
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:05,599
okay let's try it out now let's see if
 

1575
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,069
okay let's try it out now let's see if
we accidentally make tall grass

1576
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079
we accidentally make tall grass
 

1577
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,829
we accidentally make tall grass
again yeah i'm still doing it

1578
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:11,839
again yeah i'm still doing it
 

1579
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,710
again yeah i'm still doing it
i think

1580
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:16,720
i think
 

1581
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,950
i think
i think it was i'm i'm not going to hold

1582
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:18,960
i think it was i'm i'm not going to hold
 

1583
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,589
i think it was i'm i'm not going to hold
right click right now to see

1584
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:21,599
right click right now to see
 

1585
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,190
right click right now to see
yeah i'm still making tall grass if i

1586
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,200
yeah i'm still making tall grass if i
 

1587
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,349
yeah i'm still making tall grass if i
hold right click so that is a bit of a

1588
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:25,359
hold right click so that is a bit of a
 

1589
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,750
hold right click so that is a bit of a
flaw

1590
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:29,760

 

1591
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,990

but whatever i got tons of bone meal

1592
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,000

 

1593
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,510

all right let's try out our hopper mine

1594
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:35,520
all right let's try out our hopper mine
 

1595
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,790
all right let's try out our hopper mine
cart you're going to pick this stuff up

1596
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:38,800
cart you're going to pick this stuff up
 

1597
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,069
cart you're going to pick this stuff up
there it goes very cool

1598
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:42,079
there it goes very cool
 

1599
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,829
there it goes very cool
it missed the spot there though

1600
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:45,839
it missed the spot there though
 

1601
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,950
it missed the spot there though
oh got some more on the return trip

1602
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:50,960

 

1603
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,990

cool cool so i'll automate that later

1604
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,000
cool cool so i'll automate that later
 

1605
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,630
cool cool so i'll automate that later
i guess not bad though so i really need

1606
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:58,640
i guess not bad though so i really need
 

1607
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,470
i guess not bad though so i really need
one of these at a flower forest

1608
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:00,480
one of these at a flower forest
 

1609
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,069
one of these at a flower forest
though because i'm only getting the blue

longer to make up for the lack of
 

1625
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,950
longer to make up for the lack of
progress earlier

1626
