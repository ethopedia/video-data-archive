hello my crafters almost episode 12 I

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,250
hello my crafters almost episode 12 I
 

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,860
hello my crafters almost episode 12 I
thought it would be a guide here to

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:06,870
thought it would be a guide here to
 

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,110
thought it would be a guide here to
address some of the questions and

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,120
address some of the questions and
 

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,749
address some of the questions and
suggestions people have left above this

8
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:11,759
suggestions people have left above this

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,930
suggestions people have left above this
mob spawning crap I'm just going to

10
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:17,940
mob spawning crap I'm just going to
 

11
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,920
mob spawning crap I'm just going to
spend a few minutes on that this episode

12
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:20,930
spend a few minutes on that this episode
 

13
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:27,130
spend a few minutes on that this episode
first thing we gotta do is shut it down

14
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:27,140

 

15
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:51,580

if we can

16
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:51,590

 

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:01:07,820

there we go okay yeah so uh stay please

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:07,830
there we go okay yeah so uh stay please
 

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,130
there we go okay yeah so uh stay please
asked why is there a pressure plate in

20
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:10,140
asked why is there a pressure plate in
 

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,960
asked why is there a pressure plate in
your water trap and Lauren jog 45:45

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:14,970
your water trap and Lauren jog 45:45
 

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,690
your water trap and Lauren jog 45:45
says if you took the pressure plate out

24
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:17,700
says if you took the pressure plate out
 

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,420
says if you took the pressure plate out
in your trap they would fall in without

26
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:20,430
in your trap they would fall in without
 

27
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,510
in your trap they would fall in without
having to be pushed and art 96 er says

28
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:26,520
having to be pushed and art 96 er says
 

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,249
having to be pushed and art 96 er says
what happens if you don't use the

30
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:28,259
what happens if you don't use the
 

31
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,730
what happens if you don't use the
pressure plate well that's what we'll

32
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:31,740
pressure plate well that's what we'll
 

33
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,889
pressure plate well that's what we'll
find out first that's what happens it

34
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:36,899
find out first that's what happens it
 

35
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:40,040
find out first that's what happens it
creates a backflow disrupts the water

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,050
creates a backflow disrupts the water
 

37
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,830
creates a backflow disrupts the water
pattern that's why we're using a

38
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:42,840
pattern that's why we're using a
 

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,330
pattern that's why we're using a
pressure plate and then recon jeff says

40
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:49,340
pressure plate and then recon jeff says
 

41
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,370
pressure plate and then recon jeff says
nice design for the zombie trap but why

42
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:52,380
nice design for the zombie trap but why
 

43
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,110
nice design for the zombie trap but why
you use the pressure pad to stop the

44
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,120
you use the pressure pad to stop the
 

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,570
you use the pressure pad to stop the
water why not just make them flow into

46
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:56,580
water why not just make them flow into
 

47
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,370
water why not just make them flow into
the drowning pit

48
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:01,380

 

49
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,980

good question will we're going to try

50
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:03,990
good question will we're going to try
 

51
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:10,430
good question will we're going to try
that out you don't have to eat something

52
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,440
that out you don't have to eat something
 

53
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,150
that out you don't have to eat something
first

54
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,160
first
 

55
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,270
first
I kind of just got this thing working

56
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
I kind of just got this thing working
 

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,630
I kind of just got this thing working
and then didn't try to improve it at all

58
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
and then didn't try to improve it at all
 

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,230
and then didn't try to improve it at all
because it worked well but if there's a

60
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:24,240
because it worked well but if there's a
 

61
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,460
because it worked well but if there's a
better way of doing it we should

62
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:25,470
better way of doing it we should
 

63
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,140
better way of doing it we should
definitely try to find it because I

64
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,150
definitely try to find it because I
 

65
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,780
definitely try to find it because I
don't like building anything inferior

66
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:34,790

 

67
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:51,590

block that off one there so yeah let's

68
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:51,600
block that off one there so yeah let's
 

69
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,410
block that off one there so yeah let's
try get it going again and see how this

70
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:54,420
try get it going again and see how this
 

71
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:05,840
try get it going again and see how this
works out without the pressure plate um

72
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:05,850
works out without the pressure plate um
 

73
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,110
works out without the pressure plate um
I should probably use glass I don't have

74
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
I should probably use glass I don't have
 

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:19,160
I should probably use glass I don't have
glass great hey hey uh there's just no

76
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,170
glass great hey hey uh there's just no
 

77
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,350
glass great hey hey uh there's just no
time yeah one second okay we're back

78
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:24,360
time yeah one second okay we're back
 

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:47,630
time yeah one second okay we're back
here gotta see little fast here

80
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:47,640

 

81
00:03:47,640 --> 00:04:00,270

okay hope I got all my stuff back okay

82
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:00,280
okay hope I got all my stuff back okay
 

83
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,550
okay hope I got all my stuff back okay
so that's another big no-no so the way

84
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:05,560
so that's another big no-no so the way
 

85
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,340
so that's another big no-no so the way
it was working with the pressure plates

86
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:07,350
it was working with the pressure plates
 

87
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,700
it was working with the pressure plates
the a second zombie was pushing them in

88
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:10,710
the a second zombie was pushing them in
 

89
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:17,819
the a second zombie was pushing them in
and so it's like their state then

90
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:17,829
and so it's like their state then
 

91
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:25,950
and so it's like their state then
updates they were stuck oh how do I

92
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:25,960
updates they were stuck oh how do I
 

93
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:35,970
updates they were stuck oh how do I
explain this better since they walked in

94
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:35,980
explain this better since they walked in
 

95
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,820
explain this better since they walked in
here they're gonna try swim hop which is

96
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:38,830
here they're gonna try swim hop which is
 

97
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,100
here they're gonna try swim hop which is
what they're doing but before they were

98
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,110
what they're doing but before they were
 

99
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,400
what they're doing but before they were
stuck the second zombie would push him

100
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,410
stuck the second zombie would push him
 

101
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,980
stuck the second zombie would push him
in and it would and they would just sink

102
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:46,990
in and it would and they would just sink
 

103
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,170
in and it would and they would just sink
down because they were still considered

104
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:49,180
down because they were still considered
 

105
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,960
down because they were still considered
stuck in there in their game states or

106
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:54,970
stuck in there in their game states or
 

107
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:04,650
stuck in there in their game states or
whatever that's my theory so yeah you're

108
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:04,660
whatever that's my theory so yeah you're
 

109
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,820
whatever that's my theory so yeah you're
going to need to use a pressure plate

110
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:05,830
going to need to use a pressure plate
 

111
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:12,839
going to need to use a pressure plate
for a sign

112
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:12,849

 

113
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,709

alright now we gonna shut this down

114
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:14,719
alright now we gonna shut this down
 

115
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:30,309
alright now we gonna shut this down
again sorry if I'm not clear about

116
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:30,319
again sorry if I'm not clear about
 

117
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,529
again sorry if I'm not clear about
things um I have a hard time explaining

118
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:32,539
things um I have a hard time explaining
 

119
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:50,649
things um I have a hard time explaining
things sometimes hey we're gonna try one

120
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:50,659
things sometimes hey we're gonna try one
 

121
00:05:50,659 --> 00:06:02,519
things sometimes hey we're gonna try one
more thing after this run something oh I

122
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:02,529

 

123
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:13,270

hope that's all

124
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280

 

125
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:28,370

okay what else did we want to try going

126
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:28,380
okay what else did we want to try going
 

127
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:36,679
okay what else did we want to try going
to make our infinite pool here again

128
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:36,689

 

129
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:46,279

actually we going to shut this off okay

130
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:46,289

 

131
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:48,390

okay so we're going to set up like it

132
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
okay so we're going to set up like it
 

133
00:06:48,400 --> 00:07:04,439
okay so we're going to set up like it
was before yeah like that we're going to

134
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:04,449
was before yeah like that we're going to
 

135
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,029
was before yeah like that we're going to
place the pressure plate back this is an

136
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:08,039
place the pressure plate back this is an
 

137
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,820
place the pressure plate back this is an
something fires of Hades tried he put up

138
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:14,830
something fires of Hades tried he put up
 

139
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,129
something fires of Hades tried he put up
a water source above this pressure plate

140
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:17,139
a water source above this pressure plate
 

141
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:22,850
a water source above this pressure plate
and somehow he he kept it there and

142
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:22,860
and somehow he he kept it there and
 

143
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,260
and somehow he he kept it there and
that's what we're going to try see if it

144
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,270
that's what we're going to try see if it
 

145
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:34,320
that's what we're going to try see if it
works better we're going to need signs

146
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:34,330
works better we're going to need signs
 

147
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:47,520
works better we're going to need signs
for this cell probably too

148
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,530

 

149
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:53,830

and we're going to place the glass here

150
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
and we're going to place the glass here
 

151
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,370
and we're going to place the glass here
already

152
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:54,380
already
 

153
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:02,200
already
and rebuild the wall okay and we're

154
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,210
and rebuild the wall okay and we're
 

155
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,330
and rebuild the wall okay and we're
going to place a sign here I think I

156
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:04,340
going to place a sign here I think I
 

157
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,770
going to place a sign here I think I
don't know how he did it

158
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:05,780
don't know how he did it
 

159
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,840
don't know how he did it
this is how I'm assuming he did it so we

160
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:10,850
this is how I'm assuming he did it so we
 

161
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,610
this is how I'm assuming he did it so we
got a floating sign I placed it on this

162
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:12,620
got a floating sign I placed it on this
 

163
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,300
got a floating sign I placed it on this
side so now we should be able to place

164
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,310
side so now we should be able to place
 

165
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:21,160
side so now we should be able to place
water in here and it flows and goes down

166
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,170
water in here and it flows and goes down
 

167
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,980
water in here and it flows and goes down
oh yeah

168
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:23,990
oh yeah
 

169
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:32,710
oh yeah
got to seal this - so I think this would

170
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:32,720
got to seal this - so I think this would
 

171
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,490
got to seal this - so I think this would
work better but it is obviously more

172
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:36,500
work better but it is obviously more
 

173
00:08:36,500 --> 00:09:04,440
work better but it is obviously more
complicated to do

174
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:04,450

 

175
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:14,190

and let's see how it works

176
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,200

 

177
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,370

yeah works so by doing it that way you

178
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:18,380
yeah works so by doing it that way you
 

179
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,160
yeah works so by doing it that way you
don't need a second zombie to push him

180
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,170
don't need a second zombie to push him
 

181
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:33,340
don't need a second zombie to push him
in and I forgot a block down there and

182
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,350
in and I forgot a block down there and
 

183
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:42,670
in and I forgot a block down there and
then we died so yeah that works better

184
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:42,680
then we died so yeah that works better
 

185
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,010
then we died so yeah that works better
it's a little bit more complicated and

186
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:45,020
it's a little bit more complicated and
 

187
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,650
it's a little bit more complicated and
you need more more stuff to do it but

188
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:49,660
you need more more stuff to do it but
 

189
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,830
you need more more stuff to do it but
definitely a better way of doing it so

190
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:52,840
definitely a better way of doing it so
 

191
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,270
definitely a better way of doing it so

I fixed it okay talk to something else

202
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:21,950
I fixed it okay talk to something else
 

203
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,550
I fixed it okay talk to something else
now

204
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560

 

205
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,750

alright so the next thing we're going to

206
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:26,760
alright so the next thing we're going to
 

207
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,600
alright so the next thing we're going to
do chip neck 87 asks are you ever going

208
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:32,610
do chip neck 87 asks are you ever going
 

209
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,570
do chip neck 87 asks are you ever going
to go to the nether in this world you

210
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:35,580
to go to the nether in this world you
 

211
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,700
to go to the nether in this world you
have plenty of lava to make obsidian and

212
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:37,710
have plenty of lava to make obsidian and
 

213
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,120
have plenty of lava to make obsidian and
a portal and such dancer your question

214
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,130
a portal and such dancer your question
 

215
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,050
a portal and such dancer your question
yes we will be going to the nether

216
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:44,060
yes we will be going to the nether
 

217
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,790
yes we will be going to the nether
eventually not probably not for at least

218
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
eventually not probably not for at least
 

219
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,910
eventually not probably not for at least
a few more episodes but let's build a

220
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:52,920
a few more episodes but let's build a
 

221
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,780
a few more episodes but let's build a
portal right now anyway

222
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:55,790
portal right now anyway
 

223
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,590
portal right now anyway
and in case you guys didn't know I do

224
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:00,600
and in case you guys didn't know I do
 

225
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,690
and in case you guys didn't know I do
have a diamond pick but if you guys

226
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:02,700
have a diamond pick but if you guys
 

227
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,370
have a diamond pick but if you guys
don't have a diamond pick or if you just

228
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:04,380
don't have a diamond pick or if you just
 

229
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,190
don't have a diamond pick or if you just
want to save some time now what you can

230
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
want to save some time now what you can
 

231
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,960
want to save some time now what you can
do is just place lava and build your

232
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:14,970
do is just place lava and build your
 

233
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,410
do is just place lava and build your
portal that way without having to mine

234
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:18,420
portal that way without having to mine
 

235
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,270
portal that way without having to mine
out the obsidian which takes forever and

236
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:22,280
out the obsidian which takes forever and
 

237
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,830
out the obsidian which takes forever and
all you really need to do is build a

238
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:24,840
all you really need to do is build a
 

239
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:34,810
all you really need to do is build a
mold for the portal

240
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:34,820

 

241
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:41,210

just like that and there's I think you

242
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,220
just like that and there's I think you
 

243
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,040
just like that and there's I think you
would probably do it even simpler if

244
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,050
would probably do it even simpler if
 

245
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,630
would probably do it even simpler if
you're quick you can probably just place

246
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
you're quick you can probably just place
 

247
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,840
you're quick you can probably just place
the lava yeah

248
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:47,850
the lava yeah
 

249
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,890
the lava yeah
and place water above even easier

250
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:50,900
and place water above even easier
 

251
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,270
and place water above even easier
because you don't need a mold if you do

252
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:53,280
because you don't need a mold if you do
 

253
00:11:53,280 --> 00:12:14,450
because you don't need a mold if you do
that just don't die

254
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:14,460

 

255
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,170

so our goal or my goal in the nether is

256
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:19,180
so our goal or my goal in the nether is
 

257
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:24,330
so our goal or my goal in the nether is
to eventually set up a base without

258
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:24,340
to eventually set up a base without
 

259
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,020
to eventually set up a base without
switching to peaceful a lot of people

260
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,030
switching to peaceful a lot of people
 

261
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,660
switching to peaceful a lot of people
build bases in the nether but they they

262
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:30,670
build bases in the nether but they they
 

263
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,130
build bases in the nether but they they
build it and peaceful and then they

264
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:32,140
build it and peaceful and then they
 

265
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,510
build it and peaceful and then they
switch it to hard and their bases are

266
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:36,520
switch it to hard and their bases are
 

267
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,150
switch it to hard and their bases are
pretty cool but I find that kind of lame

268
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
pretty cool but I find that kind of lame
 

269
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,190
pretty cool but I find that kind of lame
you should keep going hard all the time

270
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200

 

271
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,280

and that's just my opinion

272
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,290
and that's just my opinion
 

273
00:12:47,290 --> 00:13:08,170
and that's just my opinion
oh and

274
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:08,180

 

275
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,300

and I'll probably build another portal

276
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,310
and I'll probably build another portal
 

277
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,430
and I'll probably build another portal
in a house if I ever get around to doing

278
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
in a house if I ever get around to doing
 

279
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:21,560
in a house if I ever get around to doing
that still need to build a house and you

280
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:21,570
that still need to build a house and you
 

281
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:29,629
that still need to build a house and you
need iron and Flint build to make fire

282
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:29,639
need iron and Flint build to make fire
 

283
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:39,069
need iron and Flint build to make fire
and then you light it on fire

284
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:39,079
and then you light it on fire
 

285
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:46,249
and then you light it on fire
it's on fire they're all done so I'll

286
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:46,259
it's on fire they're all done so I'll
 

287
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,050
it's on fire they're all done so I'll
probably at least a few episodes before

288
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,060
probably at least a few episodes before
 

289
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,809
probably at least a few episodes before
we do that just I would like to have a

290
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:50,819
we do that just I would like to have a
 

291
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:55,850
we do that just I would like to have a
wheat farm or something first and we

292
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:55,860
wheat farm or something first and we
 

293
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,040
wheat farm or something first and we
will be building wheat farms and factus

294
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,050
will be building wheat farms and factus
 

295
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,980
will be building wheat farms and factus
farms and all that fun stuff

296
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:00,990
farms and all that fun stuff
 

297
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,779
farms and all that fun stuff
eventually okay on to something else
