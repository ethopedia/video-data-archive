nice to have more more options of
 

115
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,229

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,030
as i was cutting this out i found this
lava pool

120
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
lava pool
 

121
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,030
lava pool
which i've been hearing for a while now

122
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
which i've been hearing for a while now
 

123
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,390
which i've been hearing for a while now
but i just didn't realize it was so

124
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
but i just didn't realize it was so
 

125
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,350
but i just didn't realize it was so
close

126
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360

 

127
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,229

so what we'll do

128
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
so what we'll do
 

129
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,509
so what we'll do
we're gonna have like a three we're

130
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
we're gonna have like a three we're
 

131
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,030
we're gonna have like a three we're
gonna make this much like the stairs

132
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
gonna make this much like the stairs
 

133
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,030
gonna make this much like the stairs
here where we'll have the wooden

134
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
here where we'll have the wooden
 

135
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,149
here where we'll have the wooden
half slabs and then the wood blocks and

136
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
half slabs and then the wood blocks and
 

137
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,270
half slabs and then the wood blocks and
the fence on top

138
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
the fence on top
 

139
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,110
the fence on top
so i'll play around with it a bit and

140
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
so i'll play around with it a bit and
 

141
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,190
so i'll play around with it a bit and
see see what we come up with

142
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200

 

143
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,229

and this is what we get so i

144
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
and this is what we get so i
 

145
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,350
and this is what we get so i
used half slabs here

146
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
used half slabs here
 

147
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,670
used half slabs here
the advantage of using half slabs over

148
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
the advantage of using half slabs over
 

149
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,750
the advantage of using half slabs over
stairs is you can actually run up them

150
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
stairs is you can actually run up them
 

151
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,309
stairs is you can actually run up them
without breaking your stride which is

152
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
without breaking your stride which is
 

153
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,470
without breaking your stride which is
always nice

154
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
always nice
 

155
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,830
always nice
but the downside is you get a very long

156
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
but the downside is you get a very long
 

157
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,869
but the downside is you get a very long
staircase twice as long as

158
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
staircase twice as long as
 

159
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,110
staircase twice as long as
if if you use regular stairs so

160
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
if if you use regular stairs so
 

161
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,710
if if you use regular stairs so
do we do it this way or do we use

162
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
do we do it this way or do we use
 

163
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,910
do we do it this way or do we use
regular stairs is the question

164
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
regular stairs is the question
 

165
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,470
regular stairs is the question
um if we look at some of the other ones

166
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
um if we look at some of the other ones
 

167
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,990
um if we look at some of the other ones
i made these are regular

168
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
i made these are regular
 

169
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,110
i made these are regular
or these are half slabs but if we go to

170
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
or these are half slabs but if we go to
 

171
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,589
or these are half slabs but if we go to
this one i used the full stairs

172
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599

 

173
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,509

otherwise it would have been would have

174
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
otherwise it would have been would have
 

175
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,789
otherwise it would have been would have
been huge

176
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
been huge
 

177
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,990
been huge
so with this

178
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
so with this
 

179
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,990
so with this
case i did the stairs because i didn't

180
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
case i did the stairs because i didn't
 

181
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,830
case i did the stairs because i didn't
want it taking away space from other

182
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
want it taking away space from other
 

183
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,310
want it taking away space from other
things

184
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
things
 

185
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,629
things
but with this this one we just made i

186
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
but with this this one we just made i
 

187
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,950
but with this this one we just made i
think the half slabs

188
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
think the half slabs
 

189
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,270
think the half slabs
are pretty good actually because there's

190
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
are pretty good actually because there's
 

191
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,430
are pretty good actually because there's
nothing else we would put there

192
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
nothing else we would put there
 

193
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,710
nothing else we would put there
so i don't think the huge staircase is

194
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
so i don't think the huge staircase is
 

195
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,830
so i don't think the huge staircase is
an issue

196
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
an issue
 

197
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,550
an issue
and it starts at a really nice spot here

198
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
and it starts at a really nice spot here
 

199
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,270
and it starts at a really nice spot here
too

200
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280

 

201
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,830

so we'll do it this way i'm happy with

202
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
so we'll do it this way i'm happy with
 

203
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,469
so we'll do it this way i'm happy with
that

204
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
that
 

205
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,749
that

was sort of one of the guys pushing to

236
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
was sort of one of the guys pushing to
 

237
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,390
was sort of one of the guys pushing to
continue recording if people can't make

238
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
continue recording if people can't make
 

239
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,830
continue recording if people can't make
it

240
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840
it
 

241
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,150
it
to a season because when we were doing

242
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
to a season because when we were doing
 

243
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,310
to a season because when we were doing
the teams we had issues with scheduling

244
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
the teams we had issues with scheduling
 

245
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,550
the teams we had issues with scheduling
it

246
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
it
 

247
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,230
it
we had to kind of postpone it

248
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
we had to kind of postpone it
 

249
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,510
we had to kind of postpone it
for i think a week or two and that's the

250
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
for i think a week or two and that's the
 

251
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,950
for i think a week or two and that's the
problem you have if you have

252
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
problem you have if you have
 

253
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,830
problem you have if you have
a lot of people playing a game it's it's

254
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
a lot of people playing a game it's it's
 

255
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,350
a lot of people playing a game it's it's
just going to keep being postponed

256
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
just going to keep being postponed
 

257
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,230
just going to keep being postponed
because

258
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
because
 

259
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,310
because
not everybody is free at the same time

260
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
not everybody is free at the same time
 

261
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,670
not everybody is free at the same time
so

262
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
so
 

263
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,510
so
to me it makes more sense just to

264
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
to me it makes more sense just to
 

265
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,830
to me it makes more sense just to
have everyone play and if people can

266
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
have everyone play and if people can
 

267
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,350
have everyone play and if people can
make it great

268
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
make it great
 

269
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,150
make it great
and if not hopefully they can make it

270
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
and if not hopefully they can make it
 

271
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,590
and if not hopefully they can make it
next time type thing because

272
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
next time type thing because
 

273
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,070
next time type thing because
doc wasn't able to make it last season

274
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
out of it
 

283
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,270
out of it
uh and

284
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280

a minecarts track over here
 

539
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,949
a minecarts track over here
this is a slime farm the big pad for it

540
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
this is a slime farm the big pad for it
 

541
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,110
this is a slime farm the big pad for it
have like a minecart track that goes

542
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
have like a minecart track that goes
 

543
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,389
have like a minecart track that goes
from here all the way to the end

544
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
from here all the way to the end
 

545
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,509
from here all the way to the end
portal with the silver fish farm and the

546
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
portal with the silver fish farm and the
 

547
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,350
portal with the silver fish farm and the
mob system and all other stuff we plan

548
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
mob system and all other stuff we plan
 

549
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,030
mob system and all other stuff we plan
on doing there

550
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040

 

551
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,310

maybe we'll work on
 

553
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,550
maybe we'll work on
improving this area a bit too

all right we got that done uh you can
 

565
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,269
all right we got that done uh you can
see the grass is a different color here

566
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
see the grass is a different color here
 

567
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,470
see the grass is a different color here
i believe this is a

568
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
i believe this is a
 

569
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,550
i believe this is a
desert biome yeah

570
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560

 

571
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,750

desert biome nice view of the slime farm

572
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
desert biome nice view of the slime farm
 

573
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,150
desert biome nice view of the slime farm
here

574
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160

 

575
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,030

i would like to like have the minecart

576
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
i would like to like have the minecart
 

577
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,430
i would like to like have the minecart
track

578
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
track
 

579
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,710
track
right around like start right here

580
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
right around like start right here
 

581
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,310
right around like start right here
so it's out of the way you know um

582
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
so it's out of the way you know um
 

583
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,430
so it's out of the way you know um
and do the same thing i

584
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
and do the same thing i
 

585
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,910
and do the same thing i
did with the the mine shaft system you

586
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
did with the the mine shaft system you
 

587
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,990
did with the the mine shaft system you
know cut out the

588
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
know cut out the
 

589
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,350
know cut out the
like a five by five area

590
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
like a five by five area
 

591
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,110
like a five by five area
and run a tunnel all the way down i'll

592
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,120
and run a tunnel all the way down i'll
 

593
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,790
and run a tunnel all the way down i'll
probably blast it out with tnt

594
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
probably blast it out with tnt
 

595
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,230
probably blast it out with tnt
uh our z coordinate here is around 200

596
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
uh our z coordinate here is around 200
 

597
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,189
uh our z coordinate here is around 200
we got to go all the way up to 800

598
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
we got to go all the way up to 800
 

599
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,110
we got to go all the way up to 800
to around 800 to run the tunnel to

600
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
to around 800 to run the tunnel to
 

601
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,150
to around 800 to run the tunnel to
the other area there i think that'd be

602
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
the other area there i think that'd be
 

603
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,949
the other area there i think that'd be
cool to do

604
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
cool to do
 

605
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,790
cool to do
i'll try and do that today

606
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
i'll try and do that today
 

607
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,550
i'll try and do that today
if i if i can manage to do it in time

608
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
if i if i can manage to do it in time
 

609
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,829
if i if i can manage to do it in time
um oh

610
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
um oh
 

611
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,590
um oh
and if i have enough tv t i'm not sure

612
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600
and if i have enough tv t i'm not sure
 

613
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,150
and if i have enough tv t i'm not sure
how much i have at the moment

614
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
how much i have at the moment
 

615
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,949
how much i have at the moment
but i'll i'll tunnel there and i'll rig

616
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
but i'll i'll tunnel there and i'll rig
 

617
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:07,590
but i'll i'll tunnel there and i'll rig
it with

618
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
it with
 

619
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,829
it with
the charges if i can and we

620
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
the charges if i can and we
 

621
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,350
the charges if i can and we
will hopefully get to see an explosion

622
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
will hopefully get to see an explosion
 

623
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,110
will hopefully get to see an explosion
today

624
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,120
today
 

625
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,350
today
uh and also we'll maybe we'll go check

626
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
uh and also we'll maybe we'll go check
 

627
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,269
uh and also we'll maybe we'll go check
out the the mine shaft project because i

628
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279
out the the mine shaft project because i
 

629
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,949
out the the mine shaft project because i
have been working on that

630
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
have been working on that
 

631
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,030
have been working on that
uh continually i just haven't shown it

632
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
uh continually i just haven't shown it
 

633
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,710
uh continually i just haven't shown it
in a long time so

634
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720
in a long time so
 

635
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,430
in a long time so
that could be fun too

636
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:29,440

 

637
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,150

okay guys so i have uh ran some more

638
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
okay guys so i have uh ran some more
 

639
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,750
okay guys so i have uh ran some more
grass here

640
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760
grass here
 

641
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,470
grass here
on this side i don't know if i'll keep

642
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
on this side i don't know if i'll keep
 

643
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,910
on this side i don't know if i'll keep
this or not

644
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
this or not
 

645
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,310
this or not
um i felt like i needed it like it

646
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
um i felt like i needed it like it
 

647
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,509
um i felt like i needed it like it
bounced out the look somehow uh if if i

648
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
bounced out the look somehow uh if if i
 

649
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:45,829
bounced out the look somehow uh if if i
do

650
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
do
 

651
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,550
do
keep it i plan on replacing this with

652
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
keep it i plan on replacing this with
 

653
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,750
keep it i plan on replacing this with
glass as well

654
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
glass as well
 

655
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,870
glass as well
so it'll be much like this side uh

656
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880

 

657
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,629

desert forest desert forest desert

658
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
desert forest desert forest desert
 

659
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,870
desert forest desert forest desert
forest uh

660
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
forest uh
 

661
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,030
forest uh
so pretty much all this way it's gonna

662
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
so pretty much all this way it's gonna
 

663
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,269
so pretty much all this way it's gonna
be desert grass

664
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279
be desert grass
 

665
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,750
be desert grass
i got it rigged to blow here that took a

666
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:09,760
i got it rigged to blow here that took a
 

667
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,110
i got it rigged to blow here that took a
while actually

668
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120
while actually
 

669
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,910
while actually
and i used up all my tnt only made it

670
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
and i used up all my tnt only made it
 

671
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,389
and i used up all my tnt only made it
about

672
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
about
 

673
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,990
about
halfway but we should get a pretty good

674
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
halfway but we should get a pretty good
 

675
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,509
halfway but we should get a pretty good
show here

676
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
show here
 

677
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,030
show here
won't be able to get much done today

678
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
won't be able to get much done today
 

679
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,030
won't be able to get much done today
though we actually

680
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
though we actually
 

681
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,310
though we actually
have to go to i wrote this down

682
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
have to go to i wrote this down
 

683
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,350
have to go to i wrote this down
