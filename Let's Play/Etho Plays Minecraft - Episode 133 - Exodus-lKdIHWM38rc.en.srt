these spider stairs of course you build
 

443
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,900
these spider stairs of course you build
the stairs first then you put up your

00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:47,910
the stairs first then you put up your
 

445
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,600
the stairs first then you put up your
walls put up the signs to hold the water

446

walls put up the signs to hold the water
 

447
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,930

in place then you put the water down and
 

449
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,050
in place then you put the water down and
you fill in any remaining blocks you

450

was really lowering the rates of the
 

467
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,569
was really lowering the rates of the
spiders and I got that fixed up so it's

468
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:44,579
spiders and I got that fixed up so it's
 

469
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,180
