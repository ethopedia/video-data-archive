although the work on a tool so you can
 

53
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,070
although the work on a tool so you can
start fresh with it is a pretty cool but

now recently I've been doing some
 

57
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,100
now recently I've been doing some
testing with it a bit more and it's like

58
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,110
testing with it a bit more and it's like
 

59
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,249
testing with it a bit more and it's like
oh oh this thing might actually have

60
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:16,259
oh oh this thing might actually have
 

61
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,550
oh oh this thing might actually have
some crazy potential so one of the

62
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:19,560
some crazy potential so one of the
 

63
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,130
some crazy potential so one of the
biggest things is I think it's the

64
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,140
biggest things is I think it's the
 

65
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,480
biggest things is I think it's the
ultimate way of storing portable

66

00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:33,990
chakra box you got a grindstone and you
 

75
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,380

have a crazy enchanted book so you can
combine a bunch of enchantments onto a

78
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,100
combine a bunch of enchantments onto a
 

79
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,230
combine a bunch of enchantments onto a
book I think this one has 15 on it put

book I think this one has 15 on it put
down your your grindstone and disenchant

82
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:44,820
down your your grindstone and disenchant
 

83
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,569
down your your grindstone and disenchant
it and you get the experience from all

84
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:47,579
it and you get the experience from all
 

85
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,429
it and you get the experience from all
of those and normally like that you

86
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
of those and normally like that you
 

87
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,139
of those and normally like that you
disenchant something it does it gives

88
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:51,149
disenchant something it does it gives
 

89
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,370
disenchant something it does it gives
you a little bit of experience but it's

90
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:52,380
you a little bit of experience but it's
 

91
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,840
you a little bit of experience but it's
not anything crazy but when you've

92
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:53,850
not anything crazy but when you've
 

93
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,660
not anything crazy but when you've
combined like 15 different things it

94
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:56,670
combined like 15 different things it
 

95
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,810
combined like 15 different things it
starts to add up I think I was seeing it

96
00:01:59,810 --> 00:01:59,820
starts to add up I think I was seeing it
 

97
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,929
starts to add up I think I was seeing it
giving like about 300 experience at

98
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:02,939
giving like about 300 experience at
 

99
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,880
giving like about 300 experience at
times even let's test it out here though

100
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:04,890
times even let's test it out here though
 

101
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,440
times even let's test it out here though
so I'm still like in the testing phase

102
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:06,450
so I'm still like in the testing phase
 

103
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,910
so I'm still like in the testing phase
trying to figure out if it's actually

104
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
trying to figure out if it's actually
 

105
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,490
trying to figure out if it's actually
good or not this pitch has 33 durability

106
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:10,500
good or not this pitch has 33 durability
 

107
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,619
good or not this pitch has 33 durability
at the moment it has mending on it put

108
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:12,629
at the moment it has mending on it put
 

109
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,670
at the moment it has mending on it put
this in

110
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
this in
 

111
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,100
this in
disenchant now here's the biggest thing

112
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,110
disenchant now here's the biggest thing
 

113
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,990
disenchant now here's the biggest thing
about it as well it's dense experience

114
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
about it as well it's dense experience
 

115
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,720
about it as well it's dense experience
so normally experienced so you only get

116
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:20,730
so normally experienced so you only get
 

117
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,009
so normally experienced so you only get
a little bit at a time but when you

118
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:22,019
a little bit at a time but when you
 

119
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:26,929
a little bit at a time but when you
absorb this we got our pick up to 611

120
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:26,939
absorb this we got our pick up to 611
 

121
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,250
absorb this we got our pick up to 611
there uh-huh

122
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,260
there uh-huh
 

123
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,089
there uh-huh
so I thought that was kind of

124
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:29,099
so I thought that was kind of
 

125
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,429
so I thought that was kind of
interesting it's like fast easy portable

126
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:31,439
interesting it's like fast easy portable
 

127
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,140
interesting it's like fast easy portable
experience as long as you have those

128
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,150
experience as long as you have those
 

129
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,050
experience as long as you have those
crazy enchanted books but that's where

130
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,060
crazy enchanted books but that's where
 

131
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,420
crazy enchanted books but that's where
the idea probably falls apart because

132
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,430
the idea probably falls apart because
 

133
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,309
the idea probably falls apart because
how do you get those crazy enchanted

134
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
how do you get those crazy enchanted
 

135
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,259
how do you get those crazy enchanted
books I think the ideal way of doing it

136
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:42,269
books I think the ideal way of doing it
 

137
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:43,970
books I think the ideal way of doing it
would be to set up a villager trading

138
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:43,980
would be to set up a villager trading
 

139
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,369
would be to set up a villager trading
hall get their trades down to one

140
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:46,379
hall get their trades down to one
 

141
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,220
hall get their trades down to one
emerald each and then have like 12 to 16

142
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,230
emerald each and then have like 12 to 16
 

143
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,619
emerald each and then have like 12 to 16
different enchantments you could buy

144
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:51,629
different enchantments you could buy
 

145
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,539
different enchantments you could buy
from them and then you have to combine

146
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:53,549
from them and then you have to combine
 

147
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,250
from them and then you have to combine
them together on an anvil to make it

148
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:55,260
them together on an anvil to make it
 

149
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,129
them together on an anvil to make it
super dense crazy book when you consider

150
00:02:58,129 --> 00:02:58,139
super dense crazy book when you consider
 

151
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:59,509
super dense crazy book when you consider
everything though it's probably not

152
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
everything though it's probably not
 

153
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,250
everything though it's probably not
worth the time it would take to create

154
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:01,260
worth the time it would take to create
 

155
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,860
worth the time it would take to create
the books for it at best it might

156
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:03,870
the books for it at best it might
 

157
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,780
the books for it at best it might
function as an emergency repair kit like

158
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:05,790
function as an emergency repair kit like
 

159
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,280
function as an emergency repair kit like
if you're far away from an experienced

160
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,290
if you're far away from an experienced
 

161
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,780
if you're far away from an experienced
farm it could be an easy way of

162
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:08,790
farm it could be an easy way of
 

163
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,399

to his barrel workstation and a bed that
allows them to refill his trade when it

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:16,980
allows them to refill his trade when it
 

249
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,460
allows them to refill his trade when it
gets exhausted and it gets cheaper the

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:19,470
gets exhausted and it gets cheaper the
 

251
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,960

00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:39,870
and then we have an item filter
 

267
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,240

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,080
next project okay so we spend a lot of
time in this area we got our tree farm

280
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,090
time in this area we got our tree farm
 

281
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,879
time in this area we got our tree farm
over there I use that thing all the time

282
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:03,889
over there I use that thing all the time
 

283
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:05,350
over there I use that thing all the time
now

we got the Nexus we got the super

286
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:07,220
we got the Nexus we got the super

haven't built there's some other random

290
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:11,419
haven't built there's some other random
 

291
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:13,090
haven't built there's some other random
stuff over here so this is like a pretty

292
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:13,100
stuff over here so this is like a pretty
 

293
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,000
stuff over here so this is like a pretty
key area in our world and right next to

294
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,010
key area in our world and right next to
 

295
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,330
key area in our world and right next to
it is our Guardian farm which I feel

296
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:19,340
it is our Guardian farm which I feel
 

297
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,879
it is our Guardian farm which I feel
I've kind of realized I'm underutilizing

298
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:21,889
I've kind of realized I'm underutilizing
 

299
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:25,990
I've kind of realized I'm underutilizing
at the moment like it's so close to our

300
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
at the moment like it's so close to our
 

301
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,379
at the moment like it's so close to our
main area the way I set this up is

302
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:29,389
main area the way I set this up is
 

303
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,020
main area the way I set this up is
actually pretty crummy now that I look

304
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,030
actually pretty crummy now that I look
 

305
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,719
actually pretty crummy now that I look
at it so we got an auto sorting system

306
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:34,729
at it so we got an auto sorting system
 

307
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,480
at it so we got an auto sorting system
for it and stuff which is cool that's

308
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,490
for it and stuff which is cool that's
 

309
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,270
for it and stuff which is cool that's
all kind of taken care of it's an old

310
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,280
all kind of taken care of it's an old
 

311
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,950
all kind of taken care of it's an old
system though you can hear the drop or

elevator activating which is annoying we

314
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:45,740
elevator activating which is annoying we
 

315
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,040
elevator activating which is annoying we
can up upgrade that with a bubble stream

316
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,050
can up upgrade that with a bubble stream
 

317
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,050
can up upgrade that with a bubble stream
the big issue with this farm though is

318
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,060
the big issue with this farm though is
 

319
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,940
the big issue with this farm though is
there's no way to manually kill the

320
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:51,950
there's no way to manually kill the
 

321
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,710
there's no way to manually kill the
guardians they just fall down here and

322
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:53,720
guardians they just fall down here and
 

323
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,270
guardians they just fall down here and
die on top of the hoppers so it's a

324
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
die on top of the hoppers so it's a
 

325
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,360
die on top of the hoppers so it's a
passive only farm we want to add in a

326
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,370
passive only farm we want to add in a
 

327
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,670
passive only farm we want to add in a
switch here so that we can choose if we

328
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:00,680
switch here so that we can choose if we
 

329
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,070
switch here so that we can choose if we
want to kill them or not because

330
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,080
want to kill them or not because
 

331
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,240
want to kill them or not because
Guardians actually give a lot of

332
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,250
Guardians actually give a lot of
 

333
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,250
Guardians actually give a lot of
experience they give 10 points each

334
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:06,260
experience they give 10 points each
 

335
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,890
experience they give 10 points each
while most hostile mobs only give you 5

336
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:08,900
while most hostile mobs only give you 5
 

337
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,960
while most hostile mobs only give you 5
except for like blazes they also give

338
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:10,970
except for like blazes they also give
 

339
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,020
except for like blazes they also give
you 10 so this would make a great

340
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,030
you 10 so this would make a great
 

341
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,360
you 10 so this would make a great
experience farm if we set it up properly

342
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,370
experience farm if we set it up properly
 

343
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,200
experience farm if we set it up properly
I think we couldn't even switch out this

344
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,210
I think we couldn't even switch out this
 

345
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,830
I think we couldn't even switch out this
with this new warp planks maybe but I

346
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
with this new warp planks maybe but I
 

347
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,110
with this new warp planks maybe but I
think what we'll do is let's try it here

348
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,120
think what we'll do is let's try it here
 

349
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,010
think what we'll do is let's try it here
probably you just put some hoppers

350
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:30,020
probably you just put some hoppers
 

351
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,200
probably you just put some hoppers
underneath this quartz this way they

352
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,210
underneath this quartz this way they
 

353
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,310
underneath this quartz this way they
don't fall us far oh I don't know how

354
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:36,320
don't fall us far oh I don't know how
 

355
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,469
don't fall us far oh I don't know how
much help they're gonna have I need to

356
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
much help they're gonna have I need to
 

357
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,850
much help they're gonna have I need to
be able to one-shot them with a sword

358
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:39,860
be able to one-shot them with a sword
 

359
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,709
be able to one-shot them with a sword
though

360
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:42,719

 

361
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:48,350

oh really huh well that I did not expect

362
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,360
oh really huh well that I did not expect
 

363
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,329
oh really huh well that I did not expect
maybe we do planks here as well also I

364
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:53,339
maybe we do planks here as well also I
 

365
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,339
maybe we do planks here as well also I
built this a long time ago and it looks

366
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:55,349
built this a long time ago and it looks
 

367
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,229
built this a long time ago and it looks
like it has a few issues now with the

368
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:57,239
like it has a few issues now with the
 

369
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:59,539
like it has a few issues now with the
pathfinding so they fall in the lava and

370
00:07:59,539 --> 00:07:59,549
pathfinding so they fall in the lava and
 

371
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:02,419
pathfinding so they fall in the lava and
they try to get out well before they

372
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:02,429
they try to get out well before they
 

373
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:04,699
they try to get out well before they
would just fall right through and as a

374
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:04,709
would just fall right through and as a
 

375
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,559
would just fall right through and as a
result a lot of them are just dying in

376
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:06,569
result a lot of them are just dying in
 

377
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,479
result a lot of them are just dying in
the lava and it's killing our rates like

378
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:08,489
the lava and it's killing our rates like
 

379
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:12,769
the lava and it's killing our rates like
crazy in the lava

380
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:12,779
crazy in the lava
 

381
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:14,859
crazy in the lava
I think the lava needs to go bye-bye

382
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:14,869
I think the lava needs to go bye-bye
 

383
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,149
I think the lava needs to go bye-bye
yeah it definitely helped a lot

384
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:17,159
yeah it definitely helped a lot
 

385
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:19,339
yeah it definitely helped a lot
I made a new sword here as well that has

386
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:19,349
I made a new sword here as well that has
 

387
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,529
I made a new sword here as well that has
sweeping edge three on because the other

388
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:21,539
sweeping edge three on because the other
 

389
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,419
sweeping edge three on because the other
one I was using didn't have it now we

390
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:23,429
one I was using didn't have it now we
 

391
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:25,699
one I was using didn't have it now we
can test this out properly I'm

392
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:25,709
can test this out properly I'm
 

393
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:28,509
can test this out properly I'm
experimenting with a killing chamber

394
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:28,519
experimenting with a killing chamber
 

395
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,769
experimenting with a killing chamber
idea like maybe we'd do something like

396
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:30,779
idea like maybe we'd do something like
 

397
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,619
idea like maybe we'd do something like
that where we have the trap door above

398
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:32,629
that where we have the trap door above
 

399
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:36,769
that where we have the trap door above
that way it holds us in place so one

400
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:36,779
that way it holds us in place so one
 

401
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,869
that way it holds us in place so one
swing there seems to have killed wait a

402
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:38,879
swing there seems to have killed wait a
 

403
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:46,220
swing there seems to have killed wait a
few yeah sweeping edge definitely helps

404
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:46,230
few yeah sweeping edge definitely helps
 

405
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,639
few yeah sweeping edge definitely helps
a lot I think they're all gone pretty

406
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:49,649
a lot I think they're all gone pretty
 

407
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:52,160
a lot I think they're all gone pretty
much pretty much can you see they're

408
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,170
much pretty much can you see they're
 

409
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,780
much pretty much can you see they're
coming in a much faster now than they

410
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:53,790
coming in a much faster now than they
 

411
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,600
coming in a much faster now than they
were before

412
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:55,610
were before
 

413
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:15,540
were before
whoops this isn't gonna work

414
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:15,550

 

415
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:39,090

Master Oh I'm messed up so bad guys oh

416
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,100
Master Oh I'm messed up so bad guys oh
 

417
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,670
Master Oh I'm messed up so bad guys oh
they're still getting in oh man that was

418
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
they're still getting in oh man that was
 

419
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,690
they're still getting in oh man that was
scary i disrespected the Guardians there

420
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:49,700
scary i disrespected the Guardians there
 

421
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,250
scary i disrespected the Guardians there
I tried modifying the farm without

422
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:51,260
I tried modifying the farm without
 

423
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,500
I tried modifying the farm without
shutting it off properly and they

424
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:53,510
shutting it off properly and they
 

425
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,330
shutting it off properly and they
started to get free and I couldn't close

426
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:55,340
started to get free and I couldn't close
 

427
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,840
started to get free and I couldn't close
it up and then yeah I died like three

428
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,850
it up and then yeah I died like three
 

429
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,160
it up and then yeah I died like three
times in a row they're trying to get my

430
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,170
times in a row they're trying to get my
 

431
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,710
times in a row they're trying to get my
stuff back thankfully I didn't lose

432
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
stuff back thankfully I didn't lose
 

433
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,240
stuff back thankfully I didn't lose
anything

434
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,250
anything
 

435
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,430
anything
shut it off properly this time and this

436
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:06,440
shut it off properly this time and this
 

437
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,490
shut it off properly this time and this
is how I modified it so the idea is we

438
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:09,500
is how I modified it so the idea is we
 

439
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,560
is how I modified it so the idea is we
stand here they don't seem to be able to

440
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:11,570
stand here they don't seem to be able to
 

441
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,900
stand here they don't seem to be able to
shoot through this area and we can get

442
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:13,910
shoot through this area and we can get
 

443
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,270
shoot through this area and we can get
in and out of this nice and easy do I

444
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:16,280
in and out of this nice and easy do I
 

445
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,990
in and out of this nice and easy do I
like that we gotta add some hoppers

446
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
like that we gotta add some hoppers
 

447
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,680
like that we gotta add some hoppers
under the courts here yeah so check this

448
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:23,690
under the courts here yeah so check this
 

449
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,180
under the courts here yeah so check this
out I think we're gonna rip out this big

450
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,190
out I think we're gonna rip out this big
 

451
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,520
out I think we're gonna rip out this big
hopper chain we have here it leads to an

452
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:27,530
hopper chain we have here it leads to an
 

453
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,100
hopper chain we have here it leads to an
item elevator which we're also gonna rip

454
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,110
item elevator which we're also gonna rip
 

455
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,480
item elevator which we're also gonna rip
out and all the Redstone for it over

456
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:31,490
out and all the Redstone for it over
 

457
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,390
out and all the Redstone for it over
here place that with a bubble stream and

458
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:34,400
here place that with a bubble stream and
 

459
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,150
here place that with a bubble stream and
then that goes to a big chain of hoppers

460
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,160
then that goes to a big chain of hoppers
 

461
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,430
then that goes to a big chain of hoppers
that runs over some item filters we'll

462
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
that runs over some item filters we'll
 

463
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,050
that runs over some item filters we'll
leave the item filters but we'll get rid

464
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:41,060
leave the item filters but we'll get rid
 

465
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,660
leave the item filters but we'll get rid
of this top chain of poppers and replace

466
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:43,670
of this top chain of poppers and replace
 

467
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:53,020
of this top chain of poppers and replace
that with a water stream as well those

468
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,030
that with a water stream as well those
 

469
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,250
that with a water stream as well those
are gonna have to go to a dropper and

470
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:54,260
are gonna have to go to a dropper and
 

471
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,660
are gonna have to go to a dropper and
then the dropper is gonna have to shoot

472
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:55,670
then the dropper is gonna have to shoot
 

473
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,030
then the dropper is gonna have to shoot
the items into a water stream and we're

474
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,040
the items into a water stream and we're
 

475
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
the items into a water stream and we're
gonna hear that constant ticking sound I

476
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,050
gonna hear that constant ticking sound I
 

477
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,280
gonna hear that constant ticking sound I
was trying to avoid so I just have

478
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,290
was trying to avoid so I just have
 

479
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,230
was trying to avoid so I just have
another idea maybe we get rid of the

480
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
another idea maybe we get rid of the
 

481
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,810
another idea maybe we get rid of the
quartz here get rid of the hoppers all

482
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:10,820
quartz here get rid of the hoppers all
 

483
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,170
quartz here get rid of the hoppers all
together and we try set it up so that

484
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:14,180
together and we try set it up so that
 

485
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,840
together and we try set it up so that
trap door is open upward

486
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:16,850
trap door is open upward
 

487
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:22,809
trap door is open upward
and then any items on top of that oh do

488
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:22,819
and then any items on top of that oh do
 

489
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:26,650
and then any items on top of that oh do
they not fall through oh never mind

490
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:26,660
they not fall through oh never mind
 

491
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,749
they not fall through oh never mind
that's not gonna work oh fence gates

492
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:28,759
that's not gonna work oh fence gates
 

493
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,120
that's not gonna work oh fence gates
guys the perfect solution here so these

494
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,130
guys the perfect solution here so these
 

495
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,319
guys the perfect solution here so these
are great because they're a block and a

496
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:32,329
are great because they're a block and a
 

497
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:35,559
are great because they're a block and a
half tall it was gonna be very difficult

498
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:35,569
half tall it was gonna be very difficult
 

499
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,360
half tall it was gonna be very difficult
to power anything at this level but if

500
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,370
to power anything at this level but if
 

501
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,069
to power anything at this level but if
we can go down a block with the fence

502
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:39,079
we can go down a block with the fence
 

503
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,780
we can go down a block with the fence
gates that makes it a lot easier to do

504
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:40,790
gates that makes it a lot easier to do
 

505
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,569
gates that makes it a lot easier to do
the redstone and these have an a nice

506
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:43,579
the redstone and these have an a nice
 

507
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,639
the redstone and these have an a nice
additional effect that stuff can fall

508
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:45,649
additional effect that stuff can fall
 

509
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:48,460
additional effect that stuff can fall
through between them so as the guardians

510
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:48,470
through between them so as the guardians
 

511
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,350
through between them so as the guardians
diet most the drops are gonna fall down

512
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:50,360
diet most the drops are gonna fall down
 

513
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,930
diet most the drops are gonna fall down
below and go into the hoppers and then

514
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:52,940
below and go into the hoppers and then
 

515
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,170
below and go into the hoppers and then
after a while we'll just want to open

516
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:56,180
after a while we'll just want to open
 

517
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,449
after a while we'll just want to open
them to drop anything that lands on top

518
00:11:58,449 --> 00:11:58,459
them to drop anything that lands on top
 

519
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:00,550
them to drop anything that lands on top
of them okay so this killing chamber is

520
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
of them okay so this killing chamber is
 

521
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,100
of them okay so this killing chamber is
actually getting kind of complicated

522
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,110
actually getting kind of complicated
 

523
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,420
actually getting kind of complicated
there's a lot of problems we gotta solve

524
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:04,430
there's a lot of problems we gotta solve
 

525
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,639
there's a lot of problems we gotta solve
with doing this so the good news is they

526
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:06,649
with doing this so the good news is they
 

527
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:07,900
with doing this so the good news is they
don't seem to be falling between the

528
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:07,910
don't seem to be falling between the
 

529
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,389
don't seem to be falling between the
fence gates the guardians are big big

530
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
fence gates the guardians are big big
 

531
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,889
fence gates the guardians are big big
enough that they don't fall down and we

532
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:11,899
enough that they don't fall down and we
 

533
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,400
enough that they don't fall down and we
don't want them to the next issue I kind

534
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,410
don't want them to the next issue I kind
 

535
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,160
don't want them to the next issue I kind
of found out is some of the experience

536
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,170
of found out is some of the experience
 

537
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,689
of found out is some of the experience
will fall down through the fence gates

538
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:19,699
will fall down through the fence gates
 

539
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:22,030
will fall down through the fence gates
as we're killing them which isn't good

540
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,040
as we're killing them which isn't good
 

541
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,740
as we're killing them which isn't good
so we have to like create a way of

542
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,750
so we have to like create a way of
 

543
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,139
so we have to like create a way of
getting the experience that falls down

544
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:26,149
getting the experience that falls down
 

545
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:31,990
getting the experience that falls down
back up to us also got a our water

546
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
back up to us also got a our water
 

547
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,590
back up to us also got a our water
elevator hair that should be good I

548
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
elevator hair that should be good I
 

549
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,460
elevator hair that should be good I
think

550
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,470
think
 

551
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,059
think
you got this whole sand down below there

552
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:39,069
you got this whole sand down below there
 

553
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:43,990
you got this whole sand down below there
let's go back up here so what I did like

554
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
let's go back up here so what I did like
 

555
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,980
let's go back up here so what I did like
as we kill the guys here this double

556
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:47,990
as we kill the guys here this double
 

557
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,530
as we kill the guys here this double
check it actually works so we get most

558
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:50,540
check it actually works so we get most
 

559
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,269
check it actually works so we get most
of the experience most of it comes to us

560
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:52,279
of the experience most of it comes to us
 

561
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,249
of the experience most of it comes to us
but some of it is gonna fall down there

562
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:56,259
but some of it is gonna fall down there
 

563
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:58,720
but some of it is gonna fall down there
so what I ended up doing is putting a

564
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:58,730
so what I ended up doing is putting a
 

565
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,150
so what I ended up doing is putting a
iron trap door here because experienced

566
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,160
iron trap door here because experienced
 

567
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,460
iron trap door here because experienced
and pass through that if it goes

568
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:03,470
and pass through that if it goes
 

569
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,629
and pass through that if it goes
underneath us and then we got a little

570
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:07,639
underneath us and then we got a little
 

571
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,059
underneath us and then we got a little
chamber here a little hole that the

572
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:10,069
chamber here a little hole that the
 

573
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,550
chamber here a little hole that the
experience can travel through into here

574
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
experience can travel through into here
 

575
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,829
experience can travel through into here
and then up to the iron trap door here

576
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:14,839
and then up to the iron trap door here
 

577
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:16,360
and then up to the iron trap door here
excellent so check that out I got the

578
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,370
excellent so check that out I got the
 

579
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,949
excellent so check that out I got the
redstone installed through this thing

580
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:17,959
redstone installed through this thing
 

581
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:21,429
redstone installed through this thing
now so we go in here we make our kills

582
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:21,439
now so we go in here we make our kills
 

583
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:24,850
now so we go in here we make our kills
they drop their stuff some of its gonna

584
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:24,860
they drop their stuff some of its gonna
 

585
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,799
they drop their stuff some of its gonna
land on top of the fence gates you can

586
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:26,809
land on top of the fence gates you can
 

587
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:28,620
land on top of the fence gates you can
see it floating around out there

588
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:28,630
see it floating around out there
 

589
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,590
see it floating around out there
so then when we back up we step on a

590
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
so then when we back up we step on a
 

591
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,440
so then when we back up we step on a
pressure plate and that opens the fence

592
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,450
pressure plate and that opens the fence
 

593
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,330
pressure plate and that opens the fence
gates for a split second all the drops

594
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:36,340
gates for a split second all the drops
 

595
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,480
gates for a split second all the drops
on top fall down into the water stream

596
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:38,490
on top fall down into the water stream
 

597
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,940
on top fall down into the water stream
and occasionally I have noticed a couple

598
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:41,950
and occasionally I have noticed a couple
 

599
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,530
and occasionally I have noticed a couple
Guardians will fall through as well it

600
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:43,540
Guardians will fall through as well it
 

601
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,150
Guardians will fall through as well it
doesn't happen usually because they're

602
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,160
doesn't happen usually because they're
 

603
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,060
doesn't happen usually because they're
always jumping around and it's only if

604
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,070
always jumping around and it's only if
 

605
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,420
always jumping around and it's only if
they get unlucky they'll go through if

606
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:51,430
they get unlucky they'll go through if
 

607
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,920
they get unlucky they'll go through if
they do go through though we have a

608
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:52,930
they do go through though we have a
 

609
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,050
they do go through though we have a
killing thing at the end here for them

610
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:55,060
killing thing at the end here for them
 

611
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,190
killing thing at the end here for them
but items come up the water go over top

612
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,200
but items come up the water go over top
 

613
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,260
but items come up the water go over top
all the item filters and then any

guardians that get through end up

616
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,120
guardians that get through end up
 

617
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,330
guardians that get through end up
hitting these magma blocks and dying and

618
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:06,340
hitting these magma blocks and dying and
 

619
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,280
hitting these magma blocks and dying and
the way we did the redstone here isn't

620
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,290
the way we did the redstone here isn't
 

621
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,610
the way we did the redstone here isn't
quite ideal but it works like we're not

622
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:11,620
quite ideal but it works like we're not
 

623
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,080
quite ideal but it works like we're not
designing this thing from scratch I

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,090
designing this thing from scratch I
 

625
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,280
designing this thing from scratch I
gotta make it work with what we had

626
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,290
gotta make it work with what we had
 

627
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,400
gotta make it work with what we had
there so we you see the fence gates over

00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,190
to the fence gate control here oh you
 

707
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,819
to the fence gate control here oh you
heard it so that just released a bunch

708

heard it so that just released a bunch
 

709
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:05,900
heard it so that just released a bunch
of the items and that'll prevent stuff

710
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:05,910
of the items and that'll prevent stuff
 

711
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,870

we're in automatic mode though when we

714
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:10,620
we're in automatic mode though when we
 

715
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,069
we're in automatic mode though when we
switch over to manual killing mode the

716
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:13,079
switch over to manual killing mode the
 

717
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,889
switch over to manual killing mode the
hopper clock doesn't run and we have a

718
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:15,899
hopper clock doesn't run and we have a
 

719
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,019
hopper clock doesn't run and we have a
switch for that over here now so right

720
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:18,029
switch for that over here now so right
 

721
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:20,389
switch for that over here now so right
now it's an auto we switch to manual

722
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:20,399
now it's an auto we switch to manual
 

723
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,150

remaining guys on fire should burn up
 

729
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:31,250
remaining guys on fire should burn up
here and then we're gonna start getting

730
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:31,260
here and then we're gonna start getting
 

731
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,340
here and then we're gonna start getting
the other guys accumulated also I've

732

the other guys accumulated also I've
 

733
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,220
the other guys accumulated also I've
added another switch here for the nether

734
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,230
added another switch here for the nether
 

735
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,230
added another switch here for the nether
that that'll turn the portal on and stop

736
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,240
that that'll turn the portal on and stop
 

737
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,840
that that'll turn the portal on and stop
them from coming down here if we switch

738
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:41,850
them from coming down here if we switch
 

739
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,670
them from coming down here if we switch
that oh yeah now you can see they're

740
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
that oh yeah now you can see they're
 

741
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,019
that oh yeah now you can see they're
starting to build up oh when you go back

742
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:48,029
starting to build up oh when you go back
 

743
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:50,480
starting to build up oh when you go back
to killing the manually here and then

744
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:50,490
to killing the manually here and then
 

745
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,670
to killing the manually here and then
when we step on the pressure plate

746
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
when we step on the pressure plate
 

747
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,949
when we step on the pressure plate
that'll drop anything on the fence deeds

748
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
that'll drop anything on the fence deeds
 

749
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,050

down below as well my favorite thing

750
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,060
down below as well my favorite thing
 

751
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,730
down below as well my favorite thing
about this though is we got it to work

752
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:58,740
about this though is we got it to work
 

753
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,769
about this though is we got it to work
without any annoying dropper sounds

754
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:00,779
without any annoying dropper sounds
 

755
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,600
without any annoying dropper sounds
which is incredible that was kind of

756
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:02,610
which is incredible that was kind of
 

757
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,140
which is incredible that was kind of
hard to do but we made it work this is

758
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,150
hard to do but we made it work this is
 

759
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,329
hard to do but we made it work this is
only part of the plan though we've spent

760
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:08,339
only part of the plan though we've spent
 

761
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,860
only part of the plan though we've spent
a bit of time on this today longer than

762
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:09,870
a bit of time on this today longer than
 

763
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,380
a bit of time on this today longer than
I expected but the other thing I want to

764
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:12,390
I expected but the other thing I want to
 

765
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,780
I expected but the other thing I want to
do is rip out a bunch of this tunnel

766
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:14,790
do is rip out a bunch of this tunnel
 

767
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,150
do is rip out a bunch of this tunnel
maybe instead of having the way up and

768
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,160
maybe instead of having the way up and
 

769
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,010
maybe instead of having the way up and
down here way over there we'll probably

770
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:19,020
down here way over there we'll probably
 

771
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,309
down here way over there we'll probably
move it closer to the killing area and I

772
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
move it closer to the killing area and I
 

773
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,110
move it closer to the killing area and I
want to add an enchanting area down here

774
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,120
want to add an enchanting area down here
 

775
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,309
want to add an enchanting area down here
now that we're gonna be able to get

776
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:25,319
now that we're gonna be able to get
 

777
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,949
now that we're gonna be able to get
experience and this is also where I'm

778
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:27,959
experience and this is also where I'm
 

779
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,720
experience and this is also where I'm
planning on building like a villager

780
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:29,730
planning on building like a villager
 

781
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,090
planning on building like a villager
trading hall I think would be very good

782
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:32,100
trading hall I think would be very good
 

783
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,669
trading hall I think would be very good
because this is very fast experience and

784
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:34,679
because this is very fast experience and
 

785
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,470
because this is very fast experience and
you need experience to like combine the

786
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:39,480
you need experience to like combine the
 

787
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,840
you need experience to like combine the
books you buy from the villagers to your

788
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:41,850
books you buy from the villagers to your
 

789
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,090
books you buy from the villagers to your
tools and stuff okay so next project

790

actually we have these slime pushers
 

799
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,490
actually we have these slime pushers
that knock the experience points to the

800
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:55,500
that knock the experience points to the
 

801
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,190
that knock the experience points to the
center here and they used to all end up

802
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:58,200
center here and they used to all end up
 

803
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,230
center here and they used to all end up
at the slime block in the very middle

804
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
at the slime block in the very middle
 

805
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,030
at the slime block in the very middle
but you can see a lot of it is not

806
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,040
but you can see a lot of it is not
 

807
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,360
but you can see a lot of it is not
anymore and it gets launched up to us

808
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,370
anymore and it gets launched up to us
 

809
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,790
anymore and it gets launched up to us
when we stand in the center platform

810
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:07,800
when we stand in the center platform
 

811
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,830
when we stand in the center platform
there but the problem is most of it is

812
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
there but the problem is most of it is
 

813
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,370
there but the problem is most of it is
not making it to the center anymore and

814
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:12,380
not making it to the center anymore and
 

815
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,020
not making it to the center anymore and
it's not getting launched up so I'm

816
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,030
it's not getting launched up so I'm
 

817
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,040
it's not getting launched up so I'm
gonna try replace the packed ice here

818
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,050
gonna try replace the packed ice here
 

819
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,530
gonna try replace the packed ice here
with blue ice which should be a little

820
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:21,540
with blue ice which should be a little
 

821
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:28,730
with blue ice which should be a little
bit more slippery check it out it works

822
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:28,740
bit more slippery check it out it works
 

823
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,400
bit more slippery check it out it works

825
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,230
again yeah so the blue ice did the trick
it can get to the middle no problem now

826
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:33,240
