00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:02,969
here the stream of water that pushes
 

31
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,240
here the stream of water that pushes
them into this chamber and then they

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,250
them into this chamber and then they
 

33
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:21,550
them into this chamber and then they
swim up and it's kind of dark down here

34
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:21,560
swim up and it's kind of dark down here
 

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,190
swim up and it's kind of dark down here

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,820

so the drops fall in here they get sent

44
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:52,830
so the drops fall in here they get sent
 

45
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,350
so the drops fall in here they get sent
to the stream here they fall one block

46
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:56,360
to the stream here they fall one block
 

47
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,990
to the stream here they fall one block
and they run along the door top here

48
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000

 

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,490

they keep going around the bend and

okay so we are going to make them go
 

79
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:08,120
okay so we are going to make them go
over and we need them to swim up I think

80
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,130
over and we need them to swim up I think
 

81
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:27,500
over and we need them to swim up I think
at least one block every time I jump

onto the glass here and we'll have this
 

91
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:30,510
onto the glass here and we'll have this
covered I think

day and then we will check it out all
 

169
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:32,190
day and then we will check it out all
right we finally got some spiders and

170
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,200
right we finally got some spiders and
 

171
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,610
right we finally got some spiders and
waiting forever like 15 minutes for a

172
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:35,620
waiting forever like 15 minutes for a
 

173
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,670
waiting forever like 15 minutes for a
spider I changed that we now have five

174
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
spider I changed that we now have five
 

175
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:49,660
spider I changed that we now have five
lava blocks

176
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:49,670

 

177
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:59,079

needs to work pretty good

178
00:10:59,079 --> 00:10:59,089

 

179
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,980

I'm happy with that

180
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:02,990

 

181
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,830

well if this door is open spring falls

182
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:05,840
well if this door is open spring falls
 

183
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,930
well if this door is open spring falls
now it's supposed to run so long

184
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:10,940
now it's supposed to run so long
 

185
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:31,540
now it's supposed to run so long
top runs to our our main collection

186
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:31,550
top runs to our our main collection
 

187
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:51,150
top runs to our our main collection
point here I'm quite happy with it so

188
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,160

 

189
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,200

another thing we're gonna look at today

190
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,210
another thing we're gonna look at today
 

191
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,870
another thing we're gonna look at today
a lot of you have been wondering about

192
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:55,880
a lot of you have been wondering about
 

193
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:02,140
a lot of you have been wondering about
with farms am I going to build a squid

194
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,150
with farms am I going to build a squid
 

195
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,170
with farms am I going to build a squid
farm I actually started kind of working

196
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,180
farm I actually started kind of working
 

197
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,840
farm I actually started kind of working
on one like two weeks ago it's

198
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:10,850
on one like two weeks ago it's
 

199
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:18,070
on one like two weeks ago it's
incredibly simple to do although this

200
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:18,080
incredibly simple to do although this
 

201
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,320
incredibly simple to do although this
biome I'm in is probably the worst one

202
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,330
biome I'm in is probably the worst one
 

203
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,070
biome I'm in is probably the worst one
for collecting squid and stuff because

204
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,080
for collecting squid and stuff because
 

205
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,390
for collecting squid and stuff because
there's so much water all around the

206
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:28,400
there's so much water all around the
 

207
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:35,170
there's so much water all around the
island if you can believe it I'm gonna

208
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:35,180
island if you can believe it I'm gonna
 

209
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,330
island if you can believe it I'm gonna
get some more soil and then I'll show

210
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:37,340
get some more soil and then I'll show
 

211
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:48,370
get some more soil and then I'll show
you what I've been doing we got some in

212
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:48,380
you what I've been doing we got some in
 

213
00:12:48,380 --> 00:13:00,900
you what I've been doing we got some in
here don't may be in here

214
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:00,910

 

215
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,820

yeah so to make a squid farm you have to

216
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:03,830
yeah so to make a squid farm you have to
 

217
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,980
yeah so to make a squid farm you have to
take advantage of one of their

218
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:05,990
take advantage of one of their
 

219
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,400
take advantage of one of their
characteristics that they they can't

220
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,410
characteristics that they they can't
 

221
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,130
characteristics that they they can't
swim up so they'll spawn randomly

222
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:14,140
swim up so they'll spawn randomly
 

223
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,870
swim up so they'll spawn randomly
somewhere within these thousands and

224
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
somewhere within these thousands and
 

225
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,840
somewhere within these thousands and
thousands of water blocks they'll choose

226
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:19,850
thousands of water blocks they'll choose
 

227
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,870
thousands of water blocks they'll choose
one by random and then they'll sink to

228
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
one by random and then they'll sink to
 

229
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,410
one by random and then they'll sink to
the bottom of the ocean and they'll swim

230
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:26,420
the bottom of the ocean and they'll swim
 

231
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,910
the bottom of the ocean and they'll swim
around and they'll keep getting lower

232
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
around and they'll keep getting lower
 

233
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:37,030
around and they'll keep getting lower
and lower and they'll keep traveling

234
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
and lower and they'll keep traveling
 

235
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,410
and lower and they'll keep traveling
towards the lowest spot in the ocean

236
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:43,420

 

237
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:50,580

haha it's probably pretty hard to see

238
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:50,590

 

239
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:57,280

but basically there's thousands of water

240
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,290
but basically there's thousands of water
 

241
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,270
but basically there's thousands of water
blocks but for like this section here

242
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:01,280
blocks but for like this section here
 

243
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,290
blocks but for like this section here
like probably at least thirty bucks all

244
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:05,300
like probably at least thirty bucks all
 

245
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,350
like probably at least thirty bucks all
around me and he Swift that spot in that

246
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:08,360
around me and he Swift that spot in that
 

247
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,180
around me and he Swift that spot in that
space will end up right here give it

248
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,190
space will end up right here give it
 

249
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,000
space will end up right here give it
enough time because it keeps swimming

250
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,010
enough time because it keeps swimming
 

251
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,890
enough time because it keeps swimming
lower and lower and it all kind of

252
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:17,900
lower and lower and it all kind of
 

253
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,160
lower and lower and it all kind of
funnels down to this point here and then

254
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,170
funnels down to this point here and then
 

255
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,930
funnels down to this point here and then
I've cut a hole in here and they will

256
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:22,940
I've cut a hole in here and they will
 

257
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:30,640
I've cut a hole in here and they will
fall into this room and so once you do

258
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:30,650
fall into this room and so once you do
 

259
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:39,100
fall into this room and so once you do
that you can build water we'd only need

260
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,110
that you can build water we'd only need
 

261
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:48,260
that you can build water we'd only need
one block space so you can

262
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:48,270

 

263
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,670

dig like water channels that had one

264
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:50,680
dig like water channels that had one
 

265
00:14:50,680 --> 00:15:00,240
dig like water channels that had one
block wide and then set up water streams

266
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,250
block wide and then set up water streams
 

267
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,040
block wide and then set up water streams
to push them through and keep doing that

268
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,050
to push them through and keep doing that
 

269
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,380
to push them through and keep doing that
and make like a central area for them

270
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,390
and make like a central area for them
 

271
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,870
and make like a central area for them
all to collect and you just connect all

272
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:09,880
all to collect and you just connect all
 

273
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:17,880
all to collect and you just connect all
the the water channels together so like

274
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:17,890
the the water channels together so like
 

275
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:24,120
the the water channels together so like
I need to make a lot of those collection

276
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,130
I need to make a lot of those collection
 

277
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,210
I need to make a lot of those collection
points because even though that covers a

278
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:27,220
points because even though that covers a
 

279
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,730
points because even though that covers a
large area there's so much water all

280
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:29,740
large area there's so much water all
 

281
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,380
large area there's so much water all
around so I probably need to make

282
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:33,390
around so I probably need to make
 

283
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,920
around so I probably need to make
probably 10 collection points and that

284
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:37,930
probably 10 collection points and that
 

285
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,340
probably 10 collection points and that
all travel to the center of my base and

286
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:41,350
all travel to the center of my base and
 

287
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,020
all travel to the center of my base and
they'll bring the squid somewhere

288
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,030
they'll bring the squid somewhere
 

289
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,350
they'll bring the squid somewhere
underground you will need to do a bit of

290
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:46,360
underground you will need to do a bit of
 

291
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,210
underground you will need to do a bit of
terraforming probably like if you have

292
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:48,220
terraforming probably like if you have
 

293
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:54,570
terraforming probably like if you have
any holes in your in your floor you need

294
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:54,580
any holes in your in your floor you need
 

295
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,820
any holes in your in your floor you need
to level them out otherwise squid can

296
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:56,830
to level them out otherwise squid can
 

297
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:02,850
to level them out otherwise squid can
fall into those and then they won't end

298
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:02,860
fall into those and then they won't end
 

299
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:10,290
fall into those and then they won't end
up into your squid farm and so here's an

300
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:10,300
up into your squid farm and so here's an
 

301
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,120
up into your squid farm and so here's an
example I think we have squid here still

302
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,130
example I think we have squid here still
 

303
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,290
example I think we have squid here still
yep they've collected to this little

304
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:16,300
yep they've collected to this little
 

305
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,000
yep they've collected to this little
point here there's a little spot here

306
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,010
point here there's a little spot here
 

307
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,000
point here there's a little spot here
this guy has been in here for a few days

308
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,010
this guy has been in here for a few days
 

309
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:33,690
this guy has been in here for a few days
now but what I would do is I would just

310
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:33,700
now but what I would do is I would just
 

311
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:44,070
now but what I would do is I would just
fill this in fill it all in so that if

312
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:44,080
fill this in fill it all in so that if
 

313
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,820
fill this in fill it all in so that if
he spawns in this area here

314
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:48,830

 

315
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,960

decrease the number of collection areas

316
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:50,970
decrease the number of collection areas
 

317
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,860
decrease the number of collection areas
we need to make we can do that and then

318
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:53,870
we need to make we can do that and then
 

319
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,860
we need to make we can do that and then
it'll more likely end up over here and

320
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:57,870
it'll more likely end up over here and
 

321
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,120
it'll more likely end up over here and
then we can make a collection point here

322
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,130
then we can make a collection point here
 

323
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:13,660
then we can make a collection point here
[Applause]

324
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:13,670

 

325
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,780

and yeah it's pretty simple definitely

326
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:17,790
and yeah it's pretty simple definitely
 

327
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,280
and yeah it's pretty simple definitely
possible it's a lot easier if you're in

328
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,290
possible it's a lot easier if you're in
 

329
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:31,480
possible it's a lot easier if you're in
a different biome but not impossible and

330
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:31,490

 

331
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:39,170

yeah and now we have a collection point

332
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:39,180
yeah and now we have a collection point
 

333
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:46,360
yeah and now we have a collection point
here and then you would just branch that

334
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:46,370
here and then you would just branch that
 

335
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,240
here and then you would just branch that
towards the center the problem is I've

336
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,250
towards the center the problem is I've
 

337
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,430
towards the center the problem is I've
tried like making water stairs for squid

338
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:52,440
tried like making water stairs for squid
 

339
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,270
tried like making water stairs for squid
to get pushed up they don't seem to want

340
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:56,280
to get pushed up they don't seem to want
 

341
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,730
to get pushed up they don't seem to want
to go upstairs even if they're being

342
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:58,740
to go upstairs even if they're being
 

343
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,550
to go upstairs even if they're being
pushed by water so they're gonna end up

344
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:04,560
pushed by water so they're gonna end up
 

345
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:11,600
pushed by water so they're gonna end up
somewhere below ground not a big deal if

346
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:11,610
somewhere below ground not a big deal if
 

347
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,390
somewhere below ground not a big deal if
you want to somehow get them above

348
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
you want to somehow get them above
 

349
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,730
you want to somehow get them above
ground you will need to use minecarts

350
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:16,740
ground you will need to use minecarts
 

351
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,850
ground you will need to use minecarts
you can put squid in microts and make

352
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:19,860
you can put squid in microts and make
 

353
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,180
you can put squid in microts and make
some system to bring them up but you

354
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,190
some system to bring them up but you
 

355
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,030
some system to bring them up but you
know it's really up to you I probably

356
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:26,040
know it's really up to you I probably
 

357
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:32,210
know it's really up to you I probably
won't be doing that okay

358
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:32,220
won't be doing that okay
 

359
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,190
won't be doing that okay
so if it wasn't clear what I meant by

360
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:34,200
so if it wasn't clear what I meant by
 

361
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,390
so if it wasn't clear what I meant by
that don't worry I will be setting up a

362
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
that don't worry I will be setting up a
 

363
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,270
that don't worry I will be setting up a
squid farm of what I have there wasn't

364
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,280
squid farm of what I have there wasn't
 

365
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,800
squid farm of what I have there wasn't
really anything and it's just a hole in

366
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:42,810
really anything and it's just a hole in
 

367
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,800
really anything and it's just a hole in
the ground to test to see if they would

368
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:45,810
the ground to test to see if they would
 

369
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,200
the ground to test to see if they would
all go into the collection point and

370
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,210
all go into the collection point and
 

371
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,660
all go into the collection point and
they did in a test I did and so probably

372
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:53,670
they did in a test I did and so probably
 

373
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,180
they did in a test I did and so probably
in a few episodes I'll show it to you

374
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,190
in a few episodes I'll show it to you
 

375
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,840
in a few episodes I'll show it to you
when it's all done won't take long to do

376
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:58,850
when it's all done won't take long to do
 

377
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,350
when it's all done won't take long to do
but it is a low efficiency

378
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:02,360
but it is a low efficiency
 

379
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,090
but it is a low efficiency
squit farm plan because obviously

380
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,100
squit farm plan because obviously
 

381
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,200
squit farm plan because obviously
there's so much water around here the

382
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,210
there's so much water around here the
 

383
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,000
there's so much water around here the
only way to make a high-efficiency Swit

384
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,010
only way to make a high-efficiency Swit
 

385
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,560
only way to make a high-efficiency Swit
farm is to have only like less than 100

386
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:15,570
farm is to have only like less than 100
 

387
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:22,629
farm is to have only like less than 100
water blocks you would want but yeah

388
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:22,639
water blocks you would want but yeah
 

389
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:25,879
water blocks you would want but yeah
it'll work low efficiency but after

390
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:25,889
it'll work low efficiency but after
 

391
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:27,950
it'll work low efficiency but after
about a minute or two of swimming around

392
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:27,960
about a minute or two of swimming around
 

393
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,669
about a minute or two of swimming around
all the switch should go into a central

394
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:31,679
all the switch should go into a central
 

395
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,419
all the switch should go into a central
collection point and then you just built

396
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:35,429
collection point and then you just built
 

397
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:37,820
collection point and then you just built
them wherever you need them like I'll

398
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:37,830
them wherever you need them like I'll
 

399
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,149
them wherever you need them like I'll
probably need one around there probably

400
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:41,159
probably need one around there probably
 

401
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,950
probably need one around there probably
one around here here here here all the

402
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:45,960
one around here here here here all the
 

403
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,120
one around here here here here all the
way around and then terraform it so

404
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,130
way around and then terraform it so
 

405
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:57,230
way around and then terraform it so
that's it works but we are out of time

406
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,240
that's it works but we are out of time
 

407
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,139
that's it works but we are out of time
guys if you guys don't like watching me

build stuff just let me know and I'll go

410
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:05,820
build stuff just let me know and I'll go
 

411
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,860
build stuff just let me know and I'll go
back to showing you I'm not sure if my

412
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:09,870
back to showing you I'm not sure if my
 

413
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,720
back to showing you I'm not sure if my
episodes have been as interesting lately

414
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:11,730
episodes have been as interesting lately
 

415
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:17,960
episodes have been as interesting lately
but I like to try different things and

416
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:17,970

 

417
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,450

well we did get one thing done anyway

420
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:22,669
well we did get one thing done anyway
 

421
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:27,460
well we did get one thing done anyway
I'm pretty happy with this thing and
