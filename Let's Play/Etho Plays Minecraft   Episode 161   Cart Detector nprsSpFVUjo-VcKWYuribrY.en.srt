sandstone like
 

53
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,630
sandstone like
how much better could it be it

54
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
how much better could it be it
 

55
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,910

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
overly defined that is definitely a
 

61
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,990
overly defined that is definitely a

and on the best block can't beat that

64
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
and on the best block can't beat that
 

65
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,590
and on the best block can't beat that
can't um i like the new look of the

66
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
can't um i like the new look of the
 

67
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,749
can't um i like the new look of the
sandstone

68
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
sandstone
 

69
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,270
sandstone
i couldn't figure out at first when i

70
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
i couldn't figure out at first when i
 

71
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,350
i couldn't figure out at first when i
saw it alone why it had this like lip at

72
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
saw it alone why it had this like lip at
 

73
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,550
saw it alone why it had this like lip at
the top and then

74
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
the top and then
 

75
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,149
the top and then
when i put it next to the regular

76
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
when i put it next to the regular
 

77
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,910
when i put it next to the regular
sandstone oh yeah

78
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
sandstone oh yeah
 

79
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,230
sandstone oh yeah
it has a lip too so it kind of goes with

80
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
it has a lip too so it kind of goes with
 

81
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,149
it has a lip too so it kind of goes with
it that way

82
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
it that way
 

83
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,749
it that way
it's one thing i i don't know

84
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
it's one thing i i don't know
 

85
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,230
it's one thing i i don't know
i guess it looks good yeah it does it's

86
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
i guess it looks good yeah it does it's
 

87
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,030
i guess it looks good yeah it does it's
just

88
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040

 

89
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,069

for the flow vertically it's a little

90
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079

 

91
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,109

that's pretty good uh has the same

92
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
that's pretty good uh has the same
 

93
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,229
that's pretty good uh has the same
top and i believe the same bottom as

94
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
top and i believe the same bottom as
 

95
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,270
top and i believe the same bottom as
regular sandstone so it goes

96
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
regular sandstone so it goes
 

97
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,309
regular sandstone so it goes
together that way and then we got the

98
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
together that way and then we got the
 

99
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,070
together that way and then we got the
new planks which are really cool because

100
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
new planks which are really cool because
 

101
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,110
new planks which are really cool because
they're

102
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
they're
 

103
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,830
they're
they're kind of colors that we don't

104
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
they're kind of colors that we don't
 

105
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,830
they're kind of colors that we don't
quite

106
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840

the new planks you still get the regular

140
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
the new planks you still get the regular
 

141
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,630
the new planks you still get the regular
half slabs and probably the regular

142
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
half slabs and probably the regular
 

143
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,229

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,149
pearl and
cut my way down get like two stacks of

174
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
cut my way down get like two stacks of
 

175
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,509
cut my way down get like two stacks of
wood that way

176
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
wood that way
 

177
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,270
wood that way
and i would just make planks out of them

178
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
and i would just make planks out of them
 

179
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,710
and i would just make planks out of them
because it takes a lot of planks to do

180
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
because it takes a lot of planks to do
 

181
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,030
because it takes a lot of planks to do
that

182
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
that
 

183
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,949
that
uh branch mine design

184
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
uh branch mine design
 

185
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,190
uh branch mine design
and now i have to get them from these

186
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
and now i have to get them from these
 

187
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,270
and now i have to get them from these
trees and that takes a little bit longer

188
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
trees and that takes a little bit longer
 

189
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,710
trees and that takes a little bit longer
you can see i've been cutting them down

190
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
you can see i've been cutting them down
 

191
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,190
you can see i've been cutting them down
and replanting them here

192
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
and replanting them here
 

193
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,830
and replanting them here
and cutting them down at the tree farm

194
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
and cutting them down at the tree farm
 

195
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,470
and cutting them down at the tree farm
and all that

196
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
and all that
 

197
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,670
and all that
too and yeah it's just a little bit work

198
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
too and yeah it's just a little bit work
 

199
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,630
too and yeah it's just a little bit work
for me now

200
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
for me now
 

201
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,429
for me now
one trick i could do i could

202
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
one trick i could do i could
 

203
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,670
one trick i could do i could
if i wanted i'm going to pick those

204
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
if i wanted i'm going to pick those
 

205
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,870
if i wanted i'm going to pick those
tracks up again

206
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
tracks up again
 

207
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,629
tracks up again
in just a second you could convert it to

208
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
in just a second you could convert it to
 

209
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,270
in just a second you could convert it to
the wooden slabs and then just do a

210
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
the wooden slabs and then just do a
 

211
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,510
the wooden slabs and then just do a
double

212
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
double
 

213
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,950
double
and it would look the same i think it

214
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
and it would look the same i think it
 

215
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,350
and it would look the same i think it
might

216
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
might
 

217
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,590
might
i don't know if it has a lighting issue

218
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
i don't know if it has a lighting issue
 

219
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,430
i don't know if it has a lighting issue
the stairs had a lighting issue for me

220
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
the stairs had a lighting issue for me
 

221
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,790
the stairs had a lighting issue for me
when i tried

222
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800

 

223
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,230

yeah it looks it looks right

224
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
yeah it looks it looks right
 

225
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,670
yeah it looks it looks right
that's one way you could take advantage

226
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
that's one way you could take advantage
 

227
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,150
that's one way you could take advantage
of using the old or the jungle tree

228
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
of using the old or the jungle tree
 

229
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,110
of using the old or the jungle tree
still for

230
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
still for
 

231
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,230
still for
for collecting blanks

232
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
for collecting blanks
 

233
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,070
for collecting blanks
anyway let's head

234
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
anyway let's head
 

235
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,310
anyway let's head
down to the branch mine

236
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320

 

237
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,310

all right we're here i don't know if i

238
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
all right we're here i don't know if i
 

239
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,230
all right we're here i don't know if i
showed this last time but i put lamps at

240
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
showed this last time but i put lamps at
 

241
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,909
showed this last time but i put lamps at
this entrance parts

242
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
this entrance parts
 

243
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,830
this entrance parts
that are always on there's a levers

244
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
that are always on there's a levers
 

245
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,350
that are always on there's a levers
above them

246
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
above them
 

247
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,350
above them
i've been working and expanding this

248
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
i've been working and expanding this
 

249
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,310
i've been working and expanding this
quite a bit since last episode

250
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
quite a bit since last episode
 

251
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,230
quite a bit since last episode
changed this drop here too so it's

252
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
changed this drop here too so it's
 

253
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,830
changed this drop here too so it's
it's one of the cubes too i haven't had

254
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
it's one of the cubes too i haven't had
 

255
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,909
it's one of the cubes too i haven't had
any mobs spawn in here yet from the

256
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
any mobs spawn in here yet from the
 

257
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,590
any mobs spawn in here yet from the
flickering lights which is good

258
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
flickering lights which is good
 

259
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,870
flickering lights which is good
and just been doing

260
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
and just been doing
 

261
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,590
and just been doing
getting more stuff as i've been mining

262
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
getting more stuff as i've been mining
 

263
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,110
getting more stuff as i've been mining
you can see i've almost used up the

264
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
you can see i've almost used up the
 

265
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,390
you can see i've almost used up the
awesome pick just

266
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
awesome pick just
 

267
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,990
awesome pick just
just on this alone uh lots and lots of

268
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
just on this alone uh lots and lots of
 

269
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,310
just on this alone uh lots and lots of
digging

270
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
digging
 

271
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,070
digging
and i guess we'll go for a little bit of

272
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
and i guess we'll go for a little bit of
 

273
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,870
and i guess we'll go for a little bit of
a run i almost forgot to

274
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
a run i almost forgot to
 

275
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,150
a run i almost forgot to
get that

276
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160

 

277
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,749

and we got the full six minutes that's

278
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
and we got the full six minutes that's
 

279
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,670
and we got the full six minutes that's
awesome so i don't know if you guys know

280
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
awesome so i don't know if you guys know
 

281
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,790
awesome so i don't know if you guys know
this but with

282
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
this but with
 

283
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,990
this but with
splash potions uh you want them

284
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
splash potions uh you want them
 

285
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,029
splash potions uh you want them
to hit you in the face you don't want

286
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
to hit you in the face you don't want
 

287
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,469
to hit you in the face you don't want
them to hit your feet

288
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
them to hit your feet
 

289
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,110
them to hit your feet
ideally so it's the last longer if you

290
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
ideally so it's the last longer if you
 

291
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,430
ideally so it's the last longer if you
throw them at a at a wall like that

292
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
throw them at a at a wall like that
 

293
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,029
throw them at a at a wall like that
instead of

294
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
instead of
 

295
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,950
instead of
at your feet like that so just a little

296
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
at your feet like that so just a little
 

297
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,270
at your feet like that so just a little
trick

298
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
trick
 

299
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,309
trick
to keep in mind um

300
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
to keep in mind um
 

301
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,469
to keep in mind um
yeah i mostly expanded this way

302
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479

 

303
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,070

so there's 25 of these branches now

304
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
so there's 25 of these branches now
 

305
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,029
so there's 25 of these branches now
haven't started mining at all just uh

306
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
haven't started mining at all just uh
 

307
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,270
haven't started mining at all just uh
just the main corridors

308
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
just the main corridors
 

309
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,309
just the main corridors
uh then it started starts going this way

310
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
uh then it started starts going this way
 

311
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,070
uh then it started starts going this way
so and as i've been going through here

312
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
so and as i've been going through here
 

313
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,830
so and as i've been going through here
i've been finding caves and everything

314
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
i've been finding caves and everything
 

315
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,510
i've been finding caves and everything
too every so often i've just

316
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
too every so often i've just
 

317
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,589
too every so often i've just
been blocking them off and lighting them

318
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
been blocking them off and lighting them
 

319
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,110
been blocking them off and lighting them
up and stuff

320
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
up and stuff
 

321
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,230
up and stuff
now having a little bit of a problem

322
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
now having a little bit of a problem
 

323
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,189
now having a little bit of a problem
over here

324
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
over here
 

325
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,790
over here
i think you might be able to guess what

326
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
i think you might be able to guess what
 

327
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,830
i think you might be able to guess what
it is

328
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840

 

329
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,029

um yeah so i'm gonna be

330
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
um yeah so i'm gonna be
 

331
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,790
um yeah so i'm gonna be
using the the double half slabs

332
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
using the the double half slabs
 

333
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,469
using the the double half slabs
at any of these type sections where

334
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
at any of these type sections where
 

335
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,550
at any of these type sections where
there's lava

336
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
there's lava
 

337
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,270
there's lava
um look at all the redstone

338
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
um look at all the redstone
 

339
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,790
um look at all the redstone
beautiful so

340
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
beautiful so
 

341
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,270
beautiful so
the way the pattern the way this pattern

342
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
the way the pattern the way this pattern
 

343
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,710
the way the pattern the way this pattern
works is it's a five

344
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
works is it's a five
 

345
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,150
works is it's a five
wide by four high plus

346
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
wide by four high plus
 

347
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,070
wide by four high plus
this block down on the left and on the

348
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
this block down on the left and on the
 

349
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,670
this block down on the left and on the
right is cut out

350
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
right is cut out
 

351
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,430
right is cut out
and then i just run planks all the way

352
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
and then i just run planks all the way
 

353
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,270
and then i just run planks all the way
down there and there

354
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
down there and there
 

355
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,990
down there and there
and then the top left and right corners

356
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
and then the top left and right corners
 

357
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,430
and then the top left and right corners
as well

358
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
as well
 

359
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,189
as well
and then i do the cross sections that go

360
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
and then i do the cross sections that go
 

361
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,629
and then i do the cross sections that go
all the way around pretty simple

362
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
all the way around pretty simple
 

363
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,749
all the way around pretty simple
and then i put a pumpkin

364
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
and then i put a pumpkin
 

365
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,749
and then i put a pumpkin
at the top uh this one goes quite a ways

366
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
at the top uh this one goes quite a ways
 

367
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,390
at the top uh this one goes quite a ways
yet too

368
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400

 

369
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,270

and then it stops i have hit uh

370
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
and then it stops i have hit uh
 

371
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,869
and then it stops i have hit uh
that will go down i have hit my other

372
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
that will go down i have hit my other
 

373
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,350
that will go down i have hit my other
mine

374
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
mine
 

375
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,270
mine
unfortunately over here

376
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
unfortunately over here
 

377
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,430
unfortunately over here
so one of the branches is pretty much

378
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
so one of the branches is pretty much
 

379
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,550
so one of the branches is pretty much
going to get nothing

380
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
going to get nothing
 

381
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,869
going to get nothing
because it's the same exact spot as that

382
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
because it's the same exact spot as that
 

383
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,469
because it's the same exact spot as that
one

384
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479

 

385
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,869

so if i do the donor thing i'm sorry if

386
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
so if i do the donor thing i'm sorry if
 

387
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,309
so if i do the donor thing i'm sorry if
you get that one because you'll

388
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
you get that one because you'll
 

389
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,749
you get that one because you'll
probably get no resources to your name

390
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
probably get no resources to your name
 

391
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,390
probably get no resources to your name
uh if that if that matters to you

392
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,400

 

393
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,990

but we'll leave that up to the luck of

394
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
but we'll leave that up to the luck of
 

395
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,870
but we'll leave that up to the luck of
the draw i guess

396
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
the draw i guess
 

397
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,430
the draw i guess
um yeah

398
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
um yeah
 

399
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,790
um yeah
a lot of people seem to want me to do

400
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
a lot of people seem to want me to do
 

401
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,710
a lot of people seem to want me to do
the tracks and i think i might

402
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720

 

403
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,150

that's why i brought these with me just

404
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
that's why i brought these with me just
 

405
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,710
that's why i brought these with me just
so you can see what it looks like

406
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720

 

407
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,470

some people suggested i should change

408
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
some people suggested i should change
 

409
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,710
some people suggested i should change
the floor with soil

410
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
the floor with soil
 

411
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,990
the floor with soil
i tried it it looks pretty good it does

412
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
i tried it it looks pretty good it does
 

413
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,590
i tried it it looks pretty good it does
the problem is i kind of want to keep

414
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
the problem is i kind of want to keep
 

415
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,190
the problem is i kind of want to keep
the soil because i

416
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
the soil because i
 

417
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,190
the soil because i
only i don't even have like a chest full

418
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
only i don't even have like a chest full
 

419
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,310
only i don't even have like a chest full
of it

420
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
of it
 

421
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,070
of it
i'm pretty low on soil and i will

422
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
i'm pretty low on soil and i will
 

423
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,630
i'm pretty low on soil and i will
probably need it for future projects

424
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
probably need it for future projects
 

425
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,710
probably need it for future projects
so if i can keep it wrong tool

426
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
so if i can keep it wrong tool
 

427
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,790
so if i can keep it wrong tool
if i can keep it that would be good so

428
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
if i can keep it that would be good so
 

429
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,470
if i can keep it that would be good so
i'll probably keep the smooth stone

430
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
i'll probably keep the smooth stone
 

431
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,150
i'll probably keep the smooth stone
because it's a lot easier usually i

432
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
because it's a lot easier usually i
 

433
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,670
because it's a lot easier usually i
don't have to replace it because it's

434
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
don't have to replace it because it's
 

435
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,790
don't have to replace it because it's
a good chance it will be smooth stone as

436
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
a good chance it will be smooth stone as
 

437
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,030
a good chance it will be smooth stone as
i dig this out

438
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
i dig this out
 

439
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,110
i dig this out
uh this goes away these are the pumpkins

440
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
uh this goes away these are the pumpkins
 

441
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,030
uh this goes away these are the pumpkins
above the lighting looks really good

442
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
above the lighting looks really good
 

443
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,230
above the lighting looks really good
very even and i think i stopped here

444
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
very even and i think i stopped here
 

445
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,350
very even and i think i stopped here
i want to show you this cave it's

446
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
i want to show you this cave it's
 

447
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,550
i want to show you this cave it's
pretty crazy

448
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560

 

449
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,670

before i start lighting it up and stuff

450
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
before i start lighting it up and stuff
 

451
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,550
before i start lighting it up and stuff
and going through it it's huge

452
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
and going through it it's huge
 

453
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,630
and going through it it's huge

very cool so i'll have fun going through
 

461
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,069
very cool so i'll have fun going through
that

462
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
that
 

463
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,470
that
and i think i found another one too

464
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480

 

465
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,670

it's crazy i can be over here

466
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
it's crazy i can be over here
 

467
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,509
it's crazy i can be over here
and like creepers will just find me

468
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
and like creepers will just find me
 

469
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,750
and like creepers will just find me
constantly

okay i'll run down to the other other

474
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
okay i'll run down to the other other
 

475
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,910
okay i'll run down to the other other
path and we can see the other cave there

476
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
path and we can see the other cave there
 

477
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,110
path and we can see the other cave there
too i think there was one

478
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
too i think there was one
 

479
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,509
too i think there was one
yeah this other main corridor comes down

480
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
yeah this other main corridor comes down
 

481
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,110
yeah this other main corridor comes down
to this cave but i guess i went through

482
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
to this cave but i guess i went through
 

483
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,870
to this cave but i guess i went through
it already i forgot i did

484
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
it already i forgot i did
 

485
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,350
it already i forgot i did
got a lot of stuff in here though uh

486
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
got a lot of stuff in here though uh
 

487
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,110
got a lot of stuff in here though uh
it's fairly

488
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
it's fairly
 

489
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,190
it's fairly
fairly big but anyway

490
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
fairly big but anyway
 

491
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,710
fairly big but anyway
today i want to do a little bit of uh

492
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
today i want to do a little bit of uh
 

493
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,269
today i want to do a little bit of uh
messing around with minecart stuff

494
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279

 

495
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,750

i don't uh do a lot of minecart things

496
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
i don't uh do a lot of minecart things
 

497
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,550
i don't uh do a lot of minecart things
but i've had an

498
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
but i've had an
 

499
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,190
but i've had an
idea for a like a player sensor

500
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
idea for a like a player sensor
 

501
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,350
idea for a like a player sensor
to see if a player is a mine is in a

502
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
to see if a player is a mine is in a
 

503
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,550
to see if a player is a mine is in a
minecart or if it's a regular

504
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
minecart or if it's a regular
 

505
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,430
minecart or if it's a regular
empty one or a storage minecart type

506
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
empty one or a storage minecart type
 

507
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,470
empty one or a storage minecart type
thing

508
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:12,480
thing
 

509
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,590
thing
and uh the reason i want that

510
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
and uh the reason i want that
 

511
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,670
and uh the reason i want that
is so that if at any point in the system

512
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
is so that if at any point in the system
 

513
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,750
is so that if at any point in the system
i just bring a storage minecart with me

514
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
i just bring a storage minecart with me
 

515
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,389
i just bring a storage minecart with me
put it on the tracks fill it up with my

516
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
put it on the tracks fill it up with my
 

517
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,150
put it on the tracks fill it up with my
stuff and then push it

518
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
stuff and then push it
 

519
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,190
stuff and then push it
i want it to find its way back to the

520
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
i want it to find its way back to the
 

521
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,069
i want it to find its way back to the
main hub there and then also

522
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
main hub there and then also
 

523
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,150
main hub there and then also
go into a separate track specifically

524
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
go into a separate track specifically
 

525
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,269
go into a separate track specifically
for

526
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
for
 

527
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,470
for
the storage minecarts ideally that's

528
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
the storage minecarts ideally that's
 

529
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,230
the storage minecarts ideally that's
what i would like to happen

530
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
what i would like to happen
 

531
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,190
what i would like to happen
like once it gets here then it goes to a

532
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
like once it gets here then it goes to a
 

533
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,110
like once it gets here then it goes to a
storage minecart track that maybe goes

534
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
storage minecart track that maybe goes
 

535
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,990
storage minecart track that maybe goes
to

536
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
to
 

537
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,829
to
a storage room or something at my main

538
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
a storage room or something at my main
 

539
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,710
a storage room or something at my main
base that would be really cool

540
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
base that would be really cool
 

541
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,230
base that would be really cool
but i need to detect if it's a storage

542
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
but i need to detect if it's a storage
 

543
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,069
but i need to detect if it's a storage
minecart or if it's a regular minecarts

544
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
minecart or if it's a regular minecarts
 

545
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,430
minecart or if it's a regular minecarts
so that is what we're gonna do

546
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
so that is what we're gonna do
 

547
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,710
so that is what we're gonna do
here today right now at this moment

548
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720

 

549
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,470

i got a visitor unexpectedly

556
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
i got a visitor unexpectedly
 

557
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,110
i got a visitor unexpectedly
i tell ya the new mob ai

558
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
i tell ya the new mob ai
 

559
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,550

is crazy they are so smart now

560
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
is crazy they are so smart now
 

561
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,310
is crazy they are so smart now
apparently they've been programmed to

562
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
apparently they've been programmed to
 

563
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,670
apparently they've been programmed to
appreciate artwork

564
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680

 

565
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,790

which is just mind-boggling

566
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800

 

567
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,629

just can't stop staring at the

568
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
just can't stop staring at the
 

569
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,990
just can't stop staring at the
awesomeness

570
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000

 

571
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,269

it's time for you to go home

572
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
it's time for you to go home
 

573
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,110
it's time for you to go home
you like it

575
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,430

i think he likes it um

576
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
i think he likes it um
 

577
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,509
i think he likes it um
so apparently i'm pretty safe here if i

578
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:03,519
so apparently i'm pretty safe here if i
 

579
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,230
so apparently i'm pretty safe here if i
ever have zombie visitors which is good

580
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
ever have zombie visitors which is good
 

581
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,110
ever have zombie visitors which is good
i have no idea where he came from though

582
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
i have no idea where he came from though
 

583
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,509
i have no idea where he came from though
which

584
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
which
 

585
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,910
which
terrifies me

586
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920

 

587
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,069

okay so time for the minecart stuff um

588
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:20,079
okay so time for the minecart stuff um
 

589
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,110
okay so time for the minecart stuff um
i only know of two ways of detecting if

590
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
i only know of two ways of detecting if
 

591
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,710
i only know of two ways of detecting if
the there's a player in the cart or if

592
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
the there's a player in the cart or if
 

593
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,150
the there's a player in the cart or if
it's an empty cart

594
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
it's an empty cart
 

595
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,190
it's an empty cart
one of them is kind of like this uh you

596
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200
one of them is kind of like this uh you
 

597
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,190
one of them is kind of like this uh you
have an iron

598
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
have an iron
 

599
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,190
have an iron
fence above the pressure plate though

600
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,200
fence above the pressure plate though
 

601
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,550
fence above the pressure plate though
and you ram the cart

602
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
and you ram the cart
 

603
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,910
and you ram the cart
into it falls down

604
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
into it falls down
 

605
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,710
into it falls down
and it will be half on the power rail

606
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
and it will be half on the power rail
 

607
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,189
and it will be half on the power rail
here

608
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
here
 

609
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,230
here
and half on the pressure plate type

610
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
and half on the pressure plate type
 

611
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,030
and half on the pressure plate type
thing

612
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
thing
 

613
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,590
thing
and if there's a player in it the stone

614
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
and if there's a player in it the stone
 

615
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,310
and if there's a player in it the stone
plate will go down

616
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
plate will go down
 

617
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,790
plate will go down
that's one way and there's different ra

618
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
that's one way and there's different ra
 

619
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,310
that's one way and there's different ra
different ways you can

620
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
different ways you can
 

621
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,310
different ways you can
use wooden and stone pressure plates

622
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320
use wooden and stone pressure plates
 

623
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,150
use wooden and stone pressure plates
the other way i know of is like this

624
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
the other way i know of is like this
 

625
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,069
the other way i know of is like this
this is something i saw in

626
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
this is something i saw in
 

627
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,350
this is something i saw in
one of pear squirrel's videos uh

628
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
one of pear squirrel's videos uh
 

629
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,230
one of pear squirrel's videos uh
this is the best one i know of just a

630
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
this is the best one i know of just a
 

631
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,269
this is the best one i know of just a
little v

632
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
little v
 

633
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,350
little v
section here and if there's

634
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
section here and if there's
 

635
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,389
section here and if there's
if it's an empty cart it goes right over

636
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
if it's an empty cart it goes right over
 

637
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,269
if it's an empty cart it goes right over
if there's a player in it

638
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279

 

639
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,870

if there's a player in it

640
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880

 

641
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,590

then it gets active so that's actually a

642
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
then it gets active so that's actually a
 

643
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,629
then it gets active so that's actually a
really good way of doing it very compact

644
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
really good way of doing it very compact
 

645
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,949
really good way of doing it very compact
the one thing i don't like about it in

646
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
the one thing i don't like about it in
 

647
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,550
the one thing i don't like about it in
pretty much

648
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
pretty much
 

649
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,310
pretty much
all designs is you have to have

650
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
all designs is you have to have
 

651
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,910
all designs is you have to have
a v or you can't do it with a street

652
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:43,920
a v or you can't do it with a street
 

653
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,310
a v or you can't do it with a street
track

654
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
track
 

655
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,150
track
and that's what i want to try to do

656
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
and that's what i want to try to do
 

657
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,910
and that's what i want to try to do
today make it work with this

658
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
today make it work with this
 

659
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,550
today make it work with this
straight track so it's seamless um

660
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
straight track so it's seamless um
 

661
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,069
straight track so it's seamless um
and i think i know how to do it but

662
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,079
and i think i know how to do it but
 

663
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,670
and i think i know how to do it but
we're going to play with idea i haven't

664
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
we're going to play with idea i haven't
 

665
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,030
we're going to play with idea i haven't
tried it yet

666
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
tried it yet
 

667
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,629
tried it yet
and i'm sorry if this has been done

668
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
and i'm sorry if this has been done
 

669
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,389
and i'm sorry if this has been done
before i don't really keep up to date

670
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
before i don't really keep up to date
 

671
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:00,870
before i don't really keep up to date
with

672
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
with
 

673
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,269
with
minecart stuff

674
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279

 

675
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,230

but the idea is we will have

676
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,240

 

677
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,269

two detector rails i don't know how far

678
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
two detector rails i don't know how far
 

679
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,269
two detector rails i don't know how far
to space them or anything we'll

680
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
to space them or anything we'll
 

681
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,870
to space them or anything we'll
i'll play around with it a bit here

682
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
i'll play around with it a bit here
 

683
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,870
i'll play around with it a bit here
maybe we'll try

684
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880

 

685
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,629

we'll try four blocks apart

686
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639

 

687
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,910

okay and we will put power rails right

688
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
okay and we will put power rails right
 

689
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,670
okay and we will put power rails right
next to them just to make sure

690
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
next to them just to make sure
 

691
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,949
next to them just to make sure
the carts go in max speed when we do

692
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
the carts go in max speed when we do
 

693
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,310
the carts go in max speed when we do
this

694
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320

 

695
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,590

um

696
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600

 

697
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,990

and we will put power rails here too i

698
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
and we will put power rails here too i
 

699
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,350
and we will put power rails here too i
guess this will be our

700
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
guess this will be our
 

701
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,350
guess this will be our
our take off

702
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360

 

703
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,389

cart will go there and the idea is

704
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
cart will go there and the idea is
 

705
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,069
cart will go there and the idea is
we can measure the time it takes the

706
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
we can measure the time it takes the
 

707
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,230
we can measure the time it takes the
cart to go from

708
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
cart to go from
 

709
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,829
cart to go from
this one to this one empty carts travel

710
00:15:59,829 --> 00:15:59,839
this one to this one empty carts travel
 

711
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,629
this one to this one empty carts travel
slower

712
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639
slower
 

713
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,509
slower
than carts with players in and we could

714
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519
than carts with players in and we could
 

715
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,509
than carts with players in and we could
potentially use this to detect furnace

716
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
potentially use this to detect furnace
 

717
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,949
potentially use this to detect furnace
mine carts too because they're even

718
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
mine carts too because they're even
 

719
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:07,990
mine carts too because they're even
slower than empty

720
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
slower than empty
 

721
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,389
slower than empty
carts generally well actually no

722
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
carts generally well actually no
 

723
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,910
carts generally well actually no
if they're boosted with a power rail i

724
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
if they're boosted with a power rail i
 

725
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,670
if they're boosted with a power rail i
think they might be the same speed but

726
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
think they might be the same speed but
 

727
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,550
think they might be the same speed but
on their own they're slow

728
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
on their own they're slow
 

729
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,990
on their own they're slow
i don't know anyway what we'll do

730
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000

 

731
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,150

one of these will have a delay

732
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160

 

733
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,590

and again i don't know what kind of

734
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
and again i don't know what kind of
 

735
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,069
and again i don't know what kind of
delay we might have to do a

736
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
delay we might have to do a
 

737
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,550
delay we might have to do a
monostable circuit here i'm not sure

738
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560

 

739
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:48,069

they'll meet and into an and gate

740
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:48,079

 

741
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,350

actually the delay should be on this one

742
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360

 

743
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,269

okay no delay there

744
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
okay no delay there
 

745
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,949
okay no delay there
and gates make some torches

746
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959

 

747
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,990

and hopefully we'll figure this out

748
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000

 

749
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,110

i like it because uh it's seamless

750
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
i like it because uh it's seamless
 

751
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,949
i like it because uh it's seamless
you just have two detector rails in your

752
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
you just have two detector rails in your
 

753
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,230
you just have two detector rails in your
track

754
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
track
 

755
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,669
track
and you don't have to make a mess of

756
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:15,679
and you don't have to make a mess of
 

757
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,990
and you don't have to make a mess of
things you can hide all this underground

758
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
things you can hide all this underground
 

759
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,350
things you can hide all this underground
probably

760
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:21,360

 

761
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,829

yeah we'll take this

762
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839

 

763
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,990

okay

764
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000

 

765
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,549

let's see what happens what happened to

766
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
let's see what happens what happened to
 

767
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,549
let's see what happens what happened to
the button

768
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
the button
 

769
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,950
the button
oh it's over here

770
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960

 

771
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,750

we will see what happens

772
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:43,760

 

773
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,590

they put the keys so close together i

774
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
they put the keys so close together i
 

775
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,430
they put the keys so close together i
tell you

776
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440

 

777
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:59,510

and we should probably power that

778
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520

 

779
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,070

one more time here we go

780
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080

 

781
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,950

okay so it didn't this didn't light up

782
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
okay so it didn't this didn't light up
 

783
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,990
okay so it didn't this didn't light up
music

784
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,000
music
 

785
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,909
music
the music box didn't play um

786
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919

 

787
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,669

and we'll just see what happens if i

788
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
and we'll just see what happens if i
 

789
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,990
and we'll just see what happens if i
ride it now if it's any different

790
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
ride it now if it's any different
 

791
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,990
ride it now if it's any different
and if it's not i'll play around with

792
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
and if it's not i'll play around with
 

793
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,230
and if it's not i'll play around with
the timings until i find the sweet spot

794
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
the timings until i find the sweet spot
 

795
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:36,230
the timings until i find the sweet spot
i guess um

796
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,240

 

797
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,990

nope okay so i'll play around with the

798
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
nope okay so i'll play around with the
 

799
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,430
nope okay so i'll play around with the
timings a little bit off camera so i

800
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,440
timings a little bit off camera so i
 

801
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,029
timings a little bit off camera so i
don't waste a whole bunch of your time

802
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
don't waste a whole bunch of your time
 

803
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,029
don't waste a whole bunch of your time
here

804
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039

 

805
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,270

all right i got it figured out is pretty

806
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
all right i got it figured out is pretty
 

807
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,950
all right i got it figured out is pretty
simple

808
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
simple
 

809
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,390
simple
i just uh made a little

810
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
i just uh made a little
 

811
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,070
i just uh made a little
test track over here this is it

812
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080

 

813
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,350

it's an and gate uh

814
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
it's an and gate uh
 

815
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,909
it's an and gate uh
except it's only one wide underneath the

816
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
except it's only one wide underneath the
 

817
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:04,710
except it's only one wide underneath the
track

818
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
track
 

819
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,950
track
and it's pretty simple

820
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
and it's pretty simple
 

821
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,470
and it's pretty simple
so here we go empty cart

822
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480

 

823
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,150

passes right over

824
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160

 

825
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,510

and if there's a player in it

826
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
and if there's a player in it
 

827
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,310
and if there's a player in it
it it detects it so it's pretty cool um

828
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
it it detects it so it's pretty cool um
 

829
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,870
it it detects it so it's pretty cool um
and yeah it's the detector rails there

830
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
and yeah it's the detector rails there
 

831
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,430
and yeah it's the detector rails there
one

832
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440
one
 

833
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,870
one
two three four five six seven eight

834
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
two three four five six seven eight
 

835
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,310
two three four five six seven eight
blocks apart

836
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
blocks apart
 

837
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,470
blocks apart
which is uh i think the closest you can

838
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,480
which is uh i think the closest you can
 

839
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,990
which is uh i think the closest you can
get this andy to fit

840
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
get this andy to fit
 

841
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,630
get this andy to fit
if it's one wide otherwise you gotta

842
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
if it's one wide otherwise you gotta
 

843
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,430
if it's one wide otherwise you gotta
build it either

844
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
build it either
 

845
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,669
build it either
a little bit to the left or right and

846
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
a little bit to the left or right and
 

847
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,590
a little bit to the left or right and
you get the outputs

848
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
you get the outputs
 

849
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,150
you get the outputs
uh from this middle block here either on

850
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
uh from this middle block here either on
 

851
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,270
uh from this middle block here either on
this side or the other one

852
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,280
this side or the other one
 

853
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,070
this side or the other one
or you could also

854
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080

 

855
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,029

wait no no that won't work never mind uh

856
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039
wait no no that won't work never mind uh
 

857
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:03,510
wait no no that won't work never mind uh
yeah

858
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520
yeah
 

859
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,230
yeah
so that's all there is to it pretty

860
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
so that's all there is to it pretty
 

861
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,430
so that's all there is to it pretty
simple

862
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
simple
 

863
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,909
simple
i like it i might use it um

864
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
i like it i might use it um
 

865
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,590
i like it i might use it um
we should try it with a storage minecart

866
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
we should try it with a storage minecart
 

867
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,909
we should try it with a storage minecart
just to make sure

868
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919
just to make sure
 

869
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,549
just to make sure
they're the same speed and wait

870
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:20,559
they're the same speed and wait
 

871
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,909
they're the same speed and wait
i knew i had one here make sure they're

872
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
i knew i had one here make sure they're
 

873
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:24,710
i knew i had one here make sure they're
the same speed

874
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
the same speed
 

875
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,830
the same speed
maybe we'll try furnace minecarts too

876
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840

 

877
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,350

and yeah i really don't do much with

878
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
and yeah i really don't do much with
 

879
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,230
and yeah i really don't do much with
mine carts

880
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,240
mine carts
 

881
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,830
mine carts
i don't know i've always had trouble

882
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:37,840
i don't know i've always had trouble
 

883
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,669
i don't know i've always had trouble
doing anything cool with them for some

884
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
doing anything cool with them for some
 

885
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,950
doing anything cool with them for some
reason

886
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960

 

887
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,149

yeah so they're just like empty ones

888
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,159
yeah so they're just like empty ones
 

889
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,710
yeah so they're just like empty ones
i'm i'm guessing the furnace minecarts

890
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
i'm i'm guessing the furnace minecarts
 

891
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,230
i'm i'm guessing the furnace minecarts
are just like empty ones

892
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
are just like empty ones
 

893
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,470
are just like empty ones
too unless they're being coal powered

894
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
too unless they're being coal powered
 

895
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:06,549
too unless they're being coal powered
on an unboosted track

896
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:06,559

 

897
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:14,710

there we go

898
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720

 

899
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,470

that was weird i wonder why i lost its

900
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
that was weird i wonder why i lost its
 

901
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,390
that was weird i wonder why i lost its
power so quick

902
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400

 

903
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,470

try it again

904
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480

 

905
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,909

it just freezes man i didn't know it did

906
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919
it just freezes man i didn't know it did
 

907
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,029
it just freezes man i didn't know it did
that

908
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,039

 

909
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,149

okay well i'll put some coal in it

910
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:40,159
okay well i'll put some coal in it
 

911
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:47,510
okay well i'll put some coal in it
um then we'll see what happens

912
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520

 

913
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,149

that's not where the coal goes oh yeah

914
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:50,159
that's not where the coal goes oh yeah
 

915
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:58,549
that's not where the coal goes oh yeah
you got to put it in your hand

916
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
you got to put it in your hand
 

917
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,110
you got to put it in your hand
all right okay so you could potentially

918
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,120
all right okay so you could potentially
 

919
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,470
all right okay so you could potentially
detect

920
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
detect
 

921
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,669
detect
three different types of carts empty

922
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:05,679
three different types of carts empty
 

923
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,510
three different types of carts empty
carts furnace carts or

924
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,520
carts furnace carts or
 

925
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,310
carts furnace carts or
carts with players in and storage carts

926
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
carts with players in and storage carts
 

927
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,710
carts with players in and storage carts
are the same as empty carts

928
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:12,720
are the same as empty carts
 

929
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,870
are the same as empty carts
so that's all there is to that i guess

930
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:16,880
so that's all there is to that i guess
 

931
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,230
so that's all there is to that i guess
you could uh probably

932
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
you could uh probably
 

933
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,950
you could uh probably
arrange those detector things closer

934
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:22,960
arrange those detector things closer
 

935
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,870
arrange those detector things closer
together too and just build the andean

936
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880
together too and just build the andean
 

937
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,830
together too and just build the andean
off to the side

938
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
off to the side
 

939
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,390
off to the side
with these two power rails here i think

940
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,400
with these two power rails here i think
 

941
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,149
with these two power rails here i think
it should work

942
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
it should work
 

943
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,190
it should work
all the time because i think these will

944
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,200
all the time because i think these will
 

945
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,270
all the time because i think these will
bring them up to max speed

946
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,280
bring them up to max speed
 

947
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,549
bring them up to max speed
and then it should be consistent

948
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:40,559
and then it should be consistent
 

949
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,830
and then it should be consistent
regardless of how many power power rails

950
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
regardless of how many power power rails
 

951
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,549
regardless of how many power power rails
and where you have them before that

952
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559

 

953
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,630

if you got rid of these and had like a

954
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
if you got rid of these and had like a
 

955
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,390
if you got rid of these and had like a
power rail over here you could

956
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
power rail over here you could
 

957
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,630
power rail over here you could
probably build this closer together too

958
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
probably build this closer together too
 

959
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,669
probably build this closer together too
and

960
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
and
 

961
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,549
and
just the timing to to make it all work

962
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:58,559
just the timing to to make it all work
 

963
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,950
just the timing to to make it all work
out the same

964
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
out the same
 

965
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,029
out the same
but yeah that's all we're going to do

966
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:03,039
but yeah that's all we're going to do
 

967
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,630
but yeah that's all we're going to do
with that today and we'll probably end

968
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
with that today and we'll probably end
 

969
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,110
with that today and we'll probably end
the episode here

970
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120
the episode here
 

971
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,870
the episode here
um it's getting late here so

972
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
um it's getting late here so
 

973
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,669
um it's getting late here so
tomorrow is the ultra hardcore series

974
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
tomorrow is the ultra hardcore series
 

975
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,390
tomorrow is the ultra hardcore series
i know you guys are loving that uh i'll

976
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
i know you guys are loving that uh i'll

i've also
 

979
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,029
i've also
recorded me playing through spellbound

980
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
recorded me playing through spellbound
 

981
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,870
recorded me playing through spellbound
caves single-player

982
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:22,880
caves single-player
 

983
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,430
caves single-player
so i'll be uploading that soon once i

984
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
so i'll be uploading that soon once i
 

985
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,470
so i'll be uploading that soon once i
need filler episodes again

986
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
need filler episodes again
 

987
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,029
need filler episodes again
that was a lot of fun it's kind of like

988
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:31,039
that was a lot of fun it's kind of like
 

989
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,230
that was a lot of fun it's kind of like
a speed run but not

990
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240
a speed run but not
 

991
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,350
a speed run but not
quite um you'll see

992
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,360
quite um you'll see
 

993
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,789
quite um you'll see
it's very action-packed i'm hoping you

994
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:38,799
it's very action-packed i'm hoping you
