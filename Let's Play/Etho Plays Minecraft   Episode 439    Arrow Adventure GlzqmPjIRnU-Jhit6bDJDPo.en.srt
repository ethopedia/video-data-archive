159
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,110
i thought this would work
wait did i do this reverse hey you

160
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
wait did i do this reverse hey you
 

161
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,229
wait did i do this reverse hey you
get out of here

162
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239

 

163
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,030

i might have done this reverse is this

164
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
i might have done this reverse is this
 

165
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,030

there now
um in in the 1.9 snapshots

208
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
um in in the 1.9 snapshots
 

209
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,349
um in in the 1.9 snapshots
i think it's redstone that's killing the

210
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
i think it's redstone that's killing the
 

211

the frame well it's not frames the the

212
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000
the frame well it's not frames the the
 

213
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,270
the frame well it's not frames the the
tick rate of the

214
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
tick rate of the
 

215
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,310
tick rate of the
the server whatever let's shut this off

216
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
the server whatever let's shut this off
 

217
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,749
the server whatever let's shut this off
notice how long it takes to lever to

218
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
notice how long it takes to lever to
 

219
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,590
notice how long it takes to lever to
switch

220
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
switch
 

221
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,110
switch
and see if it improves now

222
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120

 

223
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,390

that wasn't too bad

224
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400

 

225
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,909

oh actually it takes the redstone quite
 

227
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,629
oh actually it takes the redstone quite
a while to shut off on this lab

228
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
a while to shut off on this lab
 

229
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,990
a while to shut off on this lab
but yeah it takes the eight minute

230
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
but yeah it takes the eight minute
 

231
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,670
but yeah it takes the eight minute
potion converts it to a two minute

232
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
potion converts it to a two minute
 

233
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,150

they mean the chest there we go then we
 

237
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,629
they mean the chest there we go then we
can take these and we can make arrows

238
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
can take these and we can make arrows
 

239
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,950
can take these and we can make arrows
out of them

240
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
out of them
 

241
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,390
out of them
yeah it's still super laggy

242
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
yeah it's still super laggy
 

243
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,430
yeah it's still super laggy
um

244
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440

am going to be very sad but yeah this is
 

259
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,070
am going to be very sad but yeah this is
the new recipe so

260
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
the new recipe so
 

261
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,909
the new recipe so
eight arrows around whatever type you

262
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
eight arrows around whatever type you
 

263
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,110
eight arrows around whatever type you

want you can do it with any type of
 

265
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,070
want you can do it with any type of
lingering potion

266
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
lingering potion
 

267
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,749
lingering potion
which is pretty cool and since we got a

268
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
which is pretty cool and since we got a
 

269
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,749
which is pretty cool and since we got a
lab that auto brews stuff

270
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
lab that auto brews stuff
 

271
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,189
lab that auto brews stuff
uh these are actually pretty convenient

272
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
uh these are actually pretty convenient
 

273
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,590
uh these are actually pretty convenient
for us to make so yeah i've been trying

274
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
for us to make so yeah i've been trying
 

275
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,510
for us to make so yeah i've been trying
to figure out what practical use can we

276
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
to figure out what practical use can we
 

277
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,270
to figure out what practical use can we
get out of these tipped arrows guys

278
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
get out of these tipped arrows guys
 

279
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,790
get out of these tipped arrows guys
because honestly in like single-player

280
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
because honestly in like single-player
 

281
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,830
because honestly in like single-player

they are not the most uh beneficial
 

285
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,990

thing to the game
 

287
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,430
thing to the game
they're more for servers like where you

288
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
they're more for servers like where you
 

289
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,510
they're more for servers like where you
have more than one person or for mini

290
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
have more than one person or for mini
 

291
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,550
have more than one person or for mini
games or for

292
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
games or for
 

293
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,710
games or for
custom maps could have a lot of

294
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
custom maps could have a lot of
 

295
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,390
custom maps could have a lot of
applications for him

296
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
applications for him
 

297
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,510
applications for him
but in single-player like

298
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
but in single-player like
 

299
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,990
but in single-player like
i don't know i don't know what we'd

300
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
i don't know i don't know what we'd
 

301
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,350
i don't know i don't know what we'd
really use them for

302
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
really use them for
 

303
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,029
really use them for
um speed the swiftness ones

you'll notice we have 64 of them stacked

308
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
you'll notice we have 64 of them stacked
 

309
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,309
you'll notice we have 64 of them stacked
together here

310
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
together here

last time i did this fight you could

1264
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
last time i did this fight you could
 

1265
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,630
last time i did this fight you could
just walk up to her and melee her but it

1266
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:16,640
just walk up to her and melee her but it
 

1267
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,430
just walk up to her and melee her but it
doesn't seem to work anymore

1268
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:21,440

 

1269
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,750

so this is a oh man she keeps doing that

1270
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:27,760
so this is a oh man she keeps doing that
 

1271
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,590
so this is a oh man she keeps doing that
like i think she lands and then she

1272
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:29,600
like i think she lands and then she
 

1273
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,029
like i think she lands and then she
automatically takes off when i'm not

1274
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:31,039
automatically takes off when i'm not
 

1275
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,149
automatically takes off when i'm not
paying attention

1276
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:36,159

 

1277
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,990

that's what it is if you turn your back

1278
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,000
that's what it is if you turn your back
 

1279
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,070
that's what it is if you turn your back
on her when she's on the pedestal i

1280
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
on her when she's on the pedestal i

let's put the theory to test so we're

1286
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:47,679
let's put the theory to test so we're
 

1287
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,990
let's put the theory to test so we're
gonna turn around

1288
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
gonna turn around
 

1289
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,110

that is awesome because otherwise you

1292
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:54,480
that is awesome because otherwise you
 

1293
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,470
that is awesome because otherwise you
gotta wait for the whole thing

1294
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,480
gotta wait for the whole thing
 

1295
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,230
gotta wait for the whole thing
and that can take up to a minute

1296
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
and that can take up to a minute
 

1297
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,549
and that can take up to a minute
sometimes this has been a really long

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
where's our other one i was hoping they
 

1359
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,590
where's our other one i was hoping they
wouldn't

1360
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:25,600
wouldn't
 

1361
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,110
wouldn't
spawn side by side yeah the other one's

1362
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,120
spawn side by side yeah the other one's
 

1363
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,029
spawn side by side yeah the other one's
on the opposite end that's awesome

1364
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039
on the opposite end that's awesome
 

1365
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,149
on the opposite end that's awesome
so now i can reach some more islands

1366
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:32,159
so now i can reach some more islands
 

1367
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,669
so now i can reach some more islands
nice and conveniently cool

1368
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:35,679
nice and conveniently cool
 

1369
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,590
nice and conveniently cool
uh we kind of are running along here

1370
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:37,600
uh we kind of are running along here
 

1371
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,710
uh we kind of are running along here
though so i don't think i'm gonna go

1372
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720
though so i don't think i'm gonna go
 

1373
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,950
though so i don't think i'm gonna go
look for elytra wings today uh we'll

1374
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:40,960
look for elytra wings today uh we'll
 

1375
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,590
look for elytra wings today uh we'll
probably have to wrap it up now

1376
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,600
probably have to wrap it up now
 

1377
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,750
probably have to wrap it up now
so the comment of the day for today guys

1378
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:45,760
so the comment of the day for today guys
 

1379
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,430
so the comment of the day for today guys
is in regards to the horse breeding

1380
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:47,440
is in regards to the horse breeding
 

1381
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,789
is in regards to the horse breeding
project that we got going on here it

1382
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:48,799
project that we got going on here it
 

1383
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,710
project that we got going on here it
says etho the breeding of a better

1384
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:50,720
says etho the breeding of a better
 

1385
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,269
says etho the breeding of a better
jumper

1386
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:51,279
jumper
 

1387
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,389
jumper
is nearly impossible at this point on

1388
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:54,399
is nearly impossible at this point on
 

1389
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,310
is nearly impossible at this point on
our server we have amazing horses

1390
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,320
our server we have amazing horses
 

1391
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,789
our server we have amazing horses
this is not by breeding but by going out

1392
00:31:58,789 --> 00:31:58,799
this is not by breeding but by going out
 

1393
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,070
this is not by breeding but by going out
into the wild and testing

1394
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,080
into the wild and testing
 

1395
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,029
into the wild and testing
every horse we see we have a 5.5 jumper

1396
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:03,039
every horse we see we have a 5.5 jumper
 

1397
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,789
every horse we see we have a 5.5 jumper
those can never be bred with anything

1398
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:04,799
those can never be bred with anything
 

1399
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,590
those can never be bred with anything
other than

1400
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:05,600
other than
 

1401
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,870
other than
5.5 jumpers 15 health max same thing and

1402
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
5.5 jumpers 15 health max same thing and
 

1403
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,269
5.5 jumpers 15 health max same thing and
possibly the fastest horse in the game

1404
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:11,279
possibly the fastest horse in the game
 

1405
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,789
possibly the fastest horse in the game
but that hard to really test yes

1406
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:14,799
but that hard to really test yes
 

1407
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,430
but that hard to really test yes
point is stop breeding for better stats

1408
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:17,440
point is stop breeding for better stats
 

1409
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,269
point is stop breeding for better stats
that only works if they suck to begin

1410
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:19,279
that only works if they suck to begin
 

1411
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:19,990
that only works if they suck to begin
with go

1412
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,000
with go
 

1413
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,430
with go
and find better horses

1414
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:23,440
and find better horses
 

1415
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,350
and find better horses
all right yes that that is generally

1416
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,360
all right yes that that is generally
 

1417
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,509
all right yes that that is generally
true in my case here though

1418
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:27,519
true in my case here though
 

1419
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,029
true in my case here though
the reason we're doing this whole thing

1420
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:29,039
the reason we're doing this whole thing
 

1421
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,630
the reason we're doing this whole thing
is because

1422
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:30,640
is because
 

1423
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,070
is because
my world is about 500 gigs right now

1424
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
my world is about 500 gigs right now
 

1425
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,950
my world is about 500 gigs right now
i do not want to go explore anymore

1426
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:36,960
i do not want to go explore anymore
 

1427
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,909
i do not want to go explore anymore
unless we're

1428
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:37,919
unless we're
 

1429
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,590
unless we're
really looking for new content in the

1430
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
really looking for new content in the
 

1431
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,430
really looking for new content in the
game that was released or something

1432
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:41,440
game that was released or something
 

1433
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,669
game that was released or something
but yeah at the moment it takes forever

1434
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:43,679
but yeah at the moment it takes forever
 

1435
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,190
but yeah at the moment it takes forever
to do a backup

1436
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:45,200
to do a backup
 

1437
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,269
to do a backup
it takes forever to restore backup takes

1438
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:47,279
it takes forever to restore backup takes
 

1439
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,470
it takes forever to restore backup takes
up a lot of space to

1440
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:48,480
up a lot of space to
 

1441
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,870
up a lot of space to
to keep them all i don't want a bigger

1442
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:50,880
to keep them all i don't want a bigger
 

1443
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,950
to keep them all i don't want a bigger
world so exploring for more horses

1444
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:52,960
world so exploring for more horses
 

1445
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,750
world so exploring for more horses
is not really what i want to do we have

1446
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:55,760
is not really what i want to do we have
 

1447
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,149
is not really what i want to do we have
tried to make a passive

1448
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:58,159
tried to make a passive
 

1449
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,389
tried to make a passive
mob farm but we failed to do it because

1450
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:02,399
mob farm but we failed to do it because
 

1451
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,230
mob farm but we failed to do it because
we would have to deface the whole area

1452
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
we would have to deface the whole area
 

1453
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,430
we would have to deface the whole area
here because we'd have to remove all the

1454
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
here because we'd have to remove all the
 

1455
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,509
here because we'd have to remove all the
grass which would take forever

1456
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:07,519
grass which would take forever
 

1457
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,230
grass which would take forever
and also we have so many entities in the

1458
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,240
and also we have so many entities in the
 

1459
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,990
and also we have so many entities in the
spawn chunks that have to destroy my cow

1460
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,000
spawn chunks that have to destroy my cow
 

1461
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,870
spawn chunks that have to destroy my cow
farm

1462
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:12,880
farm
 

1463
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,710
farm
rabbit farm pig farm all the farms

1464
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:16,720
rabbit farm pig farm all the farms
 

1465
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,669
rabbit farm pig farm all the farms
in order to get any new horses to spawn

1466
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
in order to get any new horses to spawn
 

1467
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,430
in order to get any new horses to spawn
so

1468
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
so
 

1469
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,789
so
this was our last choice and

1470
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:24,799
this was our last choice and
 

1471
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,269
this was our last choice and
it is possible to get up to at least a

1472
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:27,279
it is possible to get up to at least a
 

1473
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,870
it is possible to get up to at least a
5.4 jumper

1474
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:28,880
5.4 jumper
 

1475
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,830
5.4 jumper
i'm pretty sure because how it works is

1476
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:31,840
i'm pretty sure because how it works is
 

1477
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,269
i'm pretty sure because how it works is
it takes the stats of the parents so

1478
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:33,279
it takes the stats of the parents so
 

1479
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,549
it takes the stats of the parents so
let's say

1480
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:34,559
let's say
 

1481
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,830
let's say
mama over here is a a two block high

1482
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:37,840
mama over here is a a two block high
 

1483
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,549
mama over here is a a two block high
jumper and

1484
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:38,559
jumper and
 

1485
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,190
jumper and
papa is a two block jumper so it would

1486
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,200
papa is a two block jumper so it would
 

1487
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,389
papa is a two block jumper so it would
be two plus two

1488
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:42,399
be two plus two
 

1489
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,149
be two plus two
and then it randomizes the stats of the

1490
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
and then it randomizes the stats of the
 

1491
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,669
and then it randomizes the stats of the
baby so it's going to be i think between

1492
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:45,679
baby so it's going to be i think between
 

1493
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,430
baby so it's going to be i think between
1.5 and 5.5

1494
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,440
1.5 and 5.5
 

1495
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,190
1.5 and 5.5
so let's say it is what's an easy number

1496
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,200
so let's say it is what's an easy number
 

1497
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,830
so let's say it is what's an easy number
let's say the baby random stats is a

1498
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:53,840
let's say the baby random stats is a
 

1499
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,230
let's say the baby random stats is a
five

1500
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,240
five
 

1501
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,230
five
block jumper so that would equal nine

1502
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:58,240
block jumper so that would equal nine
 

1503
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,630
block jumper so that would equal nine
and then it takes the stats of those

1504
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:00,640
and then it takes the stats of those
 

1505
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,310
and then it takes the stats of those
three divides it by

1506
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,320
three divides it by
 

1507
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,909
three divides it by
three so it would be nine divided by

1508
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:03,919
three so it would be nine divided by
 

1509
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,630
three so it would be nine divided by
three and then the baby would be a three

1510
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:06,640
three and then the baby would be a three
 

1511
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,310
three and then the baby would be a three
block jumper so that's an improvement of

1512
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,320
block jumper so that's an improvement of
 

1513
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,149
block jumper so that's an improvement of
one block

1514
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:10,159
one block
 

1515
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,629
one block
um and you keep doing that eventually

1516
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
um and you keep doing that eventually
 

1517
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,909
um and you keep doing that eventually
you get to the point where it's going to

1518
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:13,919
you get to the point where it's going to
 

1519
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,430
you get to the point where it's going to
be like a 5.4

1520
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:15,440
be like a 5.4
 

1521
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,030
be like a 5.4
plus a 5.4 and let's say the baby is a

1522
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,040
plus a 5.4 and let's say the baby is a
 

1523
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,990
plus a 5.4 and let's say the baby is a
5.5

1524
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,000
5.5
 

1525
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,430
5.5
extremely unlikely it might equal

1526
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,440
extremely unlikely it might equal
 

1527
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,349
extremely unlikely it might equal
5.5 it might round up

1528
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:27,359
5.5 it might round up
 

1529
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,750
5.5 it might round up
uh but it might just be a 5.4 at the

1530
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:29,760
uh but it might just be a 5.4 at the
 

1531
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,629
uh but it might just be a 5.4 at the
most

1532
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:30,639
most
 

1533
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,030
most
i'm not sure but it is possible that's

1534
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,040
i'm not sure but it is possible that's
 

1535
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,389
i'm not sure but it is possible that's
what i'm getting at here and we're kind

1536
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:34,399
what i'm getting at here and we're kind
 

1537
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,030
what i'm getting at here and we're kind
of doing this

1538
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,040
of doing this
 

1539
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,669
of doing this
to see how difficult it was to do that i

1540
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:37,679
to see how difficult it was to do that i
 

1541
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,310
to see how difficult it was to do that i
can say

1542
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,320
can say
 

1543
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,869
can say
like above four blocks it is extremely

1544
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:40,879
like above four blocks it is extremely
 

1545
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,790
like above four blocks it is extremely
difficult to breed a higher jumper

1546
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:42,800
difficult to breed a higher jumper
 

1547
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,589
difficult to breed a higher jumper
you have to do it many times and also to

1548
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:45,599
you have to do it many times and also to
 

1549
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,629
you have to do it many times and also to
see if it's possible to

1550
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:46,639
see if it's possible to
 

1551
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,750
see if it's possible to
to reach 5.4 5.5 whatever the

1552
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:49,760
to reach 5.4 5.5 whatever the
 

1553
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,790
to reach 5.4 5.5 whatever the
max is actually and i'm going to keep

1554
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:52,800
max is actually and i'm going to keep
 

1555
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,669
max is actually and i'm going to keep
trying

1556
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:53,679
trying
 

1557
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,589
trying
