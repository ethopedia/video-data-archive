137
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,670
wanted me to like change out the the
ground with grass and

138
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
ground with grass and
 

139
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,070
ground with grass and
and all that kind of stuff so i did it

140
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
and all that kind of stuff so i did it
 

141
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,070
and all that kind of stuff so i did it
um i also experimented with the path

142
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
um i also experimented with the path
 

143
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,470
um i also experimented with the path
blocks down the middle here which

144
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
blocks down the middle here which
 

145
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,309
blocks down the middle here which
i think is a pretty cool look we're

146
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
i think is a pretty cool look we're
 

147
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,070
i think is a pretty cool look we're
gonna we're gonna go for the details i

148
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
gonna we're gonna go for the details i
 

149
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,750
gonna we're gonna go for the details i
tried to get away with uh

150
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
tried to get away with uh
 

151
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,589
tried to get away with uh
not adding details but it sounds like a

152
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
not adding details but it sounds like a
 

153
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,150
not adding details but it sounds like a
lot of you guys want me to just do it

154
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
lot of you guys want me to just do it
 

155
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,430
lot of you guys want me to just do it
and uh long term i'll probably

156
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
and uh long term i'll probably
 

157
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,470
and uh long term i'll probably
regret it if i don't so

158
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
regret it if i don't so
 

159
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,150
regret it if i don't so
so yeah we're gonna probably widen the

160
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
so yeah we're gonna probably widen the
 

161
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,750
so yeah we're gonna probably widen the
tunnel in places a little bit like on

162
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
tunnel in places a little bit like on
 

163
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,869
tunnel in places a little bit like on
the sides here

164
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
the sides here
 

165
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,990
the sides here
so we can add a few uh random things to

166
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
so we can add a few uh random things to
 

167
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,390
so we can add a few uh random things to
it like

168
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
it like
 

169
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,750
it like
some trees maybe some little structures

170

because the idea one of the ideas with
 

253
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,390
because the idea one of the ideas with
the library was that we would uh

254
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
the library was that we would uh
 

255
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,430
the library was that we would uh
make a a place to store those

256
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
make a a place to store those
 

257
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,950
make a a place to store those
right now they're all just like in the

284
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
how did this happen all right we're good
 

285
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,550
how did this happen all right we're good
okay so let's see how should we do this

286
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
okay so let's see how should we do this
 

287
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,350
okay so let's see how should we do this
so this is going to get built up it also

288
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
so this is going to get built up it also
 

289
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,790
so this is going to get built up it also
snows here so i really want to put a

290
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
snows here so i really want to put a
 

291
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,189
snows here so i really want to put a
roof on this place because uh

292
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
roof on this place because uh
 

293
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,870
roof on this place because uh
is this going to keep snow in here no

294
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
is this going to keep snow in here no
 

295
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,469
is this going to keep snow in here no
matter how many times i remove it

296
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
matter how many times i remove it
 

297
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,670
matter how many times i remove it
there's always going to be snow on the

298
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
there's always going to be snow on the
 

299
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,950
there's always going to be snow on the
ground until we actually get a roof in

300
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
ground until we actually get a roof in
 

301
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,790
ground until we actually get a roof in
here

302
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
here
 

303
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,310
here
uh maybe we will do

304
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
uh maybe we will do
 

305
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,350
uh maybe we will do
sections for chess like a little

306
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360

 

307
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,950

little like three wide sections maybe

308
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
little like three wide sections maybe
 

309
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,990
little like three wide sections maybe
so we'll do this and actually

310
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
so we'll do this and actually
 

311
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,870
so we'll do this and actually
maybe we should start here all right

312
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
maybe we should start here all right
 

313
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,230
maybe we should start here all right
let's try to figure this out

314
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
let's try to figure this out
 

315
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,990
let's try to figure this out
we'll just put down a big floor here for

316
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
we'll just put down a big floor here for
 

317
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,070
we'll just put down a big floor here for
right now let me put carpet over top

318
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
right now let me put carpet over top
 

319
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,550
right now let me put carpet over top
this or something else later

320
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
this or something else later
 

321
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,110
this or something else later
how is this going to meet up so i feel

322
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
how is this going to meet up so i feel
 

323
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,990
how is this going to meet up so i feel
like we need

324
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000

 

325
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,029

we need to have another post over here

326
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
we need to have another post over here
 

327
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,469
we need to have another post over here
okay i think what we'll do here i'm

328
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
okay i think what we'll do here i'm
 

329
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,550
okay i think what we'll do here i'm
going to try put in a window on the side

330
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
going to try put in a window on the side
 

331
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,469
going to try put in a window on the side
here i kind of want this to be the edge

332
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
here i kind of want this to be the edge
 

333
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,749
here i kind of want this to be the edge
of the building i don't want it to get

334
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
of the building i don't want it to get
 

335

any bigger
 

337
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,830
any bigger
because it's already a little bit on the

338
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
because it's already a little bit on the
 

339
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,909
because it's already a little bit on the
big side

340
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
big side
 

341
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,070
big side
and it's so easy just to just keep going

342
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
and it's so easy just to just keep going
 

343
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,710
and it's so easy just to just keep going
but every block you add is so much more

344
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
but every block you add is so much more
 

345
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,670
but every block you add is so much more
work

346
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
work
 

347
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,590
work
so i want to like end this building now

348
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600

consistent so we got oak on the border
 

371
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,629
consistent so we got oak on the border
and then light gray for the window

372
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639

and can i do it while falling
no i missed it i tried okay

378
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
no i missed it i tried okay
 

379
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,270
no i missed it i tried okay
i don't know how tall this building is

380
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
i don't know how tall this building is
 

381
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,670
i don't know how tall this building is
gonna be just yet so i'm not gonna

382
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
gonna be just yet so i'm not gonna
 

383
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,670
gonna be just yet so i'm not gonna
tap it off just yet uh let's do this

384
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
tap it off just yet uh let's do this
 

385
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,070
tap it off just yet uh let's do this
make this go up then and now we know

386
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
make this go up then and now we know
 

387
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,749
make this go up then and now we know
where this post is i kind of wanted to

388
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
where this post is i kind of wanted to
 

389
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,589
where this post is i kind of wanted to
figure this out

390
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
figure this out
 

391
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,070
figure this out
so if that post is there let's go every

392
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
so if that post is there let's go every
 

393
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,790
so if that post is there let's go every
third block maybe

394
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
third block maybe
 

395
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,629
third block maybe
so something like this there'll be one

396
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
so something like this there'll be one
 

397
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,230
so something like this there'll be one
section here

398
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
section here
 

399
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,670
section here
go again do another section here

400
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
go again do another section here
 

401
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,270
go again do another section here
and then we got kind of got to curve it

402
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
and then we got kind of got to curve it
 

403
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,110
and then we got kind of got to curve it
around

404
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
around
 

405
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,029
around
so could we do this

406
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
so could we do this
 

407
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,469
so could we do this
and maybe we'll stagger them oh but then

408
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
and maybe we'll stagger them oh but then
 

409
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,110
and maybe we'll stagger them oh but then
it's only two wide here

410
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120

 

411
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,469

that's no good okay what if we

412
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
that's no good okay what if we
 

413
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,670
that's no good okay what if we
do it like this then

414
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
do it like this then
 

415
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,510
do it like this then
i'm imagining something i just realized

416
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
i'm imagining something i just realized
 

417
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,670
i'm imagining something i just realized
you can't see what i'm imagining

418
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
you can't see what i'm imagining
 

419
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,830
you can't see what i'm imagining
and my commentary on this is terrible

420
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
and my commentary on this is terrible
 

421
00:07:51,840 --> 00:08:05,589
and my commentary on this is terrible
isn't it okay

422
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599

 

423
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,270

yeah this is what i had in mind here so

424
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
yeah this is what i had in mind here so
 

425
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,189
yeah this is what i had in mind here so
we have four sections of chess

426
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
we have four sections of chess
 

427
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,350
we have four sections of chess
six chests in each these are trap chests

428
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
six chests in each these are trap chests
 

429
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,309
six chests in each these are trap chests
in the middle so they

430
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
in the middle so they
 

431
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,830
in the middle so they
they go together that's 24 right

432
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
they go together that's 24 right
 

433
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,150
they go together that's 24 right
and then we're gonna mirror this onto

434
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
and then we're gonna mirror this onto
 

435
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,390
and then we're gonna mirror this onto
that side over there when we build it

436
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
that side over there when we build it
 

437
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,029
that side over there when we build it
so in total that's that's uh what is it

438
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
so in total that's that's uh what is it
 

439
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,990
so in total that's that's uh what is it
48

440
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
48
 

441
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,830
48

479
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,829
yeah so i think what we'll do is kind of
break it up out like this every 10

506
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
300 310 so then we'll start 320 at the
 

507
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,310
300 310 so then we'll start 320 at the
bottom here

508
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
bottom here
 

509
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,150
bottom here
320. i think it's better to do it

510
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
320. i think it's better to do it
 

511
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,150
320. i think it's better to do it
horizontal like this instead of like

512
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
horizontal like this instead of like
 

513
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,470
horizontal like this instead of like
200 210 220 230 i like it more like this

514
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
200 210 220 230 i like it more like this

i don't think everybody's gonna like it
though i might not like it either

646
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
though i might not like it either
 

647
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,870
though i might not like it either
we'll see um but i have an idea for a

648
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
we'll see um but i have an idea for a

651
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,670
statue
i feel like it should be something that

652
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
i feel like it should be something that
 

653
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,430
i feel like it should be something that
stands out a little bit this might stand

654
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
stands out a little bit this might stand
 

655
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,310
stands out a little bit this might stand
out a little too much we'll see

656
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
out a little too much we'll see
 

657
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,430
out a little too much we'll see
and bam so there we go

658
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
and bam so there we go
 

659
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,590
