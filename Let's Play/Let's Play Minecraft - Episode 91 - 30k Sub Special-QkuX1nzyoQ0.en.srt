00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:25,940
last-minute adjustments here but this
 

177
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,390
last-minute adjustments here but this
has all been tested before spaz jr.

178
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
has all been tested before spaz jr.
 

179
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,969
has all been tested before spaz jr.
there's nothing to worry about there we

180
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:33,979
there's nothing to worry about there we
 

181
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:38,170
there's nothing to worry about there we
go so we should be ready here engines

182
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,180
go so we should be ready here engines
 

183
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,969
go so we should be ready here engines
are ready you're ready I'm ready let's

184
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:41,979
are ready you're ready I'm ready let's
 

185
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:47,709
are ready you're ready I'm ready let's
do this so we'll do a t-minus countdown

186
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:47,719
do this so we'll do a t-minus countdown
 

187
00:05:47,719 --> 00:06:03,459
do this so we'll do a t-minus countdown
t-minus three two one blast-off well

188
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:03,469
t-minus three two one blast-off well
 

189
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:05,800
t-minus three two one blast-off well
guys I don't think spaz jr. made it to

190
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:05,810
guys I don't think spaz jr. made it to
 

191
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,219
guys I don't think spaz jr. made it to
space after all he only flew about 10

192
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:09,229
space after all he only flew about 10
 

193
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:13,689
space after all he only flew about 10
blocks up so he wasn't even close he's a

194
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:13,699
blocks up so he wasn't even close he's a
 

195
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:18,450
blocks up so he wasn't even close he's a
trooper though he tried oh how he tried

196
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:18,460
trooper though he tried oh how he tried
 

197
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,730
trooper though he tried oh how he tried
so that's kind of a problem all my

198
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:21,740
so that's kind of a problem all my
 

199
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,820
so that's kind of a problem all my
vertical cannons are gonna have I sense

200
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:24,830
vertical cannons are gonna have I sense
 

201
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,010
vertical cannons are gonna have I sense
the 1.6 patch he just can't really get

202
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,020
the 1.6 patch he just can't really get
 

203
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,950
the 1.6 patch he just can't really get
much height out of the TNT blast

204
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:29,960
much height out of the TNT blast
 

205
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,370
much height out of the TNT blast
is the problem so even I played around

206
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:33,380
is the problem so even I played around
 

207
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,529
is the problem so even I played around
us that this is a vertical cannon design

208
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:35,539
us that this is a vertical cannon design
 

209
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:39,670
us that this is a vertical cannon design
I tried and it works pretty good all for

210
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
I tried and it works pretty good all for
 

211
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,159
I tried and it works pretty good all for
T and T in it end up where this water is

212
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:42,169
T and T in it end up where this water is
 

213
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:45,809
T and T in it end up where this water is
so it's got a lot of power packed into

214
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:45,819
so it's got a lot of power packed into
 

215
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:51,339
so it's got a lot of power packed into
one spot close to the missile and yet

216
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:51,349
one spot close to the missile and yet
 

217
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:52,900
one spot close to the missile and yet
you know you still don't get very much

218
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:52,910
you know you still don't get very much
 

219
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,540
you know you still don't get very much
height with it

220
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:54,550
height with it
 

221
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:04,629
height with it
so check it out those it's good it's

222
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
so check it out those it's good it's
 

223
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,360
so check it out those it's good it's
nice but really you know what guys we've

224
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,370
nice but really you know what guys we've
 

225
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,159
nice but really you know what guys we've
seen the cannons we need something

226
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:09,169
seen the cannons we need something
 

227
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:11,320
seen the cannons we need something
different because for one thing I don't

228
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,330
different because for one thing I don't
 

229
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,830
different because for one thing I don't
feel like fixing all of these so I'm not

230
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840
feel like fixing all of these so I'm not
 

231
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,290
feel like fixing all of these so I'm not
going to and the other main problem I

232
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:17,300
going to and the other main problem I
 

233
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,939
going to and the other main problem I
had with these cannons besides them

234
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:18,949
had with these cannons besides them
 

235
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:21,310
had with these cannons besides them
taking a long time to build and then

236
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:21,320
taking a long time to build and then
 

237
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,999
taking a long time to build and then

being very repetitive I they used a lot
 

239
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:27,850
being very repetitive I they used a lot
of redstone and I kind of want to save

240
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:27,860
of redstone and I kind of want to save
 

241
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,210
of redstone and I kind of want to save
my redstone for other projects so we're

242
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:31,220
my redstone for other projects so we're
 

243

focus on this episode we're gonna be
starting a Rube Goldberg machine I hope

250
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
starting a Rube Goldberg machine I hope
 

251
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,080
starting a Rube Goldberg machine I hope
I said that right a Rube Goldberg

252
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,090
I said that right a Rube Goldberg
 

253
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,990
I said that right a Rube Goldberg
machine in Minecraft is basically just a

254
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
machine in Minecraft is basically just a
 

255
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,350
machine in Minecraft is basically just a
big set of chain reactions that looks

256
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
big set of chain reactions that looks
 

257
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,300
big set of chain reactions that looks
very cool when it's all done so the plan

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,110
of money doing Minecraft videos now so
 

337
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,800
of money doing Minecraft videos now so
I'm happy about that and it's because of

338
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:53,810
I'm happy about that and it's because of

you guys so thank you anyway we are
 

341
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,040
you guys so thank you anyway we are
going to look for a location for our RGB

342
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,050
going to look for a location for our RGB
 

343
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,730
going to look for a location for our RGB
machine and then we will start building

344
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:03,740
machine and then we will start building
 

345
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,510
machine and then we will start building
it today hopefully and maybe I doubt

346
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:07,520
it today hopefully and maybe I doubt
 

347
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,310
it today hopefully and maybe I doubt
we'll finish it today probably won't

348
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:09,320
we'll finish it today probably won't
 

349
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,720
we'll finish it today probably won't
even come close to finishing it but

350
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:10,730
even come close to finishing it but
 

351
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,120
even come close to finishing it but
we'll we'll start it that way I'll be

352
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,130
we'll we'll start it that way I'll be
 

353
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,730
we'll we'll start it that way I'll be
encouraged to work on it okay so I'm

354
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:15,740
encouraged to work on it okay so I'm
 

355
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,560
encouraged to work on it okay so I'm
gonna look for a location and we will be

356
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:17,570
gonna look for a location and we will be
 

357
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,510
gonna look for a location and we will be
back okay I think I found a pretty good

358
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:22,520
back okay I think I found a pretty good
 

359
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,780
back okay I think I found a pretty good
location over here are all right

360
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:25,790
location over here are all right
 

361
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,880
location over here are all right
vertical cannons are just over there you

362
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:27,890
vertical cannons are just over there you
 

363
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,410
vertical cannons are just over there you
can barely see them from here

364
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:29,420
can barely see them from here
 

365
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,260
can barely see them from here
and we have this big flat area over here

366
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:34,270
and we have this big flat area over here
 

367
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,450
and we have this big flat area over here
this was kind of a wasteland in my

368
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:37,460
this was kind of a wasteland in my
 

369
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,130
this was kind of a wasteland in my
opinion I wasn't gonna build anything

370
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:39,140
opinion I wasn't gonna build anything
 

371
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,800
opinion I wasn't gonna build anything
here but you know it's pretty good flat

372
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:41,810
here but you know it's pretty good flat
 

373
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,780
here but you know it's pretty good flat
land for projects like this and we have

374
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:46,790
land for projects like this and we have
 

375
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,790
land for projects like this and we have
lots of hills around to which we might

376
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
lots of hills around to which we might
 

377
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,720
lots of hills around to which we might
make use of so I think all this area

378
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:52,730
make use of so I think all this area
 

379
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,910
make use of so I think all this area
here is pretty

380
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
here is pretty
 

381
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,690
here is pretty
for this thing and our location is

382
00:10:59,690 --> 00:10:59,700
for this thing and our location is
 

383
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,269
for this thing and our location is
pretty far away from chocolate islands

384
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:02,279
pretty far away from chocolate islands
 

385
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,990
pretty far away from chocolate islands
so should be a good spot and that's the

386
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
so should be a good spot and that's the
 

387
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,759
so should be a good spot and that's the
360 cannon just over there so yeah I

388
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:10,769
360 cannon just over there so yeah I
 

389
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,769
360 cannon just over there so yeah I
think I want to start a start up base

390
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:12,779
think I want to start a start up base
 

391
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,379
think I want to start a start up base
camp here and maybe start building it a

392
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:15,389
camp here and maybe start building it a
 

393
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:19,069
camp here and maybe start building it a
little bit and then I'll see you guys

394
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:19,079
little bit and then I'll see you guys
 

395
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:25,040
little bit and then I'll see you guys
again then so I've started to get

396
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,050
again then so I've started to get
 

397
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,710
again then so I've started to get
settled down here you've got a little

398
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:27,720
settled down here you've got a little
 

399
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,019
settled down here you've got a little
base camp set up here and I have been

400
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:30,029
base camp set up here and I have been
 

401
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:35,300
base camp set up here and I have been
working on the very first part of the

402
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:35,310
working on the very first part of the
 

403
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,620
working on the very first part of the
RGB machine this is one of the coolest

404
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:39,630
RGB machine this is one of the coolest
 

405
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:48,290
RGB machine this is one of the coolest
sand cannons I've ever built so whoever

406
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:48,300
sand cannons I've ever built so whoever
 

407
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,389
sand cannons I've ever built so whoever
gets this piece is going to be one lucky

408
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
gets this piece is going to be one lucky
 

409
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,290
gets this piece is going to be one lucky
bugger because I'm having a huge trouble

410
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,300
bugger because I'm having a huge trouble
 

411
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,199
bugger because I'm having a huge trouble
getting it to work well because the sand

412
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:57,209
getting it to work well because the sand
 

413
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:01,759
getting it to work well because the sand
keeps getting launched differently every

414
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:01,769
keeps getting launched differently every
 

415
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:09,620
keeps getting launched differently every
time so it's hard to it's hard to figure

416
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:09,630
time so it's hard to it's hard to figure
 

417
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,240
time so it's hard to it's hard to figure
out where the sands gonna end up after

418
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,250
out where the sands gonna end up after
 

419
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,400
out where the sands gonna end up after
you shoot it I tried to build a net up

420
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,410
you shoot it I tried to build a net up
 

421
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,970
you shoot it I tried to build a net up
there to catch it yeah ah I'm talking

422
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:18,980
there to catch it yeah ah I'm talking
 

423
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:28,160
there to catch it yeah ah I'm talking
but it's not working so well oh cool

424
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,170
but it's not working so well oh cool
 

425
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,949
but it's not working so well oh cool
alright that's the first time it worked

426
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
alright that's the first time it worked
 

427
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,200
alright that's the first time it worked
now if you do the same shot guess what

428
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,210

 

429
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:44,350

probably totally miss it so to build

430
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:44,360
probably totally miss it so to build
 

431
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,410
probably totally miss it so to build
this RGB machine I need to do a lot of

432
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:47,420
this RGB machine I need to do a lot of
 

433
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,320
this RGB machine I need to do a lot of
world backed ups and figure out exactly

434
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,330
world backed ups and figure out exactly
 

435
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,190
world backed ups and figure out exactly
how I want to build each piece and then

436
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:54,200
how I want to build each piece and then
 

437
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,500
how I want to build each piece and then
back up the work like loader back up and

438
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:56,510
back up the work like loader back up and
 

439
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:05,290
back up the work like loader back up and
actually put it into the world okay it's

440
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:05,300
actually put it into the world okay it's
 

441
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,940
actually put it into the world okay it's
working significantly better right now

442
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:08,950
working significantly better right now
 

443
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,500
working significantly better right now
first time I shot it totally missed the

444
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:11,510
first time I shot it totally missed the
 

445
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:19,600
first time I shot it totally missed the
net somehow and I have to have a net

446
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:19,610
net somehow and I have to have a net
 

447
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,800
net somehow and I have to have a net
because if I don't the sand gets blown

448
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:22,810
because if I don't the sand gets blown
 

449
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,380
because if I don't the sand gets blown
way up in the sky and it actually gets

450
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:26,390
way up in the sky and it actually gets
 

451
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,079
way up in the sky and it actually gets
destroyed in the sky because apparently

452
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:29,089
destroyed in the sky because apparently
 

453
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:32,260
destroyed in the sky because apparently
there's a time limit on how far or how

454
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,270
there's a time limit on how far or how
 

455
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:38,860
there's a time limit on how far or how
long sand can fly for and I once the

456
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:38,870
long sand can fly for and I once the
 

457
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,480
long sand can fly for and I once the
sand passes that time limit it just

458
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:40,490
sand passes that time limit it just
 

459
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,310
sand passes that time limit it just
turns into a block like this in midair

460
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
turns into a block like this in midair
 

461
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,010
turns into a block like this in midair
instead of being a moving in to D block

462
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:48,020
instead of being a moving in to D block
 

463
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:58,810
instead of being a moving in to D block
or whatever try it again okay so that

464
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:58,820
or whatever try it again okay so that
 

465
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:05,230
or whatever try it again okay so that
net may just worked after all

466
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,240

 

467
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,270

of course I don't have to use all that

468
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:08,280
of course I don't have to use all that
 

469
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,620
of course I don't have to use all that
TNT probably be easier to control if I

470
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:12,630
TNT probably be easier to control if I
 

471
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:26,060
TNT probably be easier to control if I
don't this is a very cool sand cannon

472
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,070
don't this is a very cool sand cannon
 

473
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,900
don't this is a very cool sand cannon
I'm very happy with this design it's set

474
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:29,910
I'm very happy with this design it's set
 

475
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:34,100
I'm very happy with this design it's set
at 40 ticks I killed you already get

476
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,110
at 40 ticks I killed you already get
 

477
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,450
at 40 ticks I killed you already get
lost and this is the sand block is

478
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:38,460
lost and this is the sand block is
 

479
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,850
lost and this is the sand block is
offset by one from the center of this

480
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:40,860
offset by one from the center of this
 

481
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,580
offset by one from the center of this
pool and it falls two blocks that's

482
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:46,590
pool and it falls two blocks that's
 

483
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:50,720
pool and it falls two blocks that's
exactly how I have it Dale one last try

484
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:50,730
exactly how I have it Dale one last try
 

485
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,910
exactly how I have it Dale one last try
this works all using that the plan is to

486
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
this works all using that the plan is to
 

487
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,700
this works all using that the plan is to
make this sand then fall on either a

488
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:58,710
make this sand then fall on either a
 

489
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,490
make this sand then fall on either a
pressure plate or have it block off a

490
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:01,500
pressure plate or have it block off a
 

491
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,740
pressure plate or have it block off a
water stream to start the next reaction

492
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:05,750
water stream to start the next reaction
 

493
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:11,030
water stream to start the next reaction
chain reaction whatever I need to figure

494
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
chain reaction whatever I need to figure
 

495
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,530
chain reaction whatever I need to figure
out exactly where the sands gonna land

496
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:12,540
out exactly where the sands gonna land
 

497
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:19,210
out exactly where the sands gonna land
to do that see that wasn't good hmmm

498
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:19,220
to do that see that wasn't good hmmm
 

499
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,920
to do that see that wasn't good hmmm
okay I'll play around with it a bit more

500
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:21,930
okay I'll play around with it a bit more
 

501
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:27,080
okay I'll play around with it a bit more
see you soon okay I think I got this

502
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,090
see you soon okay I think I got this
 

503
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,540
see you soon okay I think I got this
first chain reaction figure it out here

504
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:29,550
first chain reaction figure it out here
 

505
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:37,830
first chain reaction figure it out here
I'm gonna have water now over here

506
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:37,840

 

507
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,140

and I've been practicing and practicing

508
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,150
and I've been practicing and practicing
 

509
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,230
and I've been practicing and practicing
with that sand can and I think I finally

510
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,240
with that sand can and I think I finally
 

511
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,850
with that sand can and I think I finally
figured out something that's fairly

512
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:44,860
figured out something that's fairly
 

513
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,620
figured out something that's fairly
accurate something I can expect to work

514
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:49,630
accurate something I can expect to work
 

515
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,990
accurate something I can expect to work
every time pretty much so I'm only using

516
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,000
every time pretty much so I'm only using
 

517
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,650
every time pretty much so I'm only using
three TNT now loaded in the back and

518
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:01,660
three TNT now loaded in the back and
 

519
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:09,480
three TNT now loaded in the back and
what happens is light it is the sand

520
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:09,490
what happens is light it is the sand
 

521
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:14,120
what happens is light it is the sand
block to the water blocks of water

522
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,130
block to the water blocks of water
 

523
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,560
block to the water blocks of water
causes the water at an update and it

524
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:16,570
causes the water at an update and it
 

525
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,750
causes the water at an update and it
realizes it can go this way instead of

526
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:18,760
realizes it can go this way instead of
 

527
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,930
realizes it can go this way instead of
this way so when it does that I can

528
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:21,940
this way so when it does that I can
 

529
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,829
this way so when it does that I can
start a new chain reaction here make the

530
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:25,839
start a new chain reaction here make the
 

531
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,760
start a new chain reaction here make the
water hit something and we can make it

532
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:29,770
water hit something and we can make it
 

533
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:36,720
water hit something and we can make it
keep going alright so the first piece of

534
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:36,730
keep going alright so the first piece of
 

535
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,079
keep going alright so the first piece of
the RGB machine is done it's the sand

536
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:40,089
the RGB machine is done it's the sand
 

537
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:44,190
the RGB machine is done it's the sand
cannon it shoots the sand block to this

538
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:44,200
cannon it shoots the sand block to this
 

539
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,640
cannon it shoots the sand block to this
water stream here this is the second

540
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:47,650
water stream here this is the second
 

541
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,100
water stream here this is the second
piece

542
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,110
piece
 

543
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:55,410
piece
we've got built so far so the sand will

544
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:55,420
we've got built so far so the sand will
 

545
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,100
we've got built so far so the sand will
land about here water will switch to the

546
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,110
land about here water will switch to the
 

547
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,030
land about here water will switch to the
side and it will destroy this torch when

548
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
side and it will destroy this torch when
 

549
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,550
side and it will destroy this torch when
it does that the torch will flow in the

550
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:05,560
it does that the torch will flow in the
 

551
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,730
it does that the torch will flow in the
newly created water stream to this

552
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:08,740
newly created water stream to this
 

553
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,550
newly created water stream to this
pressure plate here which will activate

554
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:11,560
pressure plate here which will activate
 

555
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,100
pressure plate here which will activate
this piston which is going to start our

556
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,110
this piston which is going to start our
 

557
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:18,210
this piston which is going to start our
third piece basically everybody that has

558
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:18,220
third piece basically everybody that has
 

559
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,179
third piece basically everybody that has
donated will get will each get one of

560
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:21,189
donated will get will each get one of
 

561
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:22,620
donated will get will each get one of
these pieces they'll have their name on

562
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:22,630
these pieces they'll have their name on
 

563
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,130
these pieces they'll have their name on
it

564
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:23,140
it
 

565
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,110
it
I'll put signs on each piece for each

566
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
I'll put signs on each piece for each
 

567
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,140
I'll put signs on each piece for each
donor and I'll do it kind of randomly I

568
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,150
donor and I'll do it kind of randomly I
 

569
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,330
donor and I'll do it kind of randomly I
know some pieces will be better than

570
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:30,340
know some pieces will be better than
 

571
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,590
know some pieces will be better than
others but you know not playing

572
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:34,600
others but you know not playing
 

573
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,640
others but you know not playing
favorites or anything okay so this third

574
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:38,650
favorites or anything okay so this third
 

575
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,270
favorites or anything okay so this third
step what I'm gonna do is when the

576
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:42,280
step what I'm gonna do is when the
 

577
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,610
step what I'm gonna do is when the
pressure plates above here gets

578
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:44,620
pressure plates above here gets
 

579
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:51,140
pressure plates above here gets
activated it powers the piston below

580
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,150

 

581
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:56,400

oops well whatever same thing and it

582
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,410
oops well whatever same thing and it
 

583
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,200
oops well whatever same thing and it
pressure plate gets uprooted and ends up

584
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,210
pressure plate gets uprooted and ends up
 

585
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,260
pressure plate gets uprooted and ends up
top there oh I've got a pretty cool idea

586
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,270
top there oh I've got a pretty cool idea
 

587
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,580
top there oh I've got a pretty cool idea
of what I'm going to do for this third

588
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:08,590
of what I'm going to do for this third
 

589
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:16,860
of what I'm going to do for this third
piece I'm gonna have woodblock pressure

590
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:16,870
piece I'm gonna have woodblock pressure
 

591
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:22,110
piece I'm gonna have woodblock pressure
plate it's gonna spiral up it's gonna be

592
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,120
plate it's gonna spiral up it's gonna be
 

593
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:29,340
plate it's gonna spiral up it's gonna be
a piston under this one piston under

594
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:29,350
a piston under this one piston under
 

595
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,210
a piston under this one piston under
here and we're just gonna keep spiraling

596
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:33,220
here and we're just gonna keep spiraling
 

597
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,700
here and we're just gonna keep spiraling
up a few times anyway till I feel it's

598
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:38,710
up a few times anyway till I feel it's
 

599
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:53,520
up a few times anyway till I feel it's
enough okay try yeah try get this going

600
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:53,530
enough okay try yeah try get this going
 

601
00:18:53,530 --> 00:19:01,310
enough okay try yeah try get this going
here so that will go up and we'll have

602
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:01,320

 

603
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:24,880

glass block here and there

604
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:24,890

 

605
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,780

now I'm building this the wrong way I

606
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:28,790
now I'm building this the wrong way I
 

607
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:32,260
now I'm building this the wrong way I
hate breaking glass but oh well

608
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:32,270
hate breaking glass but oh well
 

609
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:38,090
hate breaking glass but oh well
yes I want to glass block there don't

610
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:38,100
yes I want to glass block there don't
 

611
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,620
yes I want to glass block there don't
need it there you'll see this is going

612
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:42,630
need it there you'll see this is going
 

613
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:54,320
need it there you'll see this is going
to be cool glass there like this and

614
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,330
to be cool glass there like this and
 

615
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,920
to be cool glass there like this and
then we'll have a water stream in here

616
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:57,930
then we'll have a water stream in here
 

617
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,900
then we'll have a water stream in here
which will be held by that pressure

618
00:19:59,900 --> 00:19:59,910
which will be held by that pressure
 

619
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:07,040
which will be held by that pressure
plate there J and then next step same

620
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,050
plate there J and then next step same
 

621
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:14,080
plate there J and then next step same
thing

622
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,090

 

623
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,150

nope did that wrong yeah I'll come back

624
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:17,160
nope did that wrong yeah I'll come back
 

625
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,490
nope did that wrong yeah I'll come back
to this in a second

626
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:21,500

 

627
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,080

cool I got the three pieces done now

628
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,090
cool I got the three pieces done now
 

629
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,550
cool I got the three pieces done now
although I might have to rip out this

630
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:28,560
although I might have to rip out this
 

631
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,740
although I might have to rip out this
one I just added because it doesn't seem

632
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:30,750
one I just added because it doesn't seem
 

633
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,700
one I just added because it doesn't seem
to be working quite like I want it to

634
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:33,710
to be working quite like I want it to
 

635
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,670
to be working quite like I want it to
doesn't seem to always work is the

636
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:37,680
doesn't seem to always work is the
 

637
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,300
doesn't seem to always work is the
problem another thing I found is I have
