all around and this stone pressure plate
 

105
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:04,339
all around and this stone pressure plate
underneath this carts so we have two

106
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:04,349
underneath this carts so we have two
 

107
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:06,680

there and then this is the well let's

110
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,210
there and then this is the well let's
 

111
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,649
there and then this is the well let's
let's look at it run from in here that's

112
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:18,659
let's look at it run from in here that's

this one goes around so that's how that

120
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,000
this one goes around so that's how that
 

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,589
this one goes around so that's how that
works

122
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:39,599
works
 

123
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:42,110
works
then over here I have a little hole to

124
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,120
then over here I have a little hole to
 

125
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,610
then over here I have a little hole to
go down and there's a redstone torch

126
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:45,620
go down and there's a redstone torch
 

127
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,490
go down and there's a redstone torch
underneath the door directly and then I

128
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:52,500
underneath the door directly and then I
 

129
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,790
underneath the door directly and then I
have a kind of like a hybrid and eat

130
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:55,800
have a kind of like a hybrid and eat
 

131
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:04,490
have a kind of like a hybrid and eat
here there's two wires here yeah

132
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:04,500
here there's two wires here yeah
 

133
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,379
here there's two wires here yeah
first ones over here there's one

134
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:06,389
first ones over here there's one
 

135
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:08,210
first ones over here there's one
pressure plate directly above this one

136
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:08,220
pressure plate directly above this one
 

137
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,820
pressure plate directly above this one
the the Mies and that heads to a

138
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:13,830
the the Mies and that heads to a
 

139
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,330
the the Mies and that heads to a
repeater with the four delay goes down

140
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:17,340
repeater with the four delay goes down
 

141
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,629
repeater with the four delay goes down
another repeater with the four delay

142
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
another repeater with the four delay
 

143
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,089
another repeater with the four delay
and it goes to this redstone torch here

144
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:25,099
and it goes to this redstone torch here
 

145
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,589
and it goes to this redstone torch here
the other pressure plate is directly

146
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:27,599
the other pressure plate is directly
 

147
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:33,129
the other pressure plate is directly
above here and it goes to the torch and

148
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:33,139
above here and it goes to the torch and
 

149
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:38,659
above here and it goes to the torch and
then it goes to the door so all you need

150
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:38,669
then it goes to the door so all you need
 

151
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:43,520
then it goes to the door so all you need
is like an and eight and you need two

152
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:43,530
is like an and eight and you need two
 

153
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:49,719
is like an and eight and you need two
repeaters for the Mies pressure plate

154
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:49,729
repeaters for the Mies pressure plate
 

155
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:54,200
repeaters for the Mies pressure plate
and that what this is doing the reason

156
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,210
and that what this is doing the reason
 

157
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,879
and that what this is doing the reason
for the delay is just to give the

158
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:55,889
for the delay is just to give the
 

159
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:00,080
for the delay is just to give the
pressure plate because you go instantly

160
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,090
pressure plate because you go instantly
 

161
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,670
pressure plate because you go instantly
from one to the other so both are

162
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
from one to the other so both are
 

163
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,390
from one to the other so both are
pressed down at the same time and so

164
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,400
pressed down at the same time and so
 

165
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,709
pressed down at the same time and so
what you're doing is you're just giving

166
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:06,719
what you're doing is you're just giving
 

167
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,990
what you're doing is you're just giving
it enough time for what the pressure

168
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,000
it enough time for what the pressure
 

169
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,800
it enough time for what the pressure
plate you hop from to go back up and

170
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:11,810
plate you hop from to go back up and
 

171
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,279
plate you hop from to go back up and
that's what the delay is for just a

172
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:16,289
that's what the delay is for just a
 

173
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:18,769
that's what the delay is for just a
short delay I found four torches wasn't

174
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:18,779
short delay I found four torches wasn't
 

175
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:21,379
short delay I found four torches wasn't
enough of a delay so you need I think

176
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:21,389
enough of a delay so you need I think
 

177
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,689
enough of a delay so you need I think
five or six and I just have it set at

178
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:23,699
five or six and I just have it set at
 

179
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:31,219
five or six and I just have it set at
eight here to be sure yeah so that's

180
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:31,229
eight here to be sure yeah so that's
 

181
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,619
eight here to be sure yeah so that's
that but there's a new patch coming out

182
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:33,629
that but there's a new patch coming out
 

183
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:37,749
that but there's a new patch coming out
with boosters properly implemented so

184
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
with boosters properly implemented so
 

185
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,969
with boosters properly implemented so
not sure how useful any of this will be

186
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:42,979

 

187
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:46,909

don't maybe runaway minecart now it

188
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:46,919
don't maybe runaway minecart now it
 

189
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,649
don't maybe runaway minecart now it

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:40,380
try finish up this cannon before we do
 

271
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,809
try finish up this cannon before we do
anything else in my LP plan is to finish

272

anything else in my LP plan is to finish
 

273
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:51,050
anything else in my LP plan is to finish
this up and have a few test launches and

274
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,060
this up and have a few test launches and
 

275
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,829
this up and have a few test launches and
then then I'm gonna build another 360

276
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:54,839
then then I'm gonna build another 360
 

277
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,079
then then I'm gonna build another 360
cannon in the normal world

278
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:57,089
cannon in the normal world
 

279
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,180
cannon in the normal world
and while I build that and I'm gonna

280
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,190
and while I build that and I'm gonna
 

281
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,180
and while I build that and I'm gonna
make a do toriel on how to build a 360

282
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,190
make a do toriel on how to build a 360
 

283
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,840
make a do toriel on how to build a 360
cannon and once that's all done I'll

284
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:05,850
cannon and once that's all done I'll
 

285
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,420
cannon and once that's all done I'll
release my world again and you guys can

286
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:08,430
release my world again and you guys can
 

287
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:18,259
release my world again and you guys can
play around with it so that's my plan it

288
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:18,269
play around with it so that's my plan it
 

289
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:24,780
play around with it so that's my plan it
was easy for you dude

290
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:24,790

 

291
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,780

yes so I'm gonna work on it some more

292
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:27,790
yes so I'm gonna work on it some more
 

293
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,870

and I'll give you some updates hopefully
I gotta add it there's gonna be two

296
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,350
I gotta add it there's gonna be two
 

297
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,470
I gotta add it there's gonna be two
booster packs I think I don't think I

298
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:37,480
booster packs I think I don't think I
 

299
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,090
booster packs I think I don't think I
need three so I'm gonna work on that

300
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:42,100
need three so I'm gonna work on that
 

301
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:48,140
need three so I'm gonna work on that
right now okay

302
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,150
right now okay
 

303
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,880
right now okay
so this here is the first booster rack

304
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:50,890
so this here is the first booster rack
 

305
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,480
so this here is the first booster rack
this inside ring this outside ring is

306
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:54,490
this inside ring this outside ring is
 

307
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:00,170
this inside ring this outside ring is
for the shells you go in this gap here

308
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:00,180
for the shells you go in this gap here
 

309
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,820
for the shells you go in this gap here
so above the first string where you're

310
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:02,830
so above the first string where you're
 

311
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,890
so above the first string where you're
gonna make no shoving we're gonna start

312
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:07,900
gonna make no shoving we're gonna start
 

313
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:17,430
gonna make no shoving we're gonna start
making another ring I'm gonna leave

314
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
making another ring I'm gonna leave
 

315
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,230
making another ring I'm gonna leave
enough space so I can walk around on

316
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:19,240
enough space so I can walk around on
 

317
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,880
enough space so I can walk around on
this ring so it's gonna be a little bit

318
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,890
this ring so it's gonna be a little bit
 

319
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:31,530
this ring so it's gonna be a little bit
different than my original design the

320
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:31,540
different than my original design the
 

321
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,770
different than my original design the
second ring is gonna be one block higher

322
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:33,780

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,360

although I think I checked there and it

492
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,370
although I think I checked there and it
 

493
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,980
although I think I checked there and it
wasn't there I find it hard to believe I

494
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:28,990
wasn't there I find it hard to believe I
 

495
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:35,159
wasn't there I find it hard to believe I
used that much though okay I'm gonna

496
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:35,169
used that much though okay I'm gonna
 

497
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:37,740
used that much though okay I'm gonna
create a world backed up and I will be

498
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:37,750
create a world backed up and I will be
 

499
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,810
create a world backed up and I will be
back okay I got the world backed up now

500
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:42,820
back okay I got the world backed up now
 

501
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,680
back okay I got the world backed up now
I need to do a test here I'm wondering

502
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:46,690
I need to do a test here I'm wondering
 

503
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:52,430
I need to do a test here I'm wondering
if I need to make my booster rings - hi

504
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:52,440

 

505
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,029

in my original design I did it as a

506
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:56,039
in my original design I did it as a
 

507
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:01,560
in my original design I did it as a
guard so that the TNT from the second or

508
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:01,570
guard so that the TNT from the second or
 

509
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,680
guard so that the TNT from the second or
third ring when it fall down and land on

510
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:04,690
third ring when it fall down and land on
 

511
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,370
third ring when it fall down and land on
top of the first string I'm not sure if

512
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:08,380
top of the first string I'm not sure if
 

513
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,240
top of the first string I'm not sure if
I actually test it if it's required so

514
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,250
I actually test it if it's required so
 

515
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,860
I actually test it if it's required so
we're gonna find that out and now it'd

516
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:16,870
we're gonna find that out and now it'd
 

517
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,480
we're gonna find that out and now it'd
be better if I can make this only one

518
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:18,490
be better if I can make this only one
 

519
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:41,630
be better if I can make this only one
high so it'll place some wire and some

520
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:41,640
high so it'll place some wire and some
 

521
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,620
high so it'll place some wire and some
TNT so if it falls down to the center

522
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:46,630
TNT so if it falls down to the center
 

523
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,860
TNT so if it falls down to the center
there it's good if some of it lands on

524
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:49,870
there it's good if some of it lands on
 

525
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,070
there it's good if some of it lands on
this first ring on top of it

526
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,080
this first ring on top of it
 

527
00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:01,350
this first ring on top of it
that's bad there's a good chance I'm

528
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360
that's bad there's a good chance I'm
 

529
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:08,100
that's bad there's a good chance I'm
going to blow up here too

530
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,110

 

531
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:17,660

all right let's check it out

537
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,420

and all right so we're gonna do another

538
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,430
and all right so we're gonna do another
 

539
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,810
and all right so we're gonna do another
similar test I think this time I have a

540
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:34,820
similar test I think this time I have a
 

541
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,000
similar test I think this time I have a
block in the middle of each new string

542
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,010
block in the middle of each new string
 

543
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,910
block in the middle of each new string
and I want to see if any land on on the

544
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:42,920
and I want to see if any land on on the
 

545
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,150
and I want to see if any land on on the
center block there

546
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:46,160

place TT I think there's a guess lion up
 

551
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,740

here so to do this fast

552
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:04,750
here so to do this fast
 

553
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:13,049
here so to do this fast
and no seemed fine

554
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:13,059
and no seemed fine
 

555
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:28,110
and no seemed fine
cool so I might have a center block too

556
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,120

593
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,159

so I'm thinking I'm gonna have to try to
 

595

00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:51,980
do something with boats so I'm trying to
 

597
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,220
do something with boats so I'm trying to
figure out how high I can get into a

602
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:07,320
and that's too high still too high no
 

603
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:25,820
and that's too high still too high no
way yeah yes that's it that is one two

604
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:25,830
way yeah yes that's it that is one two
 

605
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:31,890

that's not very much the other thing is

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:45,840
that's not very much the other thing is
 

611
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,440
that's not very much the other thing is
I need the boat to be far away from the

I need the boat to be far away from the

like little offshoot here something to

00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,060

all right so I guess so that's about it

all right so I guess so that's about it
 

623
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:12,770
all right so I guess so that's about it
for today wrap it up here I did extend

624
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:12,780
for today wrap it up here I did extend
 

625
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:18,230
for today wrap it up here I did extend
this out one more and I'll when it's all

626
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
this out one more and I'll when it's all
 

627
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,310
this out one more and I'll when it's all
done I'm gonna replace this cobble stone

628
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,320
done I'm gonna replace this cobble stone
 

629
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,150

probably a lot of this floor will be

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,919
probably a lot of this floor will be

635
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:34,220
glass a big majority of the canons gonna
be glass so that we can see all around
