uh you got one trapped here you can test

22
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
uh you got one trapped here you can test
 

23
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,069
uh you got one trapped here you can test
this

24
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079
this
 

25
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,030
this
i've been having trouble with the slime

26
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
i've been having trouble with the slime
 

27
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,389
i've been having trouble with the slime
sending two carts

28
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
sending two carts
 

29
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,229
sending two carts
when they get picked up i don't know why

30
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
when they get picked up i don't know why
 

31
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,350
when they get picked up i don't know why
it's doing it uh

32
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
it's doing it uh
 

33
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,389
it's doing it uh
i tweaked this a little bit hopefully it

34
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
i tweaked this a little bit hopefully it
 

35
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,830
i tweaked this a little bit hopefully it
doesn't happen again

36
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:49,840
doesn't happen again
 

37
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,750
doesn't happen again
i tried riding it myself and only one

38
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
i tried riding it myself and only one
 

39
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,830
i tried riding it myself and only one
cart was sent like it should

40
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
cart was sent like it should
 

41
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,750
cart was sent like it should
but maybe something weird is happening

42
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
but maybe something weird is happening
 

43
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,990
but maybe something weird is happening
with the slimes i don't know about

44
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
with the slimes i don't know about
 

45
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,349
with the slimes i don't know about
so let's uh let's give it a

46
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
so let's uh let's give it a
 

47
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,870
so let's uh let's give it a
whoop dang undo undo

48
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880

 

49
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,630

there we go here we go

50
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
there we go here we go
 

51
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,310
there we go here we go
there we go here we go

52
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320

 

53
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,550

okay i think that was only one charts

54
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
okay i think that was only one charts
 

55
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,190
okay i think that was only one charts
yes it was only one chart

56
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
yes it was only one chart
 

57
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,149
yes it was only one chart
that was very weird why i don't

58
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
that was very weird why i don't
 

59
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,070
that was very weird why i don't
understand why it wasn't working before

60
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
understand why it wasn't working before
 

61
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,350
understand why it wasn't working before
so before i had the

62
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
so before i had the
 

63
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,030
so before i had the
reset hooked up to this detector rail

64
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
reset hooked up to this detector rail
 

65
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,190
reset hooked up to this detector rail
and now i just added another one over

66
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
and now i just added another one over
 

67
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,149
and now i just added another one over
here

68
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
here
 

69
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,149
here
and i'm using that instead

70
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159

 

71
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,149

but i don't understand why

72
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
but i don't understand why
 

73
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,429
but i don't understand why
that one would have been the problem

74
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
that one would have been the problem
 

75
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,510
that one would have been the problem
it's almost like this no i'm not even

76
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
it's almost like this no i'm not even
 

77
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:49,910
it's almost like this no i'm not even
gonna

78
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
gonna
 

79
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,389
gonna
i'm not even gonna jump to conclusions

80
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
i'm not even gonna jump to conclusions
 

81
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,069
i'm not even gonna jump to conclusions
because i know i'm going to be wrong

82
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
because i know i'm going to be wrong
 

83
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,510
because i know i'm going to be wrong
about it but anyway it seems to work now

84
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
about it but anyway it seems to work now
 

85
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,950
about it but anyway it seems to work now
this has gotten slightly more

86
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
this has gotten slightly more
 

87
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,830
this has gotten slightly more
complicated now

88
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
complicated now
 

89
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,870
complicated now
but it should be all fully automatic now

90
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
but it should be all fully automatic now
 

91
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,109
but it should be all fully automatic now
where is our slime i got this opened up

92
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
where is our slime i got this opened up
 

93
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:07,990
where is our slime i got this opened up
because i had a few

94
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
because i had a few
 

95
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,949
because i had a few
cards get stuck while testing this there

96
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
cards get stuck while testing this there
 

97
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,390
cards get stuck while testing this there
he comes

98
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
he comes
 

99
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,229
he comes
this is my new lazy junction here you

100
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
this is my new lazy junction here you
 

101
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,190
this is my new lazy junction here you
see that switches and then switches back

102
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
see that switches and then switches back
 

103
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,830
see that switches and then switches back
that is to pick up empty mine carts they

104
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
that is to pick up empty mine carts they
 

105
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,270
that is to pick up empty mine carts they
go over this

106
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
go over this
 

107
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,270
go over this
over this detector rail here

108
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280

 

109
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,630

and that powers this redstone

110
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
and that powers this redstone
 

111
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,990
and that powers this redstone
goes to

112
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000

 

113
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,589

there's a redstone torch back there by

114
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
there's a redstone torch back there by
 

115
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,910
there's a redstone torch back there by
the way um

116
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
the way um
 

117
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,110
the way um
that goes to this junction

118
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
that goes to this junction
 

119
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,949
that goes to this junction
and since the carts go faster if there's

120
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
and since the carts go faster if there's
 

121
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,550
and since the carts go faster if there's
a slime in it they

122
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
a slime in it they
 

123
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,030
a slime in it they
speed by before it switches back but if

124
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
speed by before it switches back but if
 

125
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,470
speed by before it switches back but if
it's empty

126
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480

 

127
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,869

they go to the right there and up our

128
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
they go to the right there and up our
 

129
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,990
they go to the right there and up our
little uh

130
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
little uh
 

131
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,309
little uh
collector units but this is

132
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319

 

133
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,750

oh no it's not full because we have

134
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
oh no it's not full because we have
 

135
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,710
oh no it's not full because we have
slime on the track i thought

136
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
slime on the track i thought
 

137
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,270
slime on the track i thought
i thought the pez was full here so it

138
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
i thought the pez was full here so it
 

139
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,550
i thought the pez was full here so it
holds six

140
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
holds six
 

141
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,790
holds six
we got one on the track though so we

142
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
we got one on the track though so we
 

143
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,309
we got one on the track though so we
better get rid of that or we will have

144
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
better get rid of that or we will have
 

145
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,509
better get rid of that or we will have
issues

146
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
issues
 

147
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,790
issues
um hold six i don't think we'll ever get

148
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
um hold six i don't think we'll ever get
 

149
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,470
um hold six i don't think we'll ever get
more than six big slimes

150
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
more than six big slimes
 

151
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,990
more than six big slimes
with this thing and

152
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000

 

153
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,390

there's also a safety mechanism i have

154
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
there's also a safety mechanism i have
 

155
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,589
there's also a safety mechanism i have
hooked up so

156
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
hooked up so
 

157
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,509
hooked up so
let's just trigger an empty cart

158
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519

 

159
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,030

they go down here goes over and now that

160
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
they go down here goes over and now that
 

161
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,190
they go down here goes over and now that
went to the left there

162
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
went to the left there
 

163
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,830
went to the left there
so there's another lazy empty cart

164
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
so there's another lazy empty cart
 

165
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,670
so there's another lazy empty cart
detector here

166
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
detector here
 

167
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,270
detector here
where it will uh

168
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
where it will uh
 

169
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,309
where it will uh
switch it if the cart is going slow

170
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319

 

171
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,710

right there

172
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720

 

173
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,670

but uh wait i need a cart i need a cart

174
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680

 

175
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,509

but yeah it seems to be working fully

176
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
but yeah it seems to be working fully
 

177
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,030
but yeah it seems to be working fully
automatic now i'm

178
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
automatic now i'm
 

179
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,630
automatic now i'm
happy this was a

180
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640

 

181
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,390

project i've been wanting to complete

182
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
project i've been wanting to complete
 

183
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,070
project i've been wanting to complete
for a long time and i

184
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
for a long time and i
 

185
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,189
for a long time and i
think we finally can close everything up

186
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
think we finally can close everything up
 

187
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,749
think we finally can close everything up
and say it's done

188
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759

 

189
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,350

all right what was i gonna do i need a

190
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
all right what was i gonna do i need a
 

191
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,590
all right what was i gonna do i need a
cart for something

192
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
cart for something
 

193
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,710
cart for something
oh yeah i was gonna demonstrate so

194
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
oh yeah i was gonna demonstrate so
 

195
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,110
oh yeah i was gonna demonstrate so
that that switch is there if i'm in the

196
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
that that switch is there if i'm in the
 

197
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,390
that that switch is there if i'm in the
cart

198
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
cart
 

199
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,150
cart
or slime is it did not work for some

200
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
or slime is it did not work for some
 

201
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,550
or slime is it did not work for some
reason

202
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
reason
 

203
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,909
reason
let's try that again it does work

204
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
let's try that again it does work
 

205
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:47,749
let's try that again it does work
trust me

206
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759

 

207
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,670

all right let's just power this off so

208
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
all right let's just power this off so
 

209
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,870
all right let's just power this off so
we can get in

210
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
we can get in
 

211
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,070
we can get in
properly there we go

212
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
properly there we go
 

213
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,590
properly there we go
so this is what the slime see when

214
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
so this is what the slime see when
 

215
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,510
so this is what the slime see when
they're riding

216
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
they're riding
 

217
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,990
they're riding
the carts goes all the way around the

218
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
the carts goes all the way around the
 

219
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,230
the carts goes all the way around the
tree farm

220
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
tree farm
 

221
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,909
tree farm
um and i think

222
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
um and i think
 

223
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,909
um and i think
if they despawn the carts will keep

224
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
if they despawn the carts will keep
 

225
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,270
if they despawn the carts will keep
going if i log out

226
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
going if i log out
 

227
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,350
going if i log out
log in i think they stay in the carts

228
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
log in i think they stay in the carts
 

229
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,430
log in i think they stay in the carts
because i think it's only if the carts

230
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
because i think it's only if the carts
 

231
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,350
because i think it's only if the carts
aren't moving that mobs will hop out of

232
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
aren't moving that mobs will hop out of
 

233
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,629
aren't moving that mobs will hop out of
them

234
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
them
 

235
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,909
them
if i'm remember correctly

236
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
if i'm remember correctly
 

237
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:26,870
if i'm remember correctly
oh yeah so that's the course

238
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880

 

239
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,629

and that is the project i think it's

240
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
and that is the project i think it's
 

241
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,590
and that is the project i think it's
done it's going to do a couple cosmetic

242
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
done it's going to do a couple cosmetic
 

243
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,150
done it's going to do a couple cosmetic
things here yet

244
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
things here yet
 

245
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,629
things here yet
with this netherrack it doesn't i don't

246
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
with this netherrack it doesn't i don't
 

247
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,990
with this netherrack it doesn't i don't
think it'll look quite right

248
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
think it'll look quite right
 

249
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,310
think it'll look quite right
with this uh stone here

250
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
with this uh stone here
 

251
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,469
with this uh stone here
it's not symmetrical i'm gonna try

252
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
it's not symmetrical i'm gonna try
 

253
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,390
it's not symmetrical i'm gonna try
change that a little bit and put

254
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
change that a little bit and put
 

255
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,909
change that a little bit and put
a line of netherrack here on both sides

256
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
a line of netherrack here on both sides
 

257
00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:01,510
a line of netherrack here on both sides
and see if that looks better

258
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520

 

259
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,029

and then we'll go do something else

260
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039

 

261
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,790

hmm

262
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800

 

263
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,950

i would have to put one there too i

264
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
i would have to put one there too i
 

265
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,150
i would have to put one there too i
think and that would

266
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
think and that would
 

267
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,350
think and that would
no that's not gonna work

268
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
no that's not gonna work
 

269
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,629
no that's not gonna work
no i'm going to switch it back to the

270
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
no i'm going to switch it back to the
 

271
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,670
no i'm going to switch it back to the
stone

272
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680

 

273
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,430

all right we got another big slime there

274
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
all right we got another big slime there
 

275
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,150
all right we got another big slime there
coming up we can test this one more time

276
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
coming up we can test this one more time
 

277
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,590
coming up we can test this one more time
but i think it is working just the way

278
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
but i think it is working just the way
 

279
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,029
but i think it is working just the way
it's supposed to

280
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039

 

281
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,909

let's see because i had that big slime

282
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
let's see because i had that big slime
 

283
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,950
let's see because i had that big slime
on the track

284
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
on the track
 

285
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,110
on the track
and one two three four five

286
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
and one two three four five
 

287
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,469
and one two three four five
oh maybe it's not working

288
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479

 

289
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,309

there should be six cards we're missing

290
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
there should be six cards we're missing
 

291
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,670
there should be six cards we're missing
one

292
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
one
 

293
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,790
one
it might when the slime despawned the

294
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
it might when the slime despawned the
 

295
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,830
it might when the slime despawned the
cart might have got stuck

296
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
cart might have got stuck
 

297
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,510
cart might have got stuck
on the track

298
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
on the track
 

299
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,430
on the track
i've never seen it from this side before

300
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440

 

301
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,830

let's see if he gets stuck

302
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840

 

303
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,629

anywhere

304
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639

 

305
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,469

i just want to know it's working so i

306
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
i just want to know it's working so i
 

307
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,070
i just want to know it's working so i
can

308
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
can
 

309
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,670
can
comfortably cover everything up

310
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
comfortably cover everything up
 

311
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,270
comfortably cover everything up
otherwise i might have to remove the

312
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
otherwise i might have to remove the
 

313
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,830
otherwise i might have to remove the
ground again

314
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840

 

315
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,350

and he's still going

316
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
and he's still going
 

317
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,670
and he's still going
i don't know if he hit anything

318
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680

 

319
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,350

all right so it seems to be okay let's

320
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
all right so it seems to be okay let's
 

321
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,950
all right so it seems to be okay let's
check how many carts are there one more

322
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
check how many carts are there one more
 

323
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,990
check how many carts are there one more
time

324
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
time
 

325
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,350
time
if there's still five we might have a

326
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
if there's still five we might have a
 

327
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,710
if there's still five we might have a
problem

328
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
problem
 

329
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,629
problem
because there should be four if he's on

330
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
because there should be four if he's on
 

331
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,270
because there should be four if he's on
the track

332
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280

 

333
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,350

okay good four it is

334
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
okay good four it is
 

335
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,749
okay good four it is
there he goes

336
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759

 

337
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,230

oh is there two one

338
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240

 

339
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,110

hmm all right well i'm confused again

340
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
hmm all right well i'm confused again
 

341
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,710
hmm all right well i'm confused again
i'll i'll just have to watch it for a

342
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
i'll i'll just have to watch it for a
 

343
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,110
i'll i'll just have to watch it for a
while i suppose

344
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
while i suppose
 

345
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,150
while i suppose
before we know it's safe to cover up

346
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
before we know it's safe to cover up
 

347
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,990
before we know it's safe to cover up
but let's go do something else i think

348
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
uh this is a silverfish farm
 

373
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,470
uh this is a silverfish farm
and this has been full for a few days

374

now and i've been very tempted to

376
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
now and i've been very tempted to
 

377

it on camera the first time
 

381
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,150
it on camera the first time
so we're going to try to set up some

382
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
so we're going to try to set up some
 

383
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,310
so we're going to try to set up some
sort of killing system

384
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
sort of killing system
 

385
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,430
sort of killing system
just see how it works first of all uh

386
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
just see how it works first of all uh
 

387
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,430
just see how it works first of all uh
to get rid of the top two layers we need

388
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
to get rid of the top two layers we need
 

389
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,790
to get rid of the top two layers we need
to hit some silver fish up high here

390
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,800
to hit some silver fish up high here
 

391
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,829
to hit some silver fish up high here
though so i'm gonna try just have a

392
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
though so i'm gonna try just have a
 

393
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,150
though so i'm gonna try just have a
little pit like this

394
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
little pit like this
 

395
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,230
little pit like this
actually that's not gonna work is it

396
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240

 

397
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,350

we'll have to line it at least half a

398
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
we'll have to line it at least half a
 

399
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,070
we'll have to line it at least half a
block up

400
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
block up
 

401
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,389
block up
so they can't jump out because if you

402
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
so they can't jump out because if you
 

403
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,269
so they can't jump out because if you
break that

404
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
break that
 

405
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,590
break that
oh damn i'm stuck

406
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600

 

407
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,269

if you were to break one of these they

408
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
if you were to break one of these they
 

409
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,509
if you were to break one of these they
could jump on another one and jump on

410
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
could jump on another one and jump on
 

411
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,870
could jump on another one and jump on
glass and get out but if we have the

412
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
glass and get out but if we have the
 

413
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,150
glass and get out but if we have the
half slabs they won't

414
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
half slabs they won't
 

415
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,389
half slabs they won't
be able to get out i don't think and

416
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
be able to get out i don't think and
 

417
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,790
be able to get out i don't think and
we'll just see how that goes and then

418
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
we'll just see how that goes and then
 

419
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,190
we'll just see how that goes and then
for down below

420
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
for down below
 

421
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,030
for down below
i think the snow golems will take care

422
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
i think the snow golems will take care
 

423
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,470
i think the snow golems will take care
of a lot of the work for us

424
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
of a lot of the work for us
 

425
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,590
of a lot of the work for us
um

426
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600

 

427
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,590

what i'm thinking we'll do actually is

428
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
what i'm thinking we'll do actually is
 

429
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,949
what i'm thinking we'll do actually is
have

430
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
have
 

431
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,949
have
like a two wide opening here so let's

432
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
like a two wide opening here so let's
 

433
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,310
like a two wide opening here so let's
find the center of the room

434
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
find the center of the room
 

435
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,430
find the center of the room
one two three four five six seven eight

436
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
one two three four five six seven eight
 

437
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,630
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen

438
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
 

439
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,949
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
one two three four five six seven

440
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
one two three four five six seven
 

441
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,069
one two three four five six seven
and there that's the center

442
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
and there that's the center
 

443
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,269
and there that's the center
so we will have them fall in a pit

444
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
so we will have them fall in a pit
 

445
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,710
so we will have them fall in a pit
of some sort

446
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720

 

447
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,430

and maybe i'll just put glass here see

448
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
and maybe i'll just put glass here see
 

449
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,350
and maybe i'll just put glass here see
how it looks

450
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360

 

451
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,110

453
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,350

so we can observe the silver fish from

454
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
so we can observe the silver fish from
 

455
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,269
so we can observe the silver fish from
outside oh

00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600

 

689
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,509

this might actually work because they're

690
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
this might actually work because they're
 

691
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,870
this might actually work because they're
all staying up here i thought they would

692
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
all staying up here i thought they would
 

693
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,110
all staying up here i thought they would
have fallen by now

694
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
have fallen by now
 

695
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,910
have fallen by now
oh that would have sucked

696
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
oh that would have sucked
 

697
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,389
oh that would have sucked
they're all gonna fall at once

698
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
they're all gonna fall at once
 

699
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,590
they're all gonna fall at once
you know how many that is you hear the

700
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600
you know how many that is you hear the
 

701
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,310
you know how many that is you hear the
snow golems below hitting them

702
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320

 

703
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,110

although that actually escaping anywhere

704
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
although that actually escaping anywhere
 

705
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,670
although that actually escaping anywhere
is

706
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
is
 

707
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,309
is
a big concern

708
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319

 

709
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,110

i think the top layer got shaved off

710
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120

 

711
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,510

and nothing below i think we're breaking

712
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:13,520
and nothing below i think we're breaking
 

713
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,549
and nothing below i think we're breaking
them faster than the snow golems

714
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
them faster than the snow golems
 

715
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,710
them faster than the snow golems
i can't hit anymore

716
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720

 

717
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,829

one yeah just about the full

718
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
one yeah just about the full
 

719
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,830
one yeah just about the full
top two layers is gone which is what we

720
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:30,840
top two layers is gone which is what we
 

721
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,150
top two layers is gone which is what we
want

722
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
want
 

723
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:44,830
want
ah if only i could hit them a few more

724
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:44,840

 

725
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,630

times

726
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
times
 

727
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,150
times
that's really really interesting looking

728
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160

 

729
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,310

all right i'm gonna go down below

730
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
all right i'm gonna go down below
 

731
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,669
all right i'm gonna go down below
although i can't go in that room i got

732
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
although i can't go in that room i got
 

733
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,830
although i can't go in that room i got
it closed off now

734
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:58,840

 

735
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,270

oh oh no

736
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280

 

737
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,230

there's a leak dance

738
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
there's a leak dance
 

739
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,510
there's a leak dance
they're falling through the pistons

740
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520
they're falling through the pistons
 

741
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,630
they're falling through the pistons
aren't they

742
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640

 

743
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,190

i just almost walked in how are they

744
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
i just almost walked in how are they
 

745
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,510
i just almost walked in how are they
getting

746
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520

 

747
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,230

they are all over the place those snow

748
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
they are all over the place those snow
 

749
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,070
they are all over the place those snow
golems are taking too long

750
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
golems are taking too long
 

751
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,590
golems are taking too long
and they're not jumping even they're

752
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
and they're not jumping even they're
 

753
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,390
and they're not jumping even they're
just

754
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400

 

755
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,830

okay uh here's here's an idea

756
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840

 

757
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,870

i need another

758
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
i need another
 

759
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:50,630
i need another
poison potion where do i have one

760
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:50,640

 

761
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,029

i wonder if uh

762
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039

 

763
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,710

because poison keeps doing damage to

764
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:56,720
because poison keeps doing damage to
 

765
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,549
because poison keeps doing damage to
them if every time they take damage from

766
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
them if every time they take damage from
 

767
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:58,789
them if every time they take damage from
it

768
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
it
 

769
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,510
it
if another more silver fish will spawn

770
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520

 

771
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,029

i hit myself i don't seem poisoned at

772
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
i hit myself i don't seem poisoned at
 

773
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,990
i hit myself i don't seem poisoned at
all

774
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000

 

775
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,990

ah

776
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000

 

777
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:29,909

what the heck i'm gonna die

778
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919

 

779
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,669

this is good we're learning things this

780
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:31,679
this is good we're learning things this
 

781
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,789
this is good we're learning things this
is not a total bust

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,430

don't die don't die don't die don't die

784
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
don't die don't die don't die don't die
 

785
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,710
don't die don't die don't die don't die
i think we're all right

786
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720

 

787
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:50,830

but yeah there's definitely a leak

788
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:50,840

 

789
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,480

793
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,230

now they're not breaking out of the

794
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
now they're not breaking out of the
 

795
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,590
now they're not breaking out of the
block so i don't think it's causing

796
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600
block so i don't think it's causing
 

797
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,149
block so i don't think it's causing
doesn't count as a hit i don't think

00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,159

 

799
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,110

i will probably be able to get this
 

839
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,549
i will probably be able to get this
working better

their glass blocked down so i'm guessing

860
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
their glass blocked down so i'm guessing
 

861
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,350
their glass blocked down so i'm guessing
the silverfish got into the wiring and

862
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360
the silverfish got into the wiring and
 

863

stone so it never happens again

1046
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
stone so it never happens again
 

1047
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,350
stone so it never happens again
i'm gonna have to seal up all the leaks

1048
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360
i'm gonna have to seal up all the leaks
 

1049
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,950
i'm gonna have to seal up all the leaks
before we attempt this again

1050
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:00,960
before we attempt this again
 

1051
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,590
before we attempt this again
and set up a better killing chamber

1052
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:05,600
and set up a better killing chamber
 

1053
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,510
and set up a better killing chamber
what happened is since i built this out

1054
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:07,520
what happened is since i built this out
 

1055
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,590
what happened is since i built this out
of wood i think it caught on fire

1056
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:09,600
of wood i think it caught on fire
 

1057
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,630
of wood i think it caught on fire
and that's how they leaked out of

1058
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:12,640
and that's how they leaked out of
 

1059
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,789
and that's how they leaked out of
there and

1060
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799
there and
 

1061
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,470
there and
well that's how that got destroyed

1062
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:20,480
well that's how that got destroyed
 

1063
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,430
well that's how that got destroyed
anyway

1064
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,440
anyway
 

1065
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,710
anyway
uh but them leaking out before they got

1066
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
uh but them leaking out before they got
 

1067
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,149
uh but them leaking out before they got
in the stone over there

1068
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
in the stone over there
 

1069
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,830
in the stone over there

1070
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
broke the blocks and then lava started
 

1071
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,149
broke the blocks and then lava started
spilling everywhere

1072
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:30,159
spilling everywhere
 

1073
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,630
spilling everywhere

1087
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,789

and yeah it's good learning experience

1088
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:48,799
and yeah it's good learning experience
 

1089
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,750
and yeah it's good learning experience
very important for figuring this out and

1090
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:53,760

 

1091
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,190

learning the hard way that's what i'm

1092
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,200
learning the hard way that's what i'm
 

1093

version of the game there was one thing
 

1103
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,830
version of the game there was one thing
that

1104
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:07,840
that
 

1105
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,669
that
i really didn't like about it and paws

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:13,760
i hope they fix it it's the lighting in
 

1111
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,789
i hope they fix it it's the lighting in
it they

1112
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:14,799
it they
 

1113
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,310
it they
seem to have had to use a different

1114
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,320
seem to have had to use a different
 

1115
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,190
seem to have had to use a different
lighting engine

1116
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
lighting engine
 

1117
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,310
lighting engine
and it is a lot darker like you place

1118
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,320
and it is a lot darker like you place
 

1119
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,149
and it is a lot darker like you place
down a torch

1120
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:24,159
down a torch
 

1121
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,350
down a torch
and it's still gray and i know like in

1122
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360
and it's still gray and i know like in
 

1123
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,470
and it's still gray and i know like in
1.6 it was using a different lighting

1124
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,480

 

1125
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,070

lighting system than what we're using

1126
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,080
lighting system than what we're using
 

1127
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,710
lighting system than what we're using
now but even still like compared to how

1128
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:36,720
now but even still like compared to how
 

1129
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,789
now but even still like compared to how
it used to be it's not

1130
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:38,799
it used to be it's not
 

1131
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,230
it used to be it's not
quite right because i think it's on a

1132
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,240
quite right because i think it's on a
 

1133
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,669
quite right because i think it's on a
different platform they had to do it

1134
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:41,679
different platform they had to do it
 

1135
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,870
different platform they had to do it
differently

1136
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:42,880
differently
 

1137
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,310
differently
and it needs to be a lot lot brighter

1138
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,320
and it needs to be a lot lot brighter
 

1139
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,389
and it needs to be a lot lot brighter
but other than that it's it's pretty

1140
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
but other than that it's it's pretty
 

1141
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,029
but other than that it's it's pretty
cool worth checking out

1142
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:51,039
cool worth checking out
 

1143
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,590
cool worth checking out
especially if you missed old minecraft i

1144
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:53,600
especially if you missed old minecraft i
 

1145
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,750
especially if you missed old minecraft i
think there was pistons in 1.6 if i

1146
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:55,760
think there was pistons in 1.6 if i
 

1147
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,269
think there was pistons in 1.6 if i
remember right so

1148
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:57,279
remember right so
 

1149
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,029
remember right so
there's there's a bit of stuff you can

1150
00:28:59,029 --> 00:28:59,039
there's there's a bit of stuff you can
 

1151
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,750
there's there's a bit of stuff you can
do and it it's a lot harder to

1152
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:01,760
do and it it's a lot harder to
 

1153
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,149
do and it it's a lot harder to
uh if you make a world on hard anyway

1154
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:06,159
uh if you make a world on hard anyway
 

1155
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,990
uh if you make a world on hard anyway
it's very tough to stay alive

1156
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,000
