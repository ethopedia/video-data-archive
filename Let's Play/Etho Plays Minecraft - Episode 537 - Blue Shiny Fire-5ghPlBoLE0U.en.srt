162
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,120
familiar with the hopper item filters
 

163
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,360
familiar with the hopper item filters
right you do something like that to do

164
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,370
right you do something like that to do
 

165
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,270
right you do something like that to do
that with a minecart is really strange

166
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
that with a minecart is really strange
 

167
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,580
that with a minecart is really strange
and I've attempted it like twice in the

168
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:41,590
and I've attempted it like twice in the
 

169
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,860
and I've attempted it like twice in the
past and like each time I gave up I got

170
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:43,870
past and like each time I gave up I got
 

171
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,720
past and like each time I gave up I got
frustrated and it's like this is stupid

172
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:45,730
frustrated and it's like this is stupid
 

173
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,430
frustrated and it's like this is stupid
when is anyone actually gonna use this

174
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
when is anyone actually gonna use this
 

175
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,310
when is anyone actually gonna use this
anyway well it's like the only way to

176
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,320
anyway well it's like the only way to
 

177
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,260
anyway well it's like the only way to
make this possible this device here so

178
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:52,270
make this possible this device here so
 

179
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,180
make this possible this device here so
it's like okay I'm gonna try it again

180
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,190
it's like okay I'm gonna try it again
 

181
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,790
it's like okay I'm gonna try it again
see if I can come up with it so we have

182
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:56,800
see if I can come up with it so we have
 

183
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,080
see if I can come up with it so we have
a minecart with hopper item filter here

184
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,090
a minecart with hopper item filter here
 

185
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,150
a minecart with hopper item filter here
the way this works that is sitting on a

186
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,160
the way this works that is sitting on a
 

187
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,550
the way this works that is sitting on a
detector rail and then we use a

188
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:05,560
detector rail and then we use a
 

189
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,130
detector rail and then we use a
comparator if a hopper minecarts on a

190
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,140
comparator if a hopper minecarts on a
 

191
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,960
comparator if a hopper minecarts on a
detector rail like a parrot can read the

192
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:09,970
detector rail like a parrot can read the
 

193
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,600
detector rail like a parrot can read the
signal we use that to figure out when

194
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:12,610
signal we use that to figure out when
 

195
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,800
signal we use that to figure out when
the next next one goes in right and you

196
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:16,810
the next next one goes in right and you
 

197
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,510
the next next one goes in right and you
see it goes down to 16 and then to get

198
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:18,520
see it goes down to 16 and then to get
 

199
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,290
see it goes down to 16 and then to get
shot in there to bring it back up to 18

200
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:21,300
shot in there to bring it back up to 18
 

201
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,850
shot in there to bring it back up to 18
that triggers the switching of the

202
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:23,860
that triggers the switching of the
 

203
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,840
that triggers the switching of the
Pistons here and stuff now the

204
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:27,850
Pistons here and stuff now the
 

205
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,970
Pistons here and stuff now the
thing is because of the month this is a

206
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:29,980
thing is because of the month this is a
 

207
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,650
thing is because of the month this is a
tricky part about because the minecart

208
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:31,660
tricky part about because the minecart
 

209
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,940
tricky part about because the minecart
is on detector rail like if you put a

210
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:35,950
is on detector rail like if you put a
 

211
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,010
is on detector rail like if you put a
hopper directly below that the detector

212
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,020
hopper directly below that the detector
 

213
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,690
hopper directly below that the detector
rail would keep the hopper powered and

214
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:39,700
rail would keep the hopper powered and
 

215
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,910
rail would keep the hopper powered and
locked right so you need another

216
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:41,920
locked right so you need another
 

217
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,330
locked right so you need another
minecart below that and I got this one

218
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:45,340
minecart below that and I got this one
 

219
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,610
minecart below that and I got this one
sitting on an activator rail and when do

220
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:47,620
sitting on an activator rail and when do
 

221
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,280
sitting on an activator rail and when do
you ever use activator rails right so we

222
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,290
you ever use activator rails right so we
 

223
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,440
you ever use activator rails right so we
use an activator rail here to lock this

224
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:52,450
use an activator rail here to lock this
 

225
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,090
use an activator rail here to lock this
hopper minecart so when it's powered

226
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,100
hopper minecart so when it's powered
 

227
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,270
hopper minecart so when it's powered
this is locked so that it doesn't take

228
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
this is locked so that it doesn't take
 

229
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,890
this is locked so that it doesn't take
the items out of this hopper minecart

230
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:58,900
the items out of this hopper minecart
 

231
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,080
the items out of this hopper minecart
and then when we add one to this we

232
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,090
and then when we add one to this we
 

233
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,670
and then when we add one to this we
unpowered for a split second so we can

234
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
unpowered for a split second so we can
 

235
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,790
unpowered for a split second so we can
take the items out and because hopper

236
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
take the items out and because hopper
 

237
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
take the items out and because hopper
mine carts are so fast the best I could

238
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:10,810
mine carts are so fast the best I could
 

239
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,660
mine carts are so fast the best I could
get to run is it taking three out

240
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:12,670
get to run is it taking three out
 

241
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,090
get to run is it taking three out
ideally you'd only want to take one out

242
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,100
ideally you'd only want to take one out
 

243
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,790
ideally you'd only want to take one out
maybe someone can design this better but

244
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:17,800
maybe someone can design this better but
 

245
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,190
maybe someone can design this better but
there's like leg with the comparator

246
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,200
there's like leg with the comparator
 

247
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,360
there's like leg with the comparator
triggering and then it's torch so I

248
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,370
triggering and then it's torch so I
 

249
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,360
triggering and then it's torch so I
can't make it instant uh-huh anyway so

250
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,370
can't make it instant uh-huh anyway so
 

251
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,520
can't make it instant uh-huh anyway so
to make up with that I send two more

252
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:29,530
to make up with that I send two more
 

253
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,850
to make up with that I send two more
back in with this dropper ideally you

254
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:32,860
back in with this dropper ideally you
 

255
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,340
back in with this dropper ideally you
would hook it up so that you take some

256
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:35,350
would hook it up so that you take some
 

257
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,100
would hook it up so that you take some
of the items out of here send them up a

258
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,110
of the items out of here send them up a
 

259
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,660
of the items out of here send them up a
water stream back into here to keep it

260
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:39,670
water stream back into here to keep it
 

261
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,510
water stream back into here to keep it
self-contained but I was kind of lazy

262
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:42,520
self-contained but I was kind of lazy
 

263
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,240
self-contained but I was kind of lazy
and didn't do it we can't put this

264
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,250
and didn't do it we can't put this
 

265
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,030
and didn't do it we can't put this
dropper right next to the detector rail

266
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,040
dropper right next to the detector rail
 

267
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,100
dropper right next to the detector rail
there though because then it would be

268
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,110
there though because then it would be
 

269
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,690
there though because then it would be
locked all the time so I have to slide

270
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:51,700
locked all the time so I have to slide
 

271
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,200
locked all the time so I have to slide
it across ice into it uh-huh

272
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,210
it across ice into it uh-huh
 

273
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,460
it across ice into it uh-huh
pretty weird right I thought that was

274
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:56,470
pretty weird right I thought that was
 

275
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,160
pretty weird right I thought that was
neat though kind of interesting I should

276
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,170
neat though kind of interesting I should
 

277
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,480
neat though kind of interesting I should
have mentioned this earlier it might be

278
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,490
have mentioned this earlier it might be
 

279
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,890
have mentioned this earlier it might be
too late now there's probably a million

280
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:01,900
too late now there's probably a million
 

281
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,500
too late now there's probably a million
comments about it I dunno you can mine

282
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:04,510
comments about it I dunno you can mine
 

283
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,960
comments about it I dunno you can mine
the nether wart blocks and the Warped

284
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:06,970
the nether wart blocks and the Warped
 

285
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,390

ones with the hose that's a new feature

286
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:09,400
ones with the hose that's a new feature
 

287
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,120
ones with the hose that's a new feature
in the snapshot so they gave these a

288
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,130
in the snapshot so they gave these a
 

289
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,520
in the snapshot so they gave these a
proper tool it's not the axe like like I

290
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:14,530
proper tool it's not the axe like like I
 

291
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,530
proper tool it's not the axe like like I
was expecting it would become it's

292
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:16,540
was expecting it would become it's
 

293
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,210
was expecting it would become it's
actually the hole which is I think the

294
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:18,220
actually the hole which is I think the
 

295
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,120
actually the hole which is I think the
first time the hole is the proper tool

296
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,130
first time the hole is the proper tool
 

297
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,440
first time the hole is the proper tool
for for blocks right on these two I

298
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,450
for for blocks right on these two I
 

299
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,820
for for blocks right on these two I
don't think I just want to double check

300
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:26,830
don't think I just want to double check
 

301
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,350
don't think I just want to double check
here I don't think you can enchant it

302
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,360
here I don't think you can enchant it
 

303
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,030
here I don't think you can enchant it
still though know so that's efficiency

304
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,040
still though know so that's efficiency
 

305
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,350
still though know so that's efficiency
can't put that on it yeah you let all

306
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:34,360
can't put that on it yeah you let all
 

307
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,520
can't put that on it yeah you let all
the animals out there free you're back

308
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:38,530
the animals out there free you're back
 

309
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,629
the animals out there free you're back
in there

310
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:39,639
in there
 

311
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,850
in there
okay so I think we should definitely go

312
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:41,860
okay so I think we should definitely go
 

313
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,290
okay so I think we should definitely go
check out the zombie pigmen farm today

314
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:43,300
check out the zombie pigmen farm today
 

315
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,670
check out the zombie pigmen farm today
because there's been some developments

316
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:44,680
because there's been some developments
 

317
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,209
because there's been some developments
with that and with the snapshots so we

318
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:48,219
with that and with the snapshots so we
 

319
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:51,510
with that and with the snapshots so we
got the new piglet mobs and we can trade

320
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
got the new piglet mobs and we can trade
 

321
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,209
got the new piglet mobs and we can trade
gold to them for items which is really

322
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:54,219
gold to them for items which is really
 

323
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:57,209
gold to them for items which is really
cool thing is they spawn in the nether

324
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:57,219
cool thing is they spawn in the nether
 

325
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:59,730
cool thing is they spawn in the nether
wastes which is where like our Pigman

326
00:06:59,730 --> 00:06:59,740
wastes which is where like our Pigman
 

327
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,119
wastes which is where like our Pigman
farm is so that's gonna affect things

328
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:02,129
farm is so that's gonna affect things
 

329
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,929
farm is so that's gonna affect things
big-time

330
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:03,939
big-time
 

331
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:06,059
big-time
also even zombie Pigman got update they

332
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:06,069
also even zombie Pigman got update they
 

333
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:07,890
also even zombie Pigman got update they
got a new skin now so we can go check

334
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:07,900
got a new skin now so we can go check
 

335
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,830
got a new skin now so we can go check
that out let's see here let's go over

336
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:10,840
that out let's see here let's go over
 

337
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,700
that out let's see here let's go over
here

338
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:13,710

 

339
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,260

so yeah Sambi Pigman they got like the

340
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:16,270
so yeah Sambi Pigman they got like the
 

341
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,379
so yeah Sambi Pigman they got like the
ear flap now this is a little minor

342
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:19,389
ear flap now this is a little minor
 

343
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:22,559
ear flap now this is a little minor
change I think it's good though

344
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:22,569
change I think it's good though
 

345
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:24,719
change I think it's good though
these are the big line guys right these

346
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:24,729
these are the big line guys right these
 

347
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:34,040
these are the big line guys right these
guys the ones with the bows are nasty

348
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,050

 

349
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,830

they did turn on me I wasn't sure yeah

350
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
they did turn on me I wasn't sure yeah
 

351
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,379
they did turn on me I wasn't sure yeah
so it's still the same same old trick of

352
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:40,389
so it's still the same same old trick of
 

353
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:43,170
so it's still the same same old trick of
a mob it's a zombie Pigman after they

354
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:43,180
a mob it's a zombie Pigman after they
 

355
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,740
a mob it's a zombie Pigman after they
kill it they they go for you then so

356
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:46,750
kill it they they go for you then so
 

357
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,269
kill it they they go for you then so
it's kind of important to note with this

358
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:48,279
it's kind of important to note with this
 

359
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,249
it's kind of important to note with this
farm the old gold farms like this they

360
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:50,259
farm the old gold farms like this they
 

361
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:51,719
farm the old gold farms like this they
don't work as well as they used to if

362
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:51,729
don't work as well as they used to if
 

363
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:54,659
don't work as well as they used to if
you stay at them for a long time because

364
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:54,669
you stay at them for a long time because
 

365
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:57,329
you stay at them for a long time because
like you get zombie Pigman and pig lands

366
00:07:57,329 --> 00:07:57,339
like you get zombie Pigman and pig lands
 

367
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:00,629
like you get zombie Pigman and pig lands
both spawning on it now nice throw ease

368
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
both spawning on it now nice throw ease
 

369
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,459
both spawning on it now nice throw ease
oh good job

370
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:04,469

 

371
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:09,499

did he not even get aggressive no he did

372
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:09,509
did he not even get aggressive no he did
 

373
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:13,589
did he not even get aggressive no he did
what you can see I mostly got pig lands

374
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
what you can see I mostly got pig lands
 

375
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,999
what you can see I mostly got pig lands
on the layers right now because I've

376
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:15,009
on the layers right now because I've
 

377
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:18,149
on the layers right now because I've
been at it for a few minutes here so the

378
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:18,159
been at it for a few minutes here so the
 

379
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,309
been at it for a few minutes here so the
zombie pigmen over time they die but the

380
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
zombie pigmen over time they die but the
 

381
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,059
zombie pigmen over time they die but the
piglets stay and accumulate and then it

382
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:24,069
piglets stay and accumulate and then it
 

383
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:25,529
piglets stay and accumulate and then it
kind of stops working until you leave

384
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:25,539
kind of stops working until you leave
 

385
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,689
kind of stops working until you leave
the area okay so I just found out

386
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:27,699
the area okay so I just found out
 

387
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,209

something else interesting here I went

388
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:30,219
something else interesting here I went
 

389
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,800
something else interesting here I went
over to our nether fortress because I

390
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:31,810
over to our nether fortress because I
 

391
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,569
over to our nether fortress because I
wanted to see some pig lines fighting

392
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:33,579
wanted to see some pig lines fighting
 

393
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,909
wanted to see some pig lines fighting

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:42,099
spawn in the nether fortress at all
 

399
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,670
spawn in the nether fortress at all
which is interesting because this is

400
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:44,680
which is interesting because this is
 

401
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,150
which is interesting because this is
another waste biome like they this is a

402
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
another waste biome like they this is a
 

403
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,860
another waste biome like they this is a
biome they can spawn in but they just

404
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:49,870
biome they can spawn in but they just
 

405
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,930
biome they can spawn in but they just
don't in the port

406

don't in the port
 

407
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,110
don't in the port
I've seen them outside of it but not

I've seen them outside of it but not
 

409
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,430
I've seen them outside of it but not
actually spawning in it okay awesome

410
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:58,440
actually spawning in it okay awesome
 

411
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,110
actually spawning in it okay awesome
check this out so I went back to our

412
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,120
check this out so I went back to our
 

413
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,640
check this out so I went back to our
nether hub and there's a piggelin just

414
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:01,650
nether hub and there's a piggelin just
 

415
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,000
nether hub and there's a piggelin just
hanging out here all on his own did I'd

416
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,010
hanging out here all on his own did I'd
 

417
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,440
hanging out here all on his own did I'd
imagine that or did he like just

418

here I got hopper underneath them keep
 

449
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,540
here I got hopper underneath them keep
that locked for right now

450
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:50,550
that locked for right now
 

451

that locked for right now
hello that's enough to keep him

452
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
hello that's enough to keep him
 

453
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,290
hello that's enough to keep him
contained he's like two blocks tall so

454
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:57,300
contained he's like two blocks tall so
 

455
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,120
contained he's like two blocks tall so
the trapdoor is thick enough that he

456
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,130
the trapdoor is thick enough that he
 

457
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,330
the trapdoor is thick enough that he
can't get out I'm gonna throw him some

458
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:02,340
can't get out I'm gonna throw him some
 

459
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,830
can't get out I'm gonna throw him some
gold here and to see what happens right

460
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:05,840

 

461
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:13,580

I need to be wearing that gold armor you

462
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:13,590
I need to be wearing that gold armor you
 

463
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,120
I need to be wearing that gold armor you
didn't do anything with that okay that

464
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,130
didn't do anything with that okay that
 

465
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,800
didn't do anything with that okay that
that didn't go as I thought it would

466
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:18,810
that didn't go as I thought it would
 

467
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:24,930
that didn't go as I thought it would
let's try this again with gold armor on

468
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:24,940

 

469
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,480

I should probably look up how to do this

470
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,490
I should probably look up how to do this
 

471
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:32,840
I should probably look up how to do this
I just assumed oh he got it okay okay I

472
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:32,850
I just assumed oh he got it okay okay I
 

473
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:38,540
I just assumed oh he got it okay okay I
think I'm thinking maybe it's like

474
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:38,550
think I'm thinking maybe it's like
 

475
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,460
think I'm thinking maybe it's like
dropping below where he can reach maybe

476
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:41,470
dropping below where he can reach maybe
 

477
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,500
dropping below where he can reach maybe
like if it falls in that part of the

478
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,510

you probably gotta use like some carbon

486
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:55,270
you probably gotta use like some carbon
 

487
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,100
you probably gotta use like some carbon
or something to look if it's on the edge

488

or something to look if it's on the edge
 

489
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,570
or something to look if it's on the edge
of the hopper yeah then you can grab it

490
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:00,580
of the hopper yeah then you can grab it
 

491
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,400
of the hopper yeah then you can grab it
okay so it's it's too low in the middle

492
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,410
okay so it's it's too low in the middle

was to use wither skeletons these guys

618
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:47,400
was to use wither skeletons these guys

do try to attack them and they seem to

620
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:50,520
do try to attack them and they seem to
 

621
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,290
do try to attack them and they seem to
see them from pretty far away even you

622
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:54,300
see them from pretty far away even you
 

623
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,880
see them from pretty far away even you
see that like this guy's pretty far away

624
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:55,890
see that like this guy's pretty far away
 

625
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,190
see that like this guy's pretty far away
and he's still going after them and then

626
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,200
and he's still going after them and then
 

627
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,370
and he's still going after them and then
they just fall down the tube which is

628
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:01,380
they just fall down the tube which is
 

629
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,079
they just fall down the tube which is
cool but it doesn't work with the baby

630
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:03,089
cool but it doesn't work with the baby
 

631
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,730
cool but it doesn't work with the baby
ones the baby ones don't try to play

633
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,300

them so that doesn't really solve the
 

635
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,860
them so that doesn't really solve the
problem because we'll just give tons of

636
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:09,870
problem because we'll just give tons of
 

637
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,910
problem because we'll just give tons of
baby ones eventually

638
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:10,920
baby ones eventually
 

639
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,910
baby ones eventually
so the other idea was to maybe use golds

640
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
so the other idea was to maybe use golds
 

641
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,970
so the other idea was to maybe use golds
to lure them and just have that refresh

642
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:16,980
to lure them and just have that refresh
 

643
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,610
to lure them and just have that refresh
every soft with the mechanism

644
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:19,620
every soft with the mechanism
 

645
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,840
every soft with the mechanism

seems like the range on the gold is only

648
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:22,889
seems like the range on the gold is only
 

649
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:24,620
seems like the range on the gold is only
about eight blocks though then they'll

650
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:24,630
about eight blocks though then they'll
 

651
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:30,079
about eight blocks though then they'll
see it very far and also if they spawn

652
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:30,089
see it very far and also if they spawn
 

653
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:31,879
see it very far and also if they spawn
near zombie pigmen they try to run away

654
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:31,889
near zombie pigmen they try to run away
 

655
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:33,680
near zombie pigmen they try to run away
from them and that can mess up their

656
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:33,690
from them and that can mess up their
 

657
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:39,490
from them and that can mess up their
path by me like that guys running away

658
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:39,500

 

659
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,870

this does work on the baby ones though

660
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:41,880
this does work on the baby ones though
 

661
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,259
this does work on the baby ones though
which is kind of cool but yeah anyways

662
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:45,269
which is kind of cool but yeah anyways
 

663
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:46,910
which is kind of cool but yeah anyways
we're back to the real let's play world

we're back to the real let's play world
here at DM and other idea is maybe we

666
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:49,500
here at DM and other idea is maybe we
 

667
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,769
here at DM and other idea is maybe we
just built a new cold farmland gold firm

668
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:51,779
just built a new cold farmland gold firm
 

669
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,780
just built a new cold farmland gold firm
number four could be fun

670
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:53,790
number four could be fun
 

671
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,879
number four could be fun
I do like building gold farms and

672
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:55,889
I do like building gold farms and
 

673
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:58,040
I do like building gold farms and
there's been a lot of a lot of changes

674
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,050
there's been a lot of a lot of changes
 

675
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,319
there's been a lot of a lot of changes
that might be worth doing because gold

676
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:00,329
that might be worth doing because gold
 

677
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:01,579
that might be worth doing because gold
is super valuable because you're

678
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:01,589
is super valuable because you're
 

679
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:03,259
is super valuable because you're
basically trading it for these items now

680
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:03,269
basically trading it for these items now
 

681
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,090
basically trading it for these items now
I don't think I'm gonna be making golden

682
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:05,100
I don't think I'm gonna be making golden
 

683
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,910
I don't think I'm gonna be making golden
carats anymore that's kind of a waste if

684
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
carats anymore that's kind of a waste if
 

685
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,400
carats anymore that's kind of a waste if
you can get these kind of goodies also

686
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,410
you can get these kind of goodies also
 

687
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,079
you can get these kind of goodies also

Oh which is super rare it's like a 1 in

694
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:18,529
Oh which is super rare it's like a 1 in
 

695

200 and something chance here we go

696
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,290
200 and something chance here we go
 

697
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,009
200 and something chance here we go
again so we are deep down in the nether

698
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:25,019
again so we are deep down in the nether
 

699
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:27,400

here guys in new terrain a workforce

700
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:27,410
here guys in new terrain a workforce
 

701
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,590

down at y level 15 you guys told me this

702
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:30,600
down at y level 15 you guys told me this
 

703

is a good level apparently for finding

704
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:32,490
is a good level apparently for finding
 

705
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,210
is a good level apparently for finding
the ancient debris so I'm gonna try a

706
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:35,220
the ancient debris so I'm gonna try a
 

707
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,800
the ancient debris so I'm gonna try a
different method this episode last

708
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:36,810
different method this episode last
 

709
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,870
different method this episode last
episode we did the TNT method which I

710
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
episode we did the TNT method which I
 

711
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,240
episode we did the TNT method which I
felt worked not too bad actually I

712
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,250
felt worked not too bad actually I
 

713
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,650
felt worked not too bad actually I
thought that was pretty good it was fun

714
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:42,660
thought that was pretty good it was fun
 

715
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:47,269
thought that was pretty good it was fun
a little dangerous we we paid the price

716
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:47,279
a little dangerous we we paid the price
 

717
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,889
a little dangerous we we paid the price
at the end because I got a little

718
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:48,899
at the end because I got a little
 

719
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,370
at the end because I got a little
careless but this is a more safe method

720
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:52,380
careless but this is a more safe method
 

721
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,199
careless but this is a more safe method
although the lava pockets are pretty

722
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:54,209
although the lava pockets are pretty
 

723
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:57,889
although the lava pockets are pretty
freaky so far I found one I'm gonna I'm

724
00:15:57,889 --> 00:15:57,899
freaky so far I found one I'm gonna I'm
 

725
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,420
freaky so far I found one I'm gonna I'm
gonna mine for bid I'm not gonna harvest

726
00:15:59,420 --> 00:15:59,430
gonna mine for bid I'm not gonna harvest
 

727
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,670
gonna mine for bid I'm not gonna harvest
them until the end and just like mark

728
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
them until the end and just like mark
 

729
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,069
them until the end and just like mark
them and see I'll spread it out they are

730
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
them and see I'll spread it out they are
 

731
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,189
them and see I'll spread it out they are
and how much mining I need to do so far

732
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
and how much mining I need to do so far
 

733
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,710
and how much mining I need to do so far
it feels slower than the TNT method but

734
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:09,720
it feels slower than the TNT method but
 

735
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,929
it feels slower than the TNT method but
I'm gonna go for a bit here you had a

736
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:11,939
I'm gonna go for a bit here you had a
 

737
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:18,910
I'm gonna go for a bit here you had a
better feel for it

738
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:18,920

 

739
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,430

whoa all right so we didn't do too bad

740
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:22,440
whoa all right so we didn't do too bad
 

741
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,009
whoa all right so we didn't do too bad
here actually like started off really

742
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:25,019
here actually like started off really
 

743
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,590
here actually like started off really
slow we found the one and then if you

744
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
slow we found the one and then if you
 

745
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,879
slow we found the one and then if you
look over there I marked them all with

746
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:28,889
look over there I marked them all with
 

747
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:29,540
look over there I marked them all with
torches

748
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:29,550
torches
 

749
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,480
torches
there's no torches over there I did a

750
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:32,490
there's no torches over there I did a
 

751
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,420
there's no torches over there I did a
big section as like man this is not this

752
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:35,430
big section as like man this is not this
 

753
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,629
big section as like man this is not this
is not good not good at all let's start

754
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
is not good not good at all let's start
 

755
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,569
is not good not good at all let's start
buying these but then I hit like a

756
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:41,579
buying these but then I hit like a
 

757
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,819
buying these but then I hit like a
pocket of like five in a row or

758
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:43,829
pocket of like five in a row or
 

759
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:45,290
pocket of like five in a row or
something then there was nothing that I

760
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:45,300
something then there was nothing that I
 

761
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,449
something then there was nothing that I
I hit another pocket and then nothing

762
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:47,459
I hit another pocket and then nothing
 

763
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,850
I hit another pocket and then nothing
and then another pocket so because

764
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:49,860
and then another pocket so because
 

765
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,999
and then another pocket so because
they're like so rare I feel like when

766
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:53,009
they're like so rare I feel like when
 

767
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:54,740
they're like so rare I feel like when
you're mining them you you go through

768
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:54,750
you're mining them you you go through
 

769
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,800
you're mining them you you go through
these like empty stretches oh there was

770
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:57,810
these like empty stretches oh there was
 

771
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,750
these like empty stretches oh there was
one below hey I'll take it

772
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:01,760
one below hey I'll take it
 

773
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,010
one below hey I'll take it

775
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,480

yeah sometimes you'll go for a long time

776
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,490
yeah sometimes you'll go for a long time
 

777
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,980
yeah sometimes you'll go for a long time
without DNA and then you'll get a whole

778
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:06,990
without DNA and then you'll get a whole
 

779
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,590
without DNA and then you'll get a whole
bunch sometimes they spawn together like

780
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
bunch sometimes they spawn together like
 

781
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,750
bunch sometimes they spawn together like
this like where there's two I found one

782
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
this like where there's two I found one
 

783
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,640
this like where there's two I found one
with three together which is cool and

784
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:16,650
with three together which is cool and
 

785
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,319
with three together which is cool and
why 15 here though they're definitely

786
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:18,329
why 15 here though they're definitely
 

787
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,919
why 15 here though they're definitely
more prevalent than up above when we did

788
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:21,929
more prevalent than up above when we did
 

789
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:24,079
more prevalent than up above when we did
the TNT mining so I think TNT mining at

790
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,089
the TNT mining so I think TNT mining at
 

791
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:29,200
the TNT mining so I think TNT mining at
this level is probably the way to go

792
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,210

 

793
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,520

anyways let's I also found it kind of

794
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:34,530
anyways let's I also found it kind of
 

795
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,620
anyways let's I also found it kind of
weird like most of them did not spawn in

796
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:36,630
weird like most of them did not spawn in
 

797
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,200
weird like most of them did not spawn in
the ceiling level here only come looking

798
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,210
the ceiling level here only come looking
 

799
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,330
the ceiling level here only come looking
to at this level most of them are either

800
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:44,340
to at this level most of them are either
 

801
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,740
to at this level most of them are either
in the ground or one block above

802
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:48,750

 

803
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,890

yeah check this out here's their triple

804
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:50,900
yeah check this out here's their triple
 

805
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,060
yeah check this out here's their triple
there was one underneath here man I

806
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,070
there was one underneath here man I
 

807
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,990
there was one underneath here man I
would freak out get four together and

808
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:57,000
would freak out get four together and
 

809
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,820
would freak out get four together and
good stuff so we mined them all up there

810
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:58,830
good stuff so we mined them all up there
 

811
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,850
good stuff so we mined them all up there
we got 18 ancient debris from that and

812
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:01,860
we got 18 ancient debris from that and
 

813
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,580
we got 18 ancient debris from that and
that took about two full pics to mine up

814
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:04,590
that took about two full pics to mine up
 

815
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,070
that took about two full pics to mine up
so now that we got our ancient debris we

816
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,080
so now that we got our ancient debris we
 

817
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,620
so now that we got our ancient debris we
got to smelt it and put in the blast

818
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:09,630
got to smelt it and put in the blast
 

819
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,680
got to smelt it and put in the blast
furnace if we want to smelt it quickly

820
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:11,690
furnace if we want to smelt it quickly
 

821
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,000
furnace if we want to smelt it quickly
just want to double-check we can do it

822
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,010
just want to double-check we can do it
 

823
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,310
just want to double-check we can do it
in the furnace yeah okay just wanted to

824
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
in the furnace yeah okay just wanted to
 

825
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,950
in the furnace yeah okay just wanted to
make sure then throw it in here so that

826
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:18,960
make sure then throw it in here so that
 

827
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,529
make sure then throw it in here so that
makes net the right scrap I did check

828
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:24,539
makes net the right scrap I did check
 

829
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,149
makes net the right scrap I did check
like they'd be good break down the

830
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:26,159
like they'd be good break down the
 

831
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:28,430
like they'd be good break down the
nether right hosing it from the big lens

832
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:28,440
nether right hosing it from the big lens
 

833
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,110
nether right hosing it from the big lens
into this but I don't think you can

834
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120
into this but I don't think you can
 

835
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,700
into this but I don't think you can
otherwise there'd be a way of like

836
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:32,710
otherwise there'd be a way of like
 

837
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,760
otherwise there'd be a way of like
farming nether right which would be

838
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:35,770
farming nether right which would be
 

839
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,090
farming nether right which would be
interesting but that's not a thing yet

840
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,100
interesting but that's not a thing yet
 

841
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,270
interesting but that's not a thing yet
anyway

842
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280
anyway
 

843
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,970
anyway
you combine four of these together with

844
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:41,980
you combine four of these together with
 

845
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,190
you combine four of these together with
four gold you get the nether right in

846
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:44,200
four gold you get the nether right in
 

847
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,660
four gold you get the nether right in
yet so we have enough for four ingots to

848
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:48,670
yet so we have enough for four ingots to
 

849
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,690
yet so we have enough for four ingots to
start off with here which isn't a lot

850
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:50,700
start off with here which isn't a lot
 

851
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,100
start off with here which isn't a lot
now you don't like make boots like this

852
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,110
now you don't like make boots like this
 

853
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,320
now you don't like make boots like this
or anything no no no what you do is you

854
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,330
or anything no no no what you do is you
 

855
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,060
or anything no no no what you do is you
just take your piece of diamond armor

856
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,070
just take your piece of diamond armor
 

857
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,530
just take your piece of diamond armor
and then you upgrade it with one like so

858
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:00,540
and then you upgrade it with one like so
 

859
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,820
and then you upgrade it with one like so
so I'm gonna go for a full set of armor

860
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:02,830
so I'm gonna go for a full set of armor
 

861
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,220
so I'm gonna go for a full set of armor
just to begin with you can make tools

862
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,230
just to begin with you can make tools
 

863
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,930
just to begin with you can make tools
out of it as well which would be nice

864
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:06,940
out of it as well which would be nice
 

865
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,920
out of it as well which would be nice
but we don't have enough right now now I

866
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:09,930
but we don't have enough right now now I
 

867
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,960
but we don't have enough right now now I
this one is damaged or actually let's do

868
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:12,970
this one is damaged or actually let's do
 

869
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,640
this one is damaged or actually let's do
this one first so this is it's got an

870
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:14,650
this one first so this is it's got an
 

871
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,830
this one first so this is it's got an
enchantment on I think you lose the

872
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:16,840
enchantment on I think you lose the
 

873
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,330
enchantment on I think you lose the
enchantment yuppers no enchantments

874
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:21,340
enchantment yuppers no enchantments
 

875
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,340
enchantment yuppers no enchantments
this one's damaged I don't know if it

876
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:23,350
this one's damaged I don't know if it
 

877
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,690
this one's damaged I don't know if it
fully repairs it looks like it does okay

878
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:26,700
fully repairs it looks like it does okay
 

879
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:35,130
fully repairs it looks like it does okay
cool cool and so I don't waste that so

880
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:35,140
cool cool and so I don't waste that so
 

881
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:40,550
cool cool and so I don't waste that so
we got our full set let's put it on Oh

882
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:40,560

 

883
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,980

snappers I don't know wait a second

884
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:45,990
snappers I don't know wait a second
 

885
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:51,270
snappers I don't know wait a second
it it looks cool I do like it yeah I

886
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
it it looks cool I do like it yeah I
 

887
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,620
it it looks cool I do like it yeah I
don't know about the helmet though I

888
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:52,630
don't know about the helmet though I
 

889
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,710
don't know about the helmet though I
don't like that line in the front

890
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
don't like that line in the front
 

891
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,670
don't like that line in the front
diamond helmets don't have that oh they

892
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:56,680
diamond helmets don't have that oh they
 

893
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,420
diamond helmets don't have that oh they
do they do

894
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:57,430
do they do
 

895
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:03,300
do they do
I guess it's consistent then seems weird

896
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,310
I guess it's consistent then seems weird
 

897
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,610
I guess it's consistent then seems weird
my guy really looks cross-eyed with that

898
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:05,620
my guy really looks cross-eyed with that
 

899
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,160
my guy really looks cross-eyed with that
line in the in between the eyes now I

900
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,170
line in the in between the eyes now I
 

901
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,690
line in the in between the eyes now I
want to give it a little trial here to

902
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:09,700
want to give it a little trial here to
 

903
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,720
want to give it a little trial here to
test it out so this is pretty much the

904
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:12,730
test it out so this is pretty much the
 

905
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,670
test it out so this is pretty much the
same as diamond armor like we get the

906
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:14,680
same as diamond armor like we get the
 

907
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,250
same as diamond armor like we get the
same number of armor bars it does

908
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:17,260
same number of armor bars it does
 

909
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,260
same number of armor bars it does
actually protect a little bit better

910
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:19,270
actually protect a little bit better
 

911
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,520
actually protect a little bit better
than diamond armor though like if you

912
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:20,530
than diamond armor though like if you
 

913
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,350
than diamond armor though like if you
look at the pants on Diamond armor it

914
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:22,360
look at the pants on Diamond armor it
 

915
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,620
look at the pants on Diamond armor it
says to Armour toughness +6 armor if you

916
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:25,630
says to Armour toughness +6 armor if you
 

917
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,610
says to Armour toughness +6 armor if you
look at these again it's +6 armor but +3

918
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:29,620
look at these again it's +6 armor but +3
 

919
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,980
look at these again it's +6 armor but +3
armor toughness so one higher their

920
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:31,990
armor toughness so one higher their
 

921
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,690
armor toughness so one higher their
armor toughness is like if you take a

922
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:33,700
armor toughness is like if you take a
 

923
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,030
armor toughness is like if you take a
heavy hit it protects you better if you

924
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,040
heavy hit it protects you better if you
 

925
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,560
heavy hit it protects you better if you
take a weak hit from something it

926
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:37,570
take a weak hit from something it
 

927
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,430
take a weak hit from something it
doesn't really do much for you so it's

928
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:41,440
doesn't really do much for you so it's
 

929
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,190
doesn't really do much for you so it's
like slightly better than the diamond

930
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:44,200
like slightly better than the diamond
 

931
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,790
like slightly better than the diamond
armor

932
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:44,800
armor
 

933
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,080
armor
the big thing though is it has higher

934
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,090
the big thing though is it has higher
 

935
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,240
the big thing though is it has higher
durability it looks a little different

936
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,250
durability it looks a little different
 

937
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,090
durability it looks a little different
and it also has knock-back resistance

938
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:51,100
and it also has knock-back resistance
 

939
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,420
and it also has knock-back resistance
which I think might be interesting

940
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:53,430
which I think might be interesting
 

941
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:58,410
which I think might be interesting
wanted to check that out so I don't know

942
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:58,420
wanted to check that out so I don't know
 

943
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,300
wanted to check that out so I don't know
if knock-back still works the same as it

944
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:00,310
if knock-back still works the same as it
 

945
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,890
if knock-back still works the same as it
did a few years ago I haven't tested it

946
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:01,900
did a few years ago I haven't tested it
 

947
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,680
did a few years ago I haven't tested it
in a long time that went right through

948
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:04,690
in a long time that went right through
 

949
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:13,790
in a long time that went right through
me what really gonna shoot myself here

950
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:13,800
me what really gonna shoot myself here
 

951
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,100
me what really gonna shoot myself here
ok we gotta have a I gotta change this

952
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,110
ok we gotta have a I gotta change this
 

953
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,360
ok we gotta have a I gotta change this
up a bit that's not gonna work

954
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,370
up a bit that's not gonna work
 

955
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,920
up a bit that's not gonna work
alright we're gonna do some science

956
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:19,930
alright we're gonna do some science
 

957
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,510
alright we're gonna do some science
stuff here so we're gonna try to test it

958
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
stuff here so we're gonna try to test it
 

959
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,550
stuff here so we're gonna try to test it
like this where we load the dispenser

960
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:23,560
like this where we load the dispenser
 

961
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,690
like this where we load the dispenser
with arrows and then it'll shoot

962
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:24,700
with arrows and then it'll shoot
 

963
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,360
with arrows and then it'll shoot
ourselves and see how much we get

964
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,370
ourselves and see how much we get
 

965
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,190
ourselves and see how much we get
knocked back I'm gonna do it without

966
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,200
knocked back I'm gonna do it without
 

967
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,990
knocked back I'm gonna do it without
armor to begin with and then we'll try

968
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,000
armor to begin with and then we'll try
 

969
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,340
armor to begin with and then we'll try
it with the nether right Armour with the

970
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:32,350
it with the nether right Armour with the
 

971
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,800
it with the nether right Armour with the
knock back resistance so a little

972
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:34,810
knock back resistance so a little
 

973
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,650
knock back resistance so a little
history last time I tried testing out

974
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:37,660
history last time I tried testing out
 

975
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,600
history last time I tried testing out
knock back a few years ago the way it

976
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:39,610
knock back a few years ago the way it
 

977
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,830
knock back a few years ago the way it
worked was it would randomly roll

978
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:42,840
worked was it would randomly roll
 

979
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,200
worked was it would randomly roll
between four different numbers it was

980
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,210
between four different numbers it was
 

981
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,450
between four different numbers it was
like it let's say someone hit you with a

982
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:48,460
like it let's say someone hit you with a
 

983
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,640
like it let's say someone hit you with a
sword the amount you get knocked back

984
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:50,650
sword the amount you get knocked back
 

985
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,910
sword the amount you get knocked back
from that hits is random it would choose

986
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:53,920
from that hits is random it would choose
 

987
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,250
from that hits is random it would choose
between four numbers and if they were

988
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:56,260
between four numbers and if they were
 

989
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,020
between four numbers and if they were
sprinting when they hit you it would

990
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,030
sprinting when they hit you it would
 

991
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,000
sprinting when they hit you it would
also apply a multiplier of I think like

992
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,010
also apply a multiplier of I think like
 

993
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,840
also apply a multiplier of I think like
1.1 or something one of the hits though

994
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:03,850
1.1 or something one of the hits though
 

995
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,180
1.1 or something one of the hits though
one of the random choices out of the

996
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,190
one of the random choices out of the
 

997
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,760
one of the random choices out of the
four was like a critical knock back and

998
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:08,770
four was like a critical knock back and
 

999
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,320
four was like a critical knock back and
you would get knocked back way further

1000
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,330
you would get knocked back way further
 

1001
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,680
you would get knocked back way further
than that the other three so I'm kind of

1002
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:13,690
than that the other three so I'm kind of
 

1003
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,390
than that the other three so I'm kind of
curious if that still applies so I'm

1004
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:15,400
curious if that still applies so I'm
 

1005
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,960
curious if that still applies so I'm
gonna let's look at our Zed

1006
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:18,970
gonna let's look at our Zed
 

1007
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,310
gonna let's look at our Zed
Zed's is the important one here so we're

1008
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,320
Zed's is the important one here so we're
 

1009
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,640
Zed's is the important one here so we're
at 150 point seven one forty nine seven

1010
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:26,650
at 150 point seven one forty nine seven
 

1011
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:32,010
at 150 point seven one forty nine seven
two eight seventeen just gonna do a

1012
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,020
two eight seventeen just gonna do a
 

1013
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,920
two eight seventeen just gonna do a
couple rolls here I got rid of the slabs

1014
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:34,930
couple rolls here I got rid of the slabs
 

1015
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,810
couple rolls here I got rid of the slabs
on the side here because I kept bumping

1016
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:36,820
on the side here because I kept bumping
 

1017
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,220
on the side here because I kept bumping
into them and it was messing up the

1018
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,230
into them and it was messing up the
 

1019
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,560
into them and it was messing up the
results without them there now it's a

1020
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:40,570
results without them there now it's a
 

1021
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,110
results without them there now it's a
lot more consistent and we seem to go

1022
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120
lot more consistent and we seem to go
 

1023
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,180
lot more consistent and we seem to go
about two one forty nine point seven

1024
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,190
about two one forty nine point seven
 

1025
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,370
about two one forty nine point seven
thirteen on the z-coordinate just about

1026
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:47,380
thirteen on the z-coordinate just about
 

1027
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,280
thirteen on the z-coordinate just about
every time here little variations are if

1028
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,290
every time here little variations are if
 

1029
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,580
every time here little variations are if
I'm not centered wrong completely or we

1030
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:53,590
I'm not centered wrong completely or we
 

1031
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,470
I'm not centered wrong completely or we
got seven twelve that time or like

1032
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:55,480
got seven twelve that time or like
 

1033
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,570
got seven twelve that time or like
arrows don't exactly come out perfectly

1034
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:57,580
arrows don't exactly come out perfectly
 

1035
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,710
arrows don't exactly come out perfectly
straight either

1036
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
straight either
 

1037
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,770
straight either
from the dispenser I have no other way

1038
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:01,780
from the dispenser I have no other way
 

1039
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,500
from the dispenser I have no other way
of hitting myself though but it seems to

1040
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:04,510
of hitting myself though but it seems to
 

1041
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,770
of hitting myself though but it seems to
only pick one knock back value like it's

1042
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:07,780
only pick one knock back value like it's
 

1043
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,360
only pick one knock back value like it's
always the same so with that in mind I

1044
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,370
always the same so with that in mind I
 

1045
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,039
always the same so with that in mind I
don't know if that it's still like that

1046
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:14,049
don't know if that it's still like that
 

1047
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:16,649
don't know if that it's still like that
with sword combat I can't test it with

1048
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:16,659
with sword combat I can't test it with
 

1049
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:18,390
with sword combat I can't test it with
dispensers it only picks one knock back

1050
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
dispensers it only picks one knock back
 

1051
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,750
dispensers it only picks one knock back
value we know that now so now that we

1052
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:21,760
value we know that now so now that we
 

1053
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,289
value we know that now so now that we
have the nether right armor on let's get

1054
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:25,299
have the nether right armor on let's get
 

1055
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:31,200
have the nether right armor on let's get
centered again didn't move oh okay so

1056
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,210
centered again didn't move oh okay so
 

1057
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,590
centered again didn't move oh okay so
it's really good armor that time we did

1058
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:34,600
it's really good armor that time we did
 

1059
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:43,560
it's really good armor that time we did
Oh what did it move interesting okay so

1060
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:43,570
Oh what did it move interesting okay so
 

1061
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,080
Oh what did it move interesting okay so
sometimes it activates sometimes it

1062
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,090
sometimes it activates sometimes it
 

1063
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,430
sometimes it activates sometimes it
doesn't I'm a pincushion here I'm

1064
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:50,440
doesn't I'm a pincushion here I'm
 

1065
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,289
doesn't I'm a pincushion here I'm
figuring it out though so knock back

1066
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:52,299
figuring it out though so knock back
 

1067
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,149
figuring it out though so knock back
resistance seems to do two things

1068
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
resistance seems to do two things
 

1069
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,020
resistance seems to do two things
actually first off the more knock back

1070
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,030
actually first off the more knock back
 

1071
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,380
actually first off the more knock back
resistance you have the more likely you

1072
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:01,390
resistance you have the more likely you
 

1073
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,830
resistance you have the more likely you
won't be knocked back so with a full set

1074
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:04,840
won't be knocked back so with a full set
 

1075
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,750
won't be knocked back so with a full set
here we have plus four knock back

1076
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:06,760
here we have plus four knock back
 

1077
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,510
here we have plus four knock back
resistance so three in a row there we

1078
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
resistance so three in a row there we
 

1079
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,520
resistance so three in a row there we
got knocked back this time we didn't did

1080
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:13,530
got knocked back this time we didn't did
 

1081
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:19,100
got knocked back this time we didn't did
did did forget an unlucky here did

1082
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,110
did did forget an unlucky here did
 

1083
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:23,610
did did forget an unlucky here did
didn't didn't I think it's about maybe

1084
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:23,620
didn't didn't I think it's about maybe
 

1085
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,320
didn't didn't I think it's about maybe
thirty or forty percent of the time we

1086
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:25,330
thirty or forty percent of the time we
 

1087
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,090
thirty or forty percent of the time we
don't get knocked back with a full set

1088
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,100
don't get knocked back with a full set
 

1089
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,120
don't get knocked back with a full set
of armor which is pretty good

1090
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,130
of armor which is pretty good
 

1091
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,860
of armor which is pretty good
the other thing knocked back resistance

1092
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:31,870
the other thing knocked back resistance
 

1093
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,320
the other thing knocked back resistance
does is affects how far we get knocked

1094
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,330
does is affects how far we get knocked
 

1095
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,250
does is affects how far we get knocked
back so we're going to knock back to

1096
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:38,260
back so we're going to knock back to
 

1097
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,240
back so we're going to knock back to
about 150 point 261 here right with no

1098
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,250
about 150 point 261 here right with no
 

1099
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:47,460
about 150 point 261 here right with no
armor we go all the way to 149 713 so

1100
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:47,470
armor we go all the way to 149 713 so
 

1101
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,159
armor we go all the way to 149 713 so
with full armor we're getting might half

1102
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:50,169
with full armor we're getting might half
 

1103
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:53,970
with full armor we're getting might half
the knock back distance which is not bad

1104
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:53,980
the knock back distance which is not bad
 

1105
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,620
the knock back distance which is not bad
and then as we remove more and more

1106
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:55,630
and then as we remove more and more
 

1107
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,080
and then as we remove more and more
pieces the number changes as well so

1108
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,090
pieces the number changes as well so

goes to the point 0 with 30.1 yeah so

1116
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:21,029
goes to the point 0 with 30.1 yeah so
 

1117
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:23,029
goes to the point 0 with 30.1 yeah so
each piece makes a little bit of

1118
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039
each piece makes a little bit of
 

1119
