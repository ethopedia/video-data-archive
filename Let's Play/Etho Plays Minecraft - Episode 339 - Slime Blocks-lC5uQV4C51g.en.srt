00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:08,850
of depends on my frame rate it seems run
 

165
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,440
of depends on my frame rate it seems run
on people's frame rates so when I wasn't

166
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,450
on people's frame rates so when I wasn't
 

167
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,840
on people's frame rates so when I wasn't
recording this worked very well now that

168
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:14,850
recording this worked very well now that
 

169
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,960
recording this worked very well now that
I am recording my frame rate drops down

170
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:17,970
I am recording my frame rate drops down
 

171
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,880
I am recording my frame rate drops down
to thirty frames per second right that's

172
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:19,890
to thirty frames per second right that's
 

173
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,260
to thirty frames per second right that's
what I have it locked at and

174
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,270
what I have it locked at and
 

175
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,499
what I have it locked at and
it becomes pretty apparent that boats

176
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:25,509
it becomes pretty apparent that boats
 

177
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:27,719
it becomes pretty apparent that boats
have a little bit of an issue when when

178
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:27,729
have a little bit of an issue when when
 

179
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:32,240
have a little bit of an issue when when
using this so let me show you all right

180
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,250
using this so let me show you all right
 

181
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,920
using this so let me show you all right
so on the second jump already is when it

182
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:34,930
so on the second jump already is when it
 

183
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,969
so on the second jump already is when it
started happening

184
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:35,979
started happening
 

185
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:44,870
started happening
the desync whoo I'm sailing away and

186
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
the desync whoo I'm sailing away and
 

187
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,469
the desync whoo I'm sailing away and
down we go and now we finally hit the

188
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:49,479
down we go and now we finally hit the
 

189
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,279
down we go and now we finally hit the
ground for real so yeah it does work

190
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:53,289
ground for real so yeah it does work
 

191
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:54,779
ground for real so yeah it does work
what what's happening though is it's

192
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:54,789
what what's happening though is it's
 

193
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:57,480
what what's happening though is it's
rendering my character in a different

194
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,490
rendering my character in a different
 

195
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,779
rendering my character in a different
spot somehow there's a desync of where

196
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:00,789
spot somehow there's a desync of where
 

197
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:02,700
spot somehow there's a desync of where
it actually calculates where you are and

198
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:02,710
it actually calculates where you are and
 

199
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,950
it actually calculates where you are and
where it shows where you are which I

200
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
where it shows where you are which I
 

201
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,969
where it shows where you are which I
don't really understand but let's try

202
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:08,979
don't really understand but let's try
 

203
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:15,120
don't really understand but let's try
write it again Oh

204
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,130

 

205
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,020

even on the first jump it messed up Wow

206
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,030
even on the first jump it messed up Wow
 

207
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,189
even on the first jump it messed up Wow
yeah so you can hear the Pistons are

208
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:20,199
yeah so you can hear the Pistons are
 

209
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,689
yeah so you can hear the Pistons are
still activating up there it is

210
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:21,699
still activating up there it is
 

211
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,760
still activating up there it is
calculating things properly it's not

212
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:23,770
calculating things properly it's not
 

213
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,879
calculating things properly it's not
drawing things properly and you'll

214
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:26,889
drawing things properly and you'll
 

215
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,180
drawing things properly and you'll
notice if I get out of the boat here it

216
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,190
notice if I get out of the boat here it
 

217
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,120
notice if I get out of the boat here it
puts me in a totally different spot so

218
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,130
puts me in a totally different spot so
 

219
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,860
puts me in a totally different spot so
yeah to the eyes it's it's trickery but

220
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:37,870
yeah to the eyes it's it's trickery but
 

221
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,570
yeah to the eyes it's it's trickery but
it actually is figuring things out

222
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:39,580
it actually is figuring things out
 

223
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,610
it actually is figuring things out
properly and it does work properly so

224
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:41,620
properly and it does work properly so
 

225
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,350
properly and it does work properly so
that's good hopefully in a future

226
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
that's good hopefully in a future
 

227
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,700
that's good hopefully in a future
version of Minecraft we will have

228
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:44,710
version of Minecraft we will have
 

229
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,560
version of Minecraft we will have
working boats but yeah so that's pretty

230
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:49,570
working boats but yeah so that's pretty
 

231
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,939
working boats but yeah so that's pretty
cool I think I'm gonna mess around with

232
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:50,949
cool I think I'm gonna mess around with
 

233
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,770
cool I think I'm gonna mess around with
eats Road stuff in the future my let's

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:52,780
eats Road stuff in the future my let's
 

235
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,159
eats Road stuff in the future my let's
play maybe even today I don't know we'll

236
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:56,169
play maybe even today I don't know we'll
 

237
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,770
play maybe even today I don't know we'll
see how things go I tried a boat

238
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:58,780
see how things go I tried a boat
 

239
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,020
see how things go I tried a boat
launching thing here see if I still have

240
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,030
launching thing here see if I still have
 

241
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,529
launching thing here see if I still have
boats in yep pretty simple all you

242
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:04,539
boats in yep pretty simple all you
 

243
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:06,930
boats in yep pretty simple all you
really need is a dispenser with boats in

244
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:06,940
really need is a dispenser with boats in
 

245
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,709
really need is a dispenser with boats in
water above that and then two right next

246
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:10,719
water above that and then two right next
 

247
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:12,209
water above that and then two right next
to the water have the slime block with

248
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:12,219
to the water have the slime block with
 

249
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:15,839
to the water have the slime block with
the sticky piston below and activate it

250
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:15,849
the sticky piston below and activate it
 

251
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:18,350
the sticky piston below and activate it
one tick after you activate the

252
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:18,360
one tick after you activate the
 

253
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,330
one tick after you activate the
dispenser pretty cool though I got I got

254
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:24,340
dispenser pretty cool though I got I got
 

255
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,559
dispenser pretty cool though I got I got

anytime it updates next to the piston it

266
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:43,659
anytime it updates next to the piston it
 

267
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:48,989
anytime it updates next to the piston it
will it'll do that so you can have like

268
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:48,999
will it'll do that so you can have like
 

269
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:52,850
will it'll do that so you can have like
a redstone wire up here for example and

270
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:52,860
a redstone wire up here for example and
 

271
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,499
a redstone wire up here for example and
every time it activates it will send a

272
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:55,509
every time it activates it will send a
 

273
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:00,119
every time it activates it will send a
pulse to that I believe or not wait a

actually tested it oh yeah it does work

278
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:08,169
actually tested it oh yeah it does work
 

279
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:12,359
actually tested it oh yeah it does work
is this really quick I guess yeah that's

280
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:12,369
is this really quick I guess yeah that's
 

281
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:15,209

get an ender pearl yeah it's just a

00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:31,659
get an ender pearl yeah it's just a
 

291
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,779

little too inconsistent to actually try

292
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:33,789
little too inconsistent to actually try
 

293
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:36,109
little too inconsistent to actually try
it try to get this working properly

294
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:36,119
it try to get this working properly
 

295
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:42,239
it try to get this working properly
throw it up nope and ender pearls they

296
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:42,249
throw it up nope and ender pearls they
 

297
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:43,709

eyes doing it this way and I was hoping

300
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:45,099
eyes doing it this way and I was hoping
 

301
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:46,589
eyes doing it this way and I was hoping
I could just keep bouncing it over and

302
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:46,599
I could just keep bouncing it over and
 

303
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,919
I could just keep bouncing it over and
over with this with this slime block

304
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:49,929
over with this with this slime block
 

305
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:54,359
over with this with this slime block
thing I got it to bounce twice but it's

306
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:54,369
thing I got it to bounce twice but it's
 

307
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:58,199
thing I got it to bounce twice but it's
is this too inconsistent you throw it

308
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:58,209
is this too inconsistent you throw it
 

309
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:01,529
is this too inconsistent you throw it
kind of randomly and the release time is

310
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:01,539
kind of randomly and the release time is
 

311
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:05,069
kind of randomly and the release time is
random and yeah the fence gate is tried

312
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:05,079
random and yeah the fence gate is tried
 

313
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:09,329
random and yeah the fence gate is tried
is to try to control when it's actually

314
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:09,339
is to try to control when it's actually
 

315
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:11,069
is to try to control when it's actually
released a little bit better but still

316
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:11,079
released a little bit better but still
 

317
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,980
released a little bit better but still
it doesn't work too well so that idea

318
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:13,990
it doesn't work too well so that idea
 

319
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,980
it doesn't work too well so that idea
was a flop some people did make devices

320
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:16,990
was a flop some people did make devices
 

321
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,749
was a flop some people did make devices
though that were able to bounce an ender

322
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:18,759

out this is when I I worked out but I

334
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
out this is when I I worked out but I
 

335
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,790

this so I never bothered making a video

338
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:41,529
this so I never bothered making a video
 

339
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:45,629
this so I never bothered making a video
on it but it seems to work pretty good

340
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:45,639
on it but it seems to work pretty good
 

341
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,249
on it but it seems to work pretty good
very simple to set up

342
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:47,259
very simple to set up
 

343
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:52,550
very simple to set up
is it glitched out oh it is good to know

344
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560

 

345
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,930

there's some issues still like slime

346
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:54,940
there's some issues still like slime
 

347

blocks sometimes get left behind I just

348
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
blocks sometimes get left behind I just
 

349
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,750

realized I never really showed how this

350
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:00,760
realized I never really showed how this
 

351
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,940
realized I never really showed how this
works so maybe I'll do that I tried

352
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:02,950
works so maybe I'll do that I tried
 

353
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,590
works so maybe I'll do that I tried
sending an empty boat through it while

354
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:04,600
sending an empty boat through it while
 

355
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,140
sending an empty boat through it while
recording and that seems to go okay so

356
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,150
recording and that seems to go okay so
 

357
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:12,900
recording and that seems to go okay so
we can watch it this way yeah pretty

358
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:12,910
we can watch it this way yeah pretty
 

359
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,810
we can watch it this way yeah pretty
cool so this this first water block

360
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:15,820
cool so this this first water block
 

361
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,870
cool so this this first water block
catches it and allows it it gives it a

362
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
catches it and allows it it gives it a
 

363
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,330
catches it and allows it it gives it a
little bit of time to to position itself

364
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:21,340
little bit of time to to position itself
 

365
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,880
little bit of time to to position itself
properly again and then the second water

366
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:23,890
properly again and then the second water
 

367
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,590
properly again and then the second water
block whew the second one here it's a

368
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:28,600
block whew the second one here it's a
 

369
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,960
block whew the second one here it's a
it's a moving stream right so that

370
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:30,970
it's a moving stream right so that
 

371
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,760
it's a moving stream right so that
allows it to keep its horizontal

372
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:32,770
allows it to keep its horizontal
 

373
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,700
allows it to keep its horizontal
momentum otherwise it would just like

374
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:35,710
momentum otherwise it would just like
 

375
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,740
momentum otherwise it would just like
slow down each jump and eventually it

376
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:37,750
slow down each jump and eventually it
 

377
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,030
slow down each jump and eventually it
will just drop right so that's cool and

378
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
will just drop right so that's cool and
 

379
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,590
will just drop right so that's cool and
since the boat is always trying to float

380
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
since the boat is always trying to float
 

381
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,220
since the boat is always trying to float
upwards this carpet prevents it from

382
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,230
upwards this carpet prevents it from
 

383
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,340
upwards this carpet prevents it from
from going upright and that keeps it in

384
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:50,350
from going upright and that keeps it in
 

385
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,780
from going upright and that keeps it in
the track but when it gets to this

386
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:51,790
the track but when it gets to this
 

387
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,500
the track but when it gets to this
pressure plates it didn't it can flow up

388
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:55,510
pressure plates it didn't it can flow up
 

389
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,990
pressure plates it didn't it can flow up
through that it triggers it and then

390
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
through that it triggers it and then
 

391
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,090
through that it triggers it and then
that also triggers the slime block which

392
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:00,100
that also triggers the slime block which
 

393
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,420
that also triggers the slime block which
it's positioned over and that sends it

394
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:03,430
it's positioned over and that sends it
 

395
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,020
it's positioned over and that sends it
sends it flying basically and this is

396
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,030
sends it flying basically and this is
 

397
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:12,780
sends it flying basically and this is
one two three four four blocks over one

398
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:12,790
one two three four four blocks over one
 

399
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:18,000

two three four five six seven up is
 

401
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,930
two three four five six seven up is
where the first water block is in case

402
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:21,940

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,310
let's see I think what I gotta do next
time I do one of these is have like I

484
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
time I do one of these is have like I
 

485
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,710
time I do one of these is have like I
had it hidden in here I need like a door

486
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
had it hidden in here I need like a door
 

487
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,870
had it hidden in here I need like a door
that opens and then it launches out of

488
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
that opens and then it launches out of
 

489
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,530
that opens and then it launches out of
it get like a proper missile silo going

490
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:58,540
it get like a proper missile silo going
 

491
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,710
it get like a proper missile silo going
on here all right so I've been trying to

492
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
on here all right so I've been trying to
 

493
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,930
on here all right so I've been trying to
decide what we should do for the rest of

494
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:06,940
decide what we should do for the rest of
 

495
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,870
decide what we should do for the rest of
episode get back here where are you

496
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:09,880
episode get back here where are you
 

497
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,220
episode get back here where are you
going I did mostly get that mob spawner

498
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,230
going I did mostly get that mob spawner
 

499
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,699
going I did mostly get that mob spawner
all set up - the only thing that's

500
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:17,709
all set up - the only thing that's
 

501
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:18,280
all set up - the only thing that's
missing

502
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,290
missing
 

503
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,259
missing
is to ocelots and I went to the jungle

504
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:20,269
is to ocelots and I went to the jungle
 

505
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,090
is to ocelots and I went to the jungle
to try to get more ocelots I even cut

506
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:22,100
to try to get more ocelots I even cut
 

507
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,489
to try to get more ocelots I even cut
down a bunch of trees so that there

508
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:24,499
down a bunch of trees so that there
 

509
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,409
down a bunch of trees so that there
would be a bunch of grass exposed and

510
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:26,419
would be a bunch of grass exposed and
 

511
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:30,249
would be a bunch of grass exposed and
hopefully they would spawn and no

512
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:30,259
hopefully they would spawn and no
 

513
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:35,019
hopefully they would spawn and no
ocelots so I could probably finish that

514
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:35,029
ocelots so I could probably finish that
 

515
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:37,299
ocelots so I could probably finish that
today but I think we should focus on

516
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:37,309
today but I think we should focus on
 

517
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,369
today but I think we should focus on
slime blocks today maybe next episode

518
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:39,379
slime blocks today maybe next episode
 

519
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:42,400
slime blocks today maybe next episode
will we'll check that out again so I had

520
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,410
will we'll check that out again so I had
 

521
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,949
will we'll check that out again so I had
a fun little idea that I thought I would

522
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:44,959
a fun little idea that I thought I would
 

523
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,279
a fun little idea that I thought I would
do with you guys try to invent something

524
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:48,289
do with you guys try to invent something
 

525
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:51,519
do with you guys try to invent something
together haven't done that in a while

526
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:51,529
together haven't done that in a while
 

527
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:54,699
together haven't done that in a while
for a long time I wanted to make sort of

528
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:54,709
for a long time I wanted to make sort of
 

529
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,710
for a long time I wanted to make sort of

that then I for some reason I got the
 

537
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:12,069
that then I for some reason I got the
impression that garage is correct and

538
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
impression that garage is correct and
 

539
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,590
impression that garage is correct and
I've been saying it ever since but I

540
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:14,600
I've been saying it ever since but I
 

541
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,759
I've been saying it ever since but I
sound like oh I feel like I'm

garage I don't know anyway I'm rambling
 

547
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,039
garage I don't know anyway I'm rambling
here so I want to make out like a horse

548
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:32,049
here so I want to make out like a horse
 

549
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:38,529
here so I want to make out like a horse
parking garage have you seen I think

550
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:38,539
parking garage have you seen I think
 

551
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:40,019
parking garage have you seen I think
it's a Japanese thing it's like a little

552
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:40,029
it's a Japanese thing it's like a little
 

553
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,909

00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:42,919
little garage thing they parked the car
 

555
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,379
little garage thing they parked the car
in it and then they press a button and

556
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:44,389
in it and then they press a button and
 

557
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:46,419
in it and then they press a button and
it like cycles to a different car it's

558
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:46,429
it like cycles to a different car it's
 

559
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:50,650
it like cycles to a different car it's
like on a conveyor belt and yeah that's

560
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:50,660
like on a conveyor belt and yeah that's
 

561
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,340
like on a conveyor belt and yeah that's
what I want to do with horses and we're

562
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:54,350
what I want to do with horses and we're
 

563
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,109
what I want to do with horses and we're
gonna try to using the new slime blocks

564
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:56,119
gonna try to using the new slime blocks
 

565
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:57,669
gonna try to using the new slime blocks
so anyway let's let's keep going here

566
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:57,679
so anyway let's let's keep going here
 

567
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,569
so anyway let's let's keep going here
and rambling for quite a bit so horses

568
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:01,579
and rambling for quite a bit so horses
 

569
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:05,970
and rambling for quite a bit so horses
they need like a 2x2 area so I figure

570
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:05,980
they need like a 2x2 area so I figure
 

571
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,699
they need like a 2x2 area so I figure
let's get 2 by 2 thing of slime blocks

572
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:09,709
let's get 2 by 2 thing of slime blocks
 

573
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,499
let's get 2 by 2 thing of slime blocks
down I guess we'll start it over here

574
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:11,509
down I guess we'll start it over here
 

575
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:15,279
down I guess we'll start it over here
this is just a like a work area we're

576
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:15,289
this is just a like a work area we're
 

577
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,119
this is just a like a work area we're
not actually putting it here the thing

578
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:19,129
not actually putting it here the thing
 

579
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:23,139
not actually putting it here the thing
is the mine carts have been reverted I

580
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:23,149
is the mine carts have been reverted I
 

581
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:26,590
is the mine carts have been reverted I
guess we gotta get rid of this too and

582
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:26,600
guess we gotta get rid of this too and
 

583
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,090
guess we gotta get rid of this too and
actually yeah we gotta get rid of all

584
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:28,100
actually yeah we gotta get rid of all
 

585
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,210
actually yeah we gotta get rid of all
this huh so they're no longer super fast

586
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:31,220
this huh so they're no longer super fast
 

587
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,200
this huh so they're no longer super fast
the mic

588
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,210
the mic
 

589
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,880
the mic
so I'm probably gonna be using horses

590
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:33,890
so I'm probably gonna be using horses
 

591
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:38,230
so I'm probably gonna be using horses
again and I want like a horse holding

592
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
again and I want like a horse holding
 

593
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,790
again and I want like a horse holding
area set up in the nether like I was

594
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:39,800
area set up in the nether like I was
 

595
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,590
area set up in the nether like I was
gonna do so we may end up using this if

596
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:44,600
gonna do so we may end up using this if
 

597
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,930
gonna do so we may end up using this if
this turns out okay which I hope it does

598
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:48,940
this turns out okay which I hope it does
 

599
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,190
this turns out okay which I hope it does
cc slime blocks they have this thing

600
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:51,200
cc slime blocks they have this thing
 

601
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,900
cc slime blocks they have this thing
where they stick to everything so for

602
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:52,910
where they stick to everything so for
 

603
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,760
where they stick to everything so for
the most part you almost have to always

604
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:54,770
the most part you almost have to always
 

605
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,380
the most part you almost have to always
use obsidian or furnaces they don't they

606
00:15:59,380 --> 00:15:59,390
use obsidian or furnaces they don't they
 

607
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,600
use obsidian or furnaces they don't they
don't stick to them which means a lot of

608
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:01,610
don't stick to them which means a lot of
 

609
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,310
don't stick to them which means a lot of
your builds aren't gonna look very good

610
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:03,320
your builds aren't gonna look very good
 

611
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,900
your builds aren't gonna look very good
unfortunately I kind of hope they add

612
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:04,910
unfortunately I kind of hope they add
 

613
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,690
unfortunately I kind of hope they add
more block sets that don't stick to the

614
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:07,700
more block sets that don't stick to the
 

615
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,230
more block sets that don't stick to the
slime blocks like maybe maybe stained

616
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:11,240
slime blocks like maybe maybe stained
 

617
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,790
slime blocks like maybe maybe stained
clay doesn't stick to it because it's

618
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
clay doesn't stick to it because it's
 

619
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,040
clay doesn't stick to it because it's
got like a smooth surface but maybe wool

620
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,050
got like a smooth surface but maybe wool
 

621
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,250
got like a smooth surface but maybe wool
does because it's you know it seems like

622
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:18,260
does because it's you know it seems like
 

623
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,170
does because it's you know it seems like
slime blocks could stick the wool pretty

624
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,180
slime blocks could stick the wool pretty
 

625
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,530
slime blocks could stick the wool pretty
easy I don't know just kind of split the

626
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:23,540
easy I don't know just kind of split the
 

627
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,110
easy I don't know just kind of split the
box in half of ones that do and don't

628
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,120
box in half of ones that do and don't
 

629
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:34,890
box in half of ones that do and don't
stick let's do like a viewing area here

630
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:34,900
stick let's do like a viewing area here
 

631
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,700
stick let's do like a viewing area here
like that and put this front give it a

632
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:39,710
like that and put this front give it a
 

633
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:44,710
like that and put this front give it a
border now I want the horse to be in

634
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
border now I want the horse to be in
 

635
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,200
border now I want the horse to be in
there let's put up some walls although

636
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,210
there let's put up some walls although
 

637
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,120
there let's put up some walls although
when that when these go up they're gonna

638
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,130
when that when these go up they're gonna
 

639
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,400
when that when these go up they're gonna
stick to this clay these play blocks so

640
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,410
stick to this clay these play blocks so
 

641
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,580
stick to this clay these play blocks so
we have to use obsidian here too and I

642
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:57,590
we have to use obsidian here too and I
 

643
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:01,480
we have to use obsidian here too and I
guess the glass has to go that the the

644
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:01,490
guess the glass has to go that the the
 

645
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,910
guess the glass has to go that the the
sticky thing is cool but there's a lot

646
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:03,920
sticky thing is cool but there's a lot
 

647
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,730
sticky thing is cool but there's a lot
of restrictions to it I'm finding it's

648
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:06,740
of restrictions to it I'm finding it's
 

649
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,020
of restrictions to it I'm finding it's
kind of hard to do stuff with it

650
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,030
kind of hard to do stuff with it
 

651
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:16,420
kind of hard to do stuff with it
actually um yeah yeah you you are test

652
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:16,430
actually um yeah yeah you you are test
 

653
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,550
actually um yeah yeah you you are test
dummy

654
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:17,560
dummy
 

655
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,230
dummy
you go inside whoa nice and bouncy let's

656
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:23,240
you go inside whoa nice and bouncy let's
 

657
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,020
you go inside whoa nice and bouncy let's
try it can you not jump on this stuff oh

658
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,030
try it can you not jump on this stuff oh
 

659
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:31,560
try it can you not jump on this stuff oh
there we go uh-oh I'm trapped with him

660
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:31,570
there we go uh-oh I'm trapped with him
 

661
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:36,610
there we go uh-oh I'm trapped with him
cool cool so now let's see how high this

662
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:36,620
cool cool so now let's see how high this
 

663
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,900
cool cool so now let's see how high this
guy gets launched up when we do this to

664
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:40,910
guy gets launched up when we do this to
 

665
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,920
guy gets launched up when we do this to
have Fred stone yep

666
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:43,930
have Fred stone yep
 

667
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:52,290
have Fred stone yep
okay and let's make a button all right

668
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:52,300

 

669
00:17:52,300 --> 00:18:03,510

yeah whoo it looked like he went maybe

670
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520

 

671
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,450

maybe three blocks above this block here

672
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:09,460

 

673
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:19,540

maybe two how about how do I want to do

674
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:19,550
maybe two how about how do I want to do
 

675
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,890
maybe two how about how do I want to do
this I could either use like water

676
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:20,900
this I could either use like water
 

677
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,070
this I could either use like water
streams to like cycle them in a loop

678
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
streams to like cycle them in a loop
 

679
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,740
streams to like cycle them in a loop
sort of thing or maybe maybe let's try

680
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:26,750
sort of thing or maybe maybe let's try
 

681
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,100
sort of thing or maybe maybe let's try
this let's try this do two horses and

682
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,110
this let's try this do two horses and
 

683
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,420
this let's try this do two horses and
like as this one falls down this one

684
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:34,430
like as this one falls down this one
 

685
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,570
like as this one falls down this one
goes up and they switch places let's see

686
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:37,580
goes up and they switch places let's see
 

687
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,550
goes up and they switch places let's see
if we can pull that off

688
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:38,560
if we can pull that off
 

689
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:51,550
if we can pull that off
so yeah let's go up here let's set up

690
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:51,560
so yeah let's go up here let's set up
 

691
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,370
so yeah let's go up here let's set up
some I guess we don't need as I was

692
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:54,380
some I guess we don't need as I was
 

693
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,960
some I guess we don't need as I was
thinking would put Pistons on this side

694
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:55,970
thinking would put Pistons on this side
 

695
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,950
thinking would put Pistons on this side
and this side I guess we don't really

696
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
and this side I guess we don't really
 

697
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,320
and this side I guess we don't really
need that because horses are big we

698
00:18:59,320 --> 00:18:59,330
need that because horses are big we
 

699
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:05,440
need that because horses are big we
could just get away with let's put some

700
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,450
could just get away with let's put some
 

701
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,820
could just get away with let's put some
sticky pistons in the back here like

702
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:09,830
sticky pistons in the back here like
 

703
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:16,690
sticky pistons in the back here like
this alright and they will move glass

704
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:16,700
this alright and they will move glass
 

705
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,030
this alright and they will move glass
blocks so that when this guy launches up

706
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,040
blocks so that when this guy launches up
 

707
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,430
blocks so that when this guy launches up
in the air we want these to extend and

708
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,440
in the air we want these to extend and
 

709
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,700
in the air we want these to extend and
hold them in place so these will need to

710
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:24,710
hold them in place so these will need to
 

711
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:31,630
hold them in place so these will need to
be inverted with a redstone torch so

712
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:31,640
be inverted with a redstone torch so
 

713
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,130
be inverted with a redstone torch so
let's do that it's been a while since we

714
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:36,140
let's do that it's been a while since we
 

715
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,110
let's do that it's been a while since we
did an episode like this where we just

716
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,120
did an episode like this where we just
 

717
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,320
did an episode like this where we just
like goofed around with like technical

718
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:41,330
like goofed around with like technical
 

719
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,880
like goofed around with like technical
things it's fun I like doing this

720
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:44,890
things it's fun I like doing this
 

721
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,740
things it's fun I like doing this
alright and we'll put redstone up there

722
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:47,750
alright and we'll put redstone up there
 

723
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,300
alright and we'll put redstone up there
so now if we if we power that redstone

724
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,310
so now if we if we power that redstone
 

725
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,630
so now if we if we power that redstone
wire it should

726
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
wire it should
 

727
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,769
wire it should
yeah that's good that's what I want okay

728
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:00,779
yeah that's good that's what I want okay
 

729
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:07,380
yeah that's good that's what I want okay
so mmm we'll want these to open up to

730
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:07,390
so mmm we'll want these to open up to
 

731
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,060
so mmm we'll want these to open up to
the right and left probably this glass

732
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,070
the right and left probably this glass
 

733
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:13,610
the right and left probably this glass
block so he can get out but we also want

734
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:13,620
block so he can get out but we also want
 

735
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,759
block so he can get out but we also want
this to bounce and that to retract maybe

736
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:17,769
this to bounce and that to retract maybe
 

737
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:19,830
this to bounce and that to retract maybe
let me run some wire off-camera for a

738
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:19,840
let me run some wire off-camera for a
 

739
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,240
let me run some wire off-camera for a
sec because this will probably take it a

740
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,250
sec because this will probably take it a
 

741
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,130
sec because this will probably take it a
little bit oh snap I was worried at

742
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,140
little bit oh snap I was worried at
 

743
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,049
little bit oh snap I was worried at
first it wasn't doing what I wanted it

744
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:28,059
first it wasn't doing what I wanted it
 

745
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,090
first it wasn't doing what I wanted it
to do but I got it worked out now so

746
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:30,100
to do but I got it worked out now so
 

747
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,350
to do but I got it worked out now so
let's just take a quick look at the

748
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,360
let's just take a quick look at the
 

749
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,669
let's just take a quick look at the
wiring the cycle button is over here it

750
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:35,679
wiring the cycle button is over here it
 

751
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,909
wiring the cycle button is over here it
runs down like this goes to a repeater I

752
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:38,919
runs down like this goes to a repeater I
 

753
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:42,330
runs down like this goes to a repeater I
had it set at 4 and that that makes the

754
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:42,340
had it set at 4 and that that makes the
 

755
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,310
had it set at 4 and that that makes the
springboard activate and I also have the

756
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320
springboard activate and I also have the
 

757
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,970
springboard activate and I also have the
wire running down and it goes up this

758
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:47,980
wire running down and it goes up this
 

759
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,909
wire running down and it goes up this
little staircase thing of half slabs and

760
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:50,919
little staircase thing of half slabs and
 

761
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:53,430
little staircase thing of half slabs and
it goes up to up to there and that's all

762
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:53,440
it goes up to up to there and that's all
 

763
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
it goes up to up to there and that's all
I got to it right now

764
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:55,450
I got to it right now
 

765
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:01,379
I got to it right now
the problem I was having every time I

766
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:01,389
the problem I was having every time I
 

767
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:04,110
the problem I was having every time I
press this he gets launched back up

768
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,120
press this he gets launched back up
 

769
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,490
press this he gets launched back up
there and as I go this is not gonna work

770
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:07,500
there and as I go this is not gonna work
 

771
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,129
there and as I go this is not gonna work
but if I change the timing all is good

772
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:11,139
but if I change the timing all is good
 

773
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:14,310
but if I change the timing all is good
in the world he's still there yeah he's

774
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,320
in the world he's still there yeah he's
 

775
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,990
in the world he's still there yeah he's
still there oh let's sleep for a second

776
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
still there oh let's sleep for a second
 

777
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,610
still there oh let's sleep for a second
before we get the mobs blowing up all

778
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:20,620
before we get the mobs blowing up all
 

779
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:27,690
before we get the mobs blowing up all
our stuff so yeah this is pretty cool so

780
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:27,700
our stuff so yeah this is pretty cool so
 

781
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,310
our stuff so yeah this is pretty cool so
you can you see how he's down here I

782
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:29,320
you can you see how he's down here I
 

783
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,600
you can you see how he's down here I
press the button he goes to the top

784
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:30,610
press the button he goes to the top
 

785
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,090
press the button he goes to the top
layer press it again he goes to the

786
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:33,100
layer press it again he goes to the
 

787
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,769
layer press it again he goes to the
bottom layer so it keeps cycling between

788
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:34,779
bottom layer so it keeps cycling between
 

789
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:36,960
bottom layer so it keeps cycling between
top and bottom which is what I wanted

790
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:36,970
top and bottom which is what I wanted
 

791
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,149
top and bottom which is what I wanted
and now let's let's see we got to add a

792
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
and now let's let's see we got to add a
 

793
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,009
and now let's let's see we got to add a
second layer to this so let's start

794
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:44,019
second layer to this so let's start
 

795
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:47,580
second layer to this so let's start
filling this in I think most this will

796
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,590
filling this in I think most this will
 

797
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,200
filling this in I think most this will
be pretty hidden which is good should we

798
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,210
be pretty hidden which is good should we
 

799
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:58,049
be pretty hidden which is good should we
put this there sure why not

800
00:21:58,049 --> 00:21:58,059
put this there sure why not
 

801
00:21:58,059 --> 00:21:59,850
put this there sure why not

like I want why is this mmm I feel like
this is in one more than it should be

812
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,010
this is in one more than it should be
 

813
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:22,260
this is in one more than it should be
oh whatever

814
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:22,270
oh whatever
 

815
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,200
oh whatever
I'll try this out so let's let's put a

816
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,210
I'll try this out so let's let's put a
 

817
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:30,600
I'll try this out so let's let's put a
window here build it up like this how

818
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:30,610
window here build it up like this how
 

819
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,380
window here build it up like this how
does that look from down here

820
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:33,390
does that look from down here
 

821
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,890
does that look from down here
that's okay

822
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:34,900
that's okay
 

823
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,990
that's okay
should we do the street tall thing like

824
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,000
should we do the street tall thing like
 

825
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,690
should we do the street tall thing like
we did with that one

826
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:38,700
we did with that one
 

827
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,539
we did with that one
get it going like this and then have it

828
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:42,549
get it going like this and then have it
 

829
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:44,750
get it going like this and then have it
go over top again

830
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:44,760
go over top again
 

831
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,240
go over top again
sure let's try it then we'll fill this

832
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,250
sure let's try it then we'll fill this
 

833
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:58,010
sure let's try it then we'll fill this
in oh do we have more yes we do okay and

834
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,020
in oh do we have more yes we do okay and
 

835
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:04,289
in oh do we have more yes we do okay and
that is about it oops let's just cover

836
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:04,299
that is about it oops let's just cover
 

837
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:11,720
that is about it oops let's just cover
this for now okay let's try it out

838
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:11,730

 

839
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,100

we're gonna launch him up to the second

840
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,110
we're gonna launch him up to the second
 

841
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,860
we're gonna launch him up to the second
floor oh he took damage what do you take

842
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:16,870
floor oh he took damage what do you take
 

843
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:21,539
floor oh he took damage what do you take
damage on is he hitting is it cuz he's

844
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:21,549
damage on is he hitting is it cuz he's
 

845
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:26,100
damage on is he hitting is it cuz he's
hitting his head on wait a second you

846
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,110
hitting his head on wait a second you
 

847
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,530
hitting his head on wait a second you
might be hitting his head on this didn't

848
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:28,540
might be hitting his head on this didn't
 

849
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,799
might be hitting his head on this didn't
think that would matter let's just keep

850
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:31,809
think that would matter let's just keep
 

851
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:37,740
think that would matter let's just keep
it open for now then yeah there we go so

852
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:37,750
it open for now then yeah there we go so
 

853
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:45,299
it open for now then yeah there we go so
we could put glass on the top then it's

854
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:45,309
we could put glass on the top then it's
 

855
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:48,960
we could put glass on the top then it's
so stupid I love it so now we need to

856
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:48,970
so stupid I love it so now we need to
 

857
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,549
so stupid I love it so now we need to
set your horse let me go get a second

858
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
set your horse let me go get a second
 

859
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,590

horse cool so we got our buddy over here

860
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
horse cool so we got our buddy over here
 

861

horse cool so we got our buddy over here
and he's gonna help us see if this works

862
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:58,390
and he's gonna help us see if this works
 

863
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,659
and he's gonna help us see if this works
the wait I think it's gonna work

864
00:23:59,659 --> 00:23:59,669
the wait I think it's gonna work
 

865
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:02,310
the wait I think it's gonna work
hopefully it does let's get this guy to

866
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,320
hopefully it does let's get this guy to
 

867
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,490
hopefully it does let's get this guy to
the second floor

868
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:04,500
the second floor
 

869
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,030
the second floor
awesome let's open this up and we'll put

870
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,040
awesome let's open this up and we'll put
 

871
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:16,169
awesome let's open this up and we'll put
them inside alright so this is a whoa I

872
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:16,179
them inside alright so this is a whoa I
 

873
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:18,299
them inside alright so this is a whoa I
got out on the other side I guess that

874
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:18,309
got out on the other side I guess that
 

875
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:20,000
got out on the other side I guess that
confused me for a second

876
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,010
confused me for a second
 

877
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,400
confused me for a second
cool now we got a guy on the first floor

878
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,410
cool now we got a guy on the first floor
 

879
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,720
cool now we got a guy on the first floor
and one on the second floor when we

880
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:24,730
and one on the second floor when we
 

881
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:32,930
and one on the second floor when we
press this yes it does work awesome

882
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:32,940

 

883
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,540

that's exactly what I wanted so they

884
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:36,550
that's exactly what I wanted so they
 

885
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,230
that's exactly what I wanted so they
switch switch between it so the extra

886
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,240
switch switch between it so the extra
 

887
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,310
switch switch between it so the extra
step to this that we still need to do is

888
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,320
step to this that we still need to do is
 

889
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,660
step to this that we still need to do is
make a release for it so we could do

890
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:48,670
make a release for it so we could do
 

891
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,250
make a release for it so we could do
something like this and have sticky

892
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:50,260
something like this and have sticky
 

893
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:55,320
something like this and have sticky
pistons that open this up we would want

894
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,330
pistons that open this up we would want
 

895
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,510
pistons that open this up we would want
one on that side one on this side that's

896
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:00,520
one on that side one on this side that's
 

897
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,890
one on that side one on this side that's
one option we may be able to put like

898
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:04,900
one option we may be able to put like
 

899
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:10,050
one option we may be able to put like
fence gates here too I built this out of

900
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,060
fence gates here too I built this out of
 

901
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,860
fence gates here too I built this out of
cyan clay and like gray glass it's more

902
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:13,870
cyan clay and like gray glass it's more
 

903
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,830
cyan clay and like gray glass it's more
of a you know a high-tech theme but if

904
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:16,840
of a you know a high-tech theme but if
 

905
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,660
of a you know a high-tech theme but if
this was made out of wood and all that

906
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:18,670
this was made out of wood and all that
 

907
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,280
this was made out of wood and all that
fences would look pretty good with this

908
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,290
fences would look pretty good with this
 

909
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:34,760
fences would look pretty good with this
too so maybe let's try that although

910
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:34,770
too so maybe let's try that although
 

911
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:39,060
too so maybe let's try that although
mm-hmm that might not work because oh

912
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,070
mm-hmm that might not work because oh
 

913
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,030
mm-hmm that might not work because oh
yeah and stupid slide locks are gonna

914
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:42,040
yeah and stupid slide locks are gonna
 

915
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,000
yeah and stupid slide locks are gonna
stick to him yeah you see how it leaves

916
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,010
stick to him yeah you see how it leaves
 

917
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:51,120
stick to him yeah you see how it leaves
him behind mm-hmm unless they were up

918
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,130
him behind mm-hmm unless they were up
 

919
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,510
him behind mm-hmm unless they were up
one more

920
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
one more
 

921
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,810
one more
oops

922
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:54,820
oops
 

923
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,620
oops
oh man and it's night time that's going

924
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:58,630
oh man and it's night time that's going
 

925
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:03,600
oh man and it's night time that's going
bad all right maybe I'll try to figure

926
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:03,610
bad all right maybe I'll try to figure
 

927
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,400
bad all right maybe I'll try to figure
this out off-camera we're running pretty

928
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,410
this out off-camera we're running pretty
 

929
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,380
this out off-camera we're running pretty
long time for today so I'm gonna wrap

930
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,390
long time for today so I'm gonna wrap
 

931
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,590
long time for today so I'm gonna wrap
this up in just the little bits the

932
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:10,600
this up in just the little bits the
 

933
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,120
this up in just the little bits the
fence gates could work at one level up

934
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,130
fence gates could work at one level up
 

935
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:24,600
fence gates could work at one level up
though yeah yeah the thing is if I have

936
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:24,610
though yeah yeah the thing is if I have
 

937
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,070
though yeah yeah the thing is if I have
the Pistons on the side it really

938
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,080
the Pistons on the side it really
 

939
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,460
the Pistons on the side it really
increases the width of the the design

940
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:28,470
increases the width of the the design
 

941
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,500
increases the width of the the design
which isn't good fence gates are pretty

942
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:31,510
which isn't good fence gates are pretty
 

943
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:36,330
which isn't good fence gates are pretty
simple well I decided to go with the

944
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:36,340
simple well I decided to go with the
 

945
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,180
simple well I decided to go with the
Pistons after all the fence gates didn't

946
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,190
Pistons after all the fence gates didn't
 

947
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,590
Pistons after all the fence gates didn't
really work because they're not a full

948
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:40,600
really work because they're not a full
 

949
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,720
really work because they're not a full
block and the horses were watching into

950
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:42,730
block and the horses were watching into
 

951
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,900
block and the horses were watching into
them and and suffocating and things were

952
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:45,910
them and and suffocating and things were
 

953
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:49,020
them and and suffocating and things were
bad so I switched to the Pistons instead

954
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,030
bad so I switched to the Pistons instead
 

955
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:53,760
bad so I switched to the Pistons instead
and got it doing that which is pretty

956
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:53,770
and got it doing that which is pretty
 

957
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,440
and got it doing that which is pretty
good they they only had one more block

958
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:55,450
good they they only had one more block
 

959
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:01,800
good they they only had one more block
to the sides both sides the wiring isn't

960
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:01,810
to the sides both sides the wiring isn't
 

961
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,900
to the sides both sides the wiring isn't
as compact as I would have liked I can

962
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:03,910
as compact as I would have liked I can
 

963
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,060
as compact as I would have liked I can
make it very compact if I just have this

964
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,070
make it very compact if I just have this
 

965
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,390
make it very compact if I just have this
one retracting on the right here but if

966
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:09,400
one retracting on the right here but if
 

967
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,390
one retracting on the right here but if
I want both of them to retract for for

968
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,400
I want both of them to retract for for
 

969
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,700
I want both of them to retract for for
the looks of it I have to do this with

970
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:14,710
the looks of it I have to do this with
 

971
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,260
the looks of it I have to do this with
the wire because I could just have like

972
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,270
the wire because I could just have like
 

973
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:20,130
the wire because I could just have like
redstone dust block redstone torch

974
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:20,140
redstone dust block redstone torch
 

975
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,690
redstone dust block redstone torch
underneath this piston that's all I

976
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:21,700
underneath this piston that's all I
 

977
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,260
underneath this piston that's all I
would need but instead I have it going

978
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,270
would need but instead I have it going
 

979
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,020
would need but instead I have it going
to a repeater which branches off this

980
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,030
to a repeater which branches off this
 

981
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,880
to a repeater which branches off this
way to a redstone torch up to that one

982
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:29,890
way to a redstone torch up to that one
 

983
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:34,320
way to a redstone torch up to that one
and then goes to the left Dodge is the

984
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,330
and then goes to the left Dodge is the
 

985
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:39,510
and then goes to the left Dodge is the
other wiring I have here goes underneath

986
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:39,520
other wiring I have here goes underneath
 

987
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,160
other wiring I have here goes underneath
that to the redstone torch in up there

988
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,170
that to the redstone torch in up there
 

989
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:48,120
that to the redstone torch in up there
so yeah pretty good there's a creeper by

990
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,130
so yeah pretty good there's a creeper by
 

991
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:53,760
so yeah pretty good there's a creeper by
ear that has me a little worried and the

992
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:53,770
ear that has me a little worried and the
 

993
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,440
ear that has me a little worried and the
nice thing about doing it this way is I

994
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:55,450
nice thing about doing it this way is I
 

995
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,700
nice thing about doing it this way is I
can seal it up totally flush if I want

996
00:27:59,700 --> 00:27:59,710
can seal it up totally flush if I want
 

997
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:11,970
can seal it up totally flush if I want
ah very cool all right so that's pretty

998
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:11,980
ah very cool all right so that's pretty
 

999
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,550
ah very cool all right so that's pretty
good so that's had to horse to horse

1000
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:14,560
good so that's had to horse to horse
 

1001
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,080
good so that's had to horse to horse
shuffler if I was to make this bigger I

1002
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,090
shuffler if I was to make this bigger I
 

1003
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,640
shuffler if I was to make this bigger I
would probably want like a window there

1004
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:20,650
would probably want like a window there
 

1005
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,890
would probably want like a window there
in a window there so that you could see

1006
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:22,900
in a window there so that you could see
 

1007
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,650
in a window there so that you could see
three horses and then shuffle between

1008
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:25,660
three horses and then shuffle between
 

1009
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,000
three horses and then shuffle between
right and left it would probably be a

1010
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,010
right and left it would probably be a
 

1011
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,780
right and left it would probably be a
six horse shuffler like it would go you

1012
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:30,790
six horse shuffler like it would go you
 

1013
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,400
six horse shuffler like it would go you
could see the one to the left and the

1014
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,410
could see the one to the left and the
 

1015
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,570
could see the one to the left and the
one to the right and then there would be

1016
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:33,580
one to the right and then there would be
 

1017
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,410
one to the right and then there would be
three more like at the back

1018
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:37,420
three more like at the back
 

1019
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,280
three more like at the back
side here but I don't really need six

1020
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,290
side here but I don't really need six
 

1021
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,500
side here but I don't really need six
horses so this is probably good

1022
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:43,510
horses so this is probably good
 

1023
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:48,000
horses so this is probably good
I could also I'm sure it changes so it's

1024
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,010
I could also I'm sure it changes so it's
 

1025
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,430
I could also I'm sure it changes so it's
one block shorter in the back here if I

1026
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:50,440
one block shorter in the back here if I
 

1027
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,500
one block shorter in the back here if I
just have the blocks here and the

1028
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:52,510
just have the blocks here and the
 

1029
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,090
just have the blocks here and the
torches on top and try to work it out

1030
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:54,100
torches on top and try to work it out
 

1031
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,760
torches on top and try to work it out
that way but I'm not too worried so yeah

1032
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:58,770
that way but I'm not too worried so yeah
 

1033
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,910
that way but I'm not too worried so yeah
turned out some I'm happy with that

1034
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:01,920
turned out some I'm happy with that
 

1035
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,020
turned out some I'm happy with that

I never even thought of it but I'm

1038
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:08,680
I never even thought of it but I'm
 

1039
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,350
I never even thought of it but I'm
really glad I made this three blocks

1040
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:10,360
really glad I made this three blocks
 

1041
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,290
really glad I made this three blocks
tall because I would have took

1042
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:13,300
tall because I would have took
 

1043
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,490
tall because I would have took
suffocation damage

1044
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:14,500
suffocation damage
 

1045
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,190
suffocation damage
otherwise I'd even even plan that it

1046
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200
otherwise I'd even even plan that it
 

1047
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,020
otherwise I'd even even plan that it
just worked out that way change it with

1048
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,030
just worked out that way change it with
 

1049
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,810
just worked out that way change it with
obsidian to make it look better

1050
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:23,820
obsidian to make it look better
 

1051
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:30,450
obsidian to make it look better

he's it he's attached and that was
 

1091
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,750
he's it he's attached and that was
that's the red color right let's get

1092
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:45,760
that's the red color right let's get
 

1093
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,299
that's the red color right let's get
this guy up

1094
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:50,309

 

1095
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:53,159

yeah okay this guy teleported that one

1096
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:53,169
yeah okay this guy teleported that one
 

1097
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:55,200
yeah okay this guy teleported that one
did not that's cool I didn't know that

1098
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,210
did not that's cool I didn't know that
 

1099
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,879
did not that's cool I didn't know that
um so he said that because I I was

1100
00:30:59,879 --> 00:30:59,889
um so he said that because I I was
 

1101
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:01,529
um so he said that because I I was
worried the wolves my teleport in that

1102
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:01,539
worried the wolves my teleport in that
 

1103
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:03,539
worried the wolves my teleport in that
mob system when we get it set up so if

1104
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:03,549
mob system when we get it set up so if
 

1105
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:07,169
mob system when we get it set up so if
if I am concerned I can take advantage

1106
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:07,179
if I am concerned I can take advantage
 

1107
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:10,950
if I am concerned I can take advantage
of this trick so that's pretty cool also

1108
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:10,960
of this trick so that's pretty cool also
 

1109
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,990
of this trick so that's pretty cool also
with this horse thing I can remove these

1110
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,000
