the filler blocks
in the nexus the giant storage room

18
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
in the nexus the giant storage room

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
building you see to the left
 

21
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,630
building you see to the left
and it is a big job

22
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
and it is a big job
 

23
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,630
and it is a big job
it is a very big job it's a quarter done

24
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
it is a very big job it's a quarter done
 

25
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,069
it is a very big job it's a quarter done
right now

26
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
right now
 

27
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,430
right now
in total we need about

28
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
in total we need about
 

29
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,869
in total we need about
three chests of filler filler blocks

30
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
three chests of filler filler blocks
 

31
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,910
three chests of filler filler blocks
and that equates to about 90

32
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
and that equates to about 90
 

33
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,990
and that equates to about 90
levels just to name the stuff so i've

34
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000
levels just to name the stuff so i've
 

35
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,110
levels just to name the stuff so i've
been running to the

36
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
been running to the
 

37
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,229
been running to the
end farming ender pearls and then

38
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
end farming ender pearls and then
 

39
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,670
end farming ender pearls and then
getting some xp there then i come back

40
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
getting some xp there then i come back
 

41
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,549
getting some xp there then i come back
and i start enchanting a whole bunch of

42
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
and i start enchanting a whole bunch of
 

43
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,990
and i start enchanting a whole bunch of
cobble

44
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
cobble
 

45
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,109
cobble
and what do we need this for well i i

46
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
and what do we need this for well i i
 

47
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,030
and what do we need this for well i i
showed this before but basically all i

48
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
showed this before but basically all i
 

49
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,630
showed this before but basically all i
gotta do

50
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
gotta do
 

51
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,429
gotta do
here's our filler chest some of it uh

52
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
here's our filler chest some of it uh
 

53
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,429
here's our filler chest some of it uh
what i got to do i go

54
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
what i got to do i go
 

55
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,749
what i got to do i go
over top here and then i gotta put in 21

56
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
over top here and then i gotta put in 21
 

57
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,149
over top here and then i gotta put in 21
cobble in each of these hoppers all the

58
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
cobble in each of these hoppers all the
 

59
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,510
cobble in each of these hoppers all the
way down

60
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
way down
 

61
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,749
way down
and there's 256 in total so 256 times 21

62
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
and there's 256 in total so 256 times 21
 

63
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,749
and there's 256 in total so 256 times 21
is a lot

64
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
is a lot
 

65
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,230
is a lot
and uh hopefully i get that done today

66
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
and uh hopefully i get that done today
 

67
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,069
and uh hopefully i get that done today
i'm starting to feel like some sort of

68
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:36,079
i'm starting to feel like some sort of
 

69
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,270
i'm starting to feel like some sort of
machine it's so repetitive it's like

70
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
machine it's so repetitive it's like
 

71
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,789
machine it's so repetitive it's like
drag drop and then try figure outs

72
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
drag drop and then try figure outs
 

73
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,310
drag drop and then try figure outs
it doesn't divide very nicely

74
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
it doesn't divide very nicely
 

75
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,830
it doesn't divide very nicely
unfortunately

76
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
unfortunately
 

77
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,469
unfortunately
but just i usually split it into 16 and

78
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
but just i usually split it into 16 and
 

79
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,670
but just i usually split it into 16 and
then try to get the rest from somewhere

80
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
then try to get the rest from somewhere
 

81
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,590
then try to get the rest from somewhere
and i have to do math in my head it's

82
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
and i have to do math in my head it's
 

83
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,149
and i have to do math in my head it's
terrible like

84
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
terrible like
 

85
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,830
terrible like
i have to try to figure out how to make

86
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
i have to try to figure out how to make
 

87
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,510
i have to try to figure out how to make
18 every time

88
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
18 every time
 

89
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,709
18 every time
drives me crazy and this is about the

90
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
drives me crazy and this is about the
 

91
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,510
drives me crazy and this is about the
pace i go

92
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
pace i go
 

93
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,789
pace i go
it's taken me a little while but this

94
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
it's taken me a little while but this
 

95
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,749
it's taken me a little while but this
will be a big step to get done again

96
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
will be a big step to get done again
 

97
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,790
will be a big step to get done again
uh and hopefully

98
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
uh and hopefully
 

99
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,790
uh and hopefully
the progress on this thing seems to be

100
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
the progress on this thing seems to be
 

101
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,790
the progress on this thing seems to be
moving slow is just because every single

102
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
moving slow is just because every single
 

103
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,190
moving slow is just because every single
step

104
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
step
 

105
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,229
step
i gotta multiply by a 256 it seems so it

106
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
i gotta multiply by a 256 it seems so it
 

107
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,150
i gotta multiply by a 256 it seems so it
takes a long time just to do one

108
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
takes a long time just to do one
 

109
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,830
takes a long time just to do one
thing but we're getting there

110
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840

 

111
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,670

and 18. all right

112
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
and 18. all right
 

113
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,550
and 18. all right
you know what of course it would work

114
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
you know what of course it would work
 

115
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,190
you know what of course it would work
out this way

116
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
out this way
 

117
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,869
out this way
you guys you know you sometimes face

118
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879
you guys you know you sometimes face
 

119
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,470
you guys you know you sometimes face
palm in my videos

120
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
palm in my videos
 

121
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,509
palm in my videos
i'm face bombing right now

122
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
i'm face bombing right now
 

123
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,990
i'm face bombing right now
right there you hear that i figured out

124
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
right there you hear that i figured out
 

125
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,229
right there you hear that i figured out
how to divide them that's all you gotta

126
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
how to divide them that's all you gotta
 

127
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,430
how to divide them that's all you gotta
do

128
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
do
 

129
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,949
do
just like that i need 21 in each hopper

130
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
just like that i need 21 in each hopper
 

131
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,229
just like that i need 21 in each hopper
then i do that so much simpler than

132
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
then i do that so much simpler than
 

133
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,589
then i do that so much simpler than
what i was doing wish i knew that at the

134
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
what i was doing wish i knew that at the
 

135
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,190
what i was doing wish i knew that at the
start

136
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
start
 

137
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:10,229
start
all right

138
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239

 

139
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,470

i really like the cinderman farm

140
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480

 

141
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,350

this anvil right here this is a special

142
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
this anvil right here this is a special
 

143
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,990
this anvil right here this is a special
anvil

144
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
anvil
 

145
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,110
anvil
okay i'm pretty sure i used it about 20

146
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
okay i'm pretty sure i used it about 20
 

147
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,949
okay i'm pretty sure i used it about 20
times before i went to the end and now

148
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
times before i went to the end and now
 

149
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,550
times before i went to the end and now
that i got back

150
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
that i got back
 

151
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,350
that i got back
i started with 39 levels i've only been

152
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
i started with 39 levels i've only been
 

153
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,509
i started with 39 levels i've only been
using this anvil

154
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
using this anvil
 

155
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,789
using this anvil
can we use the remaining five

156
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
can we use the remaining five
 

157
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,550
can we use the remaining five
on average you're only supposed to get

158
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
on average you're only supposed to get
 

159
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,910
on average you're only supposed to get
like 24 uses

160
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
like 24 uses
 

161
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,309
like 24 uses
out of an anvil but it's random right

162
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
out of an anvil but it's random right
 

163
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,070
out of an anvil but it's random right
last one yeah so it did like

164
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
last one yeah so it did like
 

165
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,110
last one yeah so it did like
it's up to like 60 something that's

166
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
it's up to like 60 something that's
 

167
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,110
it's up to like 60 something that's
that's pretty crazy and it hasn't broken

168
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,710
make the list
and if i was to make this storage room

274
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
and if i was to make this storage room
 

275
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,150
and if i was to make this storage room
any bigger i would die

276

could for sure get rid of carpet
 

285
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,270
could for sure get rid of carpet
so that's 16 unique items there off the

286
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
so that's 16 unique items there off the
 

287
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,070
so that's 16 unique items there off the
list

288
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
list
 

289
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,029
list
uh we need to free up about 70 spots

290
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
uh we need to free up about 70 spots
 

291
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:05,990
uh we need to free up about 70 spots
because usually when i

292
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
because usually when i
 

293
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,590
because usually when i
i need carpet i just craft it on the

294
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
i need carpet i just craft it on the
 

295
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,950
i need carpet i just craft it on the
spot anyway you don't even need a

296
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
spot anyway you don't even need a
 

297
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,270
spot anyway you don't even need a
crafting table just need the wool

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
crafting table just need the wool
 

299
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,550
crafting table just need the wool
um so carpet for sure gone

300
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
um so carpet for sure gone
 

301
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,990
um so carpet for sure gone
and let's see

302
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
and let's see
 

303
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,270
and let's see
dies i might should we get rid of dyes

304
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
dies i might should we get rid of dyes
 

305
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,710
dies i might should we get rid of dyes
yeah let's get rid of dyes

306
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
yeah let's get rid of dyes
 

307
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,189
yeah let's get rid of dyes
what we'll do we'll have like a maybe in

308
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
what we'll do we'll have like a maybe in
 

309
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,710
what we'll do we'll have like a maybe in
the main room at the front we'll have a

310
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
the main room at the front we'll have a
 

311
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,070
the main room at the front we'll have a
die chest

312
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
die chest
 

313
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,590
die chest
um and then we could probably get rid of

314
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
um and then we could probably get rid of
 

315
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,790
um and then we could probably get rid of
the hardened clay

316
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
the hardened clay
 

317
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,110

sometimes i get colored clay though when
 

321
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,189
sometimes i get colored clay though when
i when i go mining in the mesa

322
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
i when i go mining in the mesa
 

323
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,950
i when i go mining in the mesa
and i won't have a spot for it if i get

324
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
and i won't have a spot for it if i get
 

325
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,909
and i won't have a spot for it if i get
rid of that

326
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919

 

327
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,390

let's see there was one other thing for

328
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
let's see there was one other thing for
 

329
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,230
let's see there was one other thing for

i planned on storing like blocks of iron
 

335
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,990
i planned on storing like blocks of iron

00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
why there's a three here for the three

why there's a three here for the three
different types

340
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
different types
 

341
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,950
different types
really we shouldn't be storing blocks of

00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
really we shouldn't be storing blocks of
 

343
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,870
really we shouldn't be storing blocks of

351
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,990
ingot and some of it's in block form
and i run out of ingots i might think

352
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
and i run out of ingots i might think
 

353
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,350
and i run out of ingots i might think
i'm out of iron but i

i'm out of iron but i

i'm out of iron but i
have hundreds left in block form you

356
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
have hundreds left in block form you
 

357
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,430
have hundreds left in block form you
know so we should only have one type

358
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
know so we should only have one type
 

359
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,830
know so we should only have one type
so it's less confusing so that'll free

360
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
so it's less confusing so that'll free
 

361
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,550
so it's less confusing so that'll free
up about

362
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
up about
 

363
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,230
up about
four to eight spots i guess

364
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
four to eight spots i guess
 

365
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,830
four to eight spots i guess
uh i think we had glass why can't i find

366
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
uh i think we had glass why can't i find
 

367
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,029
uh i think we had glass why can't i find
glass

368
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
glass
 

369
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,110
glass
where's the glass yeah over here

370
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
where's the glass yeah over here
 

371
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,710
where's the glass yeah over here
i have pains on the list i think i'll

372
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
i have pains on the list i think i'll
 

373
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,629
i have pains on the list i think i'll
get rid of that

374
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
get rid of that
 

375
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,029
get rid of that
and i'll just toss them if we ever have

376
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
and i'll just toss them if we ever have
 

377
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,350
and i'll just toss them if we ever have
extra i don't use paints very often so

378
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
extra i don't use paints very often so
 

379
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,629
extra i don't use paints very often so
that'll free up 17

380
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
that'll free up 17
 

381
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,510
that'll free up 17
because there's 16 different colors and

382
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
because there's 16 different colors and
 

383
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,710
because there's 16 different colors and
then the clear

384
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
then the clear
 

385
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,670
then the clear
clear panes anyway that's sort of the

386
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
clear panes anyway that's sort of the
 

387
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,270

next step to this

388
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
next step to this
 

389
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,350
next step to this
once we do that i then got to connect

390
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
once we do that i then got to connect
 

391
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,270
once we do that i then got to connect
all these ice streams together

392
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
all these ice streams together
 

393
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,550
all these ice streams together
right now we just have it running down

394
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
right now we just have it running down
 

395
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,909
right now we just have it running down
the road so i'll have to connect them

396
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:01,919
the road so i'll have to connect them
 

397
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,670
the road so i'll have to connect them
horizontally here

398
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:03,680
horizontally here
 

399
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,589
horizontally here

so on and so forth

404
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
so on and so forth
 

405
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,510
so on and so forth
when i do that the item sorting will

406
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
when i do that the item sorting will
 

407
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,710
when i do that the item sorting will
work

408
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
work
 

409
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,710
work
and then to get the item retrieval

410
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
and then to get the item retrieval
 

411
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,150
and then to get the item retrieval
working we then have to connect the

412
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
working we then have to connect the
 

413
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,670
working we then have to connect the
redstone together

414
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
redstone together
 

415
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,390
redstone together
in each of these rows and hook it to

416
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
in each of these rows and hook it to
 

417
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,790
in each of these rows and hook it to
some

418
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
some
 

419
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,830
some
master board type of thing like this

420
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840

 

421
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,830

whoa and then we pretty much will have a

422
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
whoa and then we pretty much will have a
 

423
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,430
whoa and then we pretty much will have a
fully functioning nexus

424
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
fully functioning nexus
 

425
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,310
fully functioning nexus
and then we just have to add other fancy

426
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
and then we just have to add other fancy
 

427
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,909
and then we just have to add other fancy
stuff which is when things will get more

428
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
stuff which is when things will get more
 

429
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,990
stuff which is when things will get more
interesting again with this project

430
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
interesting again with this project
 

431
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,670
interesting again with this project
um because right now it's very

432
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
um because right now it's very
 

433
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,509
um because right now it's very
repetitive

434
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
repetitive
 

435
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,230
repetitive
uh anyway that is sort of the

436
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
uh anyway that is sort of the
 

437
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,750
uh anyway that is sort of the
what's going on here i'm gonna leave

438
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
what's going on here i'm gonna leave
 

439
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,710
what's going on here i'm gonna leave
this i'll just throw it in here for now

440
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
this i'll just throw it in here for now
 

441
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,350
this i'll just throw it in here for now
let's go do some other stuff though uh

442
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
let's go do some other stuff though uh
 

443
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,910
let's go do some other stuff though uh
today i was working on some more pathing

444
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:53,920
today i was working on some more pathing
 

445
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,710
today i was working on some more pathing
stuff

446
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
stuff
 

447
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,750
stuff
hopefully this doesn't take too long

448
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:58,760

 

449
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,990

and oh in the water

450
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
and oh in the water
 

451
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,110
and oh in the water
uh the lakeside path over here

452
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
uh the lakeside path over here
 

453
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,750
uh the lakeside path over here
lakeside road i guess we'll call it yeah

454
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
lakeside road i guess we'll call it yeah
 

455
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,590
lakeside road i guess we'll call it yeah
so we got gravel running

456
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
so we got gravel running
 

457
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,470
so we got gravel running
down here and this used to be just like

458
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
down here and this used to be just like
 

459
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,310
down here and this used to be just like
one block wide now it's

460
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
one block wide now it's
 

461
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,350
one block wide now it's
that looks a little bit nicer and out of

462
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
that looks a little bit nicer and out of
 

463
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,590
that looks a little bit nicer and out of
enterprise darn it

464
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
enterprise darn it
 

465
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,870
enterprise darn it
i guess we're walking the rest of the

466
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
i guess we're walking the rest of the
 

467
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,389
i guess we're walking the rest of the
way then up here at the desert city i

468
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
way then up here at the desert city i
 

469
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,230
way then up here at the desert city i
did something as well i saw a cool post

470
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
did something as well i saw a cool post
 

471
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,310
did something as well i saw a cool post
on the minecraft reddit

00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
about using upside down stairs uh to
 

475
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:31,990
about using upside down stairs uh to
give

476
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
give
 

477
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,150
give
texture to like sandy paths like look at

478
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
texture to like sandy paths like look at
 

479
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,590
texture to like sandy paths like look at
this this is an upside down stair

480
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
this this is an upside down stair
 

481
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,310
this this is an upside down stair
and i think that's really cool it's like

482
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
and i think that's really cool it's like
 

483
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,110
and i think that's really cool it's like
a

484
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
a
 

485
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,750
a
gritty type of texture it's very subtle

486
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
gritty type of texture it's very subtle
 

487
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,829
gritty type of texture it's very subtle
it's it's hardly noticeable but i

488
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
it's it's hardly noticeable but i
 

489
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,190
it's it's hardly noticeable but i
kind of added that throughout the

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
kind of added that throughout the
 

491
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,269
kind of added that throughout the

i don't think i had this here before the

00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
i don't think i had this here before the
 

495
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,350
i don't think i had this here before the
cutting through the sugar cane so i put

496
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
cutting through the sugar cane so i put
 

497
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,030

um let's take a look at our map here

550
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
um let's take a look at our map here
 

551
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,310
um let's take a look at our map here
to scout a location we're actually going

552
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
to scout a location we're actually going
 

553
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,590
to scout a location we're actually going
to use the maps and not just for show

554
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
to use the maps and not just for show
 

555
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,230
to use the maps and not just for show
to help us make the decision here i

556
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
to help us make the decision here i
 

557
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,110
to help us make the decision here i
think there's

558
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
think there's
 

559
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,350
think there's
no there goes a squid i think there's a

560
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
no there goes a squid i think there's a
 

561
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,350
no there goes a squid i think there's a
forest

562
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
forest
 

563
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,710
forest
um by my base where's my base that's the

564
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
um by my base where's my base that's the
 

565
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,150
um by my base where's my base that's the
snowflake over there we are right there

566
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
snowflake over there we are right there
 

567
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,550
snowflake over there we are right there
uh gold farm that's the path up the

568
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
uh gold farm that's the path up the
 

569
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,350
uh gold farm that's the path up the
library

570
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
library
 

571
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,630
library
the library is up there i

572
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
the library is up there i
 

573
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,590
the library is up there i
think we want to go this way

574
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600

 

575
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,710

what is all this land here

576
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
what is all this land here
 

577
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,750
what is all this land here
i'm confused now

578
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
i'm confused now
 

579
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,710
i'm confused now
okay uh that's that's by the you you've

580
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
okay uh that's that's by the you you've
 

581
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,829
okay uh that's that's by the you you've
been ethod logo

582
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
been ethod logo
 

583
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,389
been ethod logo
there i think we want to go this way

584
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
there i think we want to go this way
 

585
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,990
there i think we want to go this way
yeah i didn't realize it was planes over

586
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
yeah i didn't realize it was planes over
 

587
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,389
yeah i didn't realize it was planes over
here though i thought it was forest

588
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
here though i thought it was forest
 

589
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,670
here though i thought it was forest
this whole area or maybe we'll even go

590
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
this whole area or maybe we'll even go
 

591
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,470
this whole area or maybe we'll even go
far up over this way uh we're gonna be

592
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
far up over this way uh we're gonna be
 

593
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,389
far up over this way uh we're gonna be
establishing a game zone

594
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
establishing a game zone
 

595
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,910
establishing a game zone
in my world though i want to make like

596
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
in my world though i want to make like
 

597
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,670
in my world though i want to make like
little mini games kind of like good land

598
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
little mini games kind of like good land
 

599
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,790
little mini games kind of like good land
i guess

600
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
i guess
 

601
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,389
i guess
for those familiar with it

602
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399

 

603
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,949

and we'll put it on trial if i can make

604
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
and we'll put it on trial if i can make
 

605
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:01,829
and we'll put it on trial if i can make
one good game

606
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839
one good game
 

607
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,710
one good game
then we might make more but if this is a

608
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
then we might make more but if this is a
 

609
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,910
then we might make more but if this is a
big bust

610
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
big bust
 

611
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,710
big bust
then uh we'll just forget about it

612
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
then uh we'll just forget about it
 

613
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,230
then uh we'll just forget about it
because the game i have in mind is

614
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
because the game i have in mind is
 

615
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,790
because the game i have in mind is
actually

616
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
actually
 

617
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,470
actually
pretty complicated it's something i

618
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
pretty complicated it's something i
 

619
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,069
pretty complicated it's something i
wanted to try

620
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
wanted to try
 

621
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,829
wanted to try
though for a while we're going to be

622
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
though for a while we're going to be
 

623
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,430
though for a while we're going to be
making a simon says game

624
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
making a simon says game
 

625
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,110
making a simon says game
if if possible and

626
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
if if possible and
 

627
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,870
if if possible and
i think this will be fun because

628
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
i think this will be fun because
 

629
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,550
i think this will be fun because
there'll be a lot of variety with with

630
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
there'll be a lot of variety with with
 

631
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,990
there'll be a lot of variety with with
the projects like

632
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
the projects like
 

633
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,430
the projects like
if we're making lots of different games

634
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
if we're making lots of different games
 

635
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,190
if we're making lots of different games
uh oh

636
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200

out exploring and i'm making my way back
 

667
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,310
out exploring and i'm making my way back
i'll i'll walk through here and it's

668
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
i'll i'll walk through here and it's
 

669
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,629
i'll i'll walk through here and it's
like

670
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
like
 

671
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,230
like
where am i this seems so foreign

672
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
where am i this seems so foreign
 

673
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,629
where am i this seems so foreign
but it's so close to my base

674
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639

 

675
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,670

like i i feel so lost just watching here

676
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
like i i feel so lost just watching here
 

677
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,790
like i i feel so lost just watching here
i think we were aiming for up here

678
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
i think we were aiming for up here
 

679
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,150
i think we were aiming for up here
and i saw like a snow biome further

680
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
and i saw like a snow biome further
 

681
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,470
and i saw like a snow biome further
further up right so this would be pretty

682
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
further up right so this would be pretty
 

683
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,069
further up right so this would be pretty
good spot for something new

684
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
good spot for something new
 

685
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,870
good spot for something new
it's close to the main base uh it's a

686
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
it's close to the main base uh it's a
 

687
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,870
it's close to the main base uh it's a
forest biome so we can make it look nice

688
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
forest biome so we can make it look nice
 

689
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,350
forest biome so we can make it look nice
if we

690
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
if we
 

691
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,269
if we
do anything with grass and

692
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
do anything with grass and
 

693
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,310
do anything with grass and
is this ice biome yeah up here and it's

694
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
is this ice biome yeah up here and it's
 

695
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,750
is this ice biome yeah up here and it's
relatively flat so it'll be easy to

696
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:37,760
relatively flat so it'll be easy to
 

697
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,189
relatively flat so it'll be easy to
build off of

698
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199

 

699
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,670

okay huh look at all the animals here

700
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680
okay huh look at all the animals here
 

701
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,910
okay huh look at all the animals here
you can tell i haven't been here i

702
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
you can tell i haven't been here i
 

703
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,069
you can tell i haven't been here i
haven't murdered them all yet

704
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
haven't murdered them all yet
 

705
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,790
haven't murdered them all yet
and ice biome right by the desert uh-huh

706
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
and ice biome right by the desert uh-huh
 

707
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,110
and ice biome right by the desert uh-huh
this

708
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
this
 

709
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,990
this
is this is where we fought the withers

710
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
is this is where we fought the withers
 

711
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,350
is this is where we fought the withers
and i've been getting sand right

712
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
and i've been getting sand right
 

713
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,670
and i've been getting sand right
yeah okay it's all connecting together

714
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
yeah okay it's all connecting together
 

715
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,790
yeah okay it's all connecting together
now

716
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
now
 

717
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,910
now
let's get an upward view yeah that's the

718
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
let's get an upward view yeah that's the
 

719
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,590
let's get an upward view yeah that's the
big pit over there

720
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
big pit over there
 

721
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,509
big pit over there
so i think that'll be pretty nice up

722
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:11,519
so i think that'll be pretty nice up
 

723
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,069
so i think that'll be pretty nice up
over here

724
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079

 

725
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,069

yes i'm going to start at the very edge

726
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
yes i'm going to start at the very edge
 

727
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,750
yes i'm going to start at the very edge
of the forest biome here uh that's the

728
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760
of the forest biome here uh that's the
 

729
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,030
of the forest biome here uh that's the
library up there

730
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
library up there
 

731
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,629
library up there
if we build more games then we'll just

732
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
if we build more games then we'll just
 

733
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,629
if we build more games then we'll just
make our way closer and closer to the

734
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
make our way closer and closer to the
 

735
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,870
make our way closer and closer to the
man cave this direction

736
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
man cave this direction
 

737
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,509
man cave this direction
all right so we are building a simon

738
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
all right so we are building a simon
 

739
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,389
all right so we are building a simon
says game

740
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399
says game
 

741
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,870
says game
or hoping to i'm sure most of you are

742
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
or hoping to i'm sure most of you are
 

743
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,790
or hoping to i'm sure most of you are
familiar with simon says it

744
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800
familiar with simon says it
 

745
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,990
familiar with simon says it
is a memory game

746
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
is a memory game
 

747
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,829
is a memory game
i'll just explain it really quick just

748
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
i'll just explain it really quick just
 

749
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,069
i'll just explain it really quick just
in case you never know some people

750
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
in case you never know some people
 

751
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,069
in case you never know some people
may never have played it or heard of it

752
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
may never have played it or heard of it
 

753
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,750
may never have played it or heard of it
it is

754
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
it is
 

755
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,629
it is
a memory game where you got four colors

756
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
a memory game where you got four colors
 

757
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,829
a memory game where you got four colors
red green

758
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
red green
 

759
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,269
red green
blue yellow right and

760
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
blue yellow right and
 

761
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,470
blue yellow right and
uh it plays a sequence of those colors

762
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
uh it plays a sequence of those colors
 

763
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,470
uh it plays a sequence of those colors
randomly and you have to try to copy

764
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:56,480
randomly and you have to try to copy
 

765
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,230
randomly and you have to try to copy
that sequence so it'll be like

766
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
that sequence so it'll be like
 

767
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,629
that sequence so it'll be like
red green blue then you've got to click

768
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
red green blue then you've got to click
 

769
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,069
red green blue then you've got to click
red green blue and then it's going to

770
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:02,079
red green blue and then it's going to
 

771
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,910
red green blue and then it's going to
add one more onto that so it'll be red

772
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
add one more onto that so it'll be red
 

773
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,590
add one more onto that so it'll be red
green blue then something else random

774
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
green blue then something else random
 

775
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,310
green blue then something else random
like

776
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
like
 

777
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,069
like
yellow okay that's not very random

778
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
yellow okay that's not very random
 

779
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,750
yellow okay that's not very random
red green blue yellow then you enter

780
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
red green blue yellow then you enter
 

781
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,189
red green blue yellow then you enter
that and then it adds one more and it

782
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
that and then it adds one more and it
 

783
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,430
that and then it adds one more and it
keeps adding onto the chain

784
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
keeps adding onto the chain
 

785
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,670
keeps adding onto the chain
and it gets very difficult and you have

786
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680
and it gets very difficult and you have
 

787
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,030
and it gets very difficult and you have
trouble remembering it at a certain

788
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
trouble remembering it at a certain
 

789
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,150
trouble remembering it at a certain
point usually around

790
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
point usually around
 

791
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,949
point usually around
20 to 30 for me um is where i fail

792
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
20 to 30 for me um is where i fail
 

793
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,069
20 to 30 for me um is where i fail
and uh once you mess up then then you

794
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
and uh once you mess up then then you
 

795
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,910
and uh once you mess up then then you
lose and you gotta start over

796
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
lose and you gotta start over
 

797
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,030
lose and you gotta start over
so uh that's what we'll try to copy here

798
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
so uh that's what we'll try to copy here
 

799
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,829
so uh that's what we'll try to copy here
if possible

800
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
if possible
 

801
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,150
if possible
brought some stuff here to set up a

802
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
brought some stuff here to set up a
 

803
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,829
brought some stuff here to set up a
little base we're just gonna run through

804
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
little base we're just gonna run through
 

805
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,230
little base we're just gonna run through
some of the logic today

806
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
some of the logic today
 

807
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,230
some of the logic today
and i really like this kind of stuff the

808
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
and i really like this kind of stuff the
 

809
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,829
and i really like this kind of stuff the
problem solving i haven't got it all

810
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
problem solving i haven't got it all
 

811
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,749
problem solving i haven't got it all
figured out or anything i just have a

812
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:45,759
figured out or anything i just have a
 

813
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,150
figured out or anything i just have a
a rough idea of what we could try um

814
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
a rough idea of what we could try um
 

815
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,430
a rough idea of what we could try um
so we'll probably use a

816
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
so we'll probably use a
 

817
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,230
so we'll probably use a
dropper or a dispenser to get a random

818
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
dropper or a dispenser to get a random
 

819
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,670
dropper or a dispenser to get a random
selection right

820
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
selection right
 

821
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,350
selection right
so we got to randomize the color every

822
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
so we got to randomize the color every
 

823
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,870
so we got to randomize the color every
time we add to

824
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
time we add to
 

825
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,310
time we add to
the sequence and this is a pretty good

826
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
the sequence and this is a pretty good
 

827
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,189
the sequence and this is a pretty good
way of doing it

828
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
way of doing it
 

829
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,870
way of doing it
blue blue yellow

830
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
blue blue yellow
 

831
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,310
blue blue yellow
green so it's random

832
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:12,320
green so it's random
 

833
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,629
green so it's random
very good now the issue is

834
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639
very good now the issue is
 

835
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,629
very good now the issue is
uh we have to somehow keep that chain

836
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
uh we have to somehow keep that chain
 

837
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,670
uh we have to somehow keep that chain
and not mess it up like the order

838
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
and not mess it up like the order
 

839
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,670
and not mess it up like the order
they come out of here we gotta copy it

840
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
they come out of here we gotta copy it
 

841
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,110
they come out of here we gotta copy it
every time

842
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
every time
 

843
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,230
every time
and if we for example try to

844
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
and if we for example try to
 

845
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,509
and if we for example try to
let's get some some hoppers going if we

846
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
let's get some some hoppers going if we
 

847
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,150
let's get some some hoppers going if we
put these items into any sort of form of

848
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
put these items into any sort of form of
 

849
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,230
put these items into any sort of form of
storage like a chest or a hopper or

850
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
storage like a chest or a hopper or
 

851
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,670
storage like a chest or a hopper or
another dropper

852
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
another dropper
 

853
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,110
another dropper
uh what's gonna happen is

854
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
uh what's gonna happen is
 

855
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,550
uh what's gonna happen is
so that time we got red green

856
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
so that time we got red green
 

857
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,829
so that time we got red green
green see they kind of bunch up

858
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:53,839
green see they kind of bunch up
 

859
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,829
green see they kind of bunch up
so that's going to be an issue because

860
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
so that's going to be an issue because
 

861
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,189
so that's going to be an issue because
then when we

862
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
then when we
 

863
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,269
then when we
continue this or if we try to get them

864
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
continue this or if we try to get them
 

865
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,790
continue this or if we try to get them
out of there

866
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
out of there
 

867
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,470
out of there
we're going to lose our chain as it

868
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,480
we're going to lose our chain as it
 

869
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,350
we're going to lose our chain as it
should be

870
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
should be
 

871
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,909
should be
so just it just keeps that they all

872
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:07,919
so just it just keeps that they all
 

873
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,270
so just it just keeps that they all
group up and then

874
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,280
group up and then
 

875
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,630
group up and then
red is going to come out first then

876
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:10,640
red is going to come out first then
 

877
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,270
red is going to come out first then
green and blue so that doesn't work

878
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
green and blue so that doesn't work
 

879
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,110
green and blue so that doesn't work
that's that's kind of the problem we got

880
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
that's that's kind of the problem we got
 

881
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,789
that's that's kind of the problem we got
to solve here

882
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:16,799
to solve here
 

883
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,029
to solve here
the other way we could try to do it is

884
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
the other way we could try to do it is
 

885
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,669
the other way we could try to do it is
we use items that don't stack

886
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
we use items that don't stack
 

887
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,510
we use items that don't stack
if we had like four different types of

888
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
if we had like four different types of
 

889
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,669
if we had like four different types of
swords in here for example

890
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679
swords in here for example
 

891
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,829
swords in here for example
uh they wouldn't stack but then the

892
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
uh they wouldn't stack but then the
 

893
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,789
uh they wouldn't stack but then the
issue is we can't detect them

894
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:30,799
issue is we can't detect them
 

895
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,190
issue is we can't detect them
because we'll probably use an item

896
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200

 

897
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,390

item filter to detect uh

898
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
item filter to detect uh
 

899
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,470
item filter to detect uh
which one is chosen so we'll have like

900
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
which one is chosen so we'll have like
 

901
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,669
which one is chosen so we'll have like
four hoppers

902
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
four hoppers
 

903
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,390
four hoppers
it'll go into one of them and depending

904
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
it'll go into one of them and depending
 

905
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,990
it'll go into one of them and depending
on which one it goes into we can grab

906
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
on which one it goes into we can grab
 

907
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,070
on which one it goes into we can grab
a redstone signal off of that and then

908
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
a redstone signal off of that and then
 

909
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,270
a redstone signal off of that and then
do a comparison

910
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
do a comparison
 

911
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,270
do a comparison
to what i input into the the game right

912
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
to what i input into the the game right
 

913
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,870
to what i input into the the game right
um by the way maybe i should just do

914
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
um by the way maybe i should just do
 

915
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,549
um by the way maybe i should just do
this as a little diagram

916
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
this as a little diagram
 

917
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,909
this as a little diagram
uh simon says there's a few different

918
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
uh simon says there's a few different
 

919
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,350
uh simon says there's a few different
ways the game's kind of laid out but

920
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
ways the game's kind of laid out but
 

921
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,270
ways the game's kind of laid out but
it's basically

922
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
it's basically
 

923
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,789
it's basically
four different colors like this right

924
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:06,799
four different colors like this right
 

925
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,230
four different colors like this right
and you step on a pressure plate or

926
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
and you step on a pressure plate or
 

927
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,110
and you step on a pressure plate or
something

928
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
something
 

929
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,830
something
to put in your inputs and we might use a

930
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
to put in your inputs and we might use a
 

931
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,390
to put in your inputs and we might use a
sticky piston underneath

932
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
sticky piston underneath
 

933
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,549
sticky piston underneath
somewhere we'll make it bigger than this

934
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
somewhere we'll make it bigger than this
 

935
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,150
somewhere we'll make it bigger than this
of course

936
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
of course
 

937
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,669
of course
but we could do something like this like

938
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
but we could do something like this like
 

939
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,990
but we could do something like this like
when it's showing us what color it is

940
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
when it's showing us what color it is
 

941
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,549
when it's showing us what color it is
we could make it pop up for each of them

942
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
we could make it pop up for each of them
 

943
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,549
we could make it pop up for each of them
we have to have some visual indication

944
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
we have to have some visual indication
 

945
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,830
we have to have some visual indication
of what color

946
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
of what color
 

947
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,990
of what color
uh it's telling us so so we'll either

948
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
uh it's telling us so so we'll either
 

949
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,750
uh it's telling us so so we'll either
use pistons or

950
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760

 

951
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,110

or pistons they're probably the best

952
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
or pistons they're probably the best
 

953
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,950
or pistons they're probably the best
um i was thinking we could put lights

954
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:40,960
um i was thinking we could put lights
 

955
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,190
um i was thinking we could put lights
behind like stained glass or something

956
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
behind like stained glass or something
 

957
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,150
behind like stained glass or something
too but that's

958
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
too but that's
 

959
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,270
too but that's
probably not as obvious

960
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
probably not as obvious
 

961
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,669
probably not as obvious
oh snap i think i just had a great idea

962
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:49,679
oh snap i think i just had a great idea
 

963
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,190
oh snap i think i just had a great idea
i was originally gonna

964
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
i was originally gonna
 

965
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,510
i was originally gonna
try do something with ice streams and

966
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
try do something with ice streams and
 

967
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,230
try do something with ice streams and
like locking items behind gates

968
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
like locking items behind gates
 

969
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,310
like locking items behind gates
type of thing it's a little hard to

970
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
type of thing it's a little hard to
 

971
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,750
type of thing it's a little hard to
describe without actually doing it but

972
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
describe without actually doing it but
 

973
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,950
describe without actually doing it but
we're not doing it now

974
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
we're not doing it now
 

975
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,150
we're not doing it now
uh the new way i just thought of which

976
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
uh the new way i just thought of which
 

977
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,909
uh the new way i just thought of which
is probably a lot simpler and a lot more

978
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
is probably a lot simpler and a lot more
 

979
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,190
is probably a lot simpler and a lot more
compact

980
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
compact
 

981
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,230
compact
we have our color wheel in here right

982
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,240
we have our color wheel in here right
 

983
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,669
we have our color wheel in here right
whenever we need to randomize a new

984
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
whenever we need to randomize a new
 

985
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,070
whenever we need to randomize a new
color we uh we send a pulse to that hey

986
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
color we uh we send a pulse to that hey
 

987
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,270
color we uh we send a pulse to that hey

yeah keep walking just distracting me

990
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
yeah keep walking just distracting me
 

991
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,789
yeah keep walking just distracting me
that's nice

992
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
that's nice
 

993
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,510
that's nice
and then to keep our sequence we can

994
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
and then to keep our sequence we can
 

995
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,830
and then to keep our sequence we can
just do something like this make a a

996
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:23,840
just do something like this make a a
 

997
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,750
just do something like this make a a
loop

998
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:25,760
loop
 

999
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,029
loop
like so uh unfortunately it's not going

1000
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
like so uh unfortunately it's not going
 

1001
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,110
like so uh unfortunately it's not going
to be quite this simple but

1002
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
to be quite this simple but
 

1003
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,150
to be quite this simple but
just to give you the idea and

1004
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
just to give you the idea and
 

1005
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,430
just to give you the idea and
when we activate this you know i went

1006
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,440
when we activate this you know i went
 

1007
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,710
when we activate this you know i went
and got some cobble because i was gonna

1008
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
and got some cobble because i was gonna
 

1009
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,870
and got some cobble because i was gonna
make a lever and then i never did that

1010
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:40,880
make a lever and then i never did that
 

1011
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,150
make a lever and then i never did that
i wanted to do that off camera there we

1012
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
i wanted to do that off camera there we
 

1013
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,430
i wanted to do that off camera there we
go okay

1014
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
go okay
 

1015
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,870
go okay
got our lever so now when we

1016
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
got our lever so now when we
 

1017
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,150
got our lever so now when we
power this once we now have

1018
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
power this once we now have
 

1019
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,789
power this once we now have
that in there and we will have to power

1020
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:54,799
that in there and we will have to power
 

1021
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,470
that in there and we will have to power
all of these but i think there's an

1022
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480
all of these but i think there's an
 

1023
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,510
all of these but i think there's an
issue that if you do this then

1024
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520
issue that if you do this then
 

1025
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,430
issue that if you do this then
it will trigger a dropper more than once

1026
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
it will trigger a dropper more than once
 

1027
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,190
it will trigger a dropper more than once
sometimes

1028
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
sometimes
 

1029
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,870
sometimes
depending on where it is in the chunk or

1030
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,880
depending on where it is in the chunk or
 

1031
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,350
depending on where it is in the chunk or
what order it processes this

1032
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
what order it processes this
 

1033
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,310
what order it processes this
but uh here let's just try this and we

1034
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
but uh here let's just try this and we
 

1035
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,029
but uh here let's just try this and we
will connect this up to here now

1036
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039

 

1037
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,149

piggy i know you're very curious

1038
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:20,159
piggy i know you're very curious
 

1039
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,750
piggy i know you're very curious
on what i'm doing here but you're very

1040
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,760
on what i'm doing here but you're very
 

1041
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,510
on what i'm doing here but you're very
distracting so yeah

1042
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,520
distracting so yeah
 

1043
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,710
distracting so yeah
it keeps them separate this way was

1044
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:26,720
it keeps them separate this way was
 

1045
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,630
it keeps them separate this way was
no it was red first wasn't it i think

1046
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:28,640
no it was red first wasn't it i think
 

1047
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,750
no it was red first wasn't it i think
the blue jumped the

1048
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
the blue jumped the
 

1049
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,029
the blue jumped the
head oh man my memory stinks that's why

1050
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,039
head oh man my memory stinks that's why
 

1051
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,310
head oh man my memory stinks that's why
i'm building this game

1052
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
i'm building this game
 

1053
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,870
i'm building this game
to help me out so it was blue red this

1054
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:36,880
to help me out so it was blue red this
 

1055
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,549
to help me out so it was blue red this
should have blue in now

1056
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
should have blue in now
 

1057
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,909
should have blue in now
it has nothing red

1058
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:41,919
it has nothing red
 

1059
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,590
it has nothing red
red where did the blue go it must have

1060
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:43,600
red where did the blue go it must have
 

1061
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,830
red where did the blue go it must have
jumped ahead yeah so it skipped one

1062
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:45,840
jumped ahead yeah so it skipped one
 

1063
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,390
jumped ahead yeah so it skipped one
there

1064
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:46,400
there
 

1065
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,990
there
so what we're going to actually have to

1066
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
so what we're going to actually have to
 

1067
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,590
so what we're going to actually have to
do

1068
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
do
 

1069
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,510
do
is uh put a delay on these i'm pretty

1070
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
is uh put a delay on these i'm pretty
 

1071
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,510
is uh put a delay on these i'm pretty
sure

1072
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
sure
 

1073
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,350
sure
but we'll set a limit to the game maybe

1074
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
but we'll set a limit to the game maybe
 

1075
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,789
but we'll set a limit to the game maybe
only 40 or

1076
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
only 40 or
 

1077
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,430
only 40 or
50 maximum

1078
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,440

 

1079
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,549

if i get that then i win type of thing

1080
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
if i get that then i win type of thing
 

1081
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,870
if i get that then i win type of thing
because we have to set a specific limit

1082
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:06,880
because we have to set a specific limit
 

1083
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,190
because we have to set a specific limit
uh that's how many droppers we use

1084
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,200
uh that's how many droppers we use
 

1085
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,510
uh that's how many droppers we use
to like how many how long the chain can

1086
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
to like how many how long the chain can
 

1087
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,630
to like how many how long the chain can
get

1088
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:12,640
get
 

1089
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,190
get
um but yeah we'll probably oh that's not

1090
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
um but yeah we'll probably oh that's not
 

1091
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,990
um but yeah we'll probably oh that's not
going to work

1092
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
going to work
 

1093
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,510
going to work
we need a block spacing in there

1094
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520
we need a block spacing in there
 

1095
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,270
we need a block spacing in there
but yeah if we activate the droppers

1096
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,280
but yeah if we activate the droppers
 

1097
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,590
but yeah if we activate the droppers
like this where we have a one tick delay

1098
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600
like this where we have a one tick delay
 

1099
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,630
like this where we have a one tick delay
between each one

1100
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
between each one
 

1101
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,669
between each one
then there will be

1102
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:27,679
then there will be
 

1103
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,350
then there will be
no issue with them jumping ahead like

1104
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
no issue with them jumping ahead like
 

1105
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,070
no issue with them jumping ahead like
they were doing there

1106
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
they were doing there
 

1107
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,390
they were doing there
all right so here is a test to try out

1108
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:34,400
all right so here is a test to try out
 

1109
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,149
all right so here is a test to try out
that idea we're basically just trying to

1110
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:36,159
that idea we're basically just trying to
 

1111
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:36,789
that idea we're basically just trying to
store

1112
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:36,799
store
 

1113
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,350
store
the memory right now there's more

1114
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
the memory right now there's more
 

1115
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,350
the memory right now there's more
complications that will come later

1116
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:41,360
complications that will come later
 

1117
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,390
complications that will come later
but let's do it one step at a time uh we

1118
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
but let's do it one step at a time uh we
 

1119
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,909
but let's do it one step at a time uh we
want to make sure the items don't bunch

1120
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:45,919
want to make sure the items don't bunch
 

1121
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,390
want to make sure the items don't bunch
up and

1122
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
up and
 

1123
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,590
up and
they keep their order and they don't

1124
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600
they keep their order and they don't
 

1125
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,470
they keep their order and they don't
skip any spots that kind of stuff

1126
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
skip any spots that kind of stuff
 

1127
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,310
skip any spots that kind of stuff
so i have the piss or not piston loop

1128
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
so i have the piss or not piston loop
 

1129
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,630
so i have the piss or not piston loop
the dropper loop here

1130
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,640
the dropper loop here
 

1131
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,149
the dropper loop here
and it's probably easier to keep stuff

1132
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
and it's probably easier to keep stuff
 

1133
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,750
and it's probably easier to keep stuff
in a line like this than to do it in a

1134
00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
in a line like this than to do it in a
 

1135
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,029
in a line like this than to do it in a
square like we had

1136
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
square like we had
 

1137
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,990
square like we had
because then i can just put the

1138
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,000
because then i can just put the
 

1139
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,029
because then i can just put the
repeaters on both sides nice and easy

1140
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
repeaters on both sides nice and easy
 

1141
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,310
repeaters on both sides nice and easy
all right so it's going

1142
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
all right so it's going
 

1143
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,149
all right so it's going
counterclockwise yeah so it goes whoops

1144
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
counterclockwise yeah so it goes whoops
 

1145
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,870
counterclockwise yeah so it goes whoops
don't kill me zombie don't you even

1146
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
don't kill me zombie don't you even
 

1147
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,909
don't kill me zombie don't you even
think of it

1148
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919

 

1149
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,110

i had a creeper blow up right over there

1150
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
i had a creeper blow up right over there
 

1151
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,950
i had a creeper blow up right over there
and blew up my wiring oh and another one

1152
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:24,960
and blew up my wiring oh and another one
 

1153
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,029
and blew up my wiring oh and another one
i'm gonna have to chop these trees down

1154
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
i'm gonna have to chop these trees down
 

1155
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,149
i'm gonna have to chop these trees down
very soon

1156
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
very soon
 

1157
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,630
very soon
although he came from that cave there so

1158
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
although he came from that cave there so
 

1159
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,590
although he came from that cave there so
yeah it goes around the bend like this

1160
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:33,600
yeah it goes around the bend like this
 

1161
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,710
yeah it goes around the bend like this
and then shoots around this way so it

1162
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
and then shoots around this way so it
 

1163
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,230
and then shoots around this way so it
does a loop like that

1164
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
does a loop like that
 

1165
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,630
does a loop like that
the redstone wiring i have going counter

1166
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,640
the redstone wiring i have going counter
 

1167
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,110
the redstone wiring i have going counter
clock

1168
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120

 

1169
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,190

no this is going counterclockwise

1170
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
no this is going counterclockwise
 

1171
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,630
no this is going counterclockwise
redstone wiring is going

1172
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640
redstone wiring is going
 

1173
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,950
redstone wiring is going
clockwise opposite of that so we want to

1174
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:48,960
clockwise opposite of that so we want to
 

1175
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,390
clockwise opposite of that so we want to
activate the end of the chain

1176
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
activate the end of the chain
 

1177
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,270
activate the end of the chain
first and then go to the beginning

1178
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,280
first and then go to the beginning
 

1179
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,470
first and then go to the beginning
so it goes like this and each of these

1180
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:58,480
so it goes like this and each of these
 

1181
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,950
so it goes like this and each of these
is one tick delayed from each other

1182
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
is one tick delayed from each other
 

1183
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,029
is one tick delayed from each other
right so let's just try it out this is a

1184
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:03,039
right so let's just try it out this is a
 

1185
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,310
right so let's just try it out this is a
start here

1186
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
start here
 

1187
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,750
start here
with our colors in it's going to go into

1188
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:07,760
with our colors in it's going to go into
 

1189
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,950
with our colors in it's going to go into
this this way and then back around

1190
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
this this way and then back around
 

1191
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,390
this this way and then back around
um so just hit the button

1192
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
um so just hit the button
 

1193
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,789
um so just hit the button
and it activates all the way around

1194
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799
and it activates all the way around
 

1195
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,950
and it activates all the way around
makes its way to the start here

1196
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:18,960
makes its way to the start here
 

1197
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,390
makes its way to the start here
because if we did it from the start it

1198
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
because if we did it from the start it
 

1199
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,990
because if we did it from the start it
would jump two spaces

1200
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,000
would jump two spaces
 

1201
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,110
would jump two spaces
right we don't want that so red

1202
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,120
right we don't want that so red
 

1203
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,390
right we don't want that so red
good please work

1204
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
good please work
 

1205
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,590
good please work
please work yeah red moved ahead a spot

1206
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
please work yeah red moved ahead a spot
 

1207
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,070
please work yeah red moved ahead a spot
and now we have blue

1208
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
and now we have blue
 

1209
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,110
and now we have blue
red blue yellow good

1210
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
red blue yellow good
 

1211
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,710
red blue yellow good
so it seems to be going okay red

1212
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
so it seems to be going okay red
 

1213
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,750
so it seems to be going okay red
blue yellow green nah

1214
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
blue yellow green nah
 

1215
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,269
blue yellow green nah
see it is kind of random that you get

1216
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:47,279
see it is kind of random that you get
 

1217
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,710
see it is kind of random that you get
one of each right

1218
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
one of each right
 

1219
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,110
one of each right
remember my example i i did one of every

1220
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,120
remember my example i i did one of every
 

1221
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,909
remember my example i i did one of every
color

1222
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:53,919
color
 

1223
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,789
color
it happens and blue yeah so it looks

1224
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799
it happens and blue yeah so it looks
 

1225
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,470
it happens and blue yeah so it looks
like it's going good

1226
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,480
like it's going good
 

1227
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,390
like it's going good
um all right so that is good we can

1228
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
um all right so that is good we can
 

1229
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,990
um all right so that is good we can
actually store stuff in memory this

1230
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
actually store stuff in memory this
 

1231
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,350
actually store stuff in memory this
way without it having any issues

1232
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
way without it having any issues
 

1233
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,110
way without it having any issues
okay so that's awesome we can store

1234
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,120
okay so that's awesome we can store
 

1235
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,630
okay so that's awesome we can store
stuff in memory it's very

1236
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:10,640
stuff in memory it's very
 

1237
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,990
stuff in memory it's very
important to the game but on its own it

1238
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
important to the game but on its own it
 

1239
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,070
important to the game but on its own it
is totally useless to us unless we can

1240
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,080
is totally useless to us unless we can
 

1241
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,750
is totally useless to us unless we can
actually read that memory

1242
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
actually read that memory
 

1243
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,029
actually read that memory
so what we would do uh

1244
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039
so what we would do uh
 

1245
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,950
so what we would do uh
just this is technically the start of

1246
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:22,960
just this is technically the start of
 

1247
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,029
just this is technically the start of
the chain maybe

1248
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:25,039
the chain maybe
 

1249
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,669
the chain maybe
but yeah we would then need to compare

1250
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:29,679
but yeah we would then need to compare
 

1251
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,230
but yeah we would then need to compare
my inputs with what is next in the thing

1252
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,240
my inputs with what is next in the thing
 

1253
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,590
my inputs with what is next in the thing
so let's say

1254
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
so let's say
 

1255
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,070
so let's say
it's red right we need the game to know

1256
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,080
it's red right we need the game to know
 

1257
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,269
it's red right we need the game to know
it's red

1258
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:37,279
it's red
 

1259
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,029
it's red
right now it's it's not doing anything

1260
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
right now it's it's not doing anything
 

1261
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,870
right now it's it's not doing anything
it's moving items around

1262
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
it's moving items around
 

1263
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,909
it's moving items around
so we would probably

1264
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
so we would probably
 

1265
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,710
so we would probably
set up an ice stream it's a good thing i

1266
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:46,720
set up an ice stream it's a good thing i
 

1267
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,789
set up an ice stream it's a good thing i
brought that ice after all

1268
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:48,799
brought that ice after all
 

1269
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,029
brought that ice after all
because we will need it let's see let's

1270
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039
because we will need it let's see let's
 

1271
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,029
because we will need it let's see let's
grab that

1272
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,039
grab that
 

1273
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,350
grab that
again this is not a polished version of

1274
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,360
again this is not a polished version of
 

1275
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,230
again this is not a polished version of
the game by any means we're just

1276
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,240
the game by any means we're just
 

1277
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,390
the game by any means we're just
we're just working out the steps to it

1278
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
we're just working out the steps to it
 

1279
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,510
we're just working out the steps to it
so

1280
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520
so
 

1281
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,310
so
let's move this get out of the way we

1282
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
let's move this get out of the way we
 

1283
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,149
let's move this get out of the way we
would set up an ice stream

1284
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:06,159
would set up an ice stream
 

1285
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,269
would set up an ice stream
and probably have that go to an item

1286
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:09,279
and probably have that go to an item
 

1287
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,269
and probably have that go to an item
filter

1288
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:11,279
filter
 

1289
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,549
filter
and i'll i'm not actually going to set

1290
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
and i'll i'm not actually going to set
 

1291
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,750
and i'll i'm not actually going to set
up i'm just showing this as a

1292
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,760
up i'm just showing this as a
 

1293
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,110
up i'm just showing this as a
demonstration

1294
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,120
demonstration
 

1295
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,390
demonstration
so one of these would be for red

1296
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,400

 

1297
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,549

type of thing one of them would be for

1298
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,559
type of thing one of them would be for
 

1299
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,789
type of thing one of them would be for
green one of them for yellow

1300
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:24,799
green one of them for yellow
 

1301
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,789
green one of them for yellow
and blue and if it goes into that hopper

1302
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:28,799
and blue and if it goes into that hopper
 

1303
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,390
and blue and if it goes into that hopper
like when an item shoots out of here

1304
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:30,400
like when an item shoots out of here
 

1305
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,230
like when an item shoots out of here
it'll go into one of the hoppers

1306
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,240
it'll go into one of the hoppers
 

1307
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,710
it'll go into one of the hoppers
then we can use the comparator to

1308
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:34,720
then we can use the comparator to
 

1309
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,310
then we can use the comparator to
trigger a redstone signal and save that

1310
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,320
trigger a redstone signal and save that
 

1311
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,350
trigger a redstone signal and save that
um and then when i click a button

1312
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,360
um and then when i click a button
 

1313
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,390
um and then when i click a button
or a pressure plate it'll compare which

1314
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,400
or a pressure plate it'll compare which
 

1315
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,350
or a pressure plate it'll compare which
one of these got

1316
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,360
one of these got
 

1317
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,950
one of these got
activated with what button i push and

1318
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:48,960
activated with what button i push and
 

1319
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,830
activated with what button i push and
if they match then it counts as a

1320
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
if they match then it counts as a
 

1321
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,669
if they match then it counts as a
correct answer and it'll move on to the

1322
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:53,679
correct answer and it'll move on to the
 

1323
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,470
correct answer and it'll move on to the
next one

1324
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,480
next one
 

1325
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,870
next one
in the memory chain here or if it's

1326
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
in the memory chain here or if it's
 

1327
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,470
in the memory chain here or if it's
wrong then we need to make this

1328
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
wrong then we need to make this
 

1329
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,909
wrong then we need to make this
the game reset so we would have to

1330
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919
the game reset so we would have to
 

1331
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,950
the game reset so we would have to
move all the items through the chain

1332
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:04,960
move all the items through the chain
 

1333
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,110

of these

1336
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
of these
 

1337
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,870
of these
to pull the items out and then put them

1338
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:10,880
to pull the items out and then put them
 

1339
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,630
to pull the items out and then put them
into the start here

1340
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:12,640
into the start here
 

1341
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,750
into the start here
