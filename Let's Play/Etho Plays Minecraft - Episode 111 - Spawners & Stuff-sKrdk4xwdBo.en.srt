5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,040

so I wanted a win-win-win situation for

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,050
so I wanted a win-win-win situation for
 

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,670
so I wanted a win-win-win situation for
our brightness issue but obviously I'm

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
our brightness issue but obviously I'm
 

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,710
our brightness issue but obviously I'm
not going to please everybody so this is

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:27,720
not going to please everybody so this is
 

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,279
not going to please everybody so this is
what I decided to do brightness eighty

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:31,289
what I decided to do brightness eighty
 

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,810
what I decided to do brightness eighty
percent I went with a compromise I'm

14
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:35,820
percent I went with a compromise I'm
 

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,310
percent I went with a compromise I'm
hoping it works okay for everybody you

16
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
hoping it works okay for everybody you
 

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,110
hoping it works okay for everybody you
can adjust your monitor brightness if

18
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,120
can adjust your monitor brightness if
 

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,810
can adjust your monitor brightness if
you find it too dark still but and I do

20
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:44,820
you find it too dark still but and I do
 

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,970
you find it too dark still but and I do
recommend you do because it really

22
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:46,980
recommend you do because it really
 

23
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,810
recommend you do because it really
shouldn't be too dark at that level okay

24
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:53,820
shouldn't be too dark at that level okay
 

25
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,270
shouldn't be too dark at that level okay
so we are going to do a little bit work

26
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
so we are going to do a little bit work
 

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,060
so we are going to do a little bit work
on this again today our farm it's not

28
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,070
on this again today our farm it's not
 

29
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,320
on this again today our farm it's not
much left I'm going to run a tube up

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:06,330
much left I'm going to run a tube up
 

31
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,990
much left I'm going to run a tube up
here this is where I want the animals to

32
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,000
here this is where I want the animals to
 

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,670
here this is where I want the animals to
fall down right at this block here so

34
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
fall down right at this block here so
 

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:22,030
fall down right at this block here so
yeah put down some soil oops

36
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,040

 

37
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,010

just I don't know what I don't know what

38
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,020
just I don't know what I don't know what
 

39
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,310
just I don't know what I don't know what
I'm doing here

40
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:27,320
I'm doing here
 

41
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,390
I'm doing here
put soil there then glass I figure I

42
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
put soil there then glass I figure I
 

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,819
put soil there then glass I figure I
want two things two options to happen

44
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:34,829
want two things two options to happen
 

45
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:42,770
want two things two options to happen
here either animals fall down here and

46
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:42,780
here either animals fall down here and
 

47
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,139
here either animals fall down here and
they automatically die by falling

48
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:45,149
they automatically die by falling
 

49
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,830
they automatically die by falling
through lava so that their their meat

50
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:48,840
through lava so that their their meat
 

51
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,330
through lava so that their their meat
chop to get roasted or whatever

52
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:50,340
chop to get roasted or whatever
 

53
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,170
chop to get roasted or whatever
automatically or the other thing I would

54
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:54,180
automatically or the other thing I would
 

55
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,020
automatically or the other thing I would
want is the option to have them weakened

56
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,030
want is the option to have them weakened
 

57
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,780
want is the option to have them weakened
to the point where I can one-hit kill

58
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:02,790
to the point where I can one-hit kill
 

59
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,560
to the point where I can one-hit kill
them to get their XP those are the two

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:06,570
them to get their XP those are the two
 

61
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,639
them to get their XP those are the two
things I want the two options so

62
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:10,649
things I want the two options so
 

63
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,040
things I want the two options so
I figure if they fall from this height

64
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,050
I figure if they fall from this height
 

65
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,280
I figure if they fall from this height
they should be pretty close to 1 hit

66
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,290
they should be pretty close to 1 hit
 

67
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,790
they should be pretty close to 1 hit
kill so that'll take care of that nice

68
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:19,800
kill so that'll take care of that nice
 

69
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,690
kill so that'll take care of that nice
easy and for the lava we would just need

70
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:23,700
easy and for the lava we would just need
 

71
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,559
easy and for the lava we would just need
to set up a piston a lava blade

72
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:27,569
to set up a piston a lava blade
 

73
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:29,869
to set up a piston a lava blade
controlled by a piston shouldn't be too

74
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:29,879
controlled by a piston shouldn't be too
 

75
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:35,449
controlled by a piston shouldn't be too
difficult so that is a situation where

76
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:35,459
difficult so that is a situation where
 

77
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:44,600
difficult so that is a situation where
are my shears if I had cheers cool I was

78
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:44,610
are my shears if I had cheers cool I was
 

79
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,059
are my shears if I had cheers cool I was
thinking about using glass panes I tried

80
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:47,069
thinking about using glass panes I tried
 

81
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,620
thinking about using glass panes I tried
them they looked funny so I I just

82
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:48,630
them they looked funny so I I just
 

83
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:59,750
them they looked funny so I I just
canceled that all right yeah so this

84
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
canceled that all right yeah so this
 

85
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,000
canceled that all right yeah so this
shoot will be for the animals and then

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,010
shoot will be for the animals and then
 

87
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,110
shoot will be for the animals and then
I'll have a ladder going up for me

88
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
I'll have a ladder going up for me
 

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,440
I'll have a ladder going up for me
around around here somewhere and a water

90
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,450
around around here somewhere and a water
 

91
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,770
around around here somewhere and a water
break on the opposite side for coming

92
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:12,780
break on the opposite side for coming
 

93
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:20,720
break on the opposite side for coming
back down it's the plan right on so it's

94
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:20,730
back down it's the plan right on so it's
 

95
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,229
back down it's the plan right on so it's
working to some extent now we do have

96
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
working to some extent now we do have
 

97
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,629
working to some extent now we do have
more work to do on it but for today I

98
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:26,639
more work to do on it but for today I
 

99
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,020
more work to do on it but for today I
believe that's all we'll do they'll fall

100
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,030
believe that's all we'll do they'll fall
 

101
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,710
believe that's all we'll do they'll fall
down here I tried it already they fall

102
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
down here I tried it already they fall
 

103
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,360
down here I tried it already they fall
the odd time they will die from that

104
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,370
the odd time they will die from that
 

105
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,370
the odd time they will die from that
drop so I might need some sort of a

106
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:37,380
drop so I might need some sort of a
 

107
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,039
drop so I might need some sort of a
water break but if they don't it's a 1

108
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,049
water break but if they don't it's a 1
 

109
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:42,909
water break but if they don't it's a 1
hit kill always which is what I wanted I

110
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:42,919
hit kill always which is what I wanted I
 

111
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,390
hit kill always which is what I wanted I
will need to add a lava option yet

112
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
will need to add a lava option yet
 

113
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,170
will need to add a lava option yet
sometime I had a little trouble just a

114
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:51,180
sometime I had a little trouble just a
 

115
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,240
sometime I had a little trouble just a
little bit that the mobs did not want to

116
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,250
little bit that the mobs did not want to
 

117
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,819
little bit that the mobs did not want to
go the places I wanted them to this is

118
00:03:58,819 --> 00:03:58,829
go the places I wanted them to this is
 

119
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,319
go the places I wanted them to this is
how I get down to the center by the way

120
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:00,329
how I get down to the center by the way
 

121
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,190
how I get down to the center by the way
just over here I do need to polish up

122
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:04,200
just over here I do need to polish up
 

123
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,809
just over here I do need to polish up
the area a lot yet a little glass look

124
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:08,819
the area a lot yet a little glass look
 

125
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,690
the area a lot yet a little glass look
out all around but yeah the mob path

126
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:13,700
out all around but yeah the mob path
 

127
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,210
out all around but yeah the mob path
pathfinding it's a little different than

128
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:17,220
pathfinding it's a little different than
 

129
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,420
pathfinding it's a little different than
I was expecting

130
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,430
I was expecting
 

131
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,460
I was expecting
I tried adding a skylight there it

132
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:21,470
I tried adding a skylight there it
 

133
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,010
I tried adding a skylight there it
seemed to draw them to the area but they

134
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,020
seemed to draw them to the area but they
 

135
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,030
seemed to draw them to the area but they
did not want to walk down this hole here

136
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,040
did not want to walk down this hole here
 

137
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,879
did not want to walk down this hole here
as I expected so I put a sign on to this

138
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:30,889
as I expected so I put a sign on to this
 

139
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:33,550
as I expected so I put a sign on to this
last block here to trick them into

140
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:33,560
last block here to trick them into
 

141
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,909
last block here to trick them into
thinking it's ground that's how you used

142
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:36,919
thinking it's ground that's how you used
 

143
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:38,830
thinking it's ground that's how you used
to be able to make mobs fall more than

144
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:38,840
to be able to make mobs fall more than
 

145
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,460
to be able to make mobs fall more than
three and a half blocks but when I did

146
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,470
three and a half blocks but when I did
 

147
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,550
three and a half blocks but when I did
it it did not work I don't know why I

148
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
it it did not work I don't know why I
 

149
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,990
it it did not work I don't know why I
don't know if that trick was patched or

150
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,000
don't know if that trick was patched or
 

151
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,550
don't know if that trick was patched or
what the deal is but it just did not

152
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
what the deal is but it just did not
 

153
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,630
what the deal is but it just did not
work and I'm having another problem when

154
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:52,640
work and I'm having another problem when
 

155
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,340
work and I'm having another problem when
they land on these half slabs they don't

156
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:54,350
they land on these half slabs they don't
 

157
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,330
they land on these half slabs they don't
seem to treat these leaves as normal

158
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:58,340
seem to treat these leaves as normal
 

159
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,930
seem to treat these leaves as normal
ground they don't seem to have an equal

160
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:01,940
ground they don't seem to have an equal
 

161

close to close oops good so that's the

198
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:14,020
close to close oops good so that's the
 

199
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,970
close to close oops good so that's the
thing and that's why I couldn't use

200
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:14,980
thing and that's why I couldn't use
 

201
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,970
thing and that's why I couldn't use
fences over here that's why I have leaf

202
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:17,980
fences over here that's why I have leaf
 

203
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,030
fences over here that's why I have leaf
blocks because if you right-click your

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,040
blocks because if you right-click your
 

205
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,630
blocks because if you right-click your
fishing rod and it's highlighted then it

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:24,640
fishing rod and it's highlighted then it
 

207
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,790
fishing rod and it's highlighted then it
opens the fence instead of throwing your

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,200
stopped what happened it did that's
 

217
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,820
stopped what happened it did that's
weird

218
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:47,830
weird
 

219
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:56,450
weird
one sec that was strange very strange on

220
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:56,460

 

221
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,440

the air rid of all the pigs his cows are

222
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,450
the air rid of all the pigs his cows are
 

223
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,510
the air rid of all the pigs his cows are
much better

224

some people want me get the mushrooms
 

227
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,190
some people want me get the mushrooms
and if we ever find a mushroom biome or

228
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:10,200
and if we ever find a mushroom biome or
 

229
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,360
and if we ever find a mushroom biome or
whatever the biome is called mushroom

230
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,370
whatever the biome is called mushroom
 

231
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:20,190
whatever the biome is called mushroom
biome we definitely will I guess if the

232
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:20,200
biome we definitely will I guess if the
 

233
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,840
biome we definitely will I guess if the
animals don't cooperate like this guys

234
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:21,850
animals don't cooperate like this guys

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,110
right in the center
 

237
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,900
right in the center
you switch to a different tool go for

238
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:27,910
you switch to a different tool go for
 

239
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,390
you switch to a different tool go for
another one

240
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400

 

241
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,170

yeah this is animals the don't cooperate

242
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:37,180
yeah this is animals the don't cooperate
 

243
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,080

00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
they're probably falling one block
 

257
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,300
they're probably falling one block
further than they need to be you can get

258
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,310
further than they need to be you can get
 

259
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,980
further than they need to be you can get
some XP but mobs

260
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:22,990
some XP but mobs
 

261

made it actually but I did not have
 

277
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,910
made it actually but I did not have
enough books to yet enchanting it level

278
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:56,920
enough books to yet enchanting it level
 

279
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,100
enough books to yet enchanting it level
11 we'll talk about it later

280
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,110

make sticky pistons you need slime balls
 

287
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,680
make sticky pistons you need slime balls
so I need to make a slime farm or

288
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:13,690
so I need to make a slime farm or
 

289
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,250
so I need to make a slime farm or
something before I can do that

290
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:17,260
something before I can do that
 

291
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,750
something before I can do that
so here we go I went on the slime finder

292
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
so here we go I went on the slime finder
 

293
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,430
so here we go I went on the slime finder
app and I found two chunks near here I

294
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:26,440
app and I found two chunks near here I
 

295
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,280
app and I found two chunks near here I
can make a slime farm at there's

296
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,290
can make a slime farm at there's
 

297
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,259
can make a slime farm at there's
actually not very many slime jumps

298
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:31,269
actually not very many slime jumps
 

299
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,590
actually not very many slime jumps
around here

300
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
around here
 

301
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
around here
and I'll link it in the description if I

302
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,250
and I'll link it in the description if I
 

303
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:42,270
and I'll link it in the description if I
remember let's see where do I want to go

304
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:42,280
remember let's see where do I want to go
 

305
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:48,060
remember let's see where do I want to go
here it's over here possibly yeah

306
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,070
here it's over here possibly yeah
 

307
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,000
here it's over here possibly yeah
over here so this is where I was first

308
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,010
over here so this is where I was first
 

309
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,650
over here so this is where I was first
getting my lava from then I found

310
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:54,660
getting my lava from then I found
 

311
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,770
getting my lava from then I found
there's a huge lab a pool down here huge

312
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:58,780
there's a huge lab a pool down here huge
 

313
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,260
there's a huge lab a pool down here huge
like it goes all the way back there it

314
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,270
like it goes all the way back there it
 

315
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,590
like it goes all the way back there it
goes to the left goes back there

316
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:04,600
goes to the left goes back there
 

317
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,800
goes to the left goes back there
somewhere wraps around here all the way

318
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:07,810
somewhere wraps around here all the way
 

319
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,540
somewhere wraps around here all the way
over here and not only that it goes like

320
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:12,550
over here and not only that it goes like
 

321
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,900
over here and not only that it goes like
and I think it goes to that pool over

322
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:15,910
and I think it goes to that pool over
 

323
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:22,890
and I think it goes to that pool over
there to some over there but yeah you

324
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:22,900
there to some over there but yeah you
 

325
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,590
there to some over there but yeah you
hear that sound that's the sound of

326
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
hear that sound that's the sound of
 

327
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,620
hear that sound that's the sound of
glory so right here is one slime chunk

328
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:31,630
glory so right here is one slime chunk
 

329
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,320
glory so right here is one slime chunk
actually right by this lava pool and

330
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,330
actually right by this lava pool and
 

331
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,990
actually right by this lava pool and
there's another one diagonally from it

332
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,000
there's another one diagonally from it
 

333
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,420
there's another one diagonally from it
over here I have three slime balls right

334
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:42,430
over here I have three slime balls right
 

335
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,020
over here I have three slime balls right
now so this guy's a huge score if he

336
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,030
now so this guy's a huge score if he
 

337
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,600
now so this guy's a huge score if he
doesn't kill me or himself

338
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:48,610
doesn't kill me or himself
 

339
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,500
doesn't kill me or himself
I found a few big slimes like this but

340
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:52,510
I found a few big slimes like this but
 

341
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,030
I found a few big slimes like this but
they keep jumping in the lava before I

342
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,040
they keep jumping in the lava before I
 

343
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:01,800
they keep jumping in the lava before I
did to him don't you dare kill me now

344
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:01,810
did to him don't you dare kill me now
 

345
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:10,680
did to him don't you dare kill me now
don't now now I sigh Bob most of them

346
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:10,690
don't now now I sigh Bob most of them
 

347
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,740
don't now now I sigh Bob most of them
died but I got a few so this is the

348
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:13,750
died but I got a few so this is the
 

349
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,030
died but I got a few so this is the
other slime chunk right right about here

350
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
other slime chunk right right about here
 

351
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,770
other slime chunk right right about here
so I believe what I'm going to do I'm

352
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:19,780
so I believe what I'm going to do I'm
 

353
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,760
so I believe what I'm going to do I'm
just going to hollow out the area for

354
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:23,770
just going to hollow out the area for
 

355
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,870
just going to hollow out the area for
now and then later eventually I'll work

356
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:27,880
now and then later eventually I'll work
 

357
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,870
now and then later eventually I'll work
on finishing up the slime farm I just

358
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
on finishing up the slime farm I just
 

359
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,490
on finishing up the slime farm I just
want them to be able to spawn safely

360
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:32,500
want them to be able to spawn safely
 

361
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,490
want them to be able to spawn safely
though for in it for now so I'll

362
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:35,500
though for in it for now so I'll
 

363
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,460
though for in it for now so I'll
probably hollow this part out first yes

364
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:41,470
probably hollow this part out first yes
 

365
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,949
probably hollow this part out first yes
I just basically hollowed out a chunk

366
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:43,959
I just basically hollowed out a chunk
 

367
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:46,749
I just basically hollowed out a chunk
for slimes to spawn in here

368
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:46,759
for slimes to spawn in here
 

369
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,660
for slimes to spawn in here
a three-high area so the big slimes

370
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:49,670
a three-high area so the big slimes
 

371
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,419
a three-high area so the big slimes
won't suffocate when they spawn and we

372
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:52,429
won't suffocate when they spawn and we
 

373
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:54,519
won't suffocate when they spawn and we
have a wall on the side so they don't

374
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:54,529
have a wall on the side so they don't
 

375
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:56,049
have a wall on the side so they don't
jump in the lab like they have been

376
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:56,059
jump in the lab like they have been
 

377
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:59,679
jump in the lab like they have been
doing so I'll be able to get all the

378
00:11:59,679 --> 00:11:59,689
doing so I'll be able to get all the
 

379
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:04,539
doing so I'll be able to get all the
slime balls now and I recorded myself

380
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:04,549
slime balls now and I recorded myself
 

381
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,639
slime balls now and I recorded myself
hollowing this out and then my computer

382
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:06,649
hollowing this out and then my computer
 

383
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:08,799
hollowing this out and then my computer
locked up so we lost all that footage

384
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:08,809
locked up so we lost all that footage
 

385
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:11,829
locked up so we lost all that footage
but I'll just summarize quickly how this

386
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
but I'll just summarize quickly how this
 

387
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,249
but I'll just summarize quickly how this
works if you're new to the game that

388
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:15,259
works if you're new to the game that
 

389
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:19,319
works if you're new to the game that
trunk is a sixteen by sixteen area and

390
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:19,329
trunk is a sixteen by sixteen area and
 

391
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:21,999
trunk is a sixteen by sixteen area and
slimes only spawn in ten percent of

392
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:22,009
slimes only spawn in ten percent of
 

393
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:25,210
slimes only spawn in ten percent of
chunks so you can't just dig down to New

394
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:25,220
chunks so you can't just dig down to New
 

395
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,759
chunks so you can't just dig down to New
York and expect slimes will spawn

396
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:27,769
York and expect slimes will spawn
 

397
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:29,799
York and expect slimes will spawn
there's only 10 percent chance they'll

398
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:29,809
there's only 10 percent chance they'll
 

399
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:32,910
there's only 10 percent chance they'll
spawn in any given chunk which is

400
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:32,920
spawn in any given chunk which is
 

401
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,069
spawn in any given chunk which is
determined randomly basically with an

402
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
determined randomly basically with an
 

403
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,689
determined randomly basically with an
algorithm you can actually figure it out

404
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:37,699
algorithm you can actually figure it out
 

405
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:39,519
algorithm you can actually figure it out
on a calculator if you want but it would

406
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:39,529
on a calculator if you want but it would
 

407
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,859
on a calculator if you want but it would
take forever so I just use the slime

408
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:41,869
take forever so I just use the slime
 

409
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:46,840
take forever so I just use the slime
finder app and that tells me locations

410
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:46,850
finder app and that tells me locations
 

411
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,879
finder app and that tells me locations
of the chunks that spawn slimes and then

412
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:48,889
of the chunks that spawn slimes and then
 

413
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:53,079
of the chunks that spawn slimes and then
I use ft to find the coordinates in game

414
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:53,089
I use ft to find the coordinates in game
 

415
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:56,559
I use ft to find the coordinates in game
and that's how I figure out where to

416
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:56,569
and that's how I figure out where to
 

417
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:02,169
and that's how I figure out where to
hollow my room here and yeah an slimes

418
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:02,179
hollow my room here and yeah an slimes
 

419
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:06,009
hollow my room here and yeah an slimes
spawn at any light level below level 16

420
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:06,019
spawn at any light level below level 16
 

421
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,189
spawn at any light level below level 16
for the y-coordinate so that's the trick

422
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:09,199
for the y-coordinate so that's the trick
 

423
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:15,819
for the y-coordinate so that's the trick
but only in slime chunks it's also a lot

424
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:15,829
but only in slime chunks it's also a lot
 

425
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,100
but only in slime chunks it's also a lot
more rare for slimes to spawn than other

426
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,110
more rare for slimes to spawn than other
 

427
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,159
more rare for slimes to spawn than other
mobs so it'll probably take a while to

428
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:21,169
mobs so it'll probably take a while to
 

429
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:25,449
mobs so it'll probably take a while to
get a few so we're just trying to pass

430
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:25,459
get a few so we're just trying to pass
 

431
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:28,119
get a few so we're just trying to pass
the time I'm also waiting for some reeds

432
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:28,129
the time I'm also waiting for some reeds
 

433
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:32,049
the time I'm also waiting for some reeds
to grow so let me do some enchanting but

434
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:32,059
to grow so let me do some enchanting but
 

435
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:35,139
to grow so let me do some enchanting but
I think I think Reed growth has slowed

436
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:35,149
I think I think Reed growth has slowed
 

437
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,799
I think I think Reed growth has slowed
down or at least it seems to it seems to

438
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:38,809
down or at least it seems to it seems to
 

439
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:41,920
down or at least it seems to it seems to
have

440
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:41,930

 

441
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,390

let's see I have two pigs left in my

442
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:44,400
let's see I have two pigs left in my
 

443
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:52,070
let's see I have two pigs left in my
farm I think I'm going to get rid of 101

444
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,080
farm I think I'm going to get rid of 101
 

445
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,700
farm I think I'm going to get rid of 101
pig left and I just lost my fishing rod

446
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:55,710
pig left and I just lost my fishing rod
 

447
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:06,410
pig left and I just lost my fishing rod
so he is gonna have a lucky day actually

448
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:06,420
so he is gonna have a lucky day actually
 

449
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,970
so he is gonna have a lucky day actually
the wheat is grown so let's go harvest

450
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:07,980
the wheat is grown so let's go harvest
 

451
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,240
the wheat is grown so let's go harvest
it okay I don't know if I've done that

452
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,250
it okay I don't know if I've done that
 

453
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:20,560
it okay I don't know if I've done that
on camera before but it legs oh the joy

454
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:20,570

 

455
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,820

nothing looks cooler than that I love

456
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:22,830
nothing looks cooler than that I love
 

457
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:33,040
nothing looks cooler than that I love
that yes so try do some chanting um

458
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,050
that yes so try do some chanting um
 

459
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,220
that yes so try do some chanting um
maybe you'll be able to check the slime

460
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,230
maybe you'll be able to check the slime
 

461
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:42,680
maybe you'll be able to check the slime
front see if any spawns I'm a vet a

462
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:42,690
front see if any spawns I'm a vet a
 

463
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:49,600
front see if any spawns I'm a vet a
standstill right now as to what to do oh

464
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:49,610

 

465
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:56,450

yeah some reason I always take a jello

466
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:56,460
yeah some reason I always take a jello
 

467
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,360
yeah some reason I always take a jello
when I see these guys I always want

468
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,370
when I see these guys I always want
 

469
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:13,740
when I see these guys I always want
jello

470
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:13,750

 

471
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,970

not very exciting is it this is what

472
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:17,980
not very exciting is it this is what
 

473
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,439
not very exciting is it this is what
I've been doing like 20 minutes just

474
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:21,449
I've been doing like 20 minutes just
 

475
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:25,829
I've been doing like 20 minutes just
watching the reeds grow although they're

476
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:25,839
watching the reeds grow although they're
 

477
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,340
watching the reeds grow although they're
not growing while they are it's just so

478
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,350
not growing while they are it's just so
 

479
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:36,449
not growing while they are it's just so
slow why so slow we're going to skip and

480
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:36,459
slow why so slow we're going to skip and
 

481
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:40,679
slow why so slow we're going to skip and
chanting for just a little while we do

482
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:40,689
chanting for just a little while we do
 

483
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,079
chanting for just a little while we do
have enough sticky pistons or we can

484
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:43,089
have enough sticky pistons or we can
 

485
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:45,929
have enough sticky pistons or we can
make enough sticky pistons now for what

486
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:45,939
make enough sticky pistons now for what
 

487
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:49,559
make enough sticky pistons now for what
I wanted to do with the pumpkin farm but

488
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:49,569
I wanted to do with the pumpkin farm but
 

489
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:52,050
I wanted to do with the pumpkin farm but
I remembered now I wanted to mess around

490
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:52,060
I remembered now I wanted to mess around
 

491
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,210
I remembered now I wanted to mess around
with those cheap spider spawners so

492
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:54,220
with those cheap spider spawners so
 

493
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,519
with those cheap spider spawners so
let's do that yeah so we have two of

494
00:15:59,519 --> 00:15:59,529
let's do that yeah so we have two of
 

495
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:01,590
let's do that yeah so we have two of
these spawners to keep spider spawners

496
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:01,600
these spawners to keep spider spawners
 

497
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,410
these spawners to keep spider spawners
one here and one down there close

498
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:04,420
one here and one down there close
 

499
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,980
one here and one down there close
together near our farm near our creeper

500
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:07,990
together near our farm near our creeper
 

501
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,819
together near our farm near our creeper
face up there so we should capitalize on

502
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:11,829
face up there so we should capitalize on
 

503
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:15,150
face up there so we should capitalize on
this yes I want to make it so I can get

504
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,160
this yes I want to make it so I can get
 

505
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,269
this yes I want to make it so I can get
their XP when they spawn I also would

506
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:18,279
their XP when they spawn I also would
 

507
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,340
their XP when they spawn I also would
like to make it so they don't stop

508
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:20,350
like to make it so they don't stop
 

509
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,549
like to make it so they don't stop
spawning if I'm near them monster

510
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:23,559
spawning if I'm near them monster
 

511
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,769
spawning if I'm near them monster
spawners will spawn mobs if you're

512
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:25,779
spawners will spawn mobs if you're
 

513
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:29,129
spawners will spawn mobs if you're
within 16 blocks of them so just imagine

514
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:29,139
within 16 blocks of them so just imagine
 

515
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:35,460
within 16 blocks of them so just imagine
a sphere all around this spawner with a

516
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:35,470
a sphere all around this spawner with a
 

517
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,360
a sphere all around this spawner with a
radius of 16 blocks and if you're within

518
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,370
radius of 16 blocks and if you're within
 

519
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,319
radius of 16 blocks and if you're within
that day we can spawn mobs and these are

520
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:43,329
that day we can spawn mobs and these are
 

521
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:45,240
that day we can spawn mobs and these are
cave spider spawners which are a huge

522
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,250
cave spider spawners which are a huge
 

523
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,210
cave spider spawners which are a huge
pain because cave spiders fit within one

524
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:48,220
pain because cave spiders fit within one
 

525
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,360
pain because cave spiders fit within one
block there less than one by one by one

526
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,370
block there less than one by one by one
 

527
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,379
block there less than one by one by one
in size they can climb they're poisonous

528
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:55,389
in size they can climb they're poisonous
 

529
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,590
in size they can climb they're poisonous
so huge pain to deal with and I believe

530
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:58,600
so huge pain to deal with and I believe
 

531
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,720
so huge pain to deal with and I believe
they spawn if it slipped below light

532
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:00,730
they spawn if it slipped below light
 

533
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,449
they spawn if it slipped below light
level 8 and I don't know if this is true

534
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:06,459
level 8 and I don't know if this is true
 

535
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,020
level 8 and I don't know if this is true
but I believe they spawn up to 4 blocks

536
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,030
but I believe they spawn up to 4 blocks
 

537
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:15,240
but I believe they spawn up to 4 blocks
away from the spawner so 1 2 3 4 so they

538
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,250
away from the spawner so 1 2 3 4 so they
 

539
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,699
away from the spawner so 1 2 3 4 so they
should be able to spawn here but no

540
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:17,709
should be able to spawn here but no
 

541
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,720
should be able to spawn here but no
further just I usually just imagine a 9

542
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:21,730
further just I usually just imagine a 9
 

543
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,910
further just I usually just imagine a 9
by 9 square

544
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:25,920

 

545
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:33,680

around the spotter yeah and I mmm

546
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:33,690
around the spotter yeah and I mmm
 

547
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,890
around the spotter yeah and I mmm
this this always confuses me I know they

548
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:36,900
this this always confuses me I know they
 

549
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,980
this this always confuses me I know they
can spawn at this level and I know they

550
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:39,990
can spawn at this level and I know they
 

551
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,870
can spawn at this level and I know they
can spawn if you go to one down now I

552
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:41,880
can spawn if you go to one down now I
 

553
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,270
can spawn if you go to one down now I
can't remember if you go one more down

554
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:44,280
can't remember if you go one more down
 

555
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,820
can't remember if you go one more down
if they'll spawn or if it's one more up

556
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:46,830
if they'll spawn or if it's one more up
 

557
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:54,290
if they'll spawn or if it's one more up
from here maybe we'll try it if I make

558
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:54,300
from here maybe we'll try it if I make
 

559
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,320
from here maybe we'll try it if I make
no light there we'll see if they spawn

560
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,330
no light there we'll see if they spawn
 

561
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:03,200
no light there we'll see if they spawn
in there well they are spawning but I

562
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,210
in there well they are spawning but I
 

563
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,030
in there well they are spawning but I
think I messed up this test a little bit

564
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,040

 

565
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:15,730

okay well let's go with this one first

566
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:15,740

 

567
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,990

that one spawned one block above the

568
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,000
that one spawned one block above the
 

569
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:33,500
that one spawned one block above the
spawner and I dug a hole too deep but I

570
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:33,510
spawner and I dug a hole too deep but I
 

571
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,830
spawner and I dug a hole too deep but I
realize now that they possibly are

572
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:36,840
realize now that they possibly are
 

573
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,790
realize now that they possibly are
spawning in midair and then falling down

574
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:39,800
spawning in midair and then falling down
 

575
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,830
spawning in midair and then falling down
because I dug a hole three deep here and

576
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:42,840
because I dug a hole three deep here and
 

577
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,930
because I dug a hole three deep here and
they also spawn so I didn't do it right

578
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:44,940
they also spawn so I didn't do it right
 

579
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:56,210
they also spawn so I didn't do it right
so I will adjust it give me a sec yeah

580
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:56,220
so I will adjust it give me a sec yeah
 

581
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,530
so I will adjust it give me a sec yeah
so this time I'll dig do down but I'll

582
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:00,540
so this time I'll dig do down but I'll
 

583
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,940
so this time I'll dig do down but I'll
cover it here and I know they can spawn

584
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:04,950
cover it here and I know they can spawn
 

585
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,810
cover it here and I know they can spawn
at this level so I will make a 1 by 1 by

586
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:08,820
at this level so I will make a 1 by 1 by
 

587
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,840
at this level so I will make a 1 by 1 by
1 dark area and see if they'll spawn

588
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:11,850
1 dark area and see if they'll spawn
 

589
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,220
1 dark area and see if they'll spawn
there so I'm not sure if you need a too

590
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,230
there so I'm not sure if you need a too
 

591
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,740
there so I'm not sure if you need a too
high clearance I've been watching this

592
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:21,750
high clearance I've been watching this
 

593
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,540
high clearance I've been watching this
while I've been doing lots of different

594
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,550
while I've been doing lots of different
 

595
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,850
while I've been doing lots of different
tests and I think I finally get it I

596
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:27,860
tests and I think I finally get it I
 

597
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,740
tests and I think I finally get it I
understand what's responders to an

598
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:30,750
understand what's responders to an
 

599
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,160
understand what's responders to an
extent anyway as always confused about

600
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,170
extent anyway as always confused about
 

601
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,240
extent anyway as always confused about
the spawning but with cave spiders they

602
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,250
the spawning but with cave spiders they
 

603
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,209
the spawning but with cave spiders they
can spawn

604
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:40,219
can spawn
 

605
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:43,999
can spawn
oops okay you know one by one by one

606
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,009
oops okay you know one by one by one
 

607
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:54,139
oops okay you know one by one by one
area like that they can spawn at this

608
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:54,149
area like that they can spawn at this
 

609
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:56,449
area like that they can spawn at this
level here if the spawner is there or

610
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:56,459
level here if the spawner is there or
 

611
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:58,759
level here if the spawner is there or
they can spawn at this level if the

612
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:58,769
they can spawn at this level if the
 

613
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:01,999
they can spawn at this level if the
spawner is there or one block up so

614
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:02,009
spawner is there or one block up so
 

615
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:04,519
spawner is there or one block up so
level with the top of the spawner they

616
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:04,529
level with the top of the spawner they
 

617
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:07,849
level with the top of the spawner they
can also spawn so those are the three

618
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:07,859
can also spawn so those are the three
 

619
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:12,769
can also spawn so those are the three
Heights and the only three Heights and

620
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:12,779
Heights and the only three Heights and
 

621
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,889
Heights and the only three Heights and
it's an 8 by 8 square it's not a 9 by 9

622
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:15,899
it's an 8 by 8 square it's not a 9 by 9
 

623
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:18,139
it's an 8 by 8 square it's not a 9 by 9
like I thought it's a little strange how

624
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:18,149
like I thought it's a little strange how
 

625
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:21,979
like I thought it's a little strange how
it works so it goes out diagonally

626
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:21,989
it works so it goes out diagonally
 

627
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:25,699
it works so it goes out diagonally
blocks this way so this is the furthest

628
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:25,709
blocks this way so this is the furthest
 

629
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:30,019
blocks this way so this is the furthest
they'll spawn this way but then it goes

630
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:30,029
they'll spawn this way but then it goes
 

631
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:38,079
they'll spawn this way but then it goes
4 blocks this way so it's not centered

632
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:38,089
4 blocks this way so it's not centered
 

633
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:42,440
4 blocks this way so it's not centered
so numbers get bigger this way and they

634
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,450
so numbers get bigger this way and they
 

635
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,649
so numbers get bigger this way and they
get smaller this way for the coordinates

636
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:45,659
get smaller this way for the coordinates
 

637
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:50,509
get smaller this way for the coordinates
so that's why you can figure it out and

638
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:50,519
so that's why you can figure it out and
 

639
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:54,769
so that's why you can figure it out and
the other thing I found is the mobs are

640
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:54,779
the other thing I found is the mobs are
 

641
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:57,289
the other thing I found is the mobs are
more likely to spawn closer to the

642
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:57,299
more likely to spawn closer to the
 

643
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,359
more likely to spawn closer to the
spawner than they are farther away from

644
00:20:59,359 --> 00:20:59,369
spawner than they are farther away from
 

645
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:02,389
spawner than they are farther away from
it so even though I have had a spider

646
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:02,399
it so even though I have had a spider
 

647
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:05,690
it so even though I have had a spider
spawn in this space here 4 blocks

648
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:05,700
spawn in this space here 4 blocks
 

649
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,889
spawn in this space here 4 blocks
diagonally from the spawner even though

650
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:09,899
diagonally from the spawner even though
 

651
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:12,289
diagonally from the spawner even though
it's dark right now most of the time

652
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:12,299
it's dark right now most of the time
 

653
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,129
it's dark right now most of the time
they will spawn in this little

654
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:15,139
they will spawn in this little
 

655
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:17,959
they will spawn in this little
one-by-one area next to this water

656
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:17,969
one-by-one area next to this water
 

657
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:21,709
one-by-one area next to this water
because it's closer the only other thing

658
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:21,719
because it's closer the only other thing
 

659
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:23,419
because it's closer the only other thing
I'm wondering about is if hole lighting

660
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:23,429
I'm wondering about is if hole lighting
 

661
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:30,979
I'm wondering about is if hole lighting
affects it like a light level of zero

662
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:30,989
affects it like a light level of zero
 

663
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,659
affects it like a light level of zero
compared to a light level of 7 if

664
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:32,669
compared to a light level of 7 if
 

665
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:34,459
compared to a light level of 7 if
there's a difference in probability I

666
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:34,469
there's a difference in probability I
 

667
00:21:34,469 --> 00:21:38,119
there's a difference in probability I
don't know yet but this should give me a

668
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:38,129
don't know yet but this should give me a
 

669
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:41,449
don't know yet but this should give me a
good good start for understanding how to

670
00:21:41,449 --> 00:21:41,459
good good start for understanding how to
 

671
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:46,940
good good start for understanding how to
build this ok something else interesting

672
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:46,950
build this ok something else interesting
 

673
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,089
build this ok something else interesting
here I guess these cave spiders are less

674
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:50,099
here I guess these cave spiders are less
 

675
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:51,889
here I guess these cave spiders are less
than half a block in height because they

676
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:51,899
than half a block in height because they
 

677
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:52,649
than half a block in height because they
can fit

678
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:52,659
can fit
 

679
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:58,499
can fit
a half slab so in this case monster

680
00:21:58,499 --> 00:21:58,509
a half slab so in this case monster
 

681
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:00,509
a half slab so in this case monster
spawner czar transparent they let light

682
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:00,519
spawner czar transparent they let light
 

683
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,479
spawner czar transparent they let light
through half slabs do not let light

684
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:03,489
through half slabs do not let light
 

685
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,810
through half slabs do not let light
through so I get the monster spawner

686
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:06,820
through so I get the monster spawner
 

687
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,169
through so I get the monster spawner
surrounded on all sides except this one

688
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:09,179
surrounded on all sides except this one
 

689
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:12,659
surrounded on all sides except this one
there's a block above and half slabs so

690
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:12,669
there's a block above and half slabs so
 

691
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:16,769
there's a block above and half slabs so
this spot right above the spawner will

692
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:16,779
this spot right above the spawner will
 

693
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:19,830
this spot right above the spawner will
become completely dark if I put a block

694
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:19,840
become completely dark if I put a block
 

695
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:29,249
become completely dark if I put a block
here and they'll be able to spawn any

696
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:29,259
here and they'll be able to spawn any
 

697
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:38,639
here and they'll be able to spawn any
moment that would result there yes so

698
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:38,649
moment that would result there yes so
 

699
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:39,180
moment that would result there yes so
yeah

700
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,190
yeah
 

701
00:22:39,190 --> 00:23:10,649
yeah
deadly guys okay let's do it so I was

702
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:10,659
deadly guys okay let's do it so I was
 

703
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:12,149
deadly guys okay let's do it so I was
originally planning on building like a

704
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:12,159
originally planning on building like a
 

705
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,639
originally planning on building like a
huge room for these guys to spawn in but

706
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:14,649
huge room for these guys to spawn in but
 

707
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:18,450
huge room for these guys to spawn in but
now that we know what we know since

708
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:18,460
now that we know what we know since
 

709
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,190
now that we know what we know since
they're more likely to spawn closer to

710
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:20,200
they're more likely to spawn closer to
 

711
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,109
they're more likely to spawn closer to
this spawner there's not really much

712
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:22,119
this spawner there's not really much
 

713
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,119
this spawner there's not really much
point to it

714
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:23,129
point to it
 

715
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:26,549
point to it
so I'm thinking I'm just going to make a

716
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:26,559
so I'm thinking I'm just going to make a
 

717
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,639
so I'm thinking I'm just going to make a
really really small spawning you for

718
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:29,649
really really small spawning you for
 

719
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:37,379
really really small spawning you for
them okay and I'm just going to low out

720
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:37,389
them okay and I'm just going to low out
 

721
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:51,089
them okay and I'm just going to low out
of cobble start off with yeah that so

722
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:51,099
of cobble start off with yeah that so
 

723
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:57,779
of cobble start off with yeah that so
they can spawn that block below and at

724
00:23:57,779 --> 00:23:57,789
they can spawn that block below and at
 

725
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:01,320
they can spawn that block below and at
this height and one more up yet they can

726
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:01,330
this height and one more up yet they can
 

727
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,230
this height and one more up yet they can
spawn

728
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:05,240

 

729
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,670

so I'll probably just have a water

730
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:07,680
so I'll probably just have a water
 

731
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:14,420
so I'll probably just have a water
stream here for them to fall in the

732
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:14,430
stream here for them to fall in the
 

733
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,460
stream here for them to fall in the
plenty of spawning space next is spawner

734
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:16,470
plenty of spawning space next is spawner
 

735
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:32,710
plenty of spawning space next is spawner
and then yeah and then what I'll do

736
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:32,720
and then yeah and then what I'll do
 

737
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:40,330
and then yeah and then what I'll do
we'll just put a block here up here

738
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:40,340
we'll just put a block here up here
 

739
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,330
we'll just put a block here up here
they'll flow through there I may be able

740
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:44,340
they'll flow through there I may be able
 

741
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:55,670
they'll flow through there I may be able
to put glass there for now okay and we

742
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:55,680
to put glass there for now okay and we
 

743
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,560
to put glass there for now okay and we
will close this up and see what happens

744
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:57,570
will close this up and see what happens
 

745
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,510
will close this up and see what happens
I'm worried they're going to get stuck

746
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
I'm worried they're going to get stuck
 

747
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:07,930
I'm worried they're going to get stuck
climbing like on this wall here that

748
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:07,940

 

749
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,210

didn't take long and he's in the right

750
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:11,220
didn't take long and he's in the right
 

751
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:20,360
didn't take long and he's in the right
position it's good yeah so then I just

752
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,370
position it's good yeah so then I just
 

753
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,450
position it's good yeah so then I just
need to hook some kind of kill anything

754
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:23,460
need to hook some kind of kill anything
 

755
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:32,020
need to hook some kind of kill anything
up for them

756
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,030

 

757
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,000

I'll watch this for a while see how it

758
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,010
I'll watch this for a while see how it
 

759
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,010
I'll watch this for a while see how it
turns out it's another one

760
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,020
turns out it's another one
 

761
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,200
turns out it's another one
yeah they don't seem to be any stuck

762
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,210
yeah they don't seem to be any stuck
 

763
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:45,820
yeah they don't seem to be any stuck
that's good well I believe I'm going to

764
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:45,830
that's good well I believe I'm going to
 

765
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,500
that's good well I believe I'm going to
wait till next episode to work on that

766
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:48,510
wait till next episode to work on that
 

767
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,410
wait till next episode to work on that
spider thing some more because our time

768
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:51,420
spider thing some more because our time
 

769
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,830
spider thing some more because our time
is almost up but I wanted to try out

770
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:54,840
is almost up but I wanted to try out
 

771
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,600
is almost up but I wanted to try out
enchanting before we end it today so

772
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,610
enchanting before we end it today so
 

773
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:01,910
enchanting before we end it today so
let's do that quickly I just stuck it

774
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:01,920
let's do that quickly I just stuck it
 

775
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,810
let's do that quickly I just stuck it
over here but I think I want to move it

776
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:04,820
over here but I think I want to move it
 

777
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,300
over here but I think I want to move it
use your pick to get it has to be your

778
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,310
use your pick to get it has to be your
 

779
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,310
use your pick to get it has to be your
pick as you lose it

780
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,320
pick as you lose it

little bit I got some paper on me I

784
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,070
little bit I got some paper on me I
 

785
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:22,130
little bit I got some paper on me I
believe on I made books already books so

786
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,140
believe on I made books already books so
 

787
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,500
believe on I made books already books so
we have enough for two whole bookcases

788
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:26,510
we have enough for two whole bookcases
 

789
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:32,390
we have enough for two whole bookcases
amazing it only took oh like an hour to

790
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:32,400
amazing it only took oh like an hour to
 

791
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,790
amazing it only took oh like an hour to
get that much that many books from that

792
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:34,800
get that much that many books from that
 

793
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:41,120
get that much that many books from that
mini sugar cane so it seems like I need

794
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,130
mini sugar cane so it seems like I need
 

795
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,870
mini sugar cane so it seems like I need

let's try it out
upgraded unbreaking lame-o well I think

892
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:16,519
upgraded unbreaking lame-o well I think
 

893
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,129

that just makes it last longer some

894
