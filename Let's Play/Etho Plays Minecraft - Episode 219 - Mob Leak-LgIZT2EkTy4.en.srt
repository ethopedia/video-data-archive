just start changing everything up here

36
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:58,940
just start changing everything up here
 

37
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,060
just start changing everything up here
but yeah it's kind of cool so we got

38
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,070
but yeah it's kind of cool so we got
 

39
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,329
but yeah it's kind of cool so we got
still working on the stairs a little bit

40
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:04,339
still working on the stairs a little bit
 

41
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:07,100
still working on the stairs a little bit
we got a staircase that goes up here a

42
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,110
we got a staircase that goes up here a
 

43
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,210
we got a staircase that goes up here a
little bit of a thick rail this is a

44
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,220
little bit of a thick rail this is a
 

45
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,120
little bit of a thick rail this is a
stair it's all half slabs in that so I

46
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,130
stair it's all half slabs in that so I
 

47
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,080
stair it's all half slabs in that so I
don't have to worry about slimes

48
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,090
don't have to worry about slimes
 

49
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,740
don't have to worry about slimes
spawning up here and then it's going to

50
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:18,750
spawning up here and then it's going to
 

51
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,289
spawning up here and then it's going to
be a replica on the other side here will

52
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:21,299
be a replica on the other side here will
 

53
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,940
be a replica on the other side here will
you'll have the staircase going down and

54
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:24,950
you'll have the staircase going down and
 

55
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,980
you'll have the staircase going down and
yeah I don't know don't really want to

56
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:27,990
yeah I don't know don't really want to
 

57

do any more with this until I get you
guys its feedback on it because I would

60
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:31,950
guys its feedback on it because I would
 

61
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,740
guys its feedback on it because I would
have to I'd have to do one of these over

62
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:33,750
have to I'd have to do one of these over
 

63
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,580
have to I'd have to do one of these over
there and one over there but I'll take

64
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:37,590
there and one over there but I'll take
 

65
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,130
there and one over there but I'll take
you into the storage area this is how I

66
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:40,140
you into the storage area this is how I
 

67
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,920
you into the storage area this is how I
decide to do it it's not quite done

68
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:42,930
decide to do it it's not quite done
 

69
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,639
decide to do it it's not quite done
either yeah instead of doing like a Cove

70
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:46,649
either yeah instead of doing like a Cove
 

71
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,649
either yeah instead of doing like a Cove
with just three walls one here one here

72
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:48,659
with just three walls one here one here
 

73
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,569
with just three walls one here one here
one here I decide to make it go in a

74
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:50,579
one here I decide to make it go in a
 

75
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,190
one here I decide to make it go in a
little further and have like a cove here

76
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
little further and have like a cove here
 

77
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,069
little further and have like a cove here
cove here and then an extra wall here so

78
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
cove here and then an extra wall here so
 

79
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,950
cove here and then an extra wall here so
instead of just having three walls we

80
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
instead of just having three walls we
 

81
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,749
instead of just having three walls we
have seven just kind of cool and then

82
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:04,759
have seven just kind of cool and then
 

83
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,479
have seven just kind of cool and then
probably what I'll do like over here

84
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:08,489
probably what I'll do like over here
 

85
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,809
probably what I'll do like over here
I'll have a well actually maybe we can't

86
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:11,819
I'll have a well actually maybe we can't
 

87
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:12,900
I'll have a well actually maybe we can't
do that

88
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:12,910
do that
 

89
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,540
do that
somehow I'm going to try incorporate a

90
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:15,550
somehow I'm going to try incorporate a
 

91
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,220
somehow I'm going to try incorporate a
ladder that goes down and we'll have

92
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,230
ladder that goes down and we'll have
 

93
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,050
ladder that goes down and we'll have
additional storage down below for like

94
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,060
additional storage down below for like
 

95
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,370
additional storage down below for like
overflow like all my cobble and that's

96
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,380
overflow like all my cobble and that's
 

97
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,040
overflow like all my cobble and that's
will stick down below here I think

98
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,050
will stick down below here I think
 

99
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,900
will stick down below here I think
that'll work out pretty good but yeah

100
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:30,910
that'll work out pretty good but yeah
 

101
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,790
that'll work out pretty good but yeah

115
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,680
to do today for sure let's work on the
mob system a bit the the water tubes and

116
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:55,690
mob system a bit the the water tubes and
 

117
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:02,520
mob system a bit the the water tubes and
stuff so let's head on up here still

118
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:02,530
stuff so let's head on up here still
 

119
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,140
stuff so let's head on up here still
working great yeah you know what like I

120
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,150
working great yeah you know what like I
 

121
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,360
working great yeah you know what like I
talked about before I wanted to do like

122
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,370
talked about before I wanted to do like
 

123
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,760
talked about before I wanted to do like
a mob separator here I'm sort of having

124
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:11,770
a mob separator here I'm sort of having
 

125
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,870
a mob separator here I'm sort of having
second thoughts on that now still like a

126
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:15,880
second thoughts on that now still like a
 

127
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,670
second thoughts on that now still like a
mob separator but maybe do it

128
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680
mob separator but maybe do it
 

129
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,080
mob separator but maybe do it
differently because there's I don't know

130
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,090
differently because there's I don't know
 

131
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,310
differently because there's I don't know
there's not really any point to

132
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:23,320
there's not really any point to
 

133
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,430
there's not really any point to
separating skeletons into their own

134
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,440
separating skeletons into their own
 

135
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,680
separating skeletons into their own
tuber or anything like that

136
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:28,690
tuber or anything like that
 

137
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,010
tuber or anything like that
one thing that is beneficial Oh is

138
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,020
one thing that is beneficial Oh is
 

139
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,350
one thing that is beneficial Oh is
getting creepers into their own tubes so

140
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:34,360
getting creepers into their own tubes so
 

141
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,870
getting creepers into their own tubes so
that they can stockpile so don't mind

142
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:39,880
that they can stockpile so don't mind
 

143
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,100
that they can stockpile so don't mind
the sounds they're going to get fixed

144
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,110
the sounds they're going to get fixed
 

145
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,690
the sounds they're going to get fixed
I'm sure they will yeah I think they

146
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:45,700
I'm sure they will yeah I think they
 

147
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,880
I'm sure they will yeah I think they
they match the wrong sounds to the wrong

148
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:47,890
they match the wrong sounds to the wrong
 

149
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,460
they match the wrong sounds to the wrong
actions but I think that's going to be

150
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:50,470
actions but I think that's going to be
 

151
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,960
actions but I think that's going to be
fixed for sure yeah so this tube here

152
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:54,970
fixed for sure yeah so this tube here
 

153
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,880
fixed for sure yeah so this tube here
will dedicate the creepers and I'm

154
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:56,890
will dedicate the creepers and I'm
 

155
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,960
will dedicate the creepers and I'm
choosing this ones for a good reason

156
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,970
choosing this ones for a good reason
 

157
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,250
choosing this ones for a good reason
let's see let's get some light up here

158
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:02,260
let's see let's get some light up here
 

159
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,560
let's see let's get some light up here
so we can actually see all the other

160
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:07,570
so we can actually see all the other
 

161
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,730
so we can actually see all the other
tubes are under the snow I think oh

162
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:10,740
tubes are under the snow I think oh
 

163
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:17,760
tubes are under the snow I think oh
maybe not I can't tell I'm too high up I

164
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:17,770
maybe not I can't tell I'm too high up I
 

165
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,890
maybe not I can't tell I'm too high up I
can't see but this one I know definitely

166
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:19,900
can't see but this one I know definitely
 

167
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:25,170
can't see but this one I know definitely
isn't the center of it is right there so

168
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:25,180
isn't the center of it is right there so
 

169
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,879
isn't the center of it is right there so
we can get sunlight down to here

170
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:26,889
we can get sunlight down to here
 

171
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,100
we can get sunlight down to here
and burn up the other mobs that are not

172
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,110
and burn up the other mobs that are not
 

173
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,249
and burn up the other mobs that are not
creepers and make a cook outside of this

174
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:32,259
creepers and make a cook outside of this
 

175
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:38,909
creepers and make a cook outside of this
one so that's what we're going to do so

176
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:38,919
one so that's what we're going to do so
 

177
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:40,529
one so that's what we're going to do so
something else I was thinking though

178
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:40,539
something else I was thinking though
 

179
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:43,649
something else I was thinking though
like we might still do a mob separator

180
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:43,659
like we might still do a mob separator
 

181
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,749
like we might still do a mob separator
but just different types like I might

182
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
but just different types like I might
 

183
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,469
but just different types like I might
want to separate the mobs that spawn

184
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:49,479
want to separate the mobs that spawn
 

185
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:52,800
want to separate the mobs that spawn
with special things like armor or tools

186
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:52,810
with special things like armor or tools
 

187
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,080
with special things like armor or tools
and try to get them to go to a separate

188
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,090
and try to get them to go to a separate
 

189
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:01,260
and try to get them to go to a separate
tube that might be possible by throwing

190
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:01,270
tube that might be possible by throwing
 

191
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,899
tube that might be possible by throwing
items on the ground for mobs to pick up

192
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:03,909
items on the ground for mobs to pick up
 

193
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:05,279
items on the ground for mobs to pick up
I don't know I haven't really looked too

194
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:05,289
I don't know I haven't really looked too
 

195
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:07,769
I don't know I haven't really looked too
much into it I kind of doubt that will

196
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:07,779
much into it I kind of doubt that will
 

197
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:13,170
much into it I kind of doubt that will
work but maybe but anyway we need to

198
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:13,180
work but maybe but anyway we need to
 

199
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,529
work but maybe but anyway we need to
make a switch that will instead of

200
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:16,539
make a switch that will instead of
 

201
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,300
make a switch that will instead of
dropping the mobs straight down here

202
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,310
dropping the mobs straight down here
 

203
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,140
dropping the mobs straight down here
we'll have them go this way into a water

204
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,150
we'll have them go this way into a water
 

205
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,640
we'll have them go this way into a water
stream okay so I got a platform set up

206
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:26,650
stream okay so I got a platform set up
 

207
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,580
stream okay so I got a platform set up
here the very first thing we need to

208
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:29,590
here the very first thing we need to
 

209
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,230
here the very first thing we need to
sort of figure out is if this is even

210
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,240
sort of figure out is if this is even
 

211
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,980
sort of figure out is if this is even
going to work if we stick a vine here so

212
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:34,990
going to work if we stick a vine here so
 

213
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,089
going to work if we stick a vine here so
we need them to come to a gradual fall

214
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:39,099
we need them to come to a gradual fall
 

215
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:42,390
we need them to come to a gradual fall
here okay yeah they're still dying from

216
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
here okay yeah they're still dying from
 

217
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,800
here okay yeah they're still dying from
fall damage that's good zombies - yep

218
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:45,810
fall damage that's good zombies - yep
 

219
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,089
fall damage that's good zombies - yep
all right so that'll that'll work nice

220
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:50,099
all right so that'll that'll work nice
 

221
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,589
all right so that'll that'll work nice
because if we have if we have a ground

222
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:52,599
because if we have if we have a ground
 

223
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:55,019
because if we have if we have a ground
below here the ones from the very high

224
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:55,029
below here the ones from the very high
 

225
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:57,749
below here the ones from the very high
levels of the mob system all dang that's

226
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
levels of the mob system all dang that's
 

227
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,529
levels of the mob system all dang that's
what I was afraid of yeah we may need to

228
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:04,539
what I was afraid of yeah we may need to
 

229
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:09,510
what I was afraid of yeah we may need to
remove one layer of this thing because

230
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
remove one layer of this thing because
 

231
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,950
remove one layer of this thing because
he kind of got stuck there he was from

232
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
he kind of got stuck there he was from
 

233
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,980
he kind of got stuck there he was from
the lower layers didn't have the speed

234
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:13,990
the lower layers didn't have the speed
 

235
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,600
the lower layers didn't have the speed
to fall through and yes another idea

236
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:18,610
to fall through and yes another idea
 

237
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,399
to fall through and yes another idea
maybe let's try lower this one more

238
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:20,409
maybe let's try lower this one more
 

239
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:24,029
maybe let's try lower this one more
block see if we can sort of dealt that

240
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:24,039
block see if we can sort of dealt that
 

241
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,100
block see if we can sort of dealt that
way it allowed to but maybe hear that

242
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,110
way it allowed to but maybe hear that
 

243
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,510
way it allowed to but maybe hear that
and let's hope they still die from fall

244
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:30,520
and let's hope they still die from fall
 

245
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,059
and let's hope they still die from fall
damage

246
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:34,069

 

247
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,799

and then we can just lower everything

248
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:35,809
and then we can just lower everything
 

249
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:45,040
and then we can just lower everything
one block come on where the mobs let's

250
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,050
one block come on where the mobs let's
 

251
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,549
one block come on where the mobs let's
go down

252
00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:45,559
go down
 

253
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:52,869
go down
I think it's nighttime nope you know

254
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:52,879
I think it's nighttime nope you know
 

255
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,909
I think it's nighttime nope you know
what it is they're just completely stuck

256
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:54,919
what it is they're just completely stuck
 

257
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:55,689
what it is they're just completely stuck
up there

258
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:55,699
up there
 

259
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:05,950
up there
it wasn't night Wow alright see me fall

260
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:05,960
it wasn't night Wow alright see me fall
 

261
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:17,670
it wasn't night Wow alright see me fall
when we Wow they died I think they died

262
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680

 

263
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,959

yeah so the vines weren't working that

264
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:19,969
yeah so the vines weren't working that
 

265
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:21,850
yeah so the vines weren't working that
great so we're going to try and do a

266
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:21,860
great so we're going to try and do a
 

267
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,519
great so we're going to try and do a
water water break instead of a vine

268
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:24,529
water water break instead of a vine
 

269
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:28,299
water water break instead of a vine
break thing is if we do it too low

270
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:28,309
break thing is if we do it too low
 

271
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:29,799
break thing is if we do it too low
they're not going to fall to their death

272
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:29,809
they're not going to fall to their death
 

273
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:33,189
they're not going to fall to their death
and we don't have a lot of space to work

274
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
and we don't have a lot of space to work
 

275
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,439
and we don't have a lot of space to work
with here so I'm just watching right now

276
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:35,449
with here so I'm just watching right now
 

277
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:37,929
with here so I'm just watching right now
if this is enough to prevent them from

278
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:37,939
if this is enough to prevent them from
 

279
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:39,760
if this is enough to prevent them from
dying the ones that fall from the very

280
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:39,770
dying the ones that fall from the very
 

281
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,389
dying the ones that fall from the very
very top so I'm going to watch it for a

282
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:43,399
very top so I'm going to watch it for a
 

283
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:46,119
very top so I'm going to watch it for a
while and see if any mobs die by hitting

284
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:46,129
while and see if any mobs die by hitting
 

285
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:52,079
while and see if any mobs die by hitting
this glass block I placed right there

286
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:52,089

 

287
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:55,509

nope very first mob that dropped and he

288
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:55,519
nope very first mob that dropped and he
 

289
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,029
nope very first mob that dropped and he
died so we need at least one more water

290
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:58,039
died so we need at least one more water
 

291
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:01,629
died so we need at least one more water
block to stop them which shat out

292
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:01,639
block to stop them which shat out
 

293
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,079
block to stop them which shat out
there's a problem actually because we

294
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,089
there's a problem actually because we
 

295
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,850
there's a problem actually because we
and his lower this all one doesn't

296
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:06,860
and his lower this all one doesn't
 

297
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,290
and his lower this all one doesn't
matter

298
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:10,300

 

299
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,279

definitely no he's seeing a difference

300
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:12,289
definitely no he's seeing a difference
 

301
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:14,350
definitely no he's seeing a difference
with the game's audio engine no because

302
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:14,360
with the game's audio engine no because
 

303
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,179
with the game's audio engine no because
before if you had a whole ton of mobs

304
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:16,189
before if you had a whole ton of mobs
 

305
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:17,889
before if you had a whole ton of mobs
like this together it would be

306
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:17,899
like this together it would be
 

307
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:23,230
like this together it would be
SuperDuper loud now it's like they're

308

hear one and he keeps getting cut off at
a time anyway let's I can do this real

314
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:34,579
a time anyway let's I can do this real
 

315
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:39,220
a time anyway let's I can do this real
quick nope darn

316
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,230
quick nope darn
 

317
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:44,960
quick nope darn
hey we got a record um we got a problem

318
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:44,970
hey we got a record um we got a problem
 

319
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:52,370
hey we got a record um we got a problem
here we've got a problem okay how about

320
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:52,380
here we've got a problem okay how about
 

321
00:08:52,380 --> 00:09:01,870
here we've got a problem okay how about
now three blocks I want that record man

322
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:01,880

 

323
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:10,580

my record ah okay let's just watch it

324
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:10,590
my record ah okay let's just watch it
 

325
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,810
my record ah okay let's just watch it
now make sure we picked up all the drops

326
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:13,820
now make sure we picked up all the drops
 

327
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:26,720
now make sure we picked up all the drops
dude can't do that hmm some things have

328
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:26,730
dude can't do that hmm some things have
 

329
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,850
dude can't do that hmm some things have
changed in this game I guess we're not

330
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:31,860
changed in this game I guess we're not
 

331
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,190
changed in this game I guess we're not
going to be able to tell Adana I

332
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
going to be able to tell Adana I
 

333
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,290
going to be able to tell Adana I
mumbling I'm sorry just trying to watch

334
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:39,300
mumbling I'm sorry just trying to watch
 

335
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,720
mumbling I'm sorry just trying to watch
if they're dying on impact with the

336
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:41,730
if they're dying on impact with the
 

337
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,290
if they're dying on impact with the
glass block it's a little hard to tell

338
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:45,300
glass block it's a little hard to tell
 

339
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,000
glass block it's a little hard to tell
with all these guys drowning in front of

340
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,010
with all these guys drowning in front of
 

341
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:53,630
with all these guys drowning in front of
me now seems to be okay so what we got

342
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:53,640
me now seems to be okay so what we got
 

343
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,680
me now seems to be okay so what we got
to do is have a piston out lets water

344
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:57,690
to do is have a piston out lets water
 

345
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,120
to do is have a piston out lets water
flow from here then down three blocks

346
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,130
flow from here then down three blocks
 

347
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,360
flow from here then down three blocks
and then left and it'll push them to

348
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,370
and then left and it'll push them to
 

349
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:11,470
and then left and it'll push them to
that tube so we got to lower this by one

350
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:11,480

 

351
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,370

actually in order I don't think it's the

352
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:13,380
actually in order I don't think it's the
 

353
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,380
actually in order I don't think it's the
audio engine that's the change I think

354
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:15,390
audio engine that's the change I think
 

355
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,170
audio engine that's the change I think
it's just because there's so many noises

356
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:17,180
it's just because there's so many noises
 

357
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,370
it's just because there's so many noises
it's doing that thing like what happens

358
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:19,380
it's doing that thing like what happens
 

359
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,780
it's doing that thing like what happens
with the blaze when you get a lot of

360
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:20,790
with the blaze when you get a lot of
 

361
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,470
with the blaze when you get a lot of
them there's so many noises because of

362
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
them there's so many noises because of
 

363
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,840
them there's so many noises because of
the water being the water noise is being

364
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:26,850
the water being the water noise is being
 

365
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,070
the water being the water noise is being
glitched at the moment okay we'll do

366
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,080
glitched at the moment okay we'll do
 

367
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,870
glitched at the moment okay we'll do
like this

368
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880

 

369
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:47,490

oh that sounds so weird okay mmm

370
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:47,500
oh that sounds so weird okay mmm
 

371
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,650
oh that sounds so weird okay mmm
might need to shut the mob system off to

372
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:49,660
might need to shut the mob system off to
 

373
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,730
might need to shut the mob system off to
do this let's see I got to move these

374
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:53,740
do this let's see I got to move these
 

375
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,760
do this let's see I got to move these
pistons we need one sticky piston here

376
00:10:59,760 --> 00:10:59,770
pistons we need one sticky piston here
 

377
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:04,980
pistons we need one sticky piston here
to extend make that a platform for them

378
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:04,990
to extend make that a platform for them
 

379
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,040
to extend make that a platform for them
to land on there and then we need one

380
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,050
to land on there and then we need one
 

381
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,350
to land on there and then we need one
for controlling the water

382
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:12,360

 

383
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:19,530

dang no oh that sucks

384
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:19,540
dang no oh that sucks
 

385
00:11:19,540 --> 00:12:00,849
dang no oh that sucks
oh no no that's not too bad

386
00:12:00,849 --> 00:12:00,859

 

387
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:03,619

I've been messing with the switch system

388
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:03,629
I've been messing with the switch system
 

389
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:06,019
I've been messing with the switch system
for a little bit and I haven't tried it

390
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:06,029
for a little bit and I haven't tried it
 

391
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:07,999
for a little bit and I haven't tried it
yet we're about to I'm a little scared

392
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:08,009
yet we're about to I'm a little scared
 

393
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:13,059
yet we're about to I'm a little scared
too but let's see what happens here so

394
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:13,069
too but let's see what happens here so
 

395
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:17,150
too but let's see what happens here so
yeah when this piston retracts it'll

396
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,160
yeah when this piston retracts it'll
 

397
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,979
yeah when this piston retracts it'll
allow the water to flow will come down

398
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:20,989
allow the water to flow will come down
 

399
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:23,689
allow the water to flow will come down
then when it passes by this piston it

400
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:23,699
then when it passes by this piston it
 

401
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,460
then when it passes by this piston it
will cause an update you see it's being

402
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:25,470
will cause an update you see it's being
 

403
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,280
will cause an update you see it's being
powered diagonally but it's not extended

404
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,290
powered diagonally but it's not extended
 

405
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,989
powered diagonally but it's not extended
yet so once the water goes in front of

406
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:29,999
yet so once the water goes in front of
 

407
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,780
yet so once the water goes in front of
that it should extend and create a

408
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:32,790
that it should extend and create a
 

409
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,470
that it should extend and create a
ground for them to to hit when they fall

410
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
ground for them to to hit when they fall
 

411
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,979
ground for them to to hit when they fall
down and then go this way hopefully

412
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:39,989
down and then go this way hopefully
 

413
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:42,109
down and then go this way hopefully
we'll see it we'll see what happens here

414
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:42,119
we'll see it we'll see what happens here
 

415
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:44,059
we'll see it we'll see what happens here
who knows what the whole thing might

416
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:44,069
who knows what the whole thing might
 

417
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:49,489
who knows what the whole thing might
blow up when I remove this block oh it's

418
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:49,499
blow up when I remove this block oh it's
 

419
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:53,569
blow up when I remove this block oh it's
scary stuff yeah I don't know the piston

420
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:53,579
scary stuff yeah I don't know the piston
 

421
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,689
scary stuff yeah I don't know the piston
might cause some problems it's just a

422
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:56,699
might cause some problems it's just a
 

423
00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:00,139
might cause some problems it's just a
regular piston head yep

424
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:00,149
regular piston head yep
 

425
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:04,879
regular piston head yep
dang so we have to use a full block I'm

426
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:04,889
dang so we have to use a full block I'm
 

427
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:12,379
dang so we have to use a full block I'm
pretty sure it did extend though that's

428
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:12,389
pretty sure it did extend though that's
 

429
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:15,530
pretty sure it did extend though that's
good then when it it should retract

430
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:15,540
good then when it it should retract
 

431
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,979
good then when it it should retract
properly - I would think again I'm

432
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:18,989
properly - I would think again I'm
 

433
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:25,369
properly - I would think again I'm
scared to try though yep because when

434
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:25,379
scared to try though yep because when
 

435
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:27,079
scared to try though yep because when
the water disappears it causes another

436
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:27,089
the water disappears it causes another
 

437
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:30,829
the water disappears it causes another
update which causes it to retract but

438
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:30,839
update which causes it to retract but
 

439
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:31,970
update which causes it to retract but
it's not perfect

440
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:31,980
it's not perfect
 

441
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,799
it's not perfect
it's letting mobs through on that side

442
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:33,809
it's letting mobs through on that side
 

443
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:37,909
it's letting mobs through on that side
still which we don't want and they're

444
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:37,919
still which we don't want and they're
 

445
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,029
still which we don't want and they're
getting stuck on the piston head so I'm

446
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:41,039
getting stuck on the piston head so I'm
 

447
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,290
getting stuck on the piston head so I'm
going to redo this

448
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:45,300

 

449
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,060

I've been messing with the switch system

450
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,070
I've been messing with the switch system
 

451
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,340
I've been messing with the switch system
for a little bit and I haven't tried it

452
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:50,350
for a little bit and I haven't tried it
 

453
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,410
for a little bit and I haven't tried it
yet we're about to I'm a little scared

454
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:52,420
yet we're about to I'm a little scared
 

455
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,470
yet we're about to I'm a little scared
too but let's see what happens here so

456
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:57,480
too but let's see what happens here so
 

457
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,559
too but let's see what happens here so
yeah when this piston retracts it'll

458
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:01,569
yeah when this piston retracts it'll
 

459
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:05,420
yeah when this piston retracts it'll
allow the water to flow will come down

460
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:05,430
allow the water to flow will come down
 

461
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,129
allow the water to flow will come down
then when it passes by this piston it

462
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:08,139
then when it passes by this piston it
 

463
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,900
then when it passes by this piston it
will cause an update you see it's being

464
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:09,910
will cause an update you see it's being
 

465
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,720
will cause an update you see it's being
powered diagonally but it's not extended

466
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:12,730
powered diagonally but it's not extended
 

467
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,430
powered diagonally but it's not extended
yet so once the water goes in front of

468
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:14,440
yet so once the water goes in front of
 

469
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,220
yet so once the water goes in front of
that it should extend and create a

470
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,230
that it should extend and create a
 

471
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,879
that it should extend and create a
ground for them to to hit when they fall

472
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:20,889
ground for them to to hit when they fall
 

473
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:24,660
ground for them to to hit when they fall
down and then go this way and hopefully

474
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:24,670
down and then go this way and hopefully
 

475
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,550
down and then go this way and hopefully
we'll see it we'll see what happens here

476
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
we'll see it we'll see what happens here
 

477
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,499
we'll see it we'll see what happens here
who knows what the whole thing might

478
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:28,509
who knows what the whole thing might
 

479
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:33,960
who knows what the whole thing might
blow up when I remove this block oh it's

480
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:33,970
blow up when I remove this block oh it's
 

481
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,009
blow up when I remove this block oh it's
scary stuff yeah I don't know the piston

482
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:38,019
scary stuff yeah I don't know the piston
 

483
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:41,100
scary stuff yeah I don't know the piston
might cause some problems this is just a

484
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,110
might cause some problems this is just a
 

485
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,110
might cause some problems this is just a
regular piston head yep dang so we have

486
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,120
regular piston head yep dang so we have
 

487
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:55,710
regular piston head yep dang so we have
to use a full block I'm pretty sure it

488
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:55,720
to use a full block I'm pretty sure it
 

489
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,500
to use a full block I'm pretty sure it
did extend though that's good then when

490
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:58,510
did extend though that's good then when
 

491
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,050
did extend though that's good then when
it it should retract properly - I would

492
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,060
it it should retract properly - I would
 

493
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:08,660
it it should retract properly - I would
think again I'm scared to try though yep

494
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:08,670
think again I'm scared to try though yep
 

495
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,860
think again I'm scared to try though yep
because when the water disappears it

496
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:10,870
because when the water disappears it
 

497
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,040
because when the water disappears it
causes another update which causes it to

498
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,050
causes another update which causes it to
 

499
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,740
causes another update which causes it to
retract but it's not perfect it's

500
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:16,750
retract but it's not perfect it's
 

501
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,660
retract but it's not perfect it's
letting mobs through on that side still

502
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:18,670
letting mobs through on that side still
 

503
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,500
letting mobs through on that side still
which we don't want and they're getting

504
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:22,510
which we don't want and they're getting
 

505
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,680
which we don't want and they're getting
stuck on the piston head so I'm going to

506
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:25,690
stuck on the piston head so I'm going to
 

507
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:31,379
stuck on the piston head so I'm going to
redo this it should be good now I'm

508
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:31,389
redo this it should be good now I'm
 

509
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,090
redo this it should be good now I'm
going to do one thing here though I'm

510
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:33,100
going to do one thing here though I'm
 

511
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,519
going to do one thing here though I'm
going to just for now put a vine here so

512
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:38,529
going to just for now put a vine here so
 

513
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:39,629
going to just for now put a vine here so
that they don't fall to their death

514
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:39,639
that they don't fall to their death
 

515
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,240
that they don't fall to their death
because when I tried it before a lot of

516
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,250
because when I tried it before a lot of
 

517
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,850
because when I tried it before a lot of
them were dying on on this fall here

518
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:46,860
them were dying on on this fall here
 

519
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:52,140
them were dying on on this fall here
okay and redid the piston switch

520
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,150
okay and redid the piston switch
 

521
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:56,760
okay and redid the piston switch
pretty happy with how it turned out so

522
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:56,770
pretty happy with how it turned out so
 

523
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,700
pretty happy with how it turned out so
you would powered from this block here

524
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:58,710
you would powered from this block here
 

525
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:05,610
you would powered from this block here
and goes up to that and then this way it

526
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:05,620
and goes up to that and then this way it
 

527
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,260
and goes up to that and then this way it
was kind of tough to do it where when it

528
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,270
was kind of tough to do it where when it
 

529
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,960
was kind of tough to do it where when it
caused block to update issues with the

530
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:09,970
caused block to update issues with the
 

531
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,130
caused block to update issues with the
Pistons but this seems to work okay

532
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:13,140
Pistons but this seems to work okay
 

533
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:28,650
Pistons but this seems to work okay

590
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:25,450
check this out yeah there's definitely a
 

591
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,639
check this out yeah there's definitely a
clog here we could fix it by moving this

592
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:29,649
clog here we could fix it by moving this
 

593
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:34,169
clog here we could fix it by moving this
I mean how many records do we get from

594
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:34,179
I mean how many records do we get from
 

595
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:45,649
I mean how many records do we get from
that one um of that not fix it what the

596
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:45,659

 

597
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:47,360

heck

598
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,370
heck
 

599
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:59,710
heck
close this up well no

600
00:19:59,710 --> 00:19:59,720

 

601
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,659

get out of here hmm okay well we left

602
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:05,669
get out of here hmm okay well we left
 

603
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:08,390
get out of here hmm okay well we left
the area and we came back now having

604
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,400
the area and we came back now having
 

605
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,700
the area and we came back now having
some issues with that vine up there

606
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:10,710
some issues with that vine up there
 

607
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,330
some issues with that vine up there
they're getting stuck on it so I think

608
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:14,340
they're getting stuck on it so I think
 

609
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,340
they're getting stuck on it so I think
we have to lower it but otherwise the

610
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:16,350
we have to lower it but otherwise the
 

611
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,930
we have to lower it but otherwise the
cook us is doing what we wanted to the

612
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:17,940
cook us is doing what we wanted to the
 

613
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,669
cook us is doing what we wanted to the
creepers are alive down here the ones

614
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
creepers are alive down here the ones
 

615
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,520
creepers are alive down here the ones
that did make it everything else burnt

616
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:22,530
that did make it everything else burnt
 

617
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,840
that did make it everything else burnt
up let's go up there and just check for

618
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:26,850
up let's go up there and just check for
 

619
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:35,710
up let's go up there and just check for
jamming I think it's okay

620
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:35,720
jamming I think it's okay
 

621
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:42,770
jamming I think it's okay
yeah no jamming here that's good sweet

622
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:42,780
yeah no jamming here that's good sweet
 

623
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,830
yeah no jamming here that's good sweet
oh there's some items there oh that's

from before our records still there I'm
 

627
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,140
from before our records still there I'm
not able to get it where it is that's a

628
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,150
not able to get it where it is that's a
 

629

that vine we just placed also so we'll
 

673
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,640
that vine we just placed also so we'll
have to do something else maybe either

674
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:00,650
have to do something else maybe either
 

675

677
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,000

on the fall or we'll just have to

678
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,010
on the fall or we'll just have to
 

679
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,570
on the fall or we'll just have to
control a water break system but if

680
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:10,580
control a water break system but if
 

681
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,970

695
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:39,029

and I want to try out also that the idea

696
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:39,039
and I want to try out also that the idea
 

697
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,450
and I want to try out also that the idea
of getting the guys with this with tools

698
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:42,460
of getting the guys with this with tools
 

699
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,349
of getting the guys with this with tools
and with armor to go separately and

and with armor to go separately and
 

701
