in no time

144
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159

 

145
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,190

all right so i guess we'll do a

146
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
all right so i guess we'll do a
 

147
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,790
all right so i guess we'll do a
glowstone trade see if that unlocks

148
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
glowstone trade see if that unlocks
 

149
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,830
glowstone trade see if that unlocks
anything new

150
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
anything new
 

151
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,309
anything new
but by doing this it'll refresh the

152
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
but by doing this it'll refresh the
 

153
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,470
but by doing this it'll refresh the
rotten flesh trade i think

154
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
rotten flesh trade i think
 

155
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,910
rotten flesh trade i think
even though we didn't quite use it up

156
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
even though we didn't quite use it up
 

157
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,910
even though we didn't quite use it up
over there all right

158
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
over there all right
 

159
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,070
over there all right
i think that's the last trade

160
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080

 

161
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,630

and yeah

516
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
and yeah
 

517
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,150
and yeah
i tried the trampoline thing a little

518
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
i tried the trampoline thing a little
 

519
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,350
i tried the trampoline thing a little
bit it's

520
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360

 

521
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,350

here maybe we'll do this i don't know if

522
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
here maybe we'll do this i don't know if
 

523
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,389
here maybe we'll do this i don't know if
it's going to work

524
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
it's going to work
 

525
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,870
it's going to work
it's not going to look good if if it

526
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
it's not going to look good if if it
 

527
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,550
it's not going to look good if if it
does work as a problem

528
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
does work as a problem
 

529
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,910
does work as a problem
because we would have to have something

530
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
because we would have to have something
 

531
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,310
because we would have to have something
like this uh let's just try to take out

532
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
like this uh let's just try to take out
 

533
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,310
like this uh let's just try to take out
that fence over here

534
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320

 

535
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,750

and then we gotta try to make them walk

536
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
and then we gotta try to make them walk
 

537
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,910
and then we gotta try to make them walk
off and then they'll bounce

538
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
off and then they'll bounce
 

539
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,430
off and then they'll bounce
which would look really cool if we can

540
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
which would look really cool if we can
 

541
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,829
which would look really cool if we can
make it happen uh

542
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
make it happen uh
 

543
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,750
make it happen uh
so we get a trap door to trick them into

544
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
so we get a trap door to trick them into
 

545
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,190
so we get a trap door to trick them into
walking off

546
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
walking off
 

547
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,310
walking off
but the thing is we then need like

548
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
but the thing is we then need like
 

549
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,069
but the thing is we then need like
something for them to try to walk to

550
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
something for them to try to walk to
 

551
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,350
something for them to try to walk to
over there because they're not gonna try

552
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
over there because they're not gonna try
 

553
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,550
over there because they're not gonna try
walk down here they'll

554
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
walk down here they'll
 

555
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,750
walk down here they'll
they'll take the stairs always unless we

556
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
they'll take the stairs always unless we
 

557
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,310
they'll take the stairs always unless we
try

558
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
try
 

559
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,030
try
to get them to walk to something over

560
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
to get them to walk to something over
 

561
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,590
to get them to walk to something over
here which

562
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
here which
 

563
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,670
here which
would require we have like a platform in

564
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
would require we have like a platform in
 

565
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,750
would require we have like a platform in
the sky

566
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
the sky
 

567
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,590
the sky
if we built it here i can't really find

568
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
if we built it here i can't really find
 

569
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,870
if we built it here i can't really find
a good place to put is the problem

570
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
a good place to put is the problem
 

571
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,550
a good place to put is the problem
but if we did something like this they

572
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
but if we did something like this they
 

573
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,230
but if we did something like this they
might choose to walk

574
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
might choose to walk
 

575
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,750
might choose to walk
off there

576
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760

 

577
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,030

we'll see i'm going to watch it for a

578
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
we'll see i'm going to watch it for a
 

579
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,990
we'll see i'm going to watch it for a
bit and just see if they'll if they'll

580
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
bit and just see if they'll if they'll
 

581
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,509
bit and just see if they'll if they'll
try to walk to there and then fall down

582
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
try to walk to there and then fall down
 

583
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,590
try to walk to there and then fall down
oh here he goes here goes

584
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600

 

585
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,990

okay so it does work it definitely works

586
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
okay so it does work it definitely works
 

587
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,829
okay so it does work it definitely works
um

588
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
um
 

589
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,870
um
it's uh it's not the best spot for it

590
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
it's uh it's not the best spot for it
 

591
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,230
it's uh it's not the best spot for it
though i think we need to find a better

592
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
though i think we need to find a better
 

593
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,430
though i think we need to find a better
place so that

594
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:41,440
place so that
 

595
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,990
place so that
we can hide the platform a little better

596
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
we can hide the platform a little better
 

597
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,949
we can hide the platform a little better
um

598
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,959
um
 

599
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,949
um
there is this big drop over here so if

600
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
there is this big drop over here so if
 

601
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,110
there is this big drop over here so if
we expand the village a little more

602
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
we expand the village a little more
 

603
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,190
we expand the village a little more
we can get them to fall like from up

604
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
we can get them to fall like from up
 

605
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,629
we can get them to fall like from up
there down to there

606
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
there down to there
 

607
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,509
there down to there
that would probably look a lot cooler

608
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
that would probably look a lot cooler
 

609
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,949
that would probably look a lot cooler
because this is a pretty small drop

610
00:12:58,949 --> 00:12:58,959
because this is a pretty small drop
 

611
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,949
because this is a pretty small drop
but keep that in mind when we expand

612
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
but keep that in mind when we expand
 

613
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,110
but keep that in mind when we expand
this village further

614
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
this village further
 

615
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,470
this village further
anyway oh i think

616
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480
anyway oh i think
 

617
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,069
anyway oh i think
uh i think let's go do something else

618
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
uh i think let's go do something else
 

619
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,110
uh i think let's go do something else
we've been here for quite a while

620
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
we've been here for quite a while
 

621
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,389
we've been here for quite a while
already today

622
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
already today
 

623
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,190
already today
so i'll see you at something else

624
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
so i'll see you at something else
 

625
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,350
so i'll see you at something else
whatever it is i'll figure it out

626
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360

 

627
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,190

okay so i team up with an idea of

628
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
okay so i team up with an idea of
 

629
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,949
okay so i team up with an idea of
something i want to work on today

630
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
something i want to work on today
 

631
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,269
something i want to work on today
uh but first we need to collect a few

632
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
uh but first we need to collect a few
 

633
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,030
uh but first we need to collect a few
things such as

this is this is the place to be uh then
 

655
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,030
this is this is the place to be uh then
after we get our red wool here we're

656
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
after we get our red wool here we're
 

657
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,389
after we get our red wool here we're
gonna get some

658
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
gonna get some
 

659
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,629
gonna get some
bookshelves from the strongholds base

660
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
bookshelves from the strongholds base
 

661
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,550
bookshelves from the strongholds base
here and as you can probably guess

662
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
here and as you can probably guess
 

663
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,910
here and as you can probably guess
already we're gonna be using these to

664
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
already we're gonna be using these to
 

665
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,590
already we're gonna be using these to
work on the

666
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
work on the
 

667
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,350
work on the
library aha so we're gonna try to get

668
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
library aha so we're gonna try to get
 

669
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,110
library aha so we're gonna try to get
some stuff done here we're gonna work on

it's gotten to that point so that was
 

687
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,829
it's gotten to that point so that was
the point of the library one of the

688
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
the point of the library one of the
 

689
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,949
the point of the library one of the
points

690
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959

i think we need to get this building
 

695
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,189
i think we need to get this building

696
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:35,199
rolling i've been avoiding this build
 

697
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,269
rolling i've been avoiding this build
a little bit even though it's like one

698
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
a little bit even though it's like one
 

699

00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
of the most requested things i work on
 

701
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,629
of the most requested things i work on
for some reason

702
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
for some reason
 

703
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,550
for some reason
you guys really want to see the library

704
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
you guys really want to see the library
 

705
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,710
you guys really want to see the library
done i don't know

706
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
done i don't know
 

707
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,509

709
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,829

the thing is when i started this build i

710
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
the thing is when i started this build i
 

711
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,509
the thing is when i started this build i
didn't have a plan for it really i just

712
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
didn't have a plan for it really i just
 

713
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,790
didn't have a plan for it really i just
worked on the front until

714
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800

 

715
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,189

i liked it and i still do like it but if

716
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
i liked it and i still do like it but if
 

717
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,150
i liked it and i still do like it but if
i was to build this

718
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
i was to build this
 

719
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,389
i was to build this
again today i would probably do it a lot

720
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
again today i would probably do it a lot
 

721
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,990
again today i would probably do it a lot
differently

722
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,000
differently
 

723
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,030
differently
but we're gonna go we're gonna roll with

724
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
but we're gonna go we're gonna roll with
 

725
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,550
but we're gonna go we're gonna roll with
it and just see what happens i still

726
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
it and just see what happens i still
 

727
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,189
it and just see what happens i still
don't have

728
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199
don't have
 

729
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,790
don't have
much of a plan but hopefully

730
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:12,800
much of a plan but hopefully
 

731
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,710
much of a plan but hopefully
it turns out nice and if it doesn't it

732
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
it turns out nice and if it doesn't it

somewhat of a second story to the
 

741
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,030
somewhat of a second story to the
building

742
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040

um how tall is this if this is ground
 

749
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,389
um how tall is this if this is ground
level this is one

750
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
level this is one
 

751
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,389
level this is one
two three four five blocks

two three four five blocks
 

753
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,670
two three four five blocks
i wonder if that's good i'm thinking

754
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
i wonder if that's good i'm thinking
 

755
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,110
i wonder if that's good i'm thinking
like we'll do

756
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
like we'll do
 

757
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,230
like we'll do
paths like this from underneath

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
paths like this from underneath
 

759
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,590
paths like this from underneath
like i want like uh

760
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600

 

761
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,509

paths running along the top here with

762
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
paths running along the top here with
 

763
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,189
paths running along the top here with
railing that you can look over

764
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
railing that you can look over
 

765
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,949
railing that you can look over
down to the second or to the bottom

766
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
down to the second or to the bottom
 

767
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,030
down to the second or to the bottom
floor here um

768
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
floor here um
 

769
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,910
floor here um
so i want this to be spruce on the sides

770
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
so i want this to be spruce on the sides
 

771
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,509
so i want this to be spruce on the sides
with a fence above

772
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519

 

773
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,670

red carpet just for some color and then

774
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
red carpet just for some color and then
 

775
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,629
red carpet just for some color and then
probably

776
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:06,639
probably
 

777
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,990
probably
i don't really want to see the red from

778
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
i don't really want to see the red from
 

779
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,749
i don't really want to see the red from
below here though so i'll probably put

780
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
below here though so i'll probably put
 

781
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,389
below here though so i'll probably put
some slabs

782
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
some slabs
 

783
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,430
some slabs
under that and probably another

let's go sleep for a second um
 

793
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,230
let's go sleep for a second um
yes the library hopefully it turns out

794
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
yes the library hopefully it turns out
 

795
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,069
yes the library hopefully it turns out
uh this project man

796
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
uh this project man
 

797
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,590
uh this project man
i'm scared of it okay here we go let's

798
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
i'm scared of it okay here we go let's
 

799
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,870
i'm scared of it okay here we go let's
go back

800
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
go back
 

801
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,949
go back
and honestly i have no plan here really

802
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959

 

803
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,230

what oh piston didn't retract

804

what oh piston didn't retract
 

805
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,350
what oh piston didn't retract
okay so if if we do that it'll look like

806
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
okay so if if we do that it'll look like
 

807
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,189
okay so if if we do that it'll look like
this kind of from up here is this going

808
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
this kind of from up here is this going
 

809
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,840
this kind of from up here is this going
to be okay is that too much red maybe

810
00:16:59,840 --> 00:16:59,850

 

811
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,949

[Music]

812
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
[Music]
 

813
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,309
[Music]
might be a little too much red we could

814
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
might be a little too much red we could
 

815
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,230
might be a little too much red we could
also use the dark wood

816
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240

 

817
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,750

instead of the spruce that might be

818
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:09,760
instead of the spruce that might be
 

819
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,590
instead of the spruce that might be
better

820
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600

 

821
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:22,230

let's see let's try this out

822
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240

 

823
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,590

i think i like that more i don't know

824
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
i think i like that more i don't know
 

825

do the dark wood so i think
let's see it the building seems like

834
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
let's see it the building seems like
 

835
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,870
let's see it the building seems like
it's going to be wider than it is long

836
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
it's going to be wider than it is long
 

837
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,830

961
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,190

red i might not put the tree or the

962
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
red i might not put the tree or the
 

963
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,710

i think i
 

967
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,110

instead we should have like something

968
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
instead we should have like something
 

969
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,590
instead we should have like something
kind of central over here because it

970
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600
kind of central over here because it
 

971
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,029
kind of central over here because it
wraps around like this and i don't want

972
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,039
wraps around like this and i don't want
 

973
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,990
wraps around like this and i don't want
the building to be

974
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000
the building to be
 

975
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,870
the building to be
too big like if we put something really

976
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
too big like if we put something really
 

977
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,149
too big like if we put something really
big over here

978
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
big over here
 

979
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,669
big over here
the building has to come all the way

980
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
the building has to come all the way
 

981
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,230
the building has to come all the way
over to here but if we just

982
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
over to here but if we just
 

983
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,630
over to here but if we just
do it over there we can kind of put the

984
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640
do it over there we can kind of put the
 

985
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,789
do it over there we can kind of put the
back wall around here

986
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
back wall around here
 

987
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,029
back wall around here
which will make it a lot smaller and

988
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
which will make it a lot smaller and
 

989
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,870
which will make it a lot smaller and
have like another centerpiece thing on

990
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
have like another centerpiece thing on
 

991
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,390
have like another centerpiece thing on
this side too

992
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,400

 

993
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,350

all right let's go back here uh so i was

994
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
all right let's go back here uh so i was
 

995
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,310
all right let's go back here uh so i was
using the dark oak right

996
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,320
using the dark oak right
 

997
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,990
using the dark oak right
i think so dark oak to line the walkway

998
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,000

 

999
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,669

like so and then in here

1000
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
like so and then in here
 

1001
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,190
like so and then in here
this is probably where i'm going to hide

1002
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,200
this is probably where i'm going to hide
 

1003

1241
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,990
third or fourth block currently might
add more

1256
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:20,480
it might be a little too much if we add
 

1257
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,149
it might be a little too much if we add
a third one over there instead i think

1258
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:22,159
a third one over there instead i think
 

1259
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,590
a third one over there instead i think
what we'll do

1260
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600
what we'll do
 

1261
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,070
what we'll do
we'll take this section move that over

1262
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,080
we'll take this section move that over
 

1263
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,870
we'll take this section move that over
to here

1264
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
to here
 

1265
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,710
to here
this will be bookcases then cove here

1266
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:30,720
this will be bookcases then cove here
 

1267
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,669
this will be bookcases then cove here
bookcase cove bookcase so there'll only

1268
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
bookcase cove bookcase so there'll only
 

1269
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,190
bookcase cove bookcase so there'll only
be two codes total

1270
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,200
be two codes total
 

1271
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,390
be two codes total
instead of three like i have going

1272
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
instead of three like i have going
 

1273
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,350
instead of three like i have going
like if we this is the middle right here

1274
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,360
like if we this is the middle right here
 

1275
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,789
like if we this is the middle right here
so if we did that it would

1276
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:42,799
so if we did that it would
 

1277
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,990
so if we did that it would
go over there too um

1278
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,000
go over there too um
 

1279
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,710
go over there too um
that'll make that a little simpler and i

1280
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
that'll make that a little simpler and i
 

1281
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,350
that'll make that a little simpler and i
tried making this go

1282
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,360
tried making this go
 

1283
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,470
tried making this go
this way and it's just not enough space

1284
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,480
this way and it's just not enough space
 

1285
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:54,870
this way and it's just not enough space
like

1286
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
like
 

1287
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,669
like
this is from this path to there is too

1288
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:57,679
this is from this path to there is too
 

1289
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,110
this is from this path to there is too
close together

1290
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,120
close together
 

1291
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,710
close together
you wouldn't really be able to see much

1292
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:00,720
you wouldn't really be able to see much
 

1293
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,230
you wouldn't really be able to see much
up there because you pretty much have to

1294
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,240
up there because you pretty much have to
 

1295
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,310
up there because you pretty much have to
look straight up and then

1296
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
look straight up and then
 

1297
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,310
look straight up and then
the angle is just wrong so instead of

1298
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:06,320
the angle is just wrong so instead of
 

1299
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,430
the angle is just wrong so instead of
making it come

1300
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
making it come
 

1301
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,789
making it come
out this way we will just have the path

1302
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:10,799
out this way we will just have the path
 

1303
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,909
out this way we will just have the path
end at the wall there i think

1304
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:13,919
end at the wall there i think
 

1305
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,909
end at the wall there i think

00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:56,159
and it's just a cool little thing to
 

1339
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,909
and it's just a cool little thing to
have around

1340
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919

 

1341
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,510

all right

1342
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:03,520
all right
 

1343
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,190
all right
take this out

1344
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,200

 

1345
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,590

yeah i think this will work out better

1346
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,600
yeah i think this will work out better
 

1347
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,190
yeah i think this will work out better
because you have a pretty nice view

1348
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,200
because you have a pretty nice view
 

1349
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,750
because you have a pretty nice view
of of this walkway from down there

1350
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760
of of this walkway from down there
 

1351
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,909
of of this walkway from down there
and then it'll be more open feeling too

1352
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:17,919
and then it'll be more open feeling too
 

1353
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,510
and then it'll be more open feeling too
over here instead of all

1354
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:19,520
over here instead of all
 

1355
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,909
over here instead of all
claustrophobic and paths all over the

1356
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:21,919
claustrophobic and paths all over the
 

1357
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:22,870
claustrophobic and paths all over the
place

1358
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:22,880
place
 

1359
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,710
place
it'll be a little bit less this way

1360
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:28,720

 

1361
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,990

all right and i'm not sure what to do

1362
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
all right and i'm not sure what to do
 

1363
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,190
all right and i'm not sure what to do
about the wall on the inside just yet

1364
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,200
about the wall on the inside just yet
 

1365
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,830
about the wall on the inside just yet
here let's go look at that may also add

1366
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
here let's go look at that may also add
 

1367
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,830
here let's go look at that may also add
a staircase to go down there

1368
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:37,840
a staircase to go down there
 

1369
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,350
a staircase to go down there
like from here down to here oops

1370
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,360

 

1371
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,269

skeleton

1372
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:47,279

 

1373
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,110

yeah like that's a pretty good view from

1374
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120
yeah like that's a pretty good view from
 

1375
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,990
yeah like that's a pretty good view from
from over here to look up at that

1376
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,000
from over here to look up at that
 

1377
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,149
from over here to look up at that
uh i almost wish i made this all one

1378
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,159
uh i almost wish i made this all one
 

1379
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,830
uh i almost wish i made this all one
block lower but i think i think it'll be

1380
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:56,840
block lower but i think i think it'll be
 

1381
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,149
block lower but i think i think it'll be
okay

1382
00:28:58,149 --> 00:28:58,159
okay
 

1383
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,230
okay
it gives it more of an epic feel when

1384
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,240
it gives it more of an epic feel when
 

1385
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,669
it gives it more of an epic feel when
it's taller like this

1386
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:03,679

 

1387
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,510

yeah anyway i think that's about it for

1388
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:05,520
yeah anyway i think that's about it for
 

1389
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,789
yeah anyway i think that's about it for

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,669
kind of stuff they'd spawn on grass and
then you'd funnel them down
