00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:40,630
maybe we'll just grab my shrubs soil I
 

99
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,879
maybe we'll just grab my shrubs soil I
guess let's go on up I was really

100
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:44,889
guess let's go on up I was really
 

101
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,860
guess let's go on up I was really
looking around my teef systems and stuff

102
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:46,870
looking around my teef systems and stuff
 

103
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,780
looking around my teef systems and stuff
to see how I want to continue this

104
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:48,790
to see how I want to continue this
 

105
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,230
to see how I want to continue this
project and

106
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,240
project and
 

107
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,390
project and
it looks like there's a lot of potential

108
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
it looks like there's a lot of potential
 

109
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,360
it looks like there's a lot of potential
for branching off to other paths and

110
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,370
for branching off to other paths and
 

111
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,850
for branching off to other paths and
stuff I didn't realize before like like

112
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:00,860
stuff I didn't realize before like like
 

113
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,650
stuff I didn't realize before like like
for example even down here if we dug

114
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:02,660
for example even down here if we dug
 

115
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,990
for example even down here if we dug
straight this way and then made it go

116
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,000
straight this way and then made it go
 

117
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,680
straight this way and then made it go
right it goes right to a cave here which

118
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:10,690
right it goes right to a cave here which
 

119
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,840
right it goes right to a cave here which
which is pretty good and it just keeps

120
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:13,850
which is pretty good and it just keeps
 

121
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,220
which is pretty good and it just keeps
going around and around I think that

122
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,230
going around and around I think that
 

123
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,540
going around and around I think that
would be a nice place to expand to the

124
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:19,550
would be a nice place to expand to the
 

125
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,430
would be a nice place to expand to the
first yeah let's do the water let's do

126
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
first yeah let's do the water let's do
 

127
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,770
first yeah let's do the water let's do
the water okay so I think what I want to

128
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:26,780
the water okay so I think what I want to
 

129
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,230
the water okay so I think what I want to
do here is have or I want to try make

130
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,240
do here is have or I want to try make
 

131
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,090
do here is have or I want to try make
the water go in one block underneath all

132
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,100
the water go in one block underneath all
 

133
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,060
the water go in one block underneath all
the logs and that might make it look a

134
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,070
the logs and that might make it look a
 

135
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,530
the logs and that might make it look a
little better I'm also considering

136
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:38,540
little better I'm also considering
 

137
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,060
little better I'm also considering
whether or not we should leave some

138
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,070
whether or not we should leave some
 

139
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,940
whether or not we should leave some
grass here like a little a little bit or

140
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:42,950
grass here like a little a little bit or
 

141
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,650
grass here like a little a little bit or
if it just should just get rid of it all

142
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:44,660
if it just should just get rid of it all
 

143
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:51,130
if it just should just get rid of it all
oh there's a cave down there and I'm

144
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,140
oh there's a cave down there and I'm
 

145
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,300
oh there's a cave down there and I'm
trying to be careful not to flood

146
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,310
trying to be careful not to flood
 

147
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,730
trying to be careful not to flood
anything to when I do this we'll try it

148
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:57,740
anything to when I do this we'll try it
 

149
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,020
anything to when I do this we'll try it
with that first

150
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,030
with that first
 

151
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,870
with that first

and over here too
 

159
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:29,320
and over here too
kind of a weird shape okay let's go see

160
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,330
kind of a weird shape okay let's go see
 

161
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:35,280
kind of a weird shape okay let's go see
what that looks like

162

wanted to try to do a whirlpool thing
 

195
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,010
wanted to try to do a whirlpool thing
too but we'll we'll go to Wilson for

196
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,020
too but we'll we'll go to Wilson for
 

197
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,920
too but we'll we'll go to Wilson for
right now also we have stairs here I

198
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:40,930
right now also we have stairs here I
 

199
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:46,540
right now also we have stairs here I
want to put more stairs here and I found

200
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:46,550
want to put more stairs here and I found
 

201
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,810
want to put more stairs here and I found
them in the first chest I checked it I

202
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:48,820
them in the first chest I checked it I
 

203
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,650
them in the first chest I checked it I
went to the chance it's three four five

204
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:52,660
went to the chance it's three four five
 

205
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,000
went to the chance it's three four five
let's actually make the stairs start

206
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,010
let's actually make the stairs start
 

207

open room and I think we'll keep the

210
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:01,550
open room and I think we'll keep the
 

211
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,490
open room and I think we'll keep the
same theme in this Wilson room as we

212
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:03,500
same theme in this Wilson room as we
 

213
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,130
same theme in this Wilson room as we
have over here with the grass and all

214
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:06,140
have over here with the grass and all
 

215
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,930

the wood and stuff might put some trees

216
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:10,940
the wood and stuff might put some trees
 

217
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:20,370
the wood and stuff might put some trees
in this room and maybe one more block

218
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:20,380

 

219
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,930

okay so the problem we're having with

220
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:22,940
okay so the problem we're having with
 

221
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,410
okay so the problem we're having with
Wilson is with his food detection system

222
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:26,420
Wilson is with his food detection system
 

223
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,690
Wilson is with his food detection system
with the minecart setup we had before

224
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:28,700
with the minecart setup we had before
 

225
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,930
with the minecart setup we had before
that stopped working for whatever reason

226
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:31,940
that stopped working for whatever reason
 

227
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,240
that stopped working for whatever reason
hoppers started putting two items in the

228
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,250
hoppers started putting two items in the
 

229
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,030
hoppers started putting two items in the
minecart instead of just one which was

230
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,040
minecart instead of just one which was
 

231
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,920
minecart instead of just one which was
making it work one time then not work

232
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:38,930
making it work one time then not work
 

233
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,630
making it work one time then not work
then worked the next time then not work

234
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:40,640
then worked the next time then not work
 

235
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,410
then worked the next time then not work
so I came up with this instead now and

236
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:44,420
so I came up with this instead now and
 

237
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,360
so I came up with this instead now and
this seems like it would be a

238
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,370
this seems like it would be a
 

239
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:52,900
this seems like it would be a
good idea like it should work if if like

240
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:52,910
good idea like it should work if if like
 

241
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,520
good idea like it should work if if like
we can have we're using this as an item

242
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:57,530
we can have we're using this as an item
 

243
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,850
we can have we're using this as an item
detector right so it will go down to 22

244
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:00,860
detector right so it will go down to 22
 

245
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,490
detector right so it will go down to 22
items and stop and every time a new item

246
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:03,500
items and stop and every time a new item
 

247
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,260
items and stop and every time a new item
goes in there it will trigger the

248
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,270
goes in there it will trigger the
 

249
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,760
goes in there it will trigger the
redstone and we can take that redstone

250
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:06,770
redstone and we can take that redstone
 

251
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,730
redstone and we can take that redstone
signal and make it do something um and

252
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:09,740
signal and make it do something um and
 

253
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,500
signal and make it do something um and
it seems to work very reliably too not

254
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:14,510
it seems to work very reliably too not
 

255
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,659
it seems to work very reliably too not
much to it we can put two together like

256
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:16,669
much to it we can put two together like
 

257
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:28,960
much to it we can put two together like
this and and this one works and it

258
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:28,970
this and and this one works and it
 

259
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,110
this and and this one works and it
stopped but how here is the problem for

260
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,120
stopped but how here is the problem for
 

261
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,730
stopped but how here is the problem for
some reason when I build it over here it

262
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:36,740
some reason when I build it over here it
 

263
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,159
some reason when I build it over here it
doesn't work and I can't figure out for

264
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,169
doesn't work and I can't figure out for
 

265
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,130
doesn't work and I can't figure out for
the life of me why that is like this one

266
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:42,140
the life of me why that is like this one
 

267
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,440
the life of me why that is like this one
works this one works

268
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:44,450
works this one works
 

269
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,220
works this one works
but these edge ones it's like this

270
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,230
but these edge ones it's like this
 

271
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,230
but these edge ones it's like this
hoppers being powered down here even

hoppers being powered down here even
 

273
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,199

though it's not so items are not passing

274
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:53,209
though it's not so items are not passing
 

275
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:57,760
though it's not so items are not passing
into it because it they're showing b22

exactly the same all right

exactly the same all right
 

281
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:12,570
exactly the same all right
and even if you like destroy all this

282
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:12,580

 

283
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,210

it's like it doesn't follow normal

284
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:16,220
it's like it doesn't follow normal
 

285
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,560
it's like it doesn't follow normal

we get rid of all this stuff you know

288
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:23,900
we get rid of all this stuff you know

00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,130
bottom hopper but they're not and I do
 

293
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,850

not understand why like if we if we

294
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:30,860
not understand why like if we if we
 

295
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,410
not understand why like if we if we
build the exact same thing somewhere

296
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:32,420
build the exact same thing somewhere
 

297
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,880
build the exact same thing somewhere
else not a problem

298
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:36,890
else not a problem

00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,760
else not a problem
and the only thing I didn't think of is

300
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:39,770
and the only thing I didn't think of is
 

301
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,920
and the only thing I didn't think of is
maybe somehow I put a lever at the

302
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:41,930
maybe somehow I put a lever at the
 

303
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,180
maybe somehow I put a lever at the
bottom of this thing and I'm going to

304
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:43,190
bottom of this thing and I'm going to
 

305
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,670
bottom of this thing and I'm going to
check it now but I highly doubt I would

306
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
check it now but I highly doubt I would
 

307
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,460
check it now but I highly doubt I would
forget that

309
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:58,900

well I'm strapping this recording I must

00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:58,910
well I'm strapping this recording I must
 

311

well I'm strapping this recording I must
have put those there for the power rails

were there I didn't actually waste like
 

319
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,320
were there I didn't actually waste like
half an hour trying to figure this out

this this is all set up now and much
 

325
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,570
this this is all set up now and much
smaller than the minecart setup which is

326
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:22,580
smaller than the minecart setup which is
 

327
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,210
smaller than the minecart setup which is
awesome and also more reliable so

328
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:25,220
awesome and also more reliable so
 

329
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,100
awesome and also more reliable so

00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,620
cool if he shot fireballs from his eyes
like randomly every now and then so I

480
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:07,630
like randomly every now and then so I
 

481
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,000
like randomly every now and then so I
would like to try and make that happen

482
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,010
would like to try and make that happen
 

483
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,600
would like to try and make that happen
ah if we go actually let's just rip

484
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:12,610
ah if we go actually let's just rip
 

485
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:18,090
ah if we go actually let's just rip
something I think to make it shoot from

486
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:18,100
something I think to make it shoot from
 

487
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,500
something I think to make it shoot from
his eyes we would have to put a

488
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:19,510
his eyes we would have to put a
 

489
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,380
his eyes we would have to put a
dispenser like right there and one there

490
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,390
dispenser like right there and one there
 

491
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:28,110
dispenser like right there and one there
and then hook up some some wiring to

492
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,120
and then hook up some some wiring to
 

493
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,389
and then hook up some some wiring to
that and it should work out okay we

494
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:33,399
that and it should work out okay we
 

495
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,949
that and it should work out okay we
would have to change the shape of this a

496
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
would have to change the shape of this a
 

497
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,949
would have to change the shape of this a
little bit so let's go upstairs

498
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:37,959
little bit so let's go upstairs
 

499
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,449
little bit so let's go upstairs
try to see if we have our stuff around

500
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:41,459
try to see if we have our stuff around
 

501
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,410
try to see if we have our stuff around
dispensers are one of those items I'm

502
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:43,420
dispensers are one of those items I'm
 

503
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,240
dispensers are one of those items I'm
never sure if I have because I hate

504
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,250
never sure if I have because I hate
 

505
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,880
never sure if I have because I hate
making them so usually I I don't make

506
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:47,890
making them so usually I I don't make
 

507
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,639
making them so usually I I don't make
them in bulk and it's not looking good

508
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:52,649
them in bulk and it's not looking good
 

509
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:57,030
them in bulk and it's not looking good
we got six cool okay we only need two we

510
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
we got six cool okay we only need two we
 

511
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,130
we got six cool okay we only need two we
have a redstone I have a lot of

512
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,140
have a redstone I have a lot of
 

513
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,470
have a redstone I have a lot of
gunpowder now so I don't mind wasting on

514
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
gunpowder now so I don't mind wasting on
 

515
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,889
gunpowder now so I don't mind wasting on
stuff like this um

516
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:08,899

 

517
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:14,790

is powder and use charcoal if you can

518
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
is powder and use charcoal if you can
 

519
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:22,480
is powder and use charcoal if you can
let's try that out I you can yeah any a

520
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,490
let's try that out I you can yeah any a
 

521
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,119
let's try that out I you can yeah any a
lots because you get three three per

522
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:27,129
lots because you get three three per
 

523
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:32,309
lots because you get three three per
let's see we'll need some sandstone

524
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:32,319

 

525
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:36,249

really much have to make do with that

526
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:36,259
really much have to make do with that
 

527
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:39,280
really much have to make do with that
okay oh and you know what else I should

528
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,290
okay oh and you know what else I should
 

529
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,999
okay oh and you know what else I should
grab is a fire resistant because how you

530
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:43,009
grab is a fire resistant because how you
 

531
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:45,850
grab is a fire resistant because how you
will probably die otherwise let's go

532
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:45,860
will probably die otherwise let's go
 

533
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:52,960
will probably die otherwise let's go
visit our lab oops and orange for fire

534
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:52,970
visit our lab oops and orange for fire
 

535
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,639
visit our lab oops and orange for fire
resist and drop that

536
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:56,649
resist and drop that
 

537
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,780
resist and drop that
how are things going guys mmm-hmm keep

538
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:01,790
how are things going guys mmm-hmm keep
 

539
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,110
how are things going guys mmm-hmm keep
each other in line the future of our

540
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
each other in line the future of our
 

541
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:13,480
each other in line the future of our
company depends on you I this should be

542
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:13,490
company depends on you I this should be
 

543
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,710
company depends on you I this should be
pretty easy actually go ahead and drink

544
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:17,720
pretty easy actually go ahead and drink
 

545
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,490
pretty easy actually go ahead and drink
this already let's see where are the

546
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:21,500
this already let's see where are the
 

547
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,720
this already let's see where are the
eyes they're right here so we I want to

548
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:25,730
eyes they're right here so we I want to
 

549
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,649
eyes they're right here so we I want to
put in the bottom left corner so that

550
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:29,659
put in the bottom left corner so that
 

551
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:32,610
put in the bottom left corner so that
would be this thing right there

552
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:32,620
would be this thing right there
 

553
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,590
would be this thing right there
hopefully it's not too hard to hide this

554
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,600
hopefully it's not too hard to hide this
 

555
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,159
hopefully it's not too hard to hide this
I could almost see there for a second

556
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:42,169
I could almost see there for a second
 

557
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:48,560
I could almost see there for a second
okay where's that oh yeah it is it is

558
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:48,570
okay where's that oh yeah it is it is
 

559
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,950
okay where's that oh yeah it is it is
where I thought it was okay

560
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
where I thought it was okay
 

561
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,830
where I thought it was okay
we lost the stare with other one right

562
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:54,840
we lost the stare with other one right
 

563
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,470
we lost the stare with other one right
there and we got to dig above that for

564
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
there and we got to dig above that for
 

565
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,529
there and we got to dig above that for
redstone

566
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:02,539
redstone
 

567
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:07,600
redstone
over here we'll have to hide some I

568
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:07,610

 

569
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:14,180

can't see should check the time on these

570
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,190
can't see should check the time on these
 

571
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,590
can't see should check the time on these
potions it might only be three minutes

572
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,600
potions it might only be three minutes
 

573
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:22,399
potions it might only be three minutes
oh no it's the minute one okay and then

574
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:22,409
oh no it's the minute one okay and then
 

575
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:28,070
oh no it's the minute one okay and then
we'll have to try make this work if we

576
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
we'll have to try make this work if we
 

577
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,029
we'll have to try make this work if we
remove these stairs up darn we lost them

578
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:34,039
remove these stairs up darn we lost them
 

579
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,340
remove these stairs up darn we lost them
like this then we could have half slabs

580
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:37,350
like this then we could have half slabs
 

581
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,680
like this then we could have half slabs
below I think that would look pretty

582
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:42,690
below I think that would look pretty
 

583
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:47,990
below I think that would look pretty
good still yeah there we go

584
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
good still yeah there we go
 

585
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,779
good still yeah there we go
that's not too bad we have a little less

586
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:50,789
that's not too bad we have a little less
 

587
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:52,760
that's not too bad we have a little less
space to throw our ender pearl but I'm

588
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:52,770
space to throw our ender pearl but I'm
 

589
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,520
space to throw our ender pearl but I'm
not overly worried about it I have lots

590
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:55,530
not overly worried about it I have lots
 

591
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,039
not overly worried about it I have lots
of practice by now I don't think I'll

592
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:58,049
of practice by now I don't think I'll
 

593
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:04,730
of practice by now I don't think I'll
hit the half slab cool off okay so the

594
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:04,740
hit the half slab cool off okay so the
 

595
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,169
hit the half slab cool off okay so the
hill shoot fireballs out his eyes and

596
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:06,179
hill shoot fireballs out his eyes and
 

597
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,510
hill shoot fireballs out his eyes and
they'll hit the wall there I think as

598
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:08,520
they'll hit the wall there I think as
 

599
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,720
they'll hit the wall there I think as
long as it doesn't have any ground like

600
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:13,730

 

601
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:18,350

like anything if there's if it if the

602
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:18,360
like anything if there's if it if the
 

603
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,870
like anything if there's if it if the
fireball hits here it'll catch the dirt

604
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
fireball hits here it'll catch the dirt
 

605
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,529
fireball hits here it'll catch the dirt
on fire but if it has nothing below its

606
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:24,539
on fire but if it has nothing below its
 

607
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,270
on fire but if it has nothing below its
I don't have to worry about fire and

608
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,280
I don't have to worry about fire and
 

609
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,460
I don't have to worry about fire and
then it's spreading up to my bridge

610
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:28,470
then it's spreading up to my bridge
 

611
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,250
then it's spreading up to my bridge
there or anything so I think we'll be

612
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:31,260
there or anything so I think we'll be
 

613
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,630
there or anything so I think we'll be
okay and I just cut a hole through here

614
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:35,640
okay and I just cut a hole through here
 

615
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,350
okay and I just cut a hole through here
where we can do the wiring this makes it

616
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
where we can do the wiring this makes it
 

617
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,960
where we can do the wiring this makes it
a lot easier to see compared to trying

618
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:41,970
a lot easier to see compared to trying
 

619
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,770
a lot easier to see compared to trying
to do it in the in the lava and the way

620
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:45,780
to do it in the in the lava and the way
 

621
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,029
to do it in the in the lava and the way
I want to do this let's let's set up a

622
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:50,039
I want to do this let's let's set up a
 

623
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,539
I want to do this let's let's set up a
5-minute dispenser clock but I also want

624
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:53,549
5-minute dispenser clock but I also want
 

625
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:55,370
5-minute dispenser clock but I also want
some randomization in it so

626
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:55,380
some randomization in it so
 

627
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,890
some randomization in it so
not always going off every five minutes

628
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:57,900
not always going off every five minutes
 

629
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,340
not always going off every five minutes
or something and the way we're gonna do

630
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:01,350
or something and the way we're gonna do
 

631
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:09,080
or something and the way we're gonna do
that let's see oh you know what we'll do

632
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,090
that let's see oh you know what we'll do
 

633
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,080
that let's see oh you know what we'll do
put a repeater here that'll go up to

634
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,090
put a repeater here that'll go up to
 

635
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:21,200
put a repeater here that'll go up to
there and then m-maybe we'll go in this

636
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,210
there and then m-maybe we'll go in this
 

637
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:21,560
there and then m-maybe we'll go in this
way

638
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:21,570
way
 

639
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,630
way
wonder what's over here I got lots of

640
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
wonder what's over here I got lots of
 

641
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,220
wonder what's over here I got lots of
stuff underground I'm always worried I'm

642
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,230
stuff underground I'm always worried I'm
 

643
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,340
stuff underground I'm always worried I'm
gonna hit it when I'm doing something

644
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:30,350
gonna hit it when I'm doing something
 

645
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:35,390
gonna hit it when I'm doing something
today we'll do a comparator and we need

646
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:35,400
today we'll do a comparator and we need
 

647
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,520
today we'll do a comparator and we need
that to run two blocks what I'm making

648
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:37,530
that to run two blocks what I'm making
 

649
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,670
that to run two blocks what I'm making
is a really cool randomizer I've seen on

650
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:40,680
is a really cool randomizer I've seen on
 

651
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:47,860
is a really cool randomizer I've seen on
a few people's channels the way it works

652
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:47,870
a few people's channels the way it works
 

653
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:52,970
a few people's channels the way it works
you have a hopper dropper combo with the

654
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:52,980
you have a hopper dropper combo with the
 

655
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,960
you have a hopper dropper combo with the
dropper below and the hopper above and

656
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:56,970
dropper below and the hopper above and
 

657
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,780
dropper below and the hopper above and
when you send it an item you just give

658
00:20:59,780 --> 00:20:59,790
when you send it an item you just give
 

659
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:05,720
when you send it an item you just give
it you give it items that do stack like

660
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:05,730
it you give it items that do stack like
 

661
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,710
it you give it items that do stack like
in in 64 is like we could do one dirt

662
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
in in 64 is like we could do one dirt
 

663
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,980
in in 64 is like we could do one dirt
one cobble one stone and then if we give

664
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:12,990
one cobble one stone and then if we give
 

665
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,210
one cobble one stone and then if we give
it an item that doesn't stack like a

666
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:17,220
it an item that doesn't stack like a
 

667
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:30,050
it an item that doesn't stack like a
sword or something then these ones will

668
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:30,060
sword or something then these ones will
 

669
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,000
sword or something then these ones will
only make the comparator travel one

670
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,010
only make the comparator travel one
 

671
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,120
only make the comparator travel one
block actually we can try that out while

672
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,130
block actually we can try that out while
 

673
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,270
block actually we can try that out while
the the hole will make it go two blocks

674
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,280
the the hole will make it go two blocks
 

675
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,060
the the hole will make it go two blocks
because it counts as a full stack of

676
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,070
because it counts as a full stack of
 

677
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:46,970
because it counts as a full stack of
items that time oh that time it went

678
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:46,980
items that time oh that time it went
 

679
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,840
items that time oh that time it went
that time it was the the hoe and the

680
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:50,850
that time it was the the hoe and the
 

681
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:59,440
that time it was the the hoe and the
item like right away goes back down OOP

682
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,450
item like right away goes back down OOP
 

683
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,960
item like right away goes back down OOP
getting pretty lucky here actually

684
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:03,970

 

685
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,820

I'm going to go check out there because

686
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:05,830
I'm going to go check out there because
 

687
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,440
I'm going to go check out there because
I'm a little worried about fire I'm not

688
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,450
I'm a little worried about fire I'm not
 

689
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,560
I'm a little worried about fire I'm not
going to lie

690
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:09,570
going to lie
 

691
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,470
going to lie
we're okay whoo yeah so we'll have that

692
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:13,480
we're okay whoo yeah so we'll have that
 

693
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,060
we're okay whoo yeah so we'll have that
and then we'll hook up a five-minute

694
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,070
and then we'll hook up a five-minute
 

695
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:20,520
and then we'll hook up a five-minute
clock to that just like this so this is

696
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:20,530
clock to that just like this so this is
 

697
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,740
clock to that just like this so this is
a five minute dispenser clock these are

698
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:22,750
a five minute dispenser clock these are
 

699
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,470
a five minute dispenser clock these are
very common and well known but the way

700
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:25,480
very common and well known but the way
 

701
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,200
very common and well known but the way
they work is they shoot an item onto

702
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,210
they work is they shoot an item onto
 

703
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,450
they work is they shoot an item onto
this wooden pressure plates and it takes

704
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:30,460
this wooden pressure plates and it takes
 

705
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,670
this wooden pressure plates and it takes
that item five minutes to de-spawn and

706
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:32,680
that item five minutes to de-spawn and
 

707
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,460
that item five minutes to de-spawn and
when it does it makes this torch turn

708
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:35,470
when it does it makes this torch turn
 

709
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,910
when it does it makes this torch turn
back on and sends out another item so it

710
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:38,920
back on and sends out another item so it
 

711
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,350
back on and sends out another item so it
keeps going around and around in a loop

712
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:40,360
keeps going around and around in a loop
 

713
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,620
keeps going around and around in a loop
and with this number of items it takes

714
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:43,630
and with this number of items it takes
 

715
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,500
and with this number of items it takes
48 hours and to run out so it's going to

716
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:46,510
48 hours and to run out so it's going to
 

717
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,020
48 hours and to run out so it's going to
run for a long time on its own but then

718
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,030
run for a long time on its own but then
 

719
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,020
run for a long time on its own but then
this goes to another torch next to this

720
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,030
this goes to another torch next to this
 

721
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,080
this goes to another torch next to this
dropper we have to use a torch we can't

722
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,090
dropper we have to use a torch we can't
 

723
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,080
dropper we have to use a torch we can't
just use redstone that's because if the

724
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,090
just use redstone that's because if the
 

725
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,380
just use redstone that's because if the
droppers stays powered then this hopper

726
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:01,390
droppers stays powered then this hopper
 

727
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,180
droppers stays powered then this hopper
won't be able to put items into it so

728
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,190
won't be able to put items into it so
 

729
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,490
won't be able to put items into it so
that's why are you using a torch and

730
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:07,500
that's why are you using a torch and
 

731
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,350
that's why are you using a torch and
we're going to use three items total so

732
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:10,360
we're going to use three items total so
 

733
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,120
we're going to use three items total so
on average it's going to trigger every

734
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,130
on average it's going to trigger every
 

735
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,090
on average it's going to trigger every
15 minutes but sometimes it might do two

736
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:15,100
15 minutes but sometimes it might do two
 

737
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,620
15 minutes but sometimes it might do two
in a row sometimes it might not go for

738
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:16,630
in a row sometimes it might not go for
 

739
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,800
in a row sometimes it might not go for
thirty minutes so it'll be kind of nice

740
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:19,810
thirty minutes so it'll be kind of nice
 

741
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,560
thirty minutes so it'll be kind of nice
and random you know something I like

742
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:22,570
and random you know something I like
 

743
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,380
and random you know something I like
things that are unexpected that just

744
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,390
things that are unexpected that just
 

745
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:30,030
things that are unexpected that just
happened on their own so with that said

746
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,040
happened on their own so with that said
 

747
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,000
happened on their own so with that said
why should I should get this going right

748
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,010
why should I should get this going right
 

749
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,930
why should I should get this going right
don't want to forget that so jumpstart

750
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:36,940
don't want to forget that so jumpstart
 

751
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,680
don't want to forget that so jumpstart
it like that oh and we got lucky there

752
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:41,690

 

753
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,310

okay and I also hooked up a wire out

754
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,320
okay and I also hooked up a wire out
 

755
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,620
okay and I also hooked up a wire out
here just so we can see what it does

756
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:47,630
here just so we can see what it does
 

757
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,300
here just so we can see what it does
instead of waiting forever for it to

758
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:50,310
instead of waiting forever for it to
 

759
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:56,770
instead of waiting forever for it to
happen by chance and it doesn't work why

760
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:56,780
happen by chance and it doesn't work why
 

761
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:03,110
happen by chance and it doesn't work why
is it too far it is too far mmm okay you

762
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
is it too far it is too far mmm okay you
 

763
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:10,610
is it too far it is too far mmm okay you
can fix that are my repeaters okay here

764
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:10,620
can fix that are my repeaters okay here
 

765
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:20,650
can fix that are my repeaters okay here
we go whoa that's cool I like it it

766
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:20,660
we go whoa that's cool I like it it
 

767
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,790
we go whoa that's cool I like it it
seems to hit the same spot pretty much

768
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:22,800
seems to hit the same spot pretty much
 

769
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,470
seems to hit the same spot pretty much
consistently we will do a little bit of

770
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:27,480
consistently we will do a little bit of
 

771
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,850
consistently we will do a little bit of
terraforming here I don't like how this

772
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:28,860
terraforming here I don't like how this
 

773
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,770
terraforming here I don't like how this
is looking

774
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:29,780
is looking
 

775
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:40,150
is looking
let's go let's go up try hide the dirt

776
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:40,160

 

777
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,030

give it some more shape and structure

778
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,040

 

779
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,030

awesome so that's another fun silly

780
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,040
awesome so that's another fun silly
 

781
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:56,150
awesome so that's another fun silly
project yeah

782
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:56,160
project yeah
 

783
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,890
project yeah
okay well I guess we're done with that I

784
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:57,900
okay well I guess we're done with that I
 

785
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,330
okay well I guess we're done with that I
can lock this up my portal doesn't work

786
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:02,340
can lock this up my portal doesn't work
 

787
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,160
can lock this up my portal doesn't work
anymore this thing so I'm gonna have to

788
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,170
anymore this thing so I'm gonna have to
 

789
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,660
anymore this thing so I'm gonna have to
go through this wiring again and fix

790
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:05,670
go through this wiring again and fix
 

791
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,170
go through this wiring again and fix
that

792
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:08,180

 

793
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,540

there it goes again

794
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:10,550
there it goes again
 

795
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:17,480
there it goes again
we will cover this back up and we'll

796
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:17,490
we will cover this back up and we'll
 

797
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,120
we will cover this back up and we'll
probably have a create an axis way to

798
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,130
probably have a create an axis way to
 

799
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:25,330
probably have a create an axis way to
get back there eventually one day cool

800
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:25,340
get back there eventually one day cool
 

801
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,310
get back there eventually one day cool
so yeah I was talking earlier about app

802
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
so yeah I was talking earlier about app
 

803
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,560
so yeah I was talking earlier about app
apps I wanted to put here the stress try

804
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:30,570
apps I wanted to put here the stress try
 

805
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,530
apps I wanted to put here the stress try
try that out this wall really needs to

806
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:33,540
try that out this wall really needs to
 

807
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,000
try that out this wall really needs to
be fixed up because you got like ugly

808
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,010
be fixed up because you got like ugly
 

809
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,760
be fixed up because you got like ugly
gravel and pumpkins showing and it's

810
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:37,770
gravel and pumpkins showing and it's
 

811
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,710
gravel and pumpkins showing and it's
been this way for a long long time

812
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:39,720
been this way for a long long time
 

813
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,190
been this way for a long long time
so eventually sometime very soon we're

814
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
so eventually sometime very soon we're
 

815
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:50,710
so eventually sometime very soon we're
going to fix this this will go through

816
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,720

 

817
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,940

maybe go over another block

818
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:54,950
maybe go over another block
 

819
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,930
maybe go over another block
yeah we'll get rid of the ground we just

820
00:25:59,930 --> 00:25:59,940
yeah we'll get rid of the ground we just
 

821
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,529
yeah we'll get rid of the ground we just
dig straight here to go to that G right

822
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:02,539
dig straight here to go to that G right
 

823
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:10,130
dig straight here to go to that G right
yeah okay and see what I would ideally

824
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:10,140
yeah okay and see what I would ideally
 

825
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,419
yeah okay and see what I would ideally
like to do just a sec let's clear this

826
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:14,429
like to do just a sec let's clear this
 

827
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:21,159
like to do just a sec let's clear this
out I would like this to eventually I

828
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:21,169
out I would like this to eventually I
 

829
00:26:21,169 --> 00:26:23,630
out I would like this to eventually I
showed you it spiraled around downward

830
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:23,640
showed you it spiraled around downward
 

831
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,909
showed you it spiraled around downward
here but there's also another place I

832
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
here but there's also another place I
 

833
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,340
here but there's also another place I
would like it to go to the path over

834
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:28,350
would like it to go to the path over
 

835
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,490
would like it to go to the path over
here this is by our slime pond which

836
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:31,500
here this is by our slime pond which
 

837
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,360
here this is by our slime pond which
just sort of dead ends so we could make

838
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,370
just sort of dead ends so we could make
 

839
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,220
just sort of dead ends so we could make
it go underneath and connect to here too

840
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,230

 

841
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,020

which would be pretty good so I'm going

842
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,030
which would be pretty good so I'm going
 

843
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,270
which would be pretty good so I'm going
to work on that maybe and I'll be right

844
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:44,280
to work on that maybe and I'll be right
 

845
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,690
to work on that maybe and I'll be right
back

846
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:46,700

 

847
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,850

what you doing there guy set your hole

848
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:51,860
what you doing there guy set your hole
 

849
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:57,440
what you doing there guy set your hole
doesn't look very comfortable all right

850
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:57,450
doesn't look very comfortable all right
 

851
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,970
doesn't look very comfortable all right
guys I got that path laid out here and

852
00:26:58,970 --> 00:26:58,980
guys I got that path laid out here and
 

853
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,789
guys I got that path laid out here and
I'm pretty happy with it so I want like

854
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:01,799
I'm pretty happy with it so I want like
 

855
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,590
I'm pretty happy with it so I want like
this Cape feel I might build this up

856
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:03,600
this Cape feel I might build this up
 

857
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,549
this Cape feel I might build this up
even more like have have the overhang

858
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:07,559
even more like have have the overhang
 

859
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,049
even more like have have the overhang
come out sort of diagonally here I guess

860
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:11,059
come out sort of diagonally here I guess
 

861
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:14,450
come out sort of diagonally here I guess
but I'll build on that later and it goes

862
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:14,460
but I'll build on that later and it goes
 

863
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,270
but I'll build on that later and it goes
through here goes down some stairs this

864
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:17,280
through here goes down some stairs this
 

865
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,580
through here goes down some stairs this
this little pad will branch off down to

866
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:19,590
this little pad will branch off down to
 

867
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,299
this little pad will branch off down to
there maybe go this direction too or we

868
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:23,309
there maybe go this direction too or we
 

869
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:27,110
there maybe go this direction too or we
can go straight through here and go

870
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,120
can go straight through here and go
 

871
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,960
can go straight through here and go
around our slime farm this was just a

872
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:29,970
around our slime farm this was just a
 

873
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,149
around our slime farm this was just a
dead end like I said so it's good we

874
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:32,159
dead end like I said so it's good we
 

875
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,539
dead end like I said so it's good we
found a way to make it go somewhere I

876
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:34,549
found a way to make it go somewhere I
 

877
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:36,529
found a way to make it go somewhere I
want to do something with the spider

878
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:36,539
want to do something with the spider
 

879
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:39,390
want to do something with the spider
fun's over this direction

880
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:39,400
fun's over this direction
 

881
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,580
fun's over this direction
we'll probably make the path come here

882
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:41,590
we'll probably make the path come here
 

883
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,020
we'll probably make the path come here
do like I think one of those spider

884
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,030
do like I think one of those spider
 

885
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:50,360
do like I think one of those spider
farms is right above here somewhere

886
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:50,370

 

887
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,870

other than that fixed up the side of the

888
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,880
other than that fixed up the side of the
 

889
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,960
other than that fixed up the side of the
cliff a little bit there oh it works ah

890
00:27:59,960 --> 00:27:59,970
cliff a little bit there oh it works ah
 

891
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,030
cliff a little bit there oh it works ah
grass is still spreading I'll probably

892
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,040
grass is still spreading I'll probably
 

893
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,490
grass is still spreading I'll probably
make some tweaks to it and I sort of

894
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:05,500
make some tweaks to it and I sort of
 

895
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,110
make some tweaks to it and I sort of
polish it up around the bridge areas

896
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,120
polish it up around the bridge areas
 

897
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,180
polish it up around the bridge areas
because it was looking like a little

898
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,190
because it was looking like a little
 

899
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,670
because it was looking like a little
little choppy could see pumpkins and

900
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:11,680
little choppy could see pumpkins and
 

901
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,340
little choppy could see pumpkins and
stuff and yeah I'll probably tweak this

902
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,350
stuff and yeah I'll probably tweak this
 

903
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,550
stuff and yeah I'll probably tweak this
some more as well but it's it's looking

904
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:17,560
some more as well but it's it's looking
 

905
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,730
some more as well but it's it's looking
a lot better I think so yeah this this

906
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:20,740
a lot better I think so yeah this this
 

907
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,980
a lot better I think so yeah this this
is a shortcut here you can go right

908
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:22,990
is a shortcut here you can go right
 

909
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,660
is a shortcut here you can go right
through this is instead of going just

910
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:27,670
through this is instead of going just
 

911
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,270
through this is instead of going just
like this add another path you can take

912
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:30,280
like this add another path you can take
 

913
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,600
like this add another path you can take
and step one the roundabout way up here

914
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:35,610

 

915
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,570

then you'd have to the left down stairs

916
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:38,580
then you'd have to the left down stairs
 

917
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,890
then you'd have to the left down stairs
and it takes you back to the spot ah so

918
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:43,900
and it takes you back to the spot ah so
 

919
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,260
and it takes you back to the spot ah so
pretty happy with this I have picked out

920
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,270
pretty happy with this I have picked out
 

921
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,660
pretty happy with this I have picked out
two comments for today guys this is

922
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:48,670
two comments for today guys this is
 

923
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,360
two comments for today guys this is
going to be the end of our episode first

924
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:51,370
going to be the end of our episode first
 

925
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,020
going to be the end of our episode first
one a etho just food for thought I

926
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,030
one a etho just food for thought I
 

927
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,760
one a etho just food for thought I
remember you saying a while back that

928
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:56,770
remember you saying a while back that
 

929
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,890
remember you saying a while back that
you had so many creative worlds and it

930
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:58,900
you had so many creative worlds and it
 

931
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,330
you had so many creative worlds and it
was hard for you to find in past

932
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:00,340
was hard for you to find in past
 

933
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,050
was hard for you to find in past
projects that is true would you ever

934
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,060
projects that is true would you ever
 

935
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,640
projects that is true would you ever
think about building a creative world

936
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:05,650
think about building a creative world
 

937
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,820
think about building a creative world
specifically for testing stuff out maybe

938
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:08,830
specifically for testing stuff out maybe
 

939
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,760
specifically for testing stuff out maybe
make an ethos lab where you can keep all

940
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:11,770
make an ethos lab where you can keep all
 

941
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,430
make an ethos lab where you can keep all
your projects labeled etc and you can

942
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:14,440
your projects labeled etc and you can
 

943
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,950
your projects labeled etc and you can
put it up for download and we can see

944
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:16,960
put it up for download and we can see
 

945
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,430
put it up for download and we can see
all your projects that is a pretty good

946
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:20,440
all your projects that is a pretty good
 

947
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
all your projects that is a pretty good
idea that's that's sort of like what

948
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:22,450
idea that's that's sort of like what
 

949
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,050
idea that's that's sort of like what
sethbling does he has one main creative

950
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:25,060
sethbling does he has one main creative
 

951
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,730
sethbling does he has one main creative
world where he builds all his stuff and

952
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:26,740
world where he builds all his stuff and
 

953
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,560
world where he builds all his stuff and
then he just moves over whenever he

954
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:31,570
then he just moves over whenever he
 

955
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,670
then he just moves over whenever he
needs more space uh I've considered

956
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:35,680
needs more space uh I've considered
