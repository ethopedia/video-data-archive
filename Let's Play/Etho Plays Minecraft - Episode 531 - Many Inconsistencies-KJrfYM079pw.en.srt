we worked on it a while ago like three

12
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:18,900
we worked on it a while ago like three
 

13
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,570
we worked on it a while ago like three
or four episodes in a row we got tons

14
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:20,580
or four episodes in a row we got tons
 

15
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,120
or four episodes in a row we got tons
done on it we were kind of getting close

16
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,130
done on it we were kind of getting close
 

17
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,890
done on it we were kind of getting close
to the end of the project and it was

18
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:24,900
to the end of the project and it was
 

19
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,679
to the end of the project and it was
getting very difficult and I just I just

20
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:27,689
getting very difficult and I just I just
 

21
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,900
getting very difficult and I just I just
left it I left it outside like

22
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:29,910
left it I left it outside like
 

23
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,700
left it I left it outside like
yesterday's trash I haven't touched it

today we would we would take another

30
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:38,850
today we would we would take another

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,700
today we would we would take another
stab at it was kind of in the mood to

32
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:40,710
stab at it was kind of in the mood to
 

33
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,130
stab at it was kind of in the mood to
work on it again at least until I

34
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:43,140
work on it again at least until I
 

35
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,400
work on it again at least until I
started it's a lot more complicated than

36
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,410
started it's a lot more complicated than
 

37
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,979
started it's a lot more complicated than
I remembered actually uh-huh yeah so if

38
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:48,989
I remembered actually uh-huh yeah so if

you guys don't remember we're trying to

40
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
you guys don't remember we're trying to
 

41
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,180
you guys don't remember we're trying to
rebuild mastermind in Minecraft like

42
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,190
rebuild mastermind in Minecraft like
 

43
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,490
rebuild mastermind in Minecraft like
it's a real-world puzzle game with a

it's a real-world puzzle game with a
 

45
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,740
it's a real-world puzzle game with a
little bit of complicated logic to its

00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:57,750
little bit of complicated logic to its
 

47
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,420
little bit of complicated logic to its
and we're trying to get around a lot of

48
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,430
and we're trying to get around a lot of
 

49
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,650
and we're trying to get around a lot of
that complicated logic using a built in

50
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:03,660
that complicated logic using a built in

mechanic of Minecraft the item stacking

52
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:06,180
mechanic of Minecraft the item stacking
 

53
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,840
mechanic of Minecraft the item stacking
mechanic we can use to do comparisons

54
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:08,850
mechanic we can use to do comparisons

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,910
mechanic we can use to do comparisons
and last time I worked on this we found

56
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:10,920
and last time I worked on this we found
 

57
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,550
and last time I worked on this we found
out something a little odd that kind of

58
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:13,560
out something a little odd that kind of
 

59
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,660
out something a little odd that kind of
broke the whole thing item stacking is

60
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:17,670
broke the whole thing item stacking is
 

61
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,670
broke the whole thing item stacking is
inconsistent the way it works like if we

62
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
inconsistent the way it works like if we
 

63
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,560
inconsistent the way it works like if we
throw that sometimes it'll stick and

64
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:21,570
throw that sometimes it'll stick and
 

65
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,390
throw that sometimes it'll stick and
stay put and sometimes it'll combine and

66
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:23,400
stay put and sometimes it'll combine and
 

67
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,800
stay put and sometimes it'll combine and
keep moving right what we found out is

68
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:27,810
keep moving right what we found out is
 

69
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,679
keep moving right what we found out is
that the item stack with the most items

70
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:30,689
that the item stack with the most items
 

71
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,980
that the item stack with the most items
always is the one that stays and the

72
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:33,990
always is the one that stays and the
 

73
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,289
always is the one that stays and the
other one combines with it so like if

74
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:36,299
other one combines with it so like if
 

75
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,260
other one combines with it so like if
for example we have two items in this

76
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:39,270
for example we have two items in this
 

77
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,840
for example we have two items in this
stack and it combines with that one this

78
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:44,850
stack and it combines with that one this
 

79
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,819
stack and it combines with that one this
is the item stack that's gonna survive

80
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:46,829
is the item stack that's gonna survive
 

81
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,870
is the item stack that's gonna survive
and it'll keep moving aha

82
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
and it'll keep moving aha
 

83
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,569
and it'll keep moving aha
always always always so what we got to

84
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:53,579
always always always so what we got to
 

85
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,630
always always always so what we got to
do with our game here we have a system

86
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
do with our game here we have a system
 

87
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,870
do with our game here we have a system
for generating our answers like the the

88
00:01:59,870 --> 00:01:59,880
for generating our answers like the the
 

89
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,080
for generating our answers like the the
random codon and I hold down uh-huh

little part core up here we got this big

92
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,310
little part core up here we got this big
 

93
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,979
little part core up here we got this big
complicated thing over here so basically

94
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:09,989
complicated thing over here so basically
 

95
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,880
complicated thing over here so basically
when we press this button

96
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:11,890
when we press this button
 

97
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,440
when we press this button
it'll change the random code here and

98
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:14,450
it'll change the random code here and
 

99
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,390
it'll change the random code here and
then it'll shoot out that random code in

100
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
then it'll shoot out that random code in
 

101
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,390
then it'll shoot out that random code in
item form down below here item streams

102
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
item form down below here item streams
 

103
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,020
item form down below here item streams
take it to this area down below oh and

104
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,030
take it to this area down below oh and
 

105
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,250
take it to this area down below oh and
there's our code right but it's only a

106
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:30,260
there's our code right but it's only a
 

107
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,960
there's our code right but it's only a
single item so when we were passing

108
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:31,970
single item so when we were passing
 

109
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,030
single item so when we were passing
another item by here to check if they

110
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,040
another item by here to check if they
 

111
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,310
another item by here to check if they
stack together or not we were having

112
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:36,320
stack together or not we were having
 

113
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,500
stack together or not we were having
issues where sometimes they would stack

114
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:38,510
issues where sometimes they would stack
 

115
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,680
issues where sometimes they would stack
together but they would either stay put

116
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:41,690
together but they would either stay put
 

117
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,000
together but they would either stay put
or they would keep moving

118
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,010
or they would keep moving
 

119
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,190
or they would keep moving
we need those items to stay put though

120
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
we need those items to stay put though
 

121
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,350
we need those items to stay put though
otherwise it's gonna break the logic in

122
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
otherwise it's gonna break the logic in
 

123
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,070
otherwise it's gonna break the logic in
our game so to do that we need to

124
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
our game so to do that we need to
 

125
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,020
our game so to do that we need to
probably send out two items so that that

126
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,030
probably send out two items so that that
 

127
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,940
probably send out two items so that that
stationary stack is bigger than the one

128
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:54,950
stationary stack is bigger than the one
 

129
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,100
stationary stack is bigger than the one
with the motion that the stationary

130
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,110
with the motion that the stationary
 

131
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,380
with the motion that the stationary
stack has two items and the one with the

132
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,390
stack has two items and the one with the
 

133
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,980
stack has two items and the one with the
motion only has one when they combine

134
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:01,990
motion only has one when they combine
 

135
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,920
motion only has one when they combine
the stationary stack will win and the

136
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:05,930
the stationary stack will win and the
 

137
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,240
the stationary stack will win and the
one with the motions gonna lose its

138
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,250
one with the motions gonna lose its
 

139
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,360
one with the motions gonna lose its
motion and they'll just stay put does

140
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,370
motion and they'll just stay put does
 

141
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,800
motion and they'll just stay put does
that make sense it's a little bit a

142
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:11,810
that make sense it's a little bit a
 

143
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,320
that make sense it's a little bit a
little bit weird anyways I've been

144
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,330
little bit weird anyways I've been
 

145
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,940
little bit weird anyways I've been
staring at the redstone here for like

146
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:15,950
staring at the redstone here for like
 

147
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,620
staring at the redstone here for like
fifteen minutes trying to figure out how

148
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:17,630
fifteen minutes trying to figure out how
 

149
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,620
fifteen minutes trying to figure out how
it works again and I think I see what we

150
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:20,630
it works again and I think I see what we
 

151
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,180
it works again and I think I see what we
need to do I think we need to set up a

152
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,190
need to do I think we need to set up a
 

153
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,890
need to do I think we need to set up a
second area branch here so it'll send a

154
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:26,900
second area branch here so it'll send a
 

155
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,330
second area branch here so it'll send a
pulse here it'll shoot out the items

156
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:28,340
pulse here it'll shoot out the items
 

157
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,400
pulse here it'll shoot out the items
right and then a couple seconds later

158
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,410
right and then a couple seconds later
 

159
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,740
right and then a couple seconds later
it'll go down this path and do it again

160
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:32,750
it'll go down this path and do it again
 

161
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,190
it'll go down this path and do it again
so it'll send out two is the plan will

162
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,200
so it'll send out two is the plan will
 

163
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,289
so it'll send out two is the plan will
it make those combined but also we have

164
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:41,299
it make those combined but also we have
 

165
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,390
it make those combined but also we have
a system here for detecting when the

166
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:43,400
a system here for detecting when the
 

167
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,630
a system here for detecting when the
items are in the dropper and it only

168
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
items are in the dropper and it only
 

169
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,100
items are in the dropper and it only
shoots out one we need to change us so

170
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,110
shoots out one we need to change us so
 

171
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,009
shoots out one we need to change us so
it shoots out too for some reason I have

172
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:51,019
it shoots out too for some reason I have
 

173
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,280
it shoots out too for some reason I have
a delay on this like a really long one

174
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,290
a delay on this like a really long one
 

175
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,900
a delay on this like a really long one
I'm not sure if there was a reason for

176
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:55,910
I'm not sure if there was a reason for
 

177
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,259
I'm not sure if there was a reason for
that but it doesn't make sense to me now

178
00:03:58,259 --> 00:03:58,269
that but it doesn't make sense to me now
 

179
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:02,680
that but it doesn't make sense to me now
so I'm going to change that make a

180
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:02,690
so I'm going to change that make a
 

181
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,740
so I'm going to change that make a
monostable here so short pulse let's see

182
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:07,750
monostable here so short pulse let's see
 

183
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,640
monostable here so short pulse let's see
alright so I do I do

184
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:09,650
alright so I do I do
 

185
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,510
alright so I do I do
okay

186
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:13,520

 

187
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,510

well we're gonna change this so it has

188
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:16,520
well we're gonna change this so it has
 

189
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,900
well we're gonna change this so it has
two pulses instead of just one as well I

190
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:18,910
two pulses instead of just one as well I
 

191
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,860
two pulses instead of just one as well I
think we do that fine what's this for

192
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:23,870
think we do that fine what's this for
 

193
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,280
think we do that fine what's this for
been doing anything I guess it's kind of

194
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,290
been doing anything I guess it's kind of
 

195
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,600
been doing anything I guess it's kind of
covering that up so items don't fall out

196
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:28,610
covering that up so items don't fall out
 

197
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,720
covering that up so items don't fall out
okay probably you can do this one and

198
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:34,730
okay probably you can do this one and
 

199
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,180
okay probably you can do this one and
then we'll make this one with the wreath

200
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,190
then we'll make this one with the wreath
 

201
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,550
then we'll make this one with the wreath
or something actually it'll probably

202
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:39,560
or something actually it'll probably
 

203
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,260
or something actually it'll probably
work better if we just do like a

204
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,270
work better if we just do like a
 

205
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,240
work better if we just do like a
continuous clock as long as there's

206
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,250
continuous clock as long as there's
 

207
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,970
continuous clock as long as there's
items in the dropper it'll run instead

208
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:45,980
items in the dropper it'll run instead
 

209
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:52,750
items in the dropper it'll run instead
of like only doing it twice oh yeah that

210
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:52,760
of like only doing it twice oh yeah that
 

211
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,140
of like only doing it twice oh yeah that
should work

212
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,150
should work
 

213
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,460
should work
and then I think we just need to somehow

214
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:57,470
and then I think we just need to somehow
 

215
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,520
and then I think we just need to somehow
send a pulse to this block right here to

216
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:00,530
send a pulse to this block right here to
 

217
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,110
send a pulse to this block right here to
try this let's see if it'll shoot two

218
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:02,120
try this let's see if it'll shoot two
 

219
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:11,610
try this let's see if it'll shoot two
items out now I heard two clicks oh no

220
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:11,620
items out now I heard two clicks oh no
 

221
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,780
items out now I heard two clicks oh no
items though why not let's extend that

222
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:16,790
items though why not let's extend that
 

223
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:23,200
items though why not let's extend that
maybe a now Chapter two awesome okay so

224
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,210
maybe a now Chapter two awesome okay so
 

225
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,270
maybe a now Chapter two awesome okay so
now every time we press this it should

226
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
now every time we press this it should
 

227
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,260
now every time we press this it should
send out q1 - okay cool cool so let's

228
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:32,270
send out q1 - okay cool cool so let's
 

229
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,790
send out q1 - okay cool cool so let's
see if we can shorten the time on this a

230
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:33,800
see if we can shorten the time on this a
 

231
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,730
see if we can shorten the time on this a
little bit so that it'll happen faster

232
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:36,740
little bit so that it'll happen faster
 

233
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,560
little bit so that it'll happen faster
we want everything via short of time as

234
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:38,570
we want everything via short of time as
 

235
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,340
we want everything via short of time as
possible in our game logic oh yeah that

236
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,350
possible in our game logic oh yeah that
 

237
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,080
possible in our game logic oh yeah that
worked okay let's see if in shortened it

238
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,090
worked okay let's see if in shortened it
 

239
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,850
worked okay let's see if in shortened it
any more

240
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:45,860
any more
 

241
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,290
any more
that way we don't have to wait around as

242
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:47,300
that way we don't have to wait around as
 

243
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,870
that way we don't have to wait around as
much when we're playing the game one oh

244
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:51,880
much when we're playing the game one oh
 

245
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,220
much when we're playing the game one oh
I think we found it there okay so this

246
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,230
I think we found it there okay so this
 

247
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,890
I think we found it there okay so this
is the absolute shortest amount of time

248
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:55,900
is the absolute shortest amount of time
 

249
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,850
is the absolute shortest amount of time
where it'll still shoot up - good good

250
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:00,860
where it'll still shoot up - good good
 

251
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,770
where it'll still shoot up - good good
okay so now the other question is is it

252
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:02,780
okay so now the other question is is it
 

253
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,330
okay so now the other question is is it
gonna do that when we generate a new

254
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:04,340
gonna do that when we generate a new
 

255
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,070
gonna do that when we generate a new
code is we also want it to send out -

256
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
code is we also want it to send out -
 

257
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:13,480
code is we also want it to send out -
then new code should right yeah -

258
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:13,490
then new code should right yeah -
 

259
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,000
then new code should right yeah -
oranges - Purple's great

260
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,010

 

261
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,920

all right and let's also just double

262
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:19,930
all right and let's also just double
 

263
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,360
all right and let's also just double
check that they're actually stacking

264
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,370
check that they're actually stacking
 

265
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,560
check that they're actually stacking
together like down below here and not

266
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:25,570
together like down below here and not
 

267
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,790
together like down below here and not
landing like next to each other

268
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
landing like next to each other
 

269
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,880
landing like next to each other
something stupid yeah it looks like

270
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:29,890
something stupid yeah it looks like
 

271
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,770
something stupid yeah it looks like
those are stacked right there's two in a

272
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:31,780
those are stacked right there's two in a
 

273
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,430
those are stacked right there's two in a
stack cool cool so now we know like a

274
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
stack cool cool so now we know like a
 

275
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,930
stack cool cool so now we know like a
purple whenever comes by here it's

276
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:36,940
purple whenever comes by here it's
 

277
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,020
purple whenever comes by here it's
always gonna remain stationary awesome

278
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,030
always gonna remain stationary awesome
 

279
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,790
always gonna remain stationary awesome
alright so that's one big problem solved

280
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:41,800
alright so that's one big problem solved
 

281
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,260
alright so that's one big problem solved
on our game here but don't you guys

282
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,270
on our game here but don't you guys
 

283
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,070
on our game here but don't you guys
worry we got we got lots left I think

284
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,080
worry we got we got lots left I think
 

285
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,690
worry we got we got lots left I think
that updates might have broke a couple

286
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:48,700
that updates might have broke a couple
 

287
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,090
that updates might have broke a couple
things on on the game here like the

288
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:51,100
things on on the game here like the
 

289
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,050
things on on the game here like the
Minecraft updates

290
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:52,060
Minecraft updates
 

291
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,150
Minecraft updates
cuz I'm noticing this I was testing it

292
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
cuz I'm noticing this I was testing it
 

293
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,140
cuz I'm noticing this I was testing it
out and look what happened now a bunch

294
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,150
out and look what happened now a bunch
 

295
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,880
out and look what happened now a bunch
of the concrete breaks instead of

296
00:06:59,880 --> 00:06:59,890
of the concrete breaks instead of
 

297
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,520
of the concrete breaks instead of
falling down like it's supposed to do

298
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:01,530
falling down like it's supposed to do
 

299
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,080
falling down like it's supposed to do
and I wasn't doing that before so I

300
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,090
and I wasn't doing that before so I
 

301
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,770
and I wasn't doing that before so I
think something has changed so probably

302
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:07,780
think something has changed so probably
 

303
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,090
think something has changed so probably
just gotta change the timings on some

304
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:09,100
just gotta change the timings on some
 

305
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,410
just gotta change the timings on some
things here but I gotta figure out what

306
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:10,420
things here but I gotta figure out what
 

307
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,750
things here but I gotta figure out what
now it's looking like an easy fix

308
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:12,760
now it's looking like an easy fix
 

309
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,280
now it's looking like an easy fix
actually so all these pistons are

310
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,290
actually so all these pistons are
 

311
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,870
actually so all these pistons are
tracked and we just have to change a

312
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:15,880
tracked and we just have to change a
 

313
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,900
tracked and we just have to change a
time before they extend again I think we

314
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:18,910
time before they extend again I think we
 

315
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,670
time before they extend again I think we
do that here we'll just add one extra

316
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:20,680
do that here we'll just add one extra
 

317
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,210
do that here we'll just add one extra
tickin that see if that'll do it go back

318
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:24,220
tickin that see if that'll do it go back
 

319
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,080
tickin that see if that'll do it go back
up here through our parkour take a jump

320
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,090
up here through our parkour take a jump
 

321
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,470
up here through our parkour take a jump
ok now let's try it again

322
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:33,480

 

323
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,189

you would jump into the tripwire here

324
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
you would jump into the tripwire here
 

325
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,279
you would jump into the tripwire here
yes awesome okay that worked wait a

326
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:40,289
yes awesome okay that worked wait a
 

327
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:41,719
yes awesome okay that worked wait a
minute this isn't gonna work this will

328
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:41,729
minute this isn't gonna work this will
 

329
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,899
minute this isn't gonna work this will
connect to this that's that's a no-go

330
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:43,909
connect to this that's that's a no-go
 

331
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:48,800
connect to this that's that's a no-go
hmm maybe let's go this way this button

332
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:48,810
hmm maybe let's go this way this button
 

333
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,570
hmm maybe let's go this way this button
this is getting exciting guys we're

334
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:50,580
this is getting exciting guys we're
 

335
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,700
this is getting exciting guys we're
getting to the point now where our games

336
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:52,710
getting to the point now where our games
 

337
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,429
getting to the point now where our games
gonna be like totally non-functional not

338
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:55,439
gonna be like totally non-functional not
 

339
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,029
gonna be like totally non-functional not
working

340
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:56,039
working
 

341
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,540
working
- like semi functional we're almost at

342
00:07:59,540 --> 00:07:59,550
- like semi functional we're almost at
 

343
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,369
- like semi functional we're almost at
that point where we can kind of play it

344
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:01,379
that point where we can kind of play it
 

345
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,950
that point where we can kind of play it
actually which will be cool and then we

346
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:03,960
actually which will be cool and then we
 

347
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,809
actually which will be cool and then we
just keep adding more and more stuff to

348
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:05,819
just keep adding more and more stuff to
 

349
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,700
just keep adding more and more stuff to
it um let's see here let's go up to here

350
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:10,710
it um let's see here let's go up to here
 

351
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,980
it um let's see here let's go up to here
so we have the system with that double

352
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:12,990
so we have the system with that double
 

353
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,279
so we have the system with that double
item thing only because like it might

354
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:16,289
item thing only because like it might
 

355
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:17,929
item thing only because like it might
take longer than five minutes for this

356
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:17,939
take longer than five minutes for this
 

357
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:20,989
take longer than five minutes for this
game to be played and items despawn in

358
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:20,999
game to be played and items despawn in
 

359
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:22,760
game to be played and items despawn in
five minutes so we need to refresh those

360
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:22,770
five minutes so we need to refresh those
 

361
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,969
five minutes so we need to refresh those
somehow and basically every time we put

362
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:25,979
somehow and basically every time we put
 

363
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,010
somehow and basically every time we put
in an answer we need to clear the

364
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,020
in an answer we need to clear the
 

365
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,489
in an answer we need to clear the
previous items and then refresh them so

366
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:31,499
previous items and then refresh them so
 

367
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:33,670
previous items and then refresh them so
we're connecting a wire up to that spot

368
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
we're connecting a wire up to that spot
 

369
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,139
we're connecting a wire up to that spot
that connects up to this tripwire

370
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:36,149
that connects up to this tripwire
 

371
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,949
that connects up to this tripwire
now whenever we activate this tripwire

372
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
now whenever we activate this tripwire
 

373
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,089
now whenever we activate this tripwire
it should send two items down below I

374
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:43,099
it should send two items down below I
 

375
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:50,050
it should send two items down below I
hope your they come cool cool

376
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:50,060

 

377
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,920

everything's good hmm yeah okay so those

378
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:54,930
everything's good hmm yeah okay so those
 

379
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,250
everything's good hmm yeah okay so those
are in place now we also just added

380
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:58,260
are in place now we also just added
 

381
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,889
are in place now we also just added
something to clear those after every

382
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:00,899
something to clear those after every
 

383
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,040
something to clear those after every
every time we put in our answer let's

384
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,050
every time we put in our answer let's
 

385
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,220
every time we put in our answer let's
test that out now so this is the answer

386
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:07,230
test that out now so this is the answer
 

387
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,600
test that out now so this is the answer
key this is what we're trying to guess

388
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:08,610
key this is what we're trying to guess
 

389
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,579
key this is what we're trying to guess
in the game normally you can't see that

390
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:10,589
in the game normally you can't see that
 

391
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:12,319
in the game normally you can't see that
but we know what it is right now because

392
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:12,329
but we know what it is right now because
 

393
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:14,449
but we know what it is right now because
it's it's open there's like a shutter

394
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:14,459
it's it's open there's like a shutter
 

395
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:20,600
it's it's open there's like a shutter
there to close so if we go orange green

396
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:20,610
there to close so if we go orange green
 

397
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,550
there to close so if we go orange green
green we're gonna get one of these right

398
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
green we're gonna get one of these right
 

399
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,439
green we're gonna get one of these right
and one of these lights should turn on

400
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:24,449
and one of these lights should turn on
 

401
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:26,720
and one of these lights should turn on
on the right side here but we're gonna

402
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:26,730
on the right side here but we're gonna
 

403
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,340
on the right side here but we're gonna
hop down here and just see if they clear

404
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,350
hop down here and just see if they clear
 

405
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,060
hop down here and just see if they clear
what we got below there

406
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,070
what we got below there
 

407
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,579
what we got below there
a little quick though Oh twitch wait

408
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:35,589
a little quick though Oh twitch wait
 

409
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:39,150
a little quick though Oh twitch wait
which way over here the pass-by I added

410
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,160
which way over here the pass-by I added
 

411
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,620
which way over here the pass-by I added
that orange acacia a pressure plate

412
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:40,630
that orange acacia a pressure plate
 

413
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,560
that orange acacia a pressure plate
there oh we got extra items again oh so

414
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:46,570
there oh we got extra items again oh so
 

415
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,319
there oh we got extra items again oh so
those items arrived before we wanted

416
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:49,329
those items arrived before we wanted
 

417
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:53,850
those items arrived before we wanted
them to also how is that green why is

418
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:53,860
them to also how is that green why is
 

419
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,019
them to also how is that green why is
this over here I'm gonna have to watch

420
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:55,029
this over here I'm gonna have to watch
 

421
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,990
this over here I'm gonna have to watch
that back oh yeah we might have a

422
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
that back oh yeah we might have a
 

423
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,059
that back oh yeah we might have a
problem here so basically the green

424
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:00,069
problem here so basically the green
 

425
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:03,240
problem here so basically the green
concrete there it was aligned like on

426
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,250
concrete there it was aligned like on
 

427
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,790
concrete there it was aligned like on
the very edge and normally it should

428
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:05,800
the very edge and normally it should
 

429
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,610
the very edge and normally it should
just keep going right but like it ran

430
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:08,620
just keep going right but like it ran
 

431
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,740
just keep going right but like it ran
into the corner of like this block here

432
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:10,750
into the corner of like this block here
 

433
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,170
into the corner of like this block here
for example I don't know does that

434
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:13,180
for example I don't know does that
 

435
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,910
for example I don't know does that
happen always like it ran into this

436
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
happen always like it ran into this
 

437
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,530
happen always like it ran into this
corner here even though it was aligned

438
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:19,540
corner here even though it was aligned
 

439
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,079
corner here even though it was aligned
on the side I think or maybe they had a

440
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,089
on the side I think or maybe they had a
 

441
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,809
on the side I think or maybe they had a
little bit of horizontal momentum cuz I

442
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:24,819
little bit of horizontal momentum cuz I
 

443
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:26,370
little bit of horizontal momentum cuz I
don't think that should happen right

444
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:26,380
don't think that should happen right
 

445
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,689
don't think that should happen right
oh no we'll have to keep our eye open

446
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:30,699
oh no we'll have to keep our eye open
 

447
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:32,280
oh no we'll have to keep our eye open
for that that's probably another problem

448
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,290
for that that's probably another problem
 

449
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,189
for that that's probably another problem
we gotta solve let's go let's go back up

450
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:35,199
we gotta solve let's go let's go back up
 

451
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,829
we gotta solve let's go let's go back up
to here though so we saw those other

452
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
to here though so we saw those other
 

453
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,040
to here though so we saw those other
items arrive before we wanted them to so

454
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,050
items arrive before we wanted them to so
 

455
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,150
items arrive before we wanted them to so
we're gonna just add a little bit

456
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
we're gonna just add a little bit
 

457
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,040
we're gonna just add a little bit
delayed to this wire we just we just add

458
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,050
delayed to this wire we just we just add
 

459
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,040
delayed to this wire we just we just add
it on maybe let's try like four

460
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,050
it on maybe let's try like four
 

461
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,930
it on maybe let's try like four
repeaters or something should be enough

462
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:50,940
repeaters or something should be enough
 

463
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,730
repeaters or something should be enough
okay so after a lot of trial and error I

464
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:53,740
okay so after a lot of trial and error I
 

465
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,170
okay so after a lot of trial and error I
think we might have it now we'll try

466
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:55,180
think we might have it now we'll try
 

467
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,699
think we might have it now we'll try
again here so we got orange yellow

468
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:56,709
again here so we got orange yellow
 

469
00:10:56,709 --> 00:11:00,300
again here so we got orange yellow
orange purple as our code they're in

470
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,310
orange purple as our code they're in
 

471
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:05,040
orange purple as our code they're in
place let's go ahead over here we will

472
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,050
place let's go ahead over here we will
 

473
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,960
place let's go ahead over here we will
do orange we will do do I have any

474
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:09,970
do orange we will do do I have any
 

475
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,220
do orange we will do do I have any
purple on this yeah let's do a purple

476
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,230
purple on this yeah let's do a purple
 

477
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,710
purple on this yeah let's do a purple
here and then for this one let's go

478
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:13,720
here and then for this one let's go
 

479
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,569
here and then for this one let's go
green maybe so three of these should

480
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:15,579
green maybe so three of these should
 

481
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:19,019
green maybe so three of these should
line up the oranges and the purple green

482
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:19,029
line up the oranges and the purple green
 

483
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,370
line up the oranges and the purple green
doesn't line up with the yellow here so

484
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:20,380
doesn't line up with the yellow here so
 

485
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,509
doesn't line up with the yellow here so
we should get three correct answers

486
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
we should get three correct answers
 

487
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,600
we should get three correct answers
three of these lights should turn on but

488
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:24,610
three of these lights should turn on but
 

489
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,790
three of these lights should turn on but
we're gonna flip our switch

490
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:27,800

 

491
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,009

we put our answer we'll go down here and

492
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:30,019
we put our answer we'll go down here and
 

493
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:35,470
we put our answer we'll go down here and
just see what happens yeah everything's

494
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:35,480
just see what happens yeah everything's
 

495
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,520
just see what happens yeah everything's
looking good so far

496
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:36,530
looking good so far
 

497
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,889
looking good so far

minecart comes picks up those items and

500
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:40,249
minecart comes picks up those items and
 

501
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:42,280
minecart comes picks up those items and
then the next batch falls down okay so

502
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,290
then the next batch falls down okay so
 

503
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,689
then the next batch falls down okay so
that's good none of these got picked up

504
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:43,699
that's good none of these got picked up
 

505
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:46,419
that's good none of these got picked up
by the minecart running below they're

506
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:46,429
by the minecart running below they're
 

507
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:47,679
by the minecart running below they're
ready for the next round they got

508
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:47,689
ready for the next round they got
 

509
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:51,460
ready for the next round they got
refreshed cool cool let's go back up

510
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:51,470
refreshed cool cool let's go back up
 

511
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,579
refreshed cool cool let's go back up
here looks like we might even be able to

512
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:54,589
here looks like we might even be able to
 

513
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,579
here looks like we might even be able to
lower the delay a bit it almost took

514
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:57,589
lower the delay a bit it almost took
 

515
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:00,999
lower the delay a bit it almost took
them too long to me to arrive and yeah

516
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:01,009
them too long to me to arrive and yeah
 

517
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:02,739
them too long to me to arrive and yeah
three of the lights turned on so three

518
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:02,749
three of the lights turned on so three
 

519
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:04,389
three of the lights turned on so three
the three answers were correct and it

520
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:04,399
the three answers were correct and it
 

521
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,910
the three answers were correct and it
shows on our scoreboard here so that is

522
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:06,920
shows on our scoreboard here so that is
 

523
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,729
shows on our scoreboard here so that is
great we're making some progress so we

524
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:09,739
great we're making some progress so we
 

525
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:11,439
great we're making some progress so we
added a thing over here that when the

526
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:11,449
added a thing over here that when the
 

527
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:13,419
added a thing over here that when the
items passed by they hit this pressure

528
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:13,429
items passed by they hit this pressure
 

529
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:16,479
items passed by they hit this pressure
plate activate some redstone below there

530
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:16,489
plate activate some redstone below there
 

531
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:19,629
plate activate some redstone below there
and that sends the minecarts to clear

532
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:19,639
and that sends the minecarts to clear
 

533
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,039
and that sends the minecarts to clear
the previous round and then it gets

534
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,049
the previous round and then it gets
 

535
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:23,769
the previous round and then it gets
refreshed so this this is the minecart

536
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:23,779
refreshed so this this is the minecart
 

537
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:26,189
refreshed so this this is the minecart
that picks them up just runs underneath

538
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:26,199
that picks them up just runs underneath
 

539
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,359
that picks them up just runs underneath
I've noticed a little bit of an

540
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:28,369
I've noticed a little bit of an
 

541
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:30,160
I've noticed a little bit of an
inconsistency with the items here like

542
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,170
inconsistency with the items here like
 

543
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,379
inconsistency with the items here like
sometimes they won't go into this hopper

544
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:32,389
sometimes they won't go into this hopper
 

545
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:36,549
sometimes they won't go into this hopper
like they're supposed to yeah they'll do

546
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:36,559
like they're supposed to yeah they'll do
 

547
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,079
like they're supposed to yeah they'll do
that they'll get stuck on the corner or

548
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:38,089
that they'll get stuck on the corner or
 

549
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:39,819
that they'll get stuck on the corner or
something right we we can't have that

550
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:39,829
something right we we can't have that
 

551
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:43,119
something right we we can't have that
happening so what we're gonna do try to

552
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:43,129
happening so what we're gonna do try to
 

553
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,249
happening so what we're gonna do try to
align them using stairs here we'll

554
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:45,259
align them using stairs here we'll
 

555
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:49,389
align them using stairs here we'll
waterlog stairs so now that ensures it's

556
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:49,399
waterlog stairs so now that ensures it's
 

557
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,919
waterlog stairs so now that ensures it's
not gonna go right against the wall and

558
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:50,929
not gonna go right against the wall and
 

559
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:53,489
not gonna go right against the wall and
then we do that same thing on this side

560
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:53,499
then we do that same thing on this side
 

561
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:55,840
then we do that same thing on this side
have another stair lining it this

562
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:55,850
have another stair lining it this
 

563
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,910
have another stair lining it this
direction this will have to be water and

564
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:00,920
direction this will have to be water and
 

565
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,869
direction this will have to be water and
we'll have to have another pressure

566
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:01,879
we'll have to have another pressure
 

567
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,519
we'll have to have another pressure
plate here I guess like so and now I

568
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:06,529
plate here I guess like so and now I
 

569
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:08,559
plate here I guess like so and now I
think they'll always go into the hopper

570
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:08,569
think they'll always go into the hopper
 

571
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:13,299
think they'll always go into the hopper
let's try it with blue they'll always be

572
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:13,309
let's try it with blue they'll always be
 

573
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:20,579
let's try it with blue they'll always be
like center-aligned have enough momentum

574
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:20,589

 

575
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:21,699

mm-hmm

576
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:21,709
mm-hmm
 

577
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:22,989
mm-hmm
yeah you know I don't think the hopper

578
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:22,999
yeah you know I don't think the hopper
 

579
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,999
yeah you know I don't think the hopper
needs to be here though I think we can

580
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:25,009
needs to be here though I think we can
 

581
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:27,410
needs to be here though I think we can
move it forward one block

582
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:27,420
move it forward one block
 

583
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,539
move it forward one block
and that'll fix the problem entirely

584
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:29,549
and that'll fix the problem entirely
 

585
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:33,889
and that'll fix the problem entirely
right let's move it over here alright

586
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:33,899
right let's move it over here alright
 

587
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,119
right let's move it over here alright
let's put this thing through some

588
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:35,129
let's put this thing through some
 

589
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:37,340
let's put this thing through some
testing now we'll see if we can trick it

590
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:37,350
testing now we'll see if we can trick it
 

591
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,449
testing now we'll see if we can trick it
up see if it ever fails you don't want

592
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:41,459
up see if it ever fails you don't want
 

593
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,519
up see if it ever fails you don't want
it to because if it fails I have no idea

594
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:43,529
it to because if it fails I have no idea
 

595
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:44,479
it to because if it fails I have no idea
what's what's wrong

596
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:44,489
what's what's wrong
 

597
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:47,179
what's what's wrong
so for blue none of those are blue so

598
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:47,189
so for blue none of those are blue so
 

599
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:48,979
so for blue none of those are blue so
this should return a zero zero of these

600
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:48,989
this should return a zero zero of these
 

601
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:52,429
this should return a zero zero of these
lights should be on yeah we got zero

602
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:52,439
lights should be on yeah we got zero
 

603
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:55,689
lights should be on yeah we got zero
okay that's good let's go for a yellow

604
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:55,699
okay that's good let's go for a yellow
 

605
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,720
okay that's good let's go for a yellow
and blue blue on all these that'll match

606
00:13:59,720 --> 00:13:59,730
and blue blue on all these that'll match
 

607
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,189
and blue blue on all these that'll match
up with this one that means one of these

608
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
up with this one that means one of these
 

609
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:07,249
up with this one that means one of these
should turn on right please yes please

610
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:07,259
should turn on right please yes please
 

611
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:10,910
should turn on right please yes please
yes please yes come on come on

yes please yes come on come on
we had to hooked up any of this yet

614
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:12,119
we had to hooked up any of this yet
 

615
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,119
we had to hooked up any of this yet
though yeah one turned on okay that's

616
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:14,129
though yeah one turned on okay that's
 

617
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:15,609
though yeah one turned on okay that's
great that's great

618
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:15,619
great that's great
 

619
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:19,900
great that's great
let's go for maybe purple go yellow

620
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:19,910
let's go for maybe purple go yellow
 

621
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,220
let's go for maybe purple go yellow
let's go for some green here just to

622
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:22,230
let's go for some green here just to
 

623
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,789
let's go for some green here just to
change things up a bit you know so two

624
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:25,799
change things up a bit you know so two
 

625
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,249
change things up a bit you know so two
of those should line up the oh no that's

626
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:28,259
of those should line up the oh no that's
 

627
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:30,410
of those should line up the oh no that's
an orange one of them only lines up the

628
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:30,420
an orange one of them only lines up the
 

629
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,799
an orange one of them only lines up the
purple alright it's only one of these

630
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:33,809
purple alright it's only one of these
 

631
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:36,799
purple alright it's only one of these
should turn on only one turned on great

632
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:36,809
should turn on only one turned on great
 

633
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,049
should turn on only one turned on great
great let's try to do what I was what I

634
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:39,059
great let's try to do what I was what I
 

635
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:44,119
great let's try to do what I was what I
wanted there go orange do those are

636
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:44,129
wanted there go orange do those are
 

637
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:47,359
wanted there go orange do those are
right purple and orange on the sides now

638
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:47,369
right purple and orange on the sides now
 

639
00:14:47,369 --> 00:15:00,350
right purple and orange on the sides now
two of these should turn on right no we

640
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:00,360
two of these should turn on right no we
 

641
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:08,569
two of these should turn on right no we
got a problem somewhere dang zero or is

642
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:08,579
got a problem somewhere dang zero or is
 

643
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,879
got a problem somewhere dang zero or is
it one it's zero oh okay so it's the

644
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:10,889
it one it's zero oh okay so it's the
 

645
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:17,259
it one it's zero oh okay so it's the
left side that's broken yeah okay okay

646
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:17,269
left side that's broken yeah okay okay
 

647
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,579
left side that's broken yeah okay okay
interesting why is it broken I don't

648
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:19,589
interesting why is it broken I don't
 

649
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:25,690
interesting why is it broken I don't
know I have no clue somebody help me

650
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:25,700
know I have no clue somebody help me
 

651
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,580
know I have no clue somebody help me
I think um I'm gonna change that I think

652
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:30,590
I think um I'm gonna change that I think
 

653
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,020
I think um I'm gonna change that I think
that little change might have fixed it

654
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,030
that little change might have fixed it
 

655
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,190
that little change might have fixed it
but we're having that green concrete

656
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:33,200
but we're having that green concrete
 

657
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,020
but we're having that green concrete
powder issue again like where it hit the

658
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,030
powder issue again like where it hit the
 

659
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,060
powder issue again like where it hit the
corner there sometimes when it comes out

660
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,070
corner there sometimes when it comes out
 

661
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,470
corner there sometimes when it comes out
of these trapdoors it's not going

662
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
of these trapdoors it's not going
 

663
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,240
of these trapdoors it's not going
perfectly straight it has a little bit

664
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,250
perfectly straight it has a little bit
 

665
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,220
perfectly straight it has a little bit
of sideways momentum and it like goes

666
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,230
of sideways momentum and it like goes
 

667
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,070
of sideways momentum and it like goes
off off to the side or something I think

668
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,080
off off to the side or something I think
 

669
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,780
off off to the side or something I think
that's why it the corner that at one

670
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:46,790
that's why it the corner that at one
 

671
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,450
that's why it the corner that at one
time so in a tri stop that from

672
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:49,460
time so in a tri stop that from
 

673
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,690
time so in a tri stop that from
happening I'm gonna just I'm gonna put

674
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:52,700
happening I'm gonna just I'm gonna put
 

675
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,270
happening I'm gonna just I'm gonna put
last long the sides here so it'll

676
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:55,280
last long the sides here so it'll
 

677
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,490
last long the sides here so it'll
hopefully hit that and then straighten

678
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:57,500
hopefully hit that and then straighten
 

679
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,610
hopefully hit that and then straighten
out it's working it's working oh I'm so

680
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:03,620
out it's working it's working oh I'm so
 

681
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,890
out it's working it's working oh I'm so
happy guys I think we got it now so I've

682
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:05,900
happy guys I think we got it now so I've
 

683
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,450
happy guys I think we got it now so I've
been doing some tests here we did orange

684
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:07,460
been doing some tests here we did orange
 

685
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,670
been doing some tests here we did orange
and three blues only the orange lines up

686
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
and three blues only the orange lines up
 

687
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,840
and three blues only the orange lines up
that's supposed to give us one and it

688
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:10,850
that's supposed to give us one and it
 

689
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,390
that's supposed to give us one and it
did that wasn't working before like the

690
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:13,400
did that wasn't working before like the
 

691
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,920
did that wasn't working before like the
left side was broken now I think I got

692
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:14,930
left side was broken now I think I got
 

693
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,590
left side was broken now I think I got
it fixed second row only the orange

694
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,600
it fixed second row only the orange
 

695
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,320
it fixed second row only the orange
lines up so again we only get one I did

696
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,330
lines up so again we only get one I did
 

697
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,510
lines up so again we only get one I did
the orange and purple again so we should

698
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:22,520
the orange and purple again so we should
 

699
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,490
the orange and purple again so we should
get two and it gave us two like it like

700
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:24,500
get two and it gave us two like it like
 

701
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,830
get two and it gave us two like it like
it's supposed to orange and yellow on

702
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:26,840
it's supposed to orange and yellow on
 

703
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,110
it's supposed to orange and yellow on
this one there's no Reds so again that's

704
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
this one there's no Reds so again that's
 

705
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,400
this one there's no Reds so again that's
two orange and purple here all right so

706
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:33,410
two orange and purple here all right so
 

707
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,870
two orange and purple here all right so
again that gives us two now let's go on

708
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
again that gives us two now let's go on
 

709
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,090
again that gives us two now let's go on
to the threes make sure those are

710
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:37,100
to the threes make sure those are
 

711
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,470
to the threes make sure those are
working off as well and then we'll try a

712
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
working off as well and then we'll try a
 

713
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,800
working off as well and then we'll try a
four I don't know if we implemented the

714
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:41,810
four I don't know if we implemented the
 

715
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,380
four I don't know if we implemented the
wind condition in this or not like it's

716
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,390
wind condition in this or not like it's
 

717
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,760
wind condition in this or not like it's
supposed to win us the game if we get

718
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:45,770
supposed to win us the game if we get
 

719
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,880
supposed to win us the game if we get
all four correct there's like some note

720
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:48,890
all four correct there's like some note
 

721
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,740
all four correct there's like some note
blocks I saw down below and I'm not sure

722
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:50,750
blocks I saw down below and I'm not sure
 

723
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,740
blocks I saw down below and I'm not sure
if that will trigger so this should give

724
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:53,750
if that will trigger so this should give
 

725
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,540
if that will trigger so this should give
us three orange yellow orange orange

726
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:55,550
us three orange yellow orange orange
 

727
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,560
us three orange yellow orange orange
yellow orange matches got three okay

728
00:16:59,560 --> 00:16:59,570
yellow orange matches got three okay
 

729
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,530
yellow orange matches got three okay
let's try another combination here let's

730
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:02,540
let's try another combination here let's
 

731
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,069
let's try another combination here let's
go oh that's not where we play some

732
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:05,079
go oh that's not where we play some
 

733
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:11,110
go oh that's not where we play some
yellow orange or full we'll go blue so

734
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
yellow orange or full we'll go blue so
 

735
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,180
yellow orange or full we'll go blue so
this one won't work and I meant if this

736
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,190
this one won't work and I meant if this
 

737
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,770
this one won't work and I meant if this
works we'll try all four see what

738
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:14,780
works we'll try all four see what
 

739
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,610
works we'll try all four see what
happens

740
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:15,620
happens
 

741
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,269
happens
Oh yellow orange purple yellow orange

742
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:19,279
Oh yellow orange purple yellow orange
 

743
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:25,449
Oh yellow orange purple yellow orange
purple should be three excellent okay

744
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:25,459
purple should be three excellent okay
 

745
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,080
purple should be three excellent okay
let's go for the full thing now I'll

746
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,090
let's go for the full thing now I'll
 

747
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,580
let's go for the full thing now I'll
probably try a few more combinations

748
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:30,590
probably try a few more combinations
 

749
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,409
probably try a few more combinations
off-camera just to make sure the games

750
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:32,419
off-camera just to make sure the games
 

751
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,470
off-camera just to make sure the games
actually working and there's no like

752
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
actually working and there's no like
 

753
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,789
actually working and there's no like
rare case where it doesn't for some

754
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:36,799
rare case where it doesn't for some
 

755
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,279
rare case where it doesn't for some
reason okay so this should be the

756
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:39,289
reason okay so this should be the
 

757
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:41,560
reason okay so this should be the
winning code all four of these should

758
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:41,570
winning code all four of these should
 

759
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:48,279
winning code all four of these should
turn on oh I did hear a note block only

760
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:48,289
turn on oh I did hear a note block only
 

761
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:56,710
turn on oh I did hear a note block only
three turned on hmm got a watch and see

762
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
three turned on hmm got a watch and see
 

763
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,110
three turned on hmm got a watch and see
how many times that pulse is there I

764
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120
how many times that pulse is there I
 

765
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,159
how many times that pulse is there I
think one two three or so it did go four

766
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:03,169
think one two three or so it did go four
 

767
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:08,500
think one two three or so it did go four
times but for some reason for light

768
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:08,510
times but for some reason for light
 

769
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:12,639
times but for some reason for light
didn't light up oh that time they did so

770
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:12,649
didn't light up oh that time they did so
 

771
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:14,500
didn't light up oh that time they did so
a general rule in life like when you're

772
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:14,510
a general rule in life like when you're
 

773
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,930
a general rule in life like when you're
trying to solve a problem you need to be

774
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:16,940
trying to solve a problem you need to be
 

775
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,090
trying to solve a problem you need to be
able to identify or narrow down what the

776
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,100
able to identify or narrow down what the
 

777
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,880
able to identify or narrow down what the
problem actually is so in this case only

778
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:21,890
problem actually is so in this case only
 

779
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,980
problem actually is so in this case only
three lights are turning on when four

780
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:23,990
three lights are turning on when four
 

781
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,470
three lights are turning on when four
should be we don't know though is that a

782
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
should be we don't know though is that a
 

783
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,970
should be we don't know though is that a
problem with the display is that a

784
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:27,980
problem with the display is that a
 

785
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,710
problem with the display is that a
problem with the game logic or maybe

786
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:29,720
problem with the game logic or maybe
 

787
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,409
problem with the game logic or maybe
something else it's not really clear so

788
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:32,419
something else it's not really clear so
 

789
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:34,080
something else it's not really clear so
we got to narrow down the possibilities

790
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,090
we got to narrow down the possibilities
 

791
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,190
we got to narrow down the possibilities
so I've been watching that wire there

792
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,200
so I've been watching that wire there
 

793
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,039
so I've been watching that wire there
that goes up to the display how many

794
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:39,049
that goes up to the display how many
 

795
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:41,500
that goes up to the display how many
times it actually pulses it's

796
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:41,510
times it actually pulses it's
 

797
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,480
times it actually pulses it's
alternating between turning four on and

798
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:43,490
alternating between turning four on and
 

799
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,480
alternating between turning four on and
three on the time only three came on

800
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:46,490
three on the time only three came on
 

801
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,639
three on the time only three came on
though it only pulse three times so

802
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:48,649
though it only pulse three times so
 

803
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:50,110
though it only pulse three times so
that's telling me it's not a problem

804
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,120
that's telling me it's not a problem
 

805
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,320
that's telling me it's not a problem
with this display logic like all these

806
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,330
with this display logic like all these
 

807
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,330
with this display logic like all these
hoppers and stuff over here it's it's

808
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:55,340
hoppers and stuff over here it's it's
 

809
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,130
hoppers and stuff over here it's it's
actually a problem with the game logic

810
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,140
actually a problem with the game logic
 

811
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,610
actually a problem with the game logic
down below so I've identified where the

812
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:00,620
down below so I've identified where the
 

813
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,480
down below so I've identified where the
problem is

814
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:01,490
problem is
 

815
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,850
problem is
I got a traffic out what is wrong with

816
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:03,860
I got a traffic out what is wrong with
 

817
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,180
I got a traffic out what is wrong with
the logic part of the game so this is a

818
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,190
the logic part of the game so this is a
 

819
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,789
the logic part of the game so this is a
lot easier with if I had another person

820
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:09,799
lot easier with if I had another person
 

821
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,909
lot easier with if I had another person
with me but you gotta like trigger it

822
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:12,919
with me but you gotta like trigger it
 

823
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,830
with me but you gotta like trigger it
and run down real fast and record what

824
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:14,840
and run down real fast and record what
 

825
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,539
and run down real fast and record what
happens and then watch it back in slow

826
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:16,549
happens and then watch it back in slow
 

827
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:23,310
happens and then watch it back in slow
motion

828
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:23,320

 

829
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,120

yeah so none of these turned on right

830
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,130
yeah so none of these turned on right
 

831
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,590
yeah so none of these turned on right
hmm I didn't catch it there I'm gonna

832
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
hmm I didn't catch it there I'm gonna
 

833
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,440
hmm I didn't catch it there I'm gonna
have to watch that back let's see how my

834
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:32,450
have to watch that back let's see how my
 

835
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,830
have to watch that back let's see how my
lights actually turned on though oh here

836
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:35,840
lights actually turned on though oh here
 

837
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,920
lights actually turned on though oh here
oh oh okay that was weird it's not an

838
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:41,930
oh oh okay that was weird it's not an
 

839
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,420
oh oh okay that was weird it's not an
answer I was expecting and do it again

840
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:45,430
answer I was expecting and do it again
 

841
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:52,180
answer I was expecting and do it again
bass go fast it's that time only three

842
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,190
bass go fast it's that time only three
 

843
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,590
bass go fast it's that time only three
of these turned on you see that that

844
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
of these turned on you see that that
 

845
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,560
of these turned on you see that that
that last one didn't for some reason so

846
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:56,570
that last one didn't for some reason so
 

847
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,200
that last one didn't for some reason so
I'm guessing only three lights turned on

848
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,210
I'm guessing only three lights turned on
 

849
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,060
I'm guessing only three lights turned on
let's go back up

850
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,070
let's go back up
 

851
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,830
let's go back up
you heard the note block though so it

852
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:02,840
you heard the note block though so it
 

853
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,900
you heard the note block though so it
detected all four of them yeah okay is

854
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:07,910
detected all four of them yeah okay is
 

855
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:19,480
detected all four of them yeah okay is
so weird understand okay okay so that

856
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:19,490
so weird understand okay okay so that
 

857
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,920
so weird understand okay okay so that
looked good to me let's see if all four

858
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:20,930
looked good to me let's see if all four
 

859
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:25,840
looked good to me let's see if all four
turned on you late I'm coming by that's

860
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:25,850
turned on you late I'm coming by that's
 

861
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,560
turned on you late I'm coming by that's
fine yeah all four turned on so that

862
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:29,570
fine yeah all four turned on so that
 

863
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:36,210
fine yeah all four turned on so that
time it looked right let's do it again

864
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:36,220

 

865
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,920

though it looks like something weird now

866
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:40,930

 

867
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,630

yeah no items nothing came out of those

868
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:43,640
yeah no items nothing came out of those
 

869
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,510
yeah no items nothing came out of those
trap doors right I'm not imagining that

870
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
trap doors right I'm not imagining that
 

871
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,740
trap doors right I'm not imagining that
I'm not crazy

872
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:49,750

 

873
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,990

does that mean they are

874
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000

 

875
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,870

[Music]

876
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:55,880
[Music]
 

877
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,150
[Music]
there they are why are they there what

878
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,160
there they are why are they there what
 

879
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,310
there they are why are they there what
happened why why did they get stuck why

880
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:03,320
happened why why did they get stuck why
 

881
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,990
happened why why did they get stuck why
it doesn't make sense

882
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,000
it doesn't make sense
 

883
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,390
it doesn't make sense
so that's what's happening when when

884
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:07,400
so that's what's happening when when
 

885
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,120
so that's what's happening when when
it's zero that's why sometimes it's zero

886
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,130
it's zero that's why sometimes it's zero
 

887
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,920
it's zero that's why sometimes it's zero
they're getting stuck first part of this

888
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:14,930
they're getting stuck first part of this
 

889
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:18,600
they're getting stuck first part of this
for some reason I find they went through

890
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:18,610
for some reason I find they went through
 

891
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,360
for some reason I find they went through
okay I think I know what's going on here

892
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,370
okay I think I know what's going on here
 

893
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,490
okay I think I know what's going on here
so we're using trip wires to activate

894
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:24,500
so we're using trip wires to activate
 

895
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,800
so we're using trip wires to activate
everything right I jump into them they

896
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:26,810
everything right I jump into them they
 

897
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,420
everything right I jump into them they
activate our redstone here it goes

898
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:28,430
activate our redstone here it goes
 

899
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,470
activate our redstone here it goes
straight into all our redstone stuff I I

900
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:32,480
straight into all our redstone stuff I I
 

901
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,870
straight into all our redstone stuff I I
think the problem is I need to clean the

902
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:34,880
think the problem is I need to clean the
 

903
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,120
think the problem is I need to clean the
Redstone you guys know like with

904
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,130
Redstone you guys know like with
 

905
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,950
Redstone you guys know like with
electricity how like if you live in

906
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
electricity how like if you live in
 

907
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,040
electricity how like if you live in
North America you want 60 Hertz of

908
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,050
North America you want 60 Hertz of
 

909
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,020
North America you want 60 Hertz of
electricity in real life right sometimes

910
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,030
electricity in real life right sometimes
 

911
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,390
electricity in real life right sometimes
you might be getting 59 or 61 or

912
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
you might be getting 59 or 61 or
 

913
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,920
you might be getting 59 or 61 or
something though right so they sell

914
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:47,930
something though right so they sell
 

915
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,820
something though right so they sell
these things called like they're called

916
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:51,830
these things called like they're called
 

917
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,620
these things called like they're called
something I don't know electricity

918
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:53,630
something I don't know electricity
 

919
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,420
something I don't know electricity
cleaners right so that it makes sure

920
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:55,430
cleaners right so that it makes sure
 

921
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,030
cleaners right so that it makes sure
it's a perfect 60 Hertz and everything

922
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,040
it's a perfect 60 Hertz and everything
 

923
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,880
it's a perfect 60 Hertz and everything
is like exactly what you want kind of

924
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:00,890
is like exactly what you want kind of
 

925
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,470
is like exactly what you want kind of
same thing with our redstone here trip

926
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
same thing with our redstone here trip
 

927
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,540
same thing with our redstone here trip
wires are pretty nasty to use with

928
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:04,550
wires are pretty nasty to use with
 

929
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,630
wires are pretty nasty to use with
redstone because they are not consistent

930
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:07,640
redstone because they are not consistent
 

931
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,700
redstone because they are not consistent
right sometimes like they'll activate

932
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:09,710
right sometimes like they'll activate
 

933
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,820
right sometimes like they'll activate
longer than other times sometimes you

934
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:12,830
longer than other times sometimes you
 

935
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,260
longer than other times sometimes you
know item will just go right through and

936
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,270
know item will just go right through and
 

937
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:17,020
know item will just go right through and
it doesn't activate you know they're not

938
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,030
it doesn't activate you know they're not
 

939
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,380
it doesn't activate you know they're not
really great in that way so I think

940
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:20,390
really great in that way so I think
 

941
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,360
really great in that way so I think
sometimes it's activating longer than

942
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:22,370
sometimes it's activating longer than
 

943
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,960
sometimes it's activating longer than
other times and that is affecting things

944
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:24,970
other times and that is affecting things
 

945
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,090
other times and that is affecting things
that's why I'm getting inconsistent

946
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:27,100
that's why I'm getting inconsistent
 

947
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,620
that's why I'm getting inconsistent
results here so what I got to do is

948
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:29,630
results here so what I got to do is
 

949
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,410
results here so what I got to do is
clean our redstone so it's a perfect

950
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:32,420
clean our redstone so it's a perfect
 

951
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,550
clean our redstone so it's a perfect
length of pulse every time excellent all

952
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:36,560
length of pulse every time excellent all
 

953
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,930
length of pulse every time excellent all
right so I just added a monostable

954
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:37,940
right so I just added a monostable
 

955
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,520
right so I just added a monostable
