briefly last time basically we're trying
 

37
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,480
briefly last time basically we're trying
to do this biome enhancement thing in

38
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:54,490
to do this biome enhancement thing in
 

39
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,830
to do this biome enhancement thing in
our world where we fill up all these

40
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
our world where we fill up all these
 

41
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,400
our world where we fill up all these
plain empty spaces we have like we got

42
00:00:59,400 --> 00:00:59,410
plain empty spaces we have like we got
 

43
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,020
plain empty spaces we have like we got
that all these empty planes here

44
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,030
that all these empty planes here
 

45
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,060
that all these empty planes here
it's nothing exciting right it's very

46
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,070
it's nothing exciting right it's very

standard we're trying to transform them

48
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:05,410
standard we're trying to transform them
 

49
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,980
standard we're trying to transform them
into something unique that stands out so

50
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:09,990

 

51
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,660

this is just one idea I tried out which

52
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:12,670
this is just one idea I tried out which
 

53
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,730
this is just one idea I tried out which
I think turned out pretty good like all

54
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:14,740
I think turned out pretty good like all
 

55
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,469
I think turned out pretty good like all
we did is we put a path in here I've

56
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
we did is we put a path in here I've
 

57
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,500
we did is we put a path in here I've
lined the sides with leaves and these

58
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:19,510
lined the sides with leaves and these
 

59
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,510
lined the sides with leaves and these
are not custom acacia trees these are

60
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
are not custom acacia trees these are
 

61
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,840
are not custom acacia trees these are
just regular ones but like you never see

62
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:24,850
just regular ones but like you never see
 

63
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,450
just regular ones but like you never see
a forest of acacia trees right they're

64
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:27,460
a forest of acacia trees right they're
 

65
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,880
a forest of acacia trees right they're
just scattered and savanna naturally so

66
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:29,890
just scattered and savanna naturally so
 

67
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,010
just scattered and savanna naturally so
by putting them together like this it

68
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,020
by putting them together like this it
 

69
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,260
by putting them together like this it
kind of is a unique thing just on its

70
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:34,270
kind of is a unique thing just on its
 

71
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,240
kind of is a unique thing just on its
own and what I did is I planted them two

72
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,250
own and what I did is I planted them two
 

73
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,850
own and what I did is I planted them two
blocks up so they're a lot taller than

74
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:38,860
blocks up so they're a lot taller than
 

75
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,639
blocks up so they're a lot taller than
normal and then I replaced the dirt

76
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:41,649
normal and then I replaced the dirt
 

77
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:44,790
normal and then I replaced the dirt
block with logs and overall this is this

78
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:44,800
block with logs and overall this is this
 

79
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,529
block with logs and overall this is this
is the final effects we could decorate

80
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:46,539
is the final effects we could decorate
 

81
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,139
is the final effects we could decorate
this more even but just after like maybe

82
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:49,149
this more even but just after like maybe
 

83
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:52,529
this more even but just after like maybe
10 minutes of working on this it it

84
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:52,539
10 minutes of working on this it it
 

85
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:55,529
10 minutes of working on this it it
feels pretty good right that was I

86
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:55,539
feels pretty good right that was I
 

87
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,930
feels pretty good right that was I
thought that was kind of cool like the

88
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:57,940
thought that was kind of cool like the
 

89
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,310
thought that was kind of cool like the
big problem is if you're doing this

90
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,320
big problem is if you're doing this
 

91
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,749
big problem is if you're doing this
biome enhancement thing is it takes a

92
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:00,759
biome enhancement thing is it takes a
 

93
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,150
biome enhancement thing is it takes a
long time a really long time to fill up

94
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,160
long time a really long time to fill up
 

95
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,690
long time a really long time to fill up
space so that was like a nice quick

96
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:06,700
space so that was like a nice quick
 

97
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,870
space so that was like a nice quick
thing that turned out pretty good I felt

98
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:08,880
thing that turned out pretty good I felt
 

99
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,430
thing that turned out pretty good I felt

anyways let's go over here we have this
lake thing here which I wanted to

102
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:14,380
lake thing here which I wanted to
 

103
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,200
lake thing here which I wanted to
decorate a little bit I saw a really

104
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,210
decorate a little bit I saw a really
 

105
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,450
decorate a little bit I saw a really
cool post on the Minecraft reddit a

106
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:18,460
cool post on the Minecraft reddit a
 

107
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,730
cool post on the Minecraft reddit a
while ago and if you guys didn't see it

108
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:20,740
while ago and if you guys didn't see it
 

109
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,220
while ago and if you guys didn't see it
like this is a neat idea which you might

110
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,230
like this is a neat idea which you might
 

111
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,740
like this is a neat idea which you might
use yourselves someone had the idea of

112
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:25,750
use yourselves someone had the idea of
 

113
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,850
use yourselves someone had the idea of
using glass panes and then you put sea

114
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:29,860
using glass panes and then you put sea
 

115
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,630
using glass panes and then you put sea
pickles on top and it kind of looks like

116
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:33,640
pickles on top and it kind of looks like
 

117
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,080
pickles on top and it kind of looks like
a cat tail right it would be nice if

118
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,090
a cat tail right it would be nice if
 

119
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,550
a cat tail right it would be nice if
they were a bit more Brown the sea

120
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
they were a bit more Brown the sea
 

121
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,400
they were a bit more Brown the sea
pickles but I think the effect kind of

122
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,410
pickles but I think the effect kind of
 

123
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,860
pickles but I think the effect kind of
works I think it's a cool trick I'll

124
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:43,870
works I think it's a cool trick I'll
 

125
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,540
works I think it's a cool trick I'll
probably scatter a few of those in here

126
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:45,550
probably scatter a few of those in here
 

127
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,710
probably scatter a few of those in here
to decorate it a bit more

128
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:47,720
to decorate it a bit more
 

129
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,900
to decorate it a bit more
uh-huh so as you guys can probably tell

130

it stacks like I think it goes up to six
if I remember correctly so then when we

290
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:03,690
if I remember correctly so then when we
 

291
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,659
if I remember correctly so then when we
enter a village it'll spawn in a raid

292
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:05,669
enter a village it'll spawn in a raid
 

293
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:07,629

00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:12,930
Volkers and we can farm them for
 

299
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,560
Volkers and we can farm them for
different materials like emeralds and

300
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,570
different materials like emeralds and
 

301
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,709
different materials like emeralds and
stuff but also when we beat the raid the

get quite a few resources from this we
 

309
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,040
get quite a few resources from this we
can get experience from it overall it's

310
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,050
can get experience from it overall it's

321
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:43,659
people go about surviving and survival
because I was thinking about is like

322
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:43,669
because I was thinking about is like
 

323
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,010
because I was thinking about is like
it's gonna keep shooting me if I kill

324
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:46,020
it's gonna keep shooting me if I kill
 

325
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,350
it's gonna keep shooting me if I kill
them they'll just respawn right they

326
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:48,360
them they'll just respawn right they
 

327
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,909
them they'll just respawn right they
spawn in a pretty big area around this

328
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
spawn in a pretty big area around this
 

329
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,969
spawn in a pretty big area around this
fortress I think maybe our first order

330
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:52,979
fortress I think maybe our first order
 

331
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,270
fortress I think maybe our first order
of business here is going to be setting

332
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,280
of business here is going to be setting
 

333
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,740
of business here is going to be setting
up a beacon

334
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:58,750
up a beacon
 

335
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:11,220
up a beacon
oh no they found me that was Gary that

336
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,230
oh no they found me that was Gary that
 

337
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:22,970
oh no they found me that was Gary that
block oh they're still getting down

338
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:22,980

 

339
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,140

resistance too

340
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,150
resistance too
 

341
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:34,730
resistance too
and we want strength and regen maybe ah

342
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:34,740

 

343
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,680

you know what it's actually not too bad

344
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:37,690
you know what it's actually not too bad
 

345
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,020
you know what it's actually not too bad
now while I was setting up the beacon I

346
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,030
now while I was setting up the beacon I
 

347
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,760
now while I was setting up the beacon I
think a lot of them wandered like

348
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:41,770
think a lot of them wandered like
 

349
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,400
think a lot of them wandered like
halfway down the cliff and they're not

350
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,410
halfway down the cliff and they're not
 

351
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,260
halfway down the cliff and they're not
really spotting up here anymore this is

352
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,270
really spotting up here anymore this is
 

353
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,380
really spotting up here anymore this is
the odd one so that's cool that a little

354
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:49,390
the odd one so that's cool that a little
 

355
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,090
the odd one so that's cool that a little
allow us to work in peace here so the

356
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:51,100
allow us to work in peace here so the
 

357
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,560
allow us to work in peace here so the
plan is oh hello guy hey we got the

358
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:55,570
plan is oh hello guy hey we got the
 

359
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,060
plan is oh hello guy hey we got the
regen in the strings and stuff so if

360
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,070
regen in the strings and stuff so if
 

361
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,680
regen in the strings and stuff so if
they do spawn we can deal with them a

362
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:58,690
they do spawn we can deal with them a
 

363
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,350
they do spawn we can deal with them a
lot easier now but the plan is we're

364
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
lot easier now but the plan is we're
 

365
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,480
lot easier now but the plan is we're
gonna put a villager in the center of

366
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:03,490
gonna put a villager in the center of
 

367
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,550
gonna put a villager in the center of
this tower probably like around here

368
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:05,560
this tower probably like around here
 

369
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,950
this tower probably like around here
protected so that they can't kill them

370
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:07,960
protected so that they can't kill them
 

371
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,220
protected so that they can't kill them
and then but they're attracted to it

372
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,230
and then but they're attracted to it
 

373
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,770
and then but they're attracted to it
like they'll try walk up good to kill it

374
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:13,780
like they'll try walk up good to kill it
 

375
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,630
like they'll try walk up good to kill it
so we're gonna then drop them down a

376
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:15,640
so we're gonna then drop them down a
 

377
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,570
so we're gonna then drop them down a
hole and then all we got to do is build

378
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:18,580
hole and then all we got to do is build
 

379
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,210
hole and then all we got to do is build
a platform so where is the center here

380
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:21,220
a platform so where is the center here
 

381
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,230
a platform so where is the center here
probably right here right I'm going to

382
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:25,240
probably right here right I'm going to
 

383
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,060
probably right here right I'm going to
assume so we'll probably go one two

384
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,070
assume so we'll probably go one two
 

385
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:38,399
assume so we'll probably go one two
three or I fall down uh yeah maybe we'll

386
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,409
three or I fall down uh yeah maybe we'll
 

387
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,529
three or I fall down uh yeah maybe we'll
try 16 blocks out to begin with like

388
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:40,539
try 16 blocks out to begin with like
 

389
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,870
try 16 blocks out to begin with like
from the center here sixteen blocks out

390
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
from the center here sixteen blocks out
 

391
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,930
from the center here sixteen blocks out
all around do like a circle we can go up

392
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:45,940
all around do like a circle we can go up
 

393
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,810
all around do like a circle we can go up
to 35 blocks out from the center point

394
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:48,820
to 35 blocks out from the center point
 

395
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,610
to 35 blocks out from the center point
though but if we want but if we go like

396
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:50,620
though but if we want but if we go like
 

397
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,640
though but if we want but if we go like
all the way to 35 it's gonna take the

398
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:53,650
all the way to 35 it's gonna take the
 

399
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,790
all the way to 35 it's gonna take the
guys a long time to walk up to the

400
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
guys a long time to walk up to the
 

401
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,200
guys a long time to walk up to the
villager here and fall down

402
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,210
villager here and fall down
 

403
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,150
villager here and fall down
right so we don't want them to have a

404
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
right so we don't want them to have a
 

405
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,329
right so we don't want them to have a
long transport time oh that's really

406
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:03,339
long transport time oh that's really
 

407
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:07,350
long transport time oh that's really
hard oh snap okay hope they can get up

408
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
hard oh snap okay hope they can get up
 

409
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,960
hard oh snap okay hope they can get up
here I don't think again earlier they

410
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:09,970
here I don't think again earlier they
 

411
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,630
here I don't think again earlier they
would have already yeah so we'll fill in

412
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
would have already yeah so we'll fill in
 

413
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,220
would have already yeah so we'll fill in
mushroom blocks but my plan is to go

414
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,230
mushroom blocks but my plan is to go
 

415
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,620
mushroom blocks but my plan is to go
vertically instead of horizontally out

416
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:16,630
vertically instead of horizontally out
 

417
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,460
vertically instead of horizontally out
so we'll probably have several layers oh

418
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:19,470
so we'll probably have several layers oh
 

419
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,020
so we'll probably have several layers oh
and you can see they can spawn like when

420
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,030
and you can see they can spawn like when
 

421
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,030
and you can see they can spawn like when
I'm up here even like right next to me

422
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,040
I'm up here even like right next to me
 

423
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,550
I'm up here even like right next to me
which is kind of interesting one thing I

424
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
which is kind of interesting one thing I
 

425
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,800
which is kind of interesting one thing I
did test out that I thought was a little

426
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:28,810
did test out that I thought was a little
 

427
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,390
did test out that I thought was a little
odd or a little different like when

428
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:30,400
odd or a little different like when
 

429
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,640
odd or a little different like when
Guardian farms came out if you had an

430
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:32,650
Guardian farms came out if you had an
 

431
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,880
Guardian farms came out if you had an
old world and you went to the location

432
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:35,890
old world and you went to the location
 

433
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,290
old world and you went to the location
where they should have spawned in your

434
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:37,300
where they should have spawned in your
 

435
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,360
where they should have spawned in your
worlds there would be no temple or

436
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,370
worlds there would be no temple or
 

437
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,000
worlds there would be no temple or
anything they're like no structure but

438
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,010
anything they're like no structure but
 

439
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,710
anything they're like no structure but
if you place water down they would be

440
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:43,720
if you place water down they would be
 

441
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,780
if you place water down they would be
able to spawn in that water but with

442
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:45,790
able to spawn in that water but with
 

443
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,640
able to spawn in that water but with
these outposts I went to a location in

444
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:50,650
these outposts I went to a location in
 

445
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,380
these outposts I went to a location in
my world here where one should have

446
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,390
my world here where one should have
 

447
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,560
my world here where one should have
spawned and like nothing that things

448
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:55,570
spawned and like nothing that things
 

449
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,010
spawned and like nothing that things
spawn there like it never created the

450
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,020
spawn there like it never created the
 

451
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,310
spawn there like it never created the
zone where they can spawn in and there's

452
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
zone where they can spawn in and there's
 

453
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,040
zone where they can spawn in and there's
no structure there either so we have to

454
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,050
no structure there either so we have to
 

455
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,750
no structure there either so we have to
go really far out in our world to find a

456
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:06,760
go really far out in our world to find a
 

457
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,970
go really far out in our world to find a
spot like this where they will actually

458
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:08,980
spot like this where they will actually
 

459
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,620
spot like this where they will actually
spawn in there's none close to our base

460
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:10,630
spawn in there's none close to our base
 

461
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,260
spawn in there's none close to our base
that we can use and with our build here

462
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,270
that we can use and with our build here
 

463
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,390
that we can use and with our build here
I don't have any super detailed plans or

464
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:15,400
I don't have any super detailed plans or
 

465
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,710
I don't have any super detailed plans or
anything like that we're kind of just

466
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
anything like that we're kind of just
 

467
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,070
anything like that we're kind of just
winging it as we go here so we'll do a

468
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,080
winging it as we go here so we'll do a
 

469
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,810
winging it as we go here so we'll do a
couple tests as we're building this to

470
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:21,820
couple tests as we're building this to
 

471
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
couple tests as we're building this to
figure out how we need to change it so

472
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:23,830
figure out how we need to change it so
 

473
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,440
figure out how we need to change it so
we're gonna go away here and come back

474
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,450
we're gonna go away here and come back
 

475
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,650
we're gonna go away here and come back
and just get an idea of how quickly they

476
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:28,660
and just get an idea of how quickly they
 

477
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,990
and just get an idea of how quickly they
will spawn on that platform and how many

478
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,000
will spawn on that platform and how many
 

479
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,990
will spawn on that platform and how many
spawn and then we'll know if we need to

480
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,000
spawn and then we'll know if we need to
 

481
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,730
spawn and then we'll know if we need to
increase the spawning space like maybe

482
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:35,740
increase the spawning space like maybe
 

483
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,150
increase the spawning space like maybe
go 20 or 24 blocks on the circle and

484
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,160
go 20 or 24 blocks on the circle and
 

485
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,500
go 20 or 24 blocks on the circle and
also like you how many layers we

486
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:40,510
also like you how many layers we
 

487
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,850
also like you how many layers we
probably need to do if we come back you

488
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:44,860
probably need to do if we come back you
 

489
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,380
probably need to do if we come back you
can see there's a bunch of them not on

490
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,390
can see there's a bunch of them not on
 

491
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,480
can see there's a bunch of them not on
the platform it's one there one there

492
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:48,490
the platform it's one there one there
 

493
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,210
the platform it's one there one there
one there so if it was a bigger platform

494
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,220
one there so if it was a bigger platform
 

495
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,790
one there so if it was a bigger platform
they would have spawned on it got one

496
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:53,800
they would have spawned on it got one
 

497
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,300
they would have spawned on it got one
guy in the middle I can see guy up there

498
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:57,310
guy in the middle I can see guy up there
 

499
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,390
guy in the middle I can see guy up there
couple guys up there actually

500
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:02,400

 

501
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,570

uh-huh overall I think only one maybe

502
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:06,580
uh-huh overall I think only one maybe
 

503
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,940
uh-huh overall I think only one maybe
two spawned on it actually so that's not

504
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:08,950
two spawned on it actually so that's not
 

505
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,100
two spawned on it actually so that's not
very good that's actually a lot worse

506
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,110
very good that's actually a lot worse
 

507
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,540
very good that's actually a lot worse
than I expected I thought we'd get maybe

508
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:12,550
than I expected I thought we'd get maybe
 

509
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,390
than I expected I thought we'd get maybe
five or something like that let's try it

510
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:15,400
five or something like that let's try it
 

511
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,900
five or something like that let's try it
again coulda got unlucky that time go

512
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:18,910

624
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:53,019

 

625
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:55,210

another thing I kind of recommend is

626
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:55,220
another thing I kind of recommend is
 

627
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,680
another thing I kind of recommend is
like when you build your nether tunnels

628
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:56,690
like when you build your nether tunnels
 

629
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,090
like when you build your nether tunnels
if you can go out the four cardinal

630
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:01,100
if you can go out the four cardinal
 

631
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,270
if you can go out the four cardinal
directions

632
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:03,280

 

633
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,130

and might try to have the tunnels set up

634
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,140
and might try to have the tunnels set up
 

635
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,930
and might try to have the tunnels set up
around 0-0 so like when I'm out here

636
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:08,940
around 0-0 so like when I'm out here
 

637
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,660
around 0-0 so like when I'm out here
let's see if I can find it so I know we

638
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:12,670
let's see if I can find it so I know we
 

639
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,900
let's see if I can find it so I know we

00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,010
enjoyable but yeah hours and hours of
land clearing here I thought when we

800
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,020
land clearing here I thought when we
 

801
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,770
land clearing here I thought when we
first started this they were gonna spawn

802
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:25,780
first started this they were gonna spawn
 

803
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,720
first started this they were gonna spawn
I'm not done you see one guy spawned

804
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:27,730
I'm not done you see one guy spawned
 

805
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,540
I'm not done you see one guy spawned
here but for the main area we got most

806
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:30,550
here but for the main area we got most
 

807
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,580
here but for the main area we got most
of it done here I thought they were only

808
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:32,590
of it done here I thought they were only
 

809
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,040
of it done here I thought they were only
gonna spawn maybe 10 or 15 bucks

810
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,050
gonna spawn maybe 10 or 15 bucks
 

811
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,320
gonna spawn maybe 10 or 15 bucks
underneath the outpost but no it goes

812
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,330
underneath the outpost but no it goes
 

813
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,560
underneath the outpost but no it goes
way down like 25 maybe 30 blocks

814
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:40,570
way down like 25 maybe 30 blocks
 

815
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,370
way down like 25 maybe 30 blocks
underneath finally at this layer here

816
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:44,380
underneath finally at this layer here
 

817
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,800
underneath finally at this layer here
the villagers stop spawning and hostile

818
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:46,810
the villagers stop spawning and hostile
 

819
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:50,280
the villagers stop spawning and hostile
mobs are spawning so above that hostile

820
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,290
mobs are spawning so above that hostile
 

821
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,910
mobs are spawning so above that hostile
mobs did not spawn at all in the area

822
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:52,920
mobs did not spawn at all in the area
 

823
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,190
mobs did not spawn at all in the area
and interesting like interestingly like

824
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,200
and interesting like interestingly like
 

825
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,930
and interesting like interestingly like
one layer above this or maybe it was to

826
00:18:59,930 --> 00:18:59,940
one layer above this or maybe it was to
 

827
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,850
one layer above this or maybe it was to
both hostile mobs and the pillagers

828
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:02,860
both hostile mobs and the pillagers
 

829
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,160
both hostile mobs and the pillagers
could spawn together there's like one

830
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,170
could spawn together there's like one
 

831
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,830
could spawn together there's like one
layer or two of them where that can

832
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:07,840
layer or two of them where that can
 

833
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,500
layer or two of them where that can
happen otherwise they they spawn

834
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:10,510
happen otherwise they they spawn
 

835
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,460
happen otherwise they they spawn
separate from each other

836
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:11,470
separate from each other
 

837
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,070
separate from each other
also while building this I had one

838
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
also while building this I had one
 

839
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,140
also while building this I had one
pretty big observation I didn't realize

840
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,150
pretty big observation I didn't realize
 

841
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,940
pretty big observation I didn't realize
beforehand here but they seem to prefer

842
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:17,950
beforehand here but they seem to prefer
 

843
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,550
beforehand here but they seem to prefer
spawning in dark areas over light areas

844
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:20,560
spawning in dark areas over light areas
 

845
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,530
spawning in dark areas over light areas
even though they can spawn in the light

846
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:22,540
even though they can spawn in the light
 

847
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,090
even though they can spawn in the light
areas like if you if you look in here

848
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:27,100
areas like if you if you look in here
 

849
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,850
areas like if you if you look in here
like they're spawning inside the kind of

850
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:29,860
like they're spawning inside the kind of
 

851
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,800
like they're spawning inside the kind of
looks like an ice cream sandwich I've

852
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:31,810
looks like an ice cream sandwich I've
 

853
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,600
looks like an ice cream sandwich I've
got the two layers of the cookie and the

854
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:33,610
got the two layers of the cookie and the
 

855
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,910
got the two layers of the cookie and the
vanilla in between or whatever they seem

856
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:35,920
vanilla in between or whatever they seem
 

857
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,100
vanilla in between or whatever they seem
to spawn in there a lot faster than they

858
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,110
to spawn in there a lot faster than they
 

859
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,040
to spawn in there a lot faster than they
do on top even though I do see the odd

860
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,050
do on top even though I do see the odd
 

861
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,070
do on top even though I do see the odd
guy on top every so often so and when

862
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
guy on top every so often so and when
 

863
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,270
guy on top every so often so and when
they were spawning down there they

864
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
they were spawning down there they
 

865
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,800
they were spawning down there they
seemed to always spawn closer to the

866
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:46,810
seemed to always spawn closer to the
 

867
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,880
seemed to always spawn closer to the
dark area instead of on the outside so

868
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:49,890
dark area instead of on the outside so
 

869
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,810
dark area instead of on the outside so
darkness seems to be important we'll

870
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:51,820
darkness seems to be important we'll
 

871
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,340
darkness seems to be important we'll
probably want to close off the walls of

872
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:53,350
probably want to close off the walls of
 

873
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,470
probably want to close off the walls of
our farm here you guys want to see a

874
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:55,480
our farm here you guys want to see a
 

875
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,080
our farm here you guys want to see a
cool trick check this out so with the

876
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,090
cool trick check this out so with the
 

877
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,380
cool trick check this out so with the
scaffolding let's start at 60 here we

878
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:01,390
scaffolding let's start at 60 here we
 

879
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,370
scaffolding let's start at 60 here we
can use them to measure vertical height

880
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:04,380
can use them to measure vertical height
 

881
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,350
can use them to measure vertical height
actually which is really cool

882
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:08,360
actually which is really cool
 

883
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,740
actually which is really cool
so we started with 60 we have 32 laps

884
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:11,750
so we started with 60 we have 32 laps
 

885
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,810
so we started with 60 we have 32 laps
that's 28 blocks up huh it's like a

886
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:16,820
that's 28 blocks up huh it's like a
 

887
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,480
that's 28 blocks up huh it's like a
vertical measuring tape it's awesome

888
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,490
vertical measuring tape it's awesome
 

889
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,370
vertical measuring tape it's awesome
good stuff all right so I think the next

890
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:21,380
good stuff all right so I think the next
 

891
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,080
good stuff all right so I think the next
order of business to building our farm

892
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,090
order of business to building our farm
 

893
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,659
order of business to building our farm
here is we're gonna start slapping maybe

894
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:25,669
here is we're gonna start slapping maybe
 

895
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:29,139
here is we're gonna start slapping maybe
let's go for this stone slabs a little

896
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:29,149
let's go for this stone slabs a little
 

897
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:31,389
let's go for this stone slabs a little
bit fancier I'm gonna start slapping the

898
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:31,399
bit fancier I'm gonna start slapping the
 

899
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:32,470
bit fancier I'm gonna start slapping the
top of his mountain here so we've

900
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
top of his mountain here so we've
 

901
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,180
top of his mountain here so we've
cleared out all the land main reason of

902
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:34,190
cleared out all the land main reason of
 

903
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,889
cleared out all the land main reason of
that was I was curious how far they

904
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:35,899
that was I was curious how far they
 

905
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:41,500
that was I was curious how far they
would spawn from the tower but also we

906
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:41,510
would spawn from the tower but also we
 

907
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,659
would spawn from the tower but also we
made sure there's no hidden caves inside

908
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:43,669
made sure there's no hidden caves inside
 

909
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:44,769
made sure there's no hidden caves inside
the mountain there that they're gonna

910
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:44,779
the mountain there that they're gonna
 

911
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,500
the mountain there that they're gonna
spawn and get stuck in or also they were

912
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:47,510
spawn and get stuck in or also they were
 

913
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,060
spawn and get stuck in or also they were
spawning on the side of the hills all

914
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,070
spawning on the side of the hills all
 

915
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,950
spawning on the side of the hills all
over the place so now we don't have to

916
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
over the place so now we don't have to
 

917
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,220
over the place so now we don't have to
worry about that well what we do kind of

918
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,230
worry about that well what we do kind of
 

919
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,169
worry about that well what we do kind of
want to stop now is hostile mobs from

920
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:56,179
want to stop now is hostile mobs from
 

921
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:57,549
want to stop now is hostile mobs from
spawning here because I think that'll

922
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:57,559
spawning here because I think that'll
 

923
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,889
spawning here because I think that'll
take up the mob cap and we want to keep

924
00:20:59,889 --> 00:20:59,899
take up the mob cap and we want to keep
 

925
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:02,970
take up the mob cap and we want to keep
that free for the villagers to spawn oh

926
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:02,980
that free for the villagers to spawn oh
 

927
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,649
that free for the villagers to spawn oh
yeah very good very good so we got it

928
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:05,659
yeah very good very good so we got it
 

929
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:08,110
yeah very good very good so we got it
all slab doubts on top of the hill there

930
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,120
all slab doubts on top of the hill there
 

931
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,000
all slab doubts on top of the hill there
so no more hostile mobs in that dark

932
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,010
so no more hostile mobs in that dark
 

933
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,430
so no more hostile mobs in that dark
spots or during the nighttime it'll be

934
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:12,440
spots or during the nighttime it'll be
 

935
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,700
spots or during the nighttime it'll be
completely empty so that's all good we

936
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:15,710
completely empty so that's all good we
 

937
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,200
completely empty so that's all good we
just got a cut away like part of the

938
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,210
just got a cut away like part of the
 

939
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,720
just got a cut away like part of the
cliff there probably like something like

940
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:19,730
cliff there probably like something like
 

941
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,000
cliff there probably like something like
that to stop them spawning on there

942
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,010
that to stop them spawning on there
 

943
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,860
that to stop them spawning on there
where I see one guy there already but

944
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:23,870
where I see one guy there already but
 

945
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,539
where I see one guy there already but
overall I think we got most of the prep

946
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:25,549
overall I think we got most of the prep
 

947
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:27,299
overall I think we got most of the prep
work ready for this farm and

948
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:27,309
work ready for this farm and
 

949
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:29,379
work ready for this farm and
unfortunately I just checked the time on

950
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:29,389
unfortunately I just checked the time on
 

951
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:33,039
unfortunately I just checked the time on
episode and that's pretty much all we're

952
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:33,049
episode and that's pretty much all we're
 

953
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:35,440
episode and that's pretty much all we're
gonna be doing today I guess I've been

954
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:35,450
gonna be doing today I guess I've been
 

955
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,810
gonna be doing today I guess I've been
at it for a while here but before we

956
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:37,820
at it for a while here but before we
 

957
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,029
at it for a while here but before we
wrap up here I at least want to show you

958
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:40,039
wrap up here I at least want to show you
 

959
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,210
wrap up here I at least want to show you
the idea we're gonna try it with this so

960
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:43,220
the idea we're gonna try it with this so
 

961
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,750
the idea we're gonna try it with this so
we got to get a villager at the center

962
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:46,760
we got to get a villager at the center
 

963
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,930
we got to get a villager at the center
here for each layer right the thing I

964
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:49,940
here for each layer right the thing I
 

965
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,850
here for each layer right the thing I
want to try out which I'm not sure if

966
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:51,860
want to try out which I'm not sure if
 

967
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,490
want to try out which I'm not sure if
it'll work I kind of think it has a good

968
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:54,500
it'll work I kind of think it has a good
 

969
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,220
it'll work I kind of think it has a good
potential to work it might be cool for a

970
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,230
potential to work it might be cool for a
 

971
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,120
potential to work it might be cool for a
lot of mob farms is I'm gonna probably

972
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,130
lot of mob farms is I'm gonna probably
 

973
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,139
lot of mob farms is I'm gonna probably
set up trap doors in the center

974
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:04,149
set up trap doors in the center
 

975
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:08,440
set up trap doors in the center
OOP not there something like actually

976
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:08,450
OOP not there something like actually
 

977
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,149
OOP not there something like actually
for the top one we got to do differently

978
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
for the top one we got to do differently
 

979
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,159
for the top one we got to do differently
I think we're gonna do it like this yeah

980
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:15,169
I think we're gonna do it like this yeah
 

981
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,529
I think we're gonna do it like this yeah
we'll make them come out like this and

982
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:17,539
we'll make them come out like this and
 

983
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:22,640
we'll make them come out like this and
then like that I think is the plan

984
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:22,650
then like that I think is the plan
 

985
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,400
then like that I think is the plan
there will be water like a water column

986
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,410
there will be water like a water column
 

987
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,250
there will be water like a water column
in the center

988
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:27,260
in the center
 

989
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,750
in the center
so those trapdoors hold it in place this

990
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
so those trapdoors hold it in place this
 

991
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,730
so those trapdoors hold it in place this
will we want to keep this open so that

992
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:31,740
will we want to keep this open so that
 

993
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,830
will we want to keep this open so that
the villagers can see the villager in

994
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
the villagers can see the villager in
 

995
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,600
the villagers can see the villager in
the centre here he's gonna be in the

996
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:35,610
the centre here he's gonna be in the
 

997
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,440
the centre here he's gonna be in the
water and we're gonna set bubble streams

998
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:39,450
water and we're gonna set bubble streams
 

999
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,990
water and we're gonna set bubble streams
so that he'll like float up and down

1000
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
so that he'll like float up and down
 

1001
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,720
so that he'll like float up and down
through the water so that we don't have

1002
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:44,730
through the water so that we don't have
 

1003
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,930
through the water so that we don't have
to have a villager on every level and

1004
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:46,940
to have a villager on every level and
 

1005
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,340
to have a villager on every level and
because he's in a bubble stream he won't

1006
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:49,350
because he's in a bubble stream he won't
 

1007
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:53,030
because he's in a bubble stream he won't
suffocate either I'm pretty sure the

1008
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,040
suffocate either I'm pretty sure the
 

1009
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,890
suffocate either I'm pretty sure the
thing I'm concerned about though is as

1010
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:54,900
thing I'm concerned about though is as
 

1011
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,570
thing I'm concerned about though is as
he passes up here there's this brief

1012
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:56,580
he passes up here there's this brief
 

1013
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,220
he passes up here there's this brief
opportunity where they can shoot them

1014
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,230
opportunity where they can shoot them
 

1015
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,240
opportunity where they can shoot them
and kill them but I think there it takes

1016
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,250
and kill them but I think there it takes
 

1017
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,430
and kill them but I think there it takes
like a second at least so I think in

1018
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,440
like a second at least so I think in
 

1019
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,020
like a second at least so I think in
that time they'll see him but he's gone

1020
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,030
that time they'll see him but he's gone
 

1021
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,530
that time they'll see him but he's gone
by the time they react and then what we

1022
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:09,540
by the time they react and then what we
 

1023
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,060
by the time they react and then what we
got to do probably is like remove some

1024
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,070
got to do probably is like remove some
 

1025
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,770
got to do probably is like remove some
of the ground here I think if we have a

1026
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:15,780
of the ground here I think if we have a
 

1027
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,460
of the ground here I think if we have a
trap door here and one here they will

1028
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:19,470
trap door here and one here they will
 

1029
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,440
trap door here and one here they will
walk off there as they try to get them

1030
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:21,450
walk off there as they try to get them
 

1031
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,870
walk off there as they try to get them
but we won't know until we can test it

1032
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:23,880
but we won't know until we can test it
 

1033
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,430
but we won't know until we can test it
out because I haven't done that yet

1034
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
out because I haven't done that yet
 

1035
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,670
out because I haven't done that yet
like I said we're winging the farm but

1036
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:28,680
like I said we're winging the farm but
 

1037
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,840
like I said we're winging the farm but
hopefully that works I think that'll be

1038
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:29,850
hopefully that works I think that'll be
 

1039
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,520
hopefully that works I think that'll be
a cool idea and you can use that for

1040
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:31,530
a cool idea and you can use that for
 

1041
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,620
a cool idea and you can use that for
assuming it does work you could use that

1042
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:33,630
assuming it does work you could use that
 

1043
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:38,270
assuming it does work you could use that
for other firms like with wolves and

1044
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:38,280
for other firms like with wolves and
 

1045
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,800
for other firms like with wolves and
ocelots like if you're doing in a

1046
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:39,810
ocelots like if you're doing in a
 

1047
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,480
ocelots like if you're doing in a
hostile mob firm you know that might be

1048
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:41,490
hostile mob firm you know that might be
 

1049
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,120
hostile mob firm you know that might be
a cool thing like the one we have

1050
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,130
a cool thing like the one we have
 

1051
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:48,170
a cool thing like the one we have
underneath my sand pyramid it's got like

1052
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:48,180
underneath my sand pyramid it's got like
 

1053
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,040
underneath my sand pyramid it's got like
over 20 dogs and cats in right that's a

1054
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,050
over 20 dogs and cats in right that's a
 

1055
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,380
over 20 dogs and cats in right that's a
real pain to set up it's nice when it's

1056
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:54,390
real pain to set up it's nice when it's
 

1057
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,850
real pain to set up it's nice when it's
all done but like if you could get away

1058
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:55,860
all done but like if you could get away
 

1059
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,640
all done but like if you could get away
with just using one wolf and one cats or

1060
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:58,650
with just using one wolf and one cats or
 

1061
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,920
with just using one wolf and one cats or
one villager for this farm it's a lot

1062
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:00,930
one villager for this farm it's a lot
 

1063
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:04,610
one villager for this farm it's a lot
easier in survival to build that but

1064
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:04,620
easier in survival to build that but
 

1065
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,260
easier in survival to build that but
yeah anyways guys I think we're gonna

1066
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:06,270
yeah anyways guys I think we're gonna
 

1067
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,790
yeah anyways guys I think we're gonna
have to wrap up the episode here for

1068
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:07,800
have to wrap up the episode here for
 

1069
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,520
have to wrap up the episode here for
today and we're gonna do it's talking

1070
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:10,530
today and we're gonna do it's talking
 

1071
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,330
today and we're gonna do it's talking
about of course audio problems it will

1072
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:14,340
about of course audio problems it will
 

1073
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,620
about of course audio problems it will
probably keep doing that until I get

1074
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:15,630
probably keep doing that until I get
 

1075
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,930
probably keep doing that until I get
them rights but yeah I want to thank you

1076
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:17,940
them rights but yeah I want to thank you
 

1077
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,090
them rights but yeah I want to thank you
again for the feedback on the last one I

1078
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,100
again for the feedback on the last one I
 

1079
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,370
again for the feedback on the last one I
think we did get a few of the issues

1080
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:22,380
think we did get a few of the issues
 

1081
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,560
think we did get a few of the issues
solved thanks to what she told me but

1082
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:24,570
solved thanks to what she told me but
 

1083
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,360
solved thanks to what she told me but
again let me know if you hear static or

1084
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:26,370
again let me know if you hear static or
 

1085
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,260
again let me know if you hear static or
audio artifacts or anything weird I

1086
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,270
audio artifacts or anything weird I
 

1087
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,180
audio artifacts or anything weird I
don't think I have the best sense of

1088
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,190
don't think I have the best sense of
 

1089
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,590
don't think I have the best sense of
that like usually I'm pretty good at

1090
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
that like usually I'm pretty good at
 

1091
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,810
that like usually I'm pretty good at
picking up subtle new

1092
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:35,820
picking up subtle new
 

1093
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,180
picking up subtle new
bounces or wheel details and things but

1094
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,190
bounces or wheel details and things but
 

1095
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,820
bounces or wheel details and things but
when it comes to audio not so much I

1096
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:40,830
when it comes to audio not so much I
 

1097
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,660
when it comes to audio not so much I
find so it's really hard to like figure

1098
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:44,670
find so it's really hard to like figure
 

1099
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,720
find so it's really hard to like figure
out what sounds better and what doesn't

1100
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:46,730
out what sounds better and what doesn't
 

1101
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,340
out what sounds better and what doesn't
so your feedback is much appreciated I

1102
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:49,350
so your feedback is much appreciated I
 

1103
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,810
so your feedback is much appreciated I
guess let's get to the calm in the day

1104
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:50,820
guess let's get to the calm in the day
 

1105
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,310
guess let's get to the calm in the day
here says so the 80/20 35 that's the

1106
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:55,320
here says so the 80/20 35 that's the
 

1107
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,760
here says so the 80/20 35 that's the
microphone I'm using is a condenser XLR

1108
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:58,770
microphone I'm using is a condenser XLR
 

1109
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,190
microphone I'm using is a condenser XLR

microphone so it's not USB it's a
 

1111
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,890

special audio cable that needs proper

1112
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:03,900
special audio cable that needs proper
 

1113
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,720
special audio cable that needs proper
phantom power to power it's an analog

1114
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:07,730
phantom power to power it's an analog
 

1115
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,630
phantom power to power it's an analog
signal you need to hook it up to a USB

1116
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:11,640
signal you need to hook it up to a USB
 

1117
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,490

audio interface set and supply the

1118
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:13,500
audio interface set and supply the
 

1119
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,070
audio interface set and supply the
necessary voltage to it so that audio

1120
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080
necessary voltage to it so that audio
 

1121
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,980
necessary voltage to it so that audio
interface converts it from an art analog

single into a digital one and it

1124
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,270
single into a digital one and it
 

1125
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,970
single into a digital one and it
connects the computer with a USB cable

1126
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:22,980
connects the computer with a USB cable
 

1127
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,310
connects the computer with a USB cable
then otherwise it will not work properly

1128
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,320
then otherwise it will not work properly
 

1129
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,560
then otherwise it will not work properly
and yeah I have done that I didn't

1130
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:27,570
and yeah I have done that I didn't
 

1131
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,570
and yeah I have done that I didn't
clarify that on the last episode I have

1132
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:29,580
clarify that on the last episode I have
 

1133
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,300
clarify that on the last episode I have
the focusrite scarlett solo I think

1134
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,310
the focusrite scarlett solo I think
 

1135
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:36,110
the focusrite scarlett solo I think
second generation audio interface with

1136
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,120
second generation audio interface with
 

1137
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,670
second generation audio interface with
phantom power enabled so that shouldn't

1138
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:37,680
phantom power enabled so that shouldn't
 

1139
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,560
phantom power enabled so that shouldn't
be an issue but even with phantom power

1140
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:39,570
be an issue but even with phantom power
 

1141
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,600
be an issue but even with phantom power
enabled I'm finding a really hard to get

1142
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:41,610
enabled I'm finding a really hard to get
 

1143
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,820
enabled I'm finding a really hard to get
enough gain on the microphone enough

1144
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:43,830
enough gain on the microphone enough
 

1145
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,940
enough gain on the microphone enough
volume I got to pretty much crank to the

1146
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:46,950
volume I got to pretty much crank to the
 

1147
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,690
volume I got to pretty much crank to the
maximum on the audio interface

1148
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:49,700
maximum on the audio interface
 

1149
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,740
maximum on the audio interface
thankfully I was able to get rid of all

1150
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:51,750
thankfully I was able to get rid of all
 

1151
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,600
thankfully I was able to get rid of all
the software games I was using which I

1152
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:53,610
the software games I was using which I
 

1153
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,480
the software games I was using which I
think was distorting in the audio a bit

1154
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:55,490
think was distorting in the audio a bit
 

1155
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,570
think was distorting in the audio a bit
but yeah maybe what we'll do let's hop

1156
00:25:59,570 --> 00:25:59,580
but yeah maybe what we'll do let's hop
 

1157
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,550
but yeah maybe what we'll do let's hop
over to the equalizer and I'll show you

1158
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:01,560
over to the equalizer and I'll show you
 

1159
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,260
over to the equalizer and I'll show you
guys what that how that works

1160
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,270
guys what that how that works
 

1161
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,270
guys what that how that works
uh-huh yeah so check this out this is

1162
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:05,280
uh-huh yeah so check this out this is
 

1163
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,610
uh-huh yeah so check this out this is
pretty cool this is the equalizer I'm

1164
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:07,620
pretty cool this is the equalizer I'm
 

1165
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,620
pretty cool this is the equalizer I'm
using and hassun talking here you can

1166
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:09,630
using and hassun talking here you can
 

1167
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,970
using and hassun talking here you can
actually see the wave shape of my voice

1168
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:12,980
actually see the wave shape of my voice
 

1169
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,050
actually see the wave shape of my voice
at the top here you can see the

1170
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:15,060
at the top here you can see the
 

1171
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,820
at the top here you can see the
different categories of the waves so we

1172
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:16,830
different categories of the waves so we
 

1173
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,490
different categories of the waves so we
got the sub bass on the left then it

1174
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:19,500
got the sub bass on the left then it
 

1175
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,210
got the sub bass on the left then it
goes bass low mid mid eye mid and treble

1176
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:23,220
goes bass low mid mid eye mid and treble
 

1177
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,790
goes bass low mid mid eye mid and treble
on the far right that's like the really

1178
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:25,800
on the far right that's like the really
 

1179
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,840
on the far right that's like the really
high-pitched sounds like s's you see

1180
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:29,850
high-pitched sounds like s's you see
 

1181
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,280
high-pitched sounds like s's you see
when I do that it goes mostly into the

1182
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,290
when I do that it goes mostly into the
 

1183
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:37,610
when I do that it goes mostly into the
treble or also apps while sub bass is

1184
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:37,620
treble or also apps while sub bass is
 

1185
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,730
treble or also apps while sub bass is
like whenever I do the p's you know

1186
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:42,740
like whenever I do the p's you know
 

1187
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,010
like whenever I do the p's you know
but generally when I'm talking its base

1188
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:45,020
but generally when I'm talking its base
 

1189
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,149
but generally when I'm talking its base
to low/mid not a lot of mid and like

1190
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:49,159
to low/mid not a lot of mid and like
 

1191
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:51,340
to low/mid not a lot of mid and like
very little high mid so this is what the

1192
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:51,350
very little high mid so this is what the
 

1193
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,100
very little high mid so this is what the
equalizer settings I played around with

1194
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,110
equalizer settings I played around with
 

1195
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,399
equalizer settings I played around with
what I figured sounded the best to me

1196
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:56,409
what I figured sounded the best to me
 

1197
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:58,600
what I figured sounded the best to me
I'm gonna start turning them on here and

1198
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:58,610
I'm gonna start turning them on here and
 

1199
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,060
I'm gonna start turning them on here and
it should affect my voice as I enable

1200
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,070
it should affect my voice as I enable
 

1201
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,659
it should affect my voice as I enable
them so right now I've got minus 5 DB on

1202
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:04,669
them so right now I've got minus 5 DB on
 

1203
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:07,899
them so right now I've got minus 5 DB on
the sub bass then we turn this one I got

1204
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:07,909
the sub bass then we turn this one I got
 

1205
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:14,169
the sub bass then we turn this one I got
minus 2.8 DB or decibels on the bass and

1206
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:14,179
minus 2.8 DB or decibels on the bass and
 

1207
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:17,500
minus 2.8 DB or decibels on the bass and
then if we go to number 3 that'll go

1208
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:17,510
then if we go to number 3 that'll go
 

1209
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,620
then if we go to number 3 that'll go
minus 3.5 DB on the low mid so the kind

1210
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:20,630
minus 3.5 DB on the low mid so the kind
 

1211
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,740
minus 3.5 DB on the low mid so the kind
of yellowish color here at 4 is the mid

1212
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:23,750
of yellowish color here at 4 is the mid
 

1213
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,159
of yellowish color here at 4 is the mid
that we got that at minus 4 DB and then

1214
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:27,169
that we got that at minus 4 DB and then
 

1215
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:30,310
that we got that at minus 4 DB and then
for 5 I left at 0 & 6

1216
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,320
for 5 I left at 0 & 6
 

1217
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,100
for 5 I left at 0 & 6
I set the minus 2 DB that's the the

1218
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,110
I set the minus 2 DB that's the the
 

1219
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,960
I set the minus 2 DB that's the the
treble the high-pitched sounds because I

1220
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:34,970
treble the high-pitched sounds because I
 

1221
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,110
treble the high-pitched sounds because I
noticed when I was doing s's it kind of

1222
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,120
noticed when I was doing s's it kind of
 

1223
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,820
noticed when I was doing s's it kind of
lingered a lot you know they were over

1224
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:39,830
lingered a lot you know they were over
 

1225
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,310
lingered a lot you know they were over
pronounced I think by lowering that it

1226
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:42,320
pronounced I think by lowering that it
 

1227
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,500
pronounced I think by lowering that it
helps it out so overall I felt this was

1228
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:44,510
helps it out so overall I felt this was
 

1229
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,330
helps it out so overall I felt this was
the best I could get with the equalizer

1230
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:46,340
the best I could get with the equalizer
 

1231
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,909
the best I could get with the equalizer
it removes a lot of the bass from my my

1232
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:48,919
it removes a lot of the bass from my my
 

1233
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:52,060
it removes a lot of the bass from my my
voice it makes it a lot more punchy but

1234
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,070
voice it makes it a lot more punchy but
 

1235
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,180
voice it makes it a lot more punchy but
I'm not sure really if I should change

1236
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,190
I'm not sure really if I should change
 

1237
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,450
I'm not sure really if I should change
any more of this I maybe raised the this

1238
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:58,460
any more of this I maybe raised the this
 

1239
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,940
any more of this I maybe raised the this
step a little bit more oh I don't know

1240
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:00,950
step a little bit more oh I don't know
 

1241
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,970
step a little bit more oh I don't know
if you guys can see that let's go let's

1242
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:03,980
if you guys can see that let's go let's
 

1243
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,909
if you guys can see that let's go let's
maybe set this I had it at 5 before you

1244
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:06,919
maybe set this I had it at 5 before you
 

1245
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,320
maybe set this I had it at 5 before you
guys said it sounds like a tin can

1246
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,330
guys said it sounds like a tin can
 

1247
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,159
guys said it sounds like a tin can
microphone so maybe we go up to 2 or

1248
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:12,169
microphone so maybe we go up to 2 or
 

1249
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:17,580
microphone so maybe we go up to 2 or
something and then this I don't know I

1250
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:17,590
something and then this I don't know I
 

1251
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,950
something and then this I don't know I
feel like I feel like I need to change

1252
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:20,960
feel like I feel like I need to change
 

1253
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,600
feel like I feel like I need to change
something though it's not quite right so

1254
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:22,610
something though it's not quite right so
 

1255
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,130

maybe if you guys got any feedback on

1256
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:24,140
maybe if you guys got any feedback on
 

1257
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,560
maybe if you guys got any feedback on
that let me know and yeah those are the

1258

that let me know and yeah those are the
 

1259
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,330
that let me know and yeah those are the
same settings I used in the intro when

1260
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:28,340
same settings I used in the intro when
 

1261
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,310
same settings I used in the intro when
we were around the lake there and at the
