switch over to amplified because it is

18
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:34,739

you know what we're gonna see Wow that
 

27
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,810
you know what we're gonna see Wow that
is my amplified border over here and the

28
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:53,820
is my amplified border over here and the
 

29
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,910
is my amplified border over here and the
reason we're out here is because I was

30
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
reason we're out here is because I was
 

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,400
reason we're out here is because I was
looking for some of this dye rights

so I had to go to new terrain

36
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
so I had to go to new terrain
 

37
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,810
so I had to go to new terrain
I even and our amplified bass there's

38
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:05,820
I even and our amplified bass there's
 

39
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,480
I even and our amplified bass there's
none there so I pretty much have to go

40
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:08,490
none there so I pretty much have to go
 

41
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,899
none there so I pretty much have to go
somewhere new to find it just sit yeah

42
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:11,909
somewhere new to find it just sit yeah
 

43
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,140

okay to give you a reference so we're

44
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,150
okay to give you a reference so we're
 

45
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,880
okay to give you a reference so we're
actually pretty close to the main base

46
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:16,890
actually pretty close to the main base
 

47
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,080
actually pretty close to the main base
the library is about 300 blocks or so

48
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,090
the library is about 300 blocks or so
 

49
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,020
the library is about 300 blocks or so
that way so it's not too far oh yeah and

50
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,030
that way so it's not too far oh yeah and
 

51
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,760
that way so it's not too far oh yeah and
let me show you the difference in

52
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:25,770
let me show you the difference in
 

53
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,550
let me show you the difference in
generation here - real quick so in my

54
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
generation here - real quick so in my
 

55
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,050
generation here - real quick so in my
world I have like four or five different

56
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:30,060
world I have like four or five different
 

57
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,420
world I have like four or five different
periods of terrain generation we have

58
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:32,430
periods of terrain generation we have
 

59
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,230
periods of terrain generation we have
this old stuff here the desert this is a

60
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
this old stuff here the desert this is a
 

61
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,749
this old stuff here the desert this is a
good view of it all well actually no

because I think jungles came out then
 

65
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,130
because I think jungles came out then
and I got chunk borders from the jungle

00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:43,140
and I got chunk borders from the jungle
 

67
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,889
and I got chunk borders from the jungle
biome then later we got the terrain

68
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:45,899
biome then later we got the terrain
 

69
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,050
biome then later we got the terrain
update with the mega taiga and and that

70
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:48,060
update with the mega taiga and and that
 

71
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,429
update with the mega taiga and and that
kind of stuff and that's what this is

72
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
kind of stuff and that's what this is
 

73
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,310
kind of stuff and that's what this is
here and then I switch my world to

74
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
here and then I switch my world to
 

75
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,630
here and then I switch my world to
amplified and then later even after that

76
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
amplified and then later even after that
 

77
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,510
amplified and then later even after that
we got the new 1.8 blocks to die right

78
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
we got the new 1.8 blocks to die right
 

79
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,840
we got the new 1.8 blocks to die right
and stuff so at the amplified base I got

80
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:02,850
and stuff so at the amplified base I got
 

81
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,910
and stuff so at the amplified base I got
none of these new blocks I had to come

82
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:04,920
none of these new blocks I had to come
 

83
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,900
none of these new blocks I had to come
here to get it but anyway I'm rambling I

87
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,589
am rambling I'm going to be doing some
speed mining over here to get the die

88
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:12,599

let's go down I just set up the beacon

92
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
let's go down I just set up the beacon
 

93
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,600
let's go down I just set up the beacon
again over here and I guess I want to

94
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:18,610
again over here and I guess I want to
 

95
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,309
again over here and I guess I want to
dig to the rights to get it so I'm going

96
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:23,319
dig to the rights to get it so I'm going
 

97
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,479
dig to the rights to get it so I'm going
to get some of this and then we will

98
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:26,489
to get some of this and then we will
 

99
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:28,710
to get some of this and then we will

have ever seen we got this this section
 

119
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:56,610
have ever seen we got this this section
here and this and then it dead-ends is

120
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:56,620
here and this and then it dead-ends is
 

121
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,400
here and this and then it dead-ends is
it that crazy I wonder if there's

there's actually some redstone in the

224
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,430
there's actually some redstone in the
 

225
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,490
there's actually some redstone in the
front like underneath here in front of

226
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:39,500
front like underneath here in front of
 

227
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,810
front like underneath here in front of
the droppers which in relation to this

228
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:43,820
the droppers which in relation to this
 

229
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,750
the droppers which in relation to this
lets us go up and check that I think

230
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:46,760
lets us go up and check that I think
 

231
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,670
lets us go up and check that I think
it's visible though that spot yeah these

232
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
it's visible though that spot yeah these
 

233
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,500
it's visible though that spot yeah these
are the droppers here so one block in

234
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:53,510
are the droppers here so one block in
 

235
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,200
are the droppers here so one block in
front like like these blocks here need

236
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,210
front like like these blocks here need
 

237
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,160
front like like these blocks here need
to be changed it'll be close so it'll

238
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,170
to be changed it'll be close so it'll
 

239
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,260
to be changed it'll be close so it'll
almost work we might just need to block

240
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,270
almost work we might just need to block
 

241
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,160
almost work we might just need to block
out like the spot with something I don't

242
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,170
out like the spot with something I don't
 

243
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,510
out like the spot with something I don't
we'll see but it's coming along so I

244
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:10,520
we'll see but it's coming along so I
 

245
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,980
we'll see but it's coming along so I
think we're going to do a technical

246
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:11,990
think we're going to do a technical
 

247
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,840
think we're going to do a technical
project next there's one I've had in

248
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:13,850
project next there's one I've had in
 

249
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,380
project next there's one I've had in
mind for a long time at the potion lab

250
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:17,390
mind for a long time at the potion lab
 

251
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,510
mind for a long time at the potion lab
here I want to set up a way of sending

252
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
here I want to set up a way of sending
 

253
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,540
here I want to set up a way of sending
potions to the nether on a storage

254
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:22,550
potions to the nether on a storage
 

255
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,660
potions to the nether on a storage
minecart type of deal no we can't put it

256
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,670
minecart type of deal no we can't put it
 

257
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,540
minecart type of deal no we can't put it
there that's not going to work what

258
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:28,550
there that's not going to work what
 

259
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:35,740
there that's not going to work what
about behind here that might work ah we

260
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:35,750
about behind here that might work ah we
 

261
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,720
about behind here that might work ah we
might be able to make it work so

262
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:37,730
might be able to make it work so
 

263
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,749
might be able to make it work so
basically drop off potions

264
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:40,759
basically drop off potions
 

265
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,390
basically drop off potions
and then I want them to get carted to

266
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:43,400
and then I want them to get carted to
 

267
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,610
and then I want them to get carted to
the to a portal so we got to first

268
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:45,620
the to a portal so we got to first
 

269
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,649
the to a portal so we got to first
figure out something

270
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:47,659
figure out something
 

271
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:52,600
figure out something
is it possible to let's see where should

272
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:52,610
is it possible to let's see where should
 

273
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,839
is it possible to let's see where should
we put this or so much stuff down here

274
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:54,849
we put this or so much stuff down here
 

275
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,920
we put this or so much stuff down here
I'm just going to set up temporarily

276
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:56,930
I'm just going to set up temporarily
 

277
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,989
I'm just going to set up temporarily
over here yeah this is going to be a

278
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:01,999
over here yeah this is going to be a
 

279
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:03,219
over here yeah this is going to be a
little tough to work down here there's

280
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:03,229
little tough to work down here there's
 

281
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:06,279
little tough to work down here there's
not a lot of space but basically I want

282
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:06,289
not a lot of space but basically I want
 

283
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:08,019
not a lot of space but basically I want
to see if we can get the storage my cart

284
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:08,029
to see if we can get the storage my cart
 

285
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,730
to see if we can get the storage my cart
to go into the nether and then go right

286
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:09,740
to go into the nether and then go right
 

287
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,420
to go into the nether and then go right
on a track on its own I don't know if

288
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,430
on a track on its own I don't know if
 

289
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,980
on a track on its own I don't know if
that is possible I feel like we've tried

290
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:14,990
that is possible I feel like we've tried
 

291
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,019
that is possible I feel like we've tried
this in the past and I can't remember um

292
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:19,029
this in the past and I can't remember um
 

293
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:23,499
this in the past and I can't remember um
anyway we'll light this okay so this

294
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:23,509
anyway we'll light this okay so this
 

295
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,769
anyway we'll light this okay so this
side doesn't matter so much so we'll

296
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:26,779
side doesn't matter so much so we'll
 

297
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,629
side doesn't matter so much so we'll
just have some rails to send a cart

298
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
just have some rails to send a cart
 

299
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,629
just have some rails to send a cart
through the other side though is where

300
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:31,639
through the other side though is where
 

301
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,079
through the other side though is where
we want to probably slope the track down

302
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:35,089
we want to probably slope the track down
 

303
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:39,070
we want to probably slope the track down
and to see if it'll go on it alright

304
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,080
and to see if it'll go on it alright
 

305
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,409
and to see if it'll go on it alright
that takes us to here I did write down

306
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:41,419
that takes us to here I did write down
 

307
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,899
that takes us to here I did write down
the coordinates of the lab so I'll try

308
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:43,909
the coordinates of the lab so I'll try
 

309
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,029
the coordinates of the lab so I'll try
set up a portal around there and then we

310
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:46,039
set up a portal around there and then we
 

311
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,290
set up a portal around there and then we
can we can experiment with it okay so it

312
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:50,300
can we can experiment with it okay so it
 

313
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,389
can we can experiment with it okay so it
turns out that potion lab coordinates

314
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:52,399
turns out that potion lab coordinates
 

315
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,209
turns out that potion lab coordinates
translate to over here in the nether so

316
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:55,219
translate to over here in the nether so
 

317
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:57,279
translate to over here in the nether so
if we build something we'll put it

318
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:57,289
if we build something we'll put it
 

319
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,889
if we build something we'll put it
behind the wall here but we're going to

320
00:07:59,889 --> 00:07:59,899
behind the wall here but we're going to
 

321
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:04,869
behind the wall here but we're going to
see first off let's just use some power

322
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
see first off let's just use some power
 

323
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,909
see first off let's just use some power
rails and make it slope like this and I

324
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
rails and make it slope like this and I
 

325
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,510
rails and make it slope like this and I
want to see if the storage minecart will

326
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
want to see if the storage minecart will
 

327
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,670
want to see if the storage minecart will
stick to the track here when it goes

328
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
stick to the track here when it goes
 

329
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,989
stick to the track here when it goes
through the portal or if it's just going

330
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:16,999
through the portal or if it's just going
 

331
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:18,999
through the portal or if it's just going
to sit on these portal blocks because

332
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:19,009
to sit on these portal blocks because
 

333
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:22,299
to sit on these portal blocks because
I'm not too sure what it does so yeah

334
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:22,309
I'm not too sure what it does so yeah
 

335
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:25,809
I'm not too sure what it does so yeah
we'll just get some redstone power go

336
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:25,819
we'll just get some redstone power go
 

337
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:29,679
we'll just get some redstone power go
into them and I will light it should be

338
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:29,689
into them and I will light it should be
 

339
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:33,009
into them and I will light it should be
able to light it still all right and

340
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:33,019
able to light it still all right and
 

341
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,339
able to light it still all right and
then we'll push the minecart through

342
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:35,349
then we'll push the minecart through
 

343
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,379
then we'll push the minecart through
okay I'm gonna push the minecart in but

344
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:38,389
okay I'm gonna push the minecart in but
 

345
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:39,370
okay I'm gonna push the minecart in but
we're not going to go through this

346
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:39,380
we're not going to go through this
 

347
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,540
we're not going to go through this
portal because I don't want to

348
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:40,550
portal because I don't want to
 

349
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,100
portal because I don't want to
accidentally nudge it so I'll go through

350
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,110
accidentally nudge it so I'll go through
 

351
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,809
accidentally nudge it so I'll go through
a different way here to check on it okay

352
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:46,819
a different way here to check on it okay
 

353
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,340
a different way here to check on it okay
hopefully we don't connect to that

354
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,350
hopefully we don't connect to that
 

355
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,170
hopefully we don't connect to that
portal we're pretty far away now this is

356
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:50,180
portal we're pretty far away now this is
 

357
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,470
portal we're pretty far away now this is
out by the library

358
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
out by the library
 

359
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,280
out by the library
all right and good we went through a

360
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,290
all right and good we went through a
 

361
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,740
all right and good we went through a
different one let's go to that portal

362
00:08:59,740 --> 00:08:59,750
different one let's go to that portal
 

363
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,230
different one let's go to that portal
now and just see where the minecart

364
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
now and just see where the minecart
 

365
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,180
now and just see where the minecart
ended up this way I always get lost um

366
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,190
ended up this way I always get lost um
 

367
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:11,950
ended up this way I always get lost um
should be to the right here right yeah

368
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:11,960
should be to the right here right yeah
 

369
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,110
should be to the right here right yeah
okay oh yeah so it ended up on the track

370
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
okay oh yeah so it ended up on the track
 

371
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,680
okay oh yeah so it ended up on the track
that's cool um that means like I did Oh

372

00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,030
unless the villager nudged it darn it
 

375
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,300

stupid villager you wrecked the test

376
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,310
stupid villager you wrecked the test
 

377
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,320
stupid villager you wrecked the test
possibly we're gonna assume it worked

378
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,330
possibly we're gonna assume it worked
 

379
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,940
possibly we're gonna assume it worked
though I'm going to start setting

380
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:30,950
though I'm going to start setting
 

381
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,630

setting this up so behind the wall over

382
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
setting this up so behind the wall over
 

383
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,660
setting this up so behind the wall over
here we will set up a track and I guess

384
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:37,670
here we will set up a track and I guess
 

385
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,370
here we will set up a track and I guess
for now just connect it to this track

386
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:39,380
for now just connect it to this track
 

387
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,200
for now just connect it to this track
this goes out to the wither skeleton

stuff behind here so I decided to put it
 

417
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,530
stuff behind here so I decided to put it
in over here instead an idea is I'll hit

418
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:29,540
in over here instead an idea is I'll hit
 

419
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,810
in over here instead an idea is I'll hit
a button that will dispense a storage

420
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:31,820
a button that will dispense a storage
 

421
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,120
a button that will dispense a storage
minecart we fill it up with potions then

422
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,130
minecart we fill it up with potions then
 

423
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,700
minecart we fill it up with potions then
we just jump up to nudge it when we're

424
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:36,710
we just jump up to nudge it when we're
 

425
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,060
we just jump up to nudge it when we're
ready to go and that will take it to the

426
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,070
ready to go and that will take it to the
 

427
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,350

then it goes to this this rail oh did it

432
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:53,660
then it goes to this this rail oh did it
 

433
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,790
then it goes to this this rail oh did it
get stuck oh that scared me this guy got

434
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:57,800
get stuck oh that scared me this guy got
 

435
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,040
get stuck oh that scared me this guy got
in the way I guess I hope alright anyway

in the way I guess I hope alright anyway
 

437
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,840
in the way I guess I hope alright anyway
it goes to this and then

438
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:05,850
it goes to this and then
 

439
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,670
it goes to this and then
goes this way so that's that's how

440
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:08,680
goes this way so that's that's how
 

441
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,780
goes this way so that's that's how
that's working um

442
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:11,790
that's working um
 

443
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:17,970
that's working um
this will take this back oh that was

444
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:17,980
this will take this back oh that was
 

445
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,590
this will take this back oh that was
interesting wait a minute the items

446
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:22,600
interesting wait a minute the items
 

447
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,360
interesting wait a minute the items
didn't go through the portal there did

448
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,370
didn't go through the portal there did
 

449
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:31,920
didn't go through the portal there did
they oh maybe they did they go to a

450
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:31,930
they oh maybe they did they go to a
 

451
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,450
they oh maybe they did they go to a
different portal we didn't get them when

452
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:33,460
different portal we didn't get them when
 

453
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:40,100
different portal we didn't get them when
we went through I don't think what oh

454
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,110
we went through I don't think what oh
 

455
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,640
we went through I don't think what oh
maybe we did yeah we must have all right

456
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:44,650
maybe we did yeah we must have all right
 

457
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,080
maybe we did yeah we must have all right
anyway so the next plan here I don't

458
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,090
anyway so the next plan here I don't
 

459
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,280
anyway so the next plan here I don't
want this portal running all the time

460
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,290
want this portal running all the time
 

461
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,350
want this portal running all the time
because it's kind of annoying so we're

462
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:52,360
because it's kind of annoying so we're
 

463
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:59,960
because it's kind of annoying so we're
going to disable this and I put in a

464
00:11:59,960 --> 00:11:59,970
going to disable this and I put in a
 

465
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,440
going to disable this and I put in a
detector rail here so what we'll do is

466
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:03,450
detector rail here so what we'll do is
 

467
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:08,010
detector rail here so what we'll do is
have a dispenser here with flint and

468
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,020
have a dispenser here with flint and
 

469
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,230
have a dispenser here with flint and
steel in when it goes over this it will

470
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
steel in when it goes over this it will
 

471
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,550
steel in when it goes over this it will
just send a pulse to that okay this

472
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
just send a pulse to that okay this
 

473
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,990
just send a pulse to that okay this
doesn't have to be pretty because we're

474
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
doesn't have to be pretty because we're
 

475
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,790
doesn't have to be pretty because we're
not going to be able to see it and then

476
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:17,800
not going to be able to see it and then
 

477
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,070
not going to be able to see it and then
right after that we want to shut it off

478
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,080
right after that we want to shut it off
 

479
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,460
right after that we want to shut it off
so we'll have a another dispenser with a

480
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:23,470
so we'll have a another dispenser with a
 

481
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,570
so we'll have a another dispenser with a
water bucket and I think over here and

482
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:27,580
water bucket and I think over here and
 

483
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,580
water bucket and I think over here and
we just need a little bit of delay for

484
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:29,590
we just need a little bit of delay for
 

485
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,640
we just need a little bit of delay for
the minecart to get through nothing too

486
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:32,650
the minecart to get through nothing too
 

487
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:38,130
the minecart to get through nothing too
major this will go up and around okay

488
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,140
major this will go up and around okay
 

489
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,710
major this will go up and around okay
but we got to do a double pulse er here

490
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
but we got to do a double pulse er here
 

491
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,180
but we got to do a double pulse er here
and if I remember right as you I'll do

492
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,190
and if I remember right as you I'll do
 

493
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,280
and if I remember right as you I'll do
it off camera I don't want to I don't

494
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,290
it off camera I don't want to I don't
 

495
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,280
it off camera I don't want to I don't
want to waste your time this seems to

496
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,290
want to waste your time this seems to
 

497
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:57,210
want to waste your time this seems to
work here basically does that so portal

498
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:57,220
work here basically does that so portal
 

499
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,800
work here basically does that so portal
stays open for just a little bit of time

500
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:58,810
stays open for just a little bit of time
 

501
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,660
stays open for just a little bit of time
for the minecart to go through again an

502
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:00,670
for the minecart to go through again an
 

503
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,150
for the minecart to go through again an
8 tick delay here then it goes to a

504
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,160
8 tick delay here then it goes to a
 

505
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,190
8 tick delay here then it goes to a
sticky piston underneath this block with

506
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:08,200
sticky piston underneath this block with
 

507
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,500
sticky piston underneath this block with
a 1 tick to that and then a 3 tick so

508
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:10,510
a 1 tick to that and then a 3 tick so
 

509
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,360
a 1 tick to that and then a 3 tick so
there's a two tick between that for the

510
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,370
there's a two tick between that for the
 

511
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,900
there's a two tick between that for the
water to go out and in but anyway let's

512
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:15,910
water to go out and in but anyway let's
 

513
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,330
water to go out and in but anyway let's
let this dry here so storage minecart

514
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:18,340
let this dry here so storage minecart
 

515
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,280
let this dry here so storage minecart
will go down

516
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,290
will go down
 

517
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,199
will go down
beautiful that way the portal does have

518
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:23,209
beautiful that way the portal does have
 

519
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:25,030
beautiful that way the portal does have
to stay on all the time in an OS which

520
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
to stay on all the time in an OS which
 

521
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,170
to stay on all the time in an OS which
is what we want or don't want whichever

522
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:29,180
is what we want or don't want whichever
 

523
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,629
is what we want or don't want whichever
is correct there anyway so I'm going to

524
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:31,639
is correct there anyway so I'm going to
 

525
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,579
is correct there anyway so I'm going to
put some red clay here so can't see all

526
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:33,589
put some red clay here so can't see all
 

527
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:38,050
put some red clay here so can't see all
the stone and it should be good cool so

528
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:38,060
the stone and it should be good cool so
 

529
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,699
the stone and it should be good cool so
now that we got that set up we're going

530
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:39,709
now that we got that set up we're going
 

531
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:41,350
now that we got that set up we're going
to use it for the first time here for

532
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
to use it for the first time here for
 

533
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,319
to use it for the first time here for
real I want to send a batch of fire

534
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,329
real I want to send a batch of fire
 

535
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:46,540
real I want to send a batch of fire
resistant potions to the wither skeleton

536
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:46,550
resistant potions to the wither skeleton
 

537
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,569
resistant potions to the wither skeleton
farm and I'll probably go check and make

538
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:49,579
farm and I'll probably go check and make
 

539
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,430
farm and I'll probably go check and make
sure they get there too I kind of wonder

540
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
sure they get there too I kind of wonder
 

541
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,319
sure they get there too I kind of wonder
what happens also if we if we send two

542
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:56,329
what happens also if we if we send two
 

543
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:58,629
what happens also if we if we send two
of these at once so we'll probably try

544
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:58,639
of these at once so we'll probably try
 

545
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,329
of these at once so we'll probably try
that it looks like that went no problem

546
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:03,339
that it looks like that went no problem
 

547
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:05,680
that it looks like that went no problem
the other issue though is we got the

548
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:05,690
the other issue though is we got the
 

549
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,139
the other issue though is we got the
zombie pigmen on the the tracks a lot of

550
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:08,149
zombie pigmen on the the tracks a lot of
 

551
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,120
zombie pigmen on the the tracks a lot of
the time so that might cause some

552
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,130
the time so that might cause some
 

553
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,500
the time so that might cause some
problems

554
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:11,510
problems
 

555
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,620
problems
let's try send some speed potions there

556
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:14,630
let's try send some speed potions there
 

557
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,689
let's try send some speed potions there
too I guess

558
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:15,699
too I guess
 

559
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:23,639
too I guess
slowness oh that shouldn't be there

560
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:23,649

 

561
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:26,949

doesn't give you a potion effect okay I

562
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
doesn't give you a potion effect okay I
 

563
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,480
doesn't give you a potion effect okay I
was wondering um so swiftness for the

564
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:31,490
was wondering um so swiftness for the
 

565
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:40,449
was wondering um so swiftness for the
horse okay and there we go so I'm going

566
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:40,459
horse okay and there we go so I'm going
 

567
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:42,160
horse okay and there we go so I'm going
to go to the nether now and just check

568
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,170
to go to the nether now and just check
 

569
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,440
to go to the nether now and just check
out what happened

570
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,450

 

571
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,440

Oh

572
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:49,450

 

573
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,040

that's not good okay they would have

574
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,050
that's not good okay they would have
 

575
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,870
that's not good okay they would have
made it but looks like the tract is out

576
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
made it but looks like the tract is out
 

577
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,140
made it but looks like the tract is out
here did I bring any with me no I'll

578
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,150
here did I bring any with me no I'll
 

579
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:04,590
here did I bring any with me no I'll
have to fix that okay but it works so

580
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:04,600
have to fix that okay but it works so
 

581
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,820
have to fix that okay but it works so
I've been trying to think of what to do

582
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:05,830
I've been trying to think of what to do
 

583
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,790
I've been trying to think of what to do
next year and maybe we will do a little

584
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
next year and maybe we will do a little
 

585
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,650
next year and maybe we will do a little
bit more biome enhancement I've been

586
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:10,660
bit more biome enhancement I've been
 

587
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,050
bit more biome enhancement I've been
seeing a lot of comments asking for that

588
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,060
seeing a lot of comments asking for that
 

589
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,560
seeing a lot of comments asking for that
lately so it's been a while let's let's

590
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:16,570
lately so it's been a while let's let's
 

591
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,280
lately so it's been a while let's let's
just do a little bit so this area where

592
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,290
just do a little bit so this area where
 

593
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,020
just do a little bit so this area where
we are right now I kind of wanted to

594
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,030
we are right now I kind of wanted to
 

595
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,410
we are right now I kind of wanted to
have a bunch of trees and we built this

596
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:25,420
have a bunch of trees and we built this
 

597
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,020
have a bunch of trees and we built this
one this custom tree here the problem is

598
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,030
one this custom tree here the problem is
 

599
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,440
one this custom tree here the problem is
this took me like 30 minutes to do and

600
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:31,450
this took me like 30 minutes to do and
 

601
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:35,760
this took me like 30 minutes to do and
you know if he gets 10 trees that's 300

602
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:35,770
you know if he gets 10 trees that's 300
 

603
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,950
you know if he gets 10 trees that's 300
minutes so I'm wondering if we could

604
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:37,960
minutes so I'm wondering if we could
 

605
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,680
minutes so I'm wondering if we could
speed that up if we maybe pay a little

606
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:40,690
speed that up if we maybe pay a little
 

607
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:46,290
speed that up if we maybe pay a little
less attention to detail so what we're

608
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:46,300
less attention to detail so what we're
 

609
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,530
less attention to detail so what we're
going to try is grow a dark oak tree and

610
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:49,540
going to try is grow a dark oak tree and
 

611
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,290
going to try is grow a dark oak tree and
then maybe add a bit to it but not like

612
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:52,300
then maybe add a bit to it but not like
 

613
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,190
then maybe add a bit to it but not like
build it totally from scratch so let's

614
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:56,200
build it totally from scratch so let's
 

615
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,410
build it totally from scratch so let's
just put another one over here okay and

616
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:00,420
just put another one over here okay and
 

617
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,600
just put another one over here okay and
I also kind of want them to be a bit

618
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:03,610
I also kind of want them to be a bit
 

619
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,600
I also kind of want them to be a bit
tall so I'm going to start it a little

620
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:06,610
tall so I'm going to start it a little
 

621
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,520
tall so I'm going to start it a little
bit higher and just see if we can make

622
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:11,530
bit higher and just see if we can make
 

623
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,200
bit higher and just see if we can make
this work somehow because that would be

624
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,210
this work somehow because that would be
 

625
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,220
this work somehow because that would be
awesome Oh what was I expecting to

626
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,230
awesome Oh what was I expecting to
 

627
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,800
awesome Oh what was I expecting to
happen there I don't know okay

628
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:19,810
happen there I don't know okay
 

629
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,360
happen there I don't know okay
so I'm going to build it down to the

630
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:21,370
so I'm going to build it down to the
 

631
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,360
so I'm going to build it down to the
ground and we'll just see how much work

632
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:24,370
ground and we'll just see how much work
 

633
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,860
ground and we'll just see how much work
that needs to to make it look cool I

634
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:27,870
that needs to to make it look cool I
 

635
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,070
that needs to to make it look cool I
wish there was more tree shapes built

636
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,080
wish there was more tree shapes built
 

637
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,180
wish there was more tree shapes built
into the game so that you could you know

638
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,190
into the game so that you could you know
 

639
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,070
into the game so that you could you know
have a little bit more option with it

640
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,080

 

641
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,120

okay so let's take a step back that's

642
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,130
okay so let's take a step back that's
 

643
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,180
okay so let's take a step back that's
about the height I want but I want it to

644
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,190
about the height I want but I want it to
 

645
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:54,750
about the height I want but I want it to
look like that yeah it needs a lot of

646
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:54,760
look like that yeah it needs a lot of
 

647
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,940
look like that yeah it needs a lot of
work doesn't it so we got to bulk up

648
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:56,950
work doesn't it so we got to bulk up
 

649
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,840
work doesn't it so we got to bulk up
around the bottom a lot may be able to

650
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:00,850
around the bottom a lot may be able to
 

651
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,850
around the bottom a lot may be able to
spam wood and see what happens

652
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:02,860
spam wood and see what happens
 

653
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,180
spam wood and see what happens
the goal here is to try to do it quickly

654
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,190
the goal here is to try to do it quickly
 

655
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:11,270
the goal here is to try to do it quickly
and I don't know if that's possible

656
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,280

 

657
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,320

actually you know what this one's is

658
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:13,330
actually you know what this one's is
 

659
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,300
actually you know what this one's is
starting out so bad already I think we

660
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:15,310
starting out so bad already I think we
 

661
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,180
starting out so bad already I think we
will skip it we'll burn it down we're

662
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,190
will skip it we'll burn it down we're
 

663
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,100
will skip it we'll burn it down we're
going to try again this time I'm going

664
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,110
going to try again this time I'm going
 

665
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,810
going to try again this time I'm going
to put a little more thought into the

666
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:21,820
to put a little more thought into the
 

667
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,990
to put a little more thought into the
structure and not spam the wood so much

668
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,000
structure and not spam the wood so much
 

669
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,320
structure and not spam the wood so much
because that didn't work out so well so

670
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,330
because that didn't work out so well so
 

671
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:35,220
because that didn't work out so well so
again same thing like yeah I don't know

672
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,230
again same thing like yeah I don't know
 

673
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,130
again same thing like yeah I don't know
it's you kind of have to get lucky I

674
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:38,140
it's you kind of have to get lucky I
 

675
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,660
it's you kind of have to get lucky I
feel when you make a tree to it

676
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:39,670
feel when you make a tree to it
 

677
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,860
feel when you make a tree to it
it either goes well or a doesn't and

678
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:42,870
it either goes well or a doesn't and
 

679
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:49,070
it either goes well or a doesn't and
that time it did not go well okay okay

680
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,080
that time it did not go well okay okay
 

681
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,420
that time it did not go well okay okay
this one's turning out quite a bit

682
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:51,430
this one's turning out quite a bit
 

683
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,920
this one's turning out quite a bit
better we're probably at five minutes

684
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:52,930
better we're probably at five minutes
 

685
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,310
better we're probably at five minutes
into building it next thing I'm going to

686
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
into building it next thing I'm going to
 

687
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,940
into building it next thing I'm going to
do is start trimming these extra pieces

688
00:17:59,940 --> 00:17:59,950
do is start trimming these extra pieces
 

689
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,580
do is start trimming these extra pieces
of wood that come with the natural tree

690
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:02,590
of wood that come with the natural tree
 

691
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,340
of wood that come with the natural tree
when you grow it and then I'm going to

692
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:05,350
when you grow it and then I'm going to
 

693
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,170
when you grow it and then I'm going to
start bulking up the leaves there and

694
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,180
start bulking up the leaves there and
 

695
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,030
start bulking up the leaves there and
also it's a little bit flat part way up

696
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,040
also it's a little bit flat part way up
 

697
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:22,700
also it's a little bit flat part way up
so I think we'll add some whoa okay

698
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:22,710

 

699
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,320

where was that did I have a beacon here

700
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,330
where was that did I have a beacon here
 

701
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:39,060
where was that did I have a beacon here
at one time whoa and somehow I fell down

702
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,070
at one time whoa and somehow I fell down
 

703
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,440
at one time whoa and somehow I fell down
there without the grabbing ladder I

704
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:40,450
there without the grabbing ladder I
 

705
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,500
there without the grabbing ladder I
think I was in so much shock I just

706
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:43,510
think I was in so much shock I just
 

707
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,080
think I was in so much shock I just
couldn't press the keys oh I know what

708
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,090
couldn't press the keys oh I know what
 

709
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:51,690
couldn't press the keys oh I know what
this is okay we did a thing here a long

710
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:51,700
this is okay we did a thing here a long
 

711
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,810
this is okay we did a thing here a long
time ago when I was experimenting with

712
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:54,820
time ago when I was experimenting with
 

713
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:00,410
time ago when I was experimenting with
our unloaded chunks work uh-huh okay

714
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:00,420
our unloaded chunks work uh-huh okay
 

715
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:05,250
our unloaded chunks work uh-huh okay
this was a proximity detector thing that

716
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:05,260
this was a proximity detector thing that
 

717
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,940
this was a proximity detector thing that
we made a long time ago man well good

718
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:08,950
we made a long time ago man well good
 

719
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,640
we made a long time ago man well good
thing I set my spawn here anyway I'm

720
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:11,650
thing I set my spawn here anyway I'm
 

721
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,230
thing I set my spawn here anyway I'm
going to bulk up the tree and maybe add

722
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:13,240
going to bulk up the tree and maybe add
 

723
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,400
going to bulk up the tree and maybe add
some branches partway up there

724
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,410
some branches partway up there
 

725
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,460
some branches partway up there
well you know it didn't turn out too too

726
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:19,470
well you know it didn't turn out too too
 

727
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,800
well you know it didn't turn out too too
bad I don't think right there's still

728
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:24,810
bad I don't think right there's still
 

729
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,600
bad I don't think right there's still
some stuff I don't like like that's way

730
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:26,610
some stuff I don't like like that's way
 

731
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,090
some stuff I don't like like that's way
too flat there and yeah so there's a

732
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,100
too flat there and yeah so there's a
 

733
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,050
too flat there and yeah so there's a
couple things that bug me about it but

734
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,060
couple things that bug me about it but
 

735
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,780
couple things that bug me about it but
the problem is it still took like 20 25

736
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:35,790
the problem is it still took like 20 25
 

737
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,870
the problem is it still took like 20 25
minutes which isn't good the thing that

738
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
minutes which isn't good the thing that
 

739
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,270
minutes which isn't good the thing that
takes the longest is the the canopy it

740
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,280
takes the longest is the the canopy it
 

741
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,140
takes the longest is the the canopy it
turns out so I have one more strategy I

742
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,150
turns out so I have one more strategy I
 

743
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,210
turns out so I have one more strategy I
want to try here we'll build another one

744
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:47,220
want to try here we'll build another one
 

745
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:56,260
want to try here we'll build another one
here okay so the tree canopy new plan

746
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,270
here okay so the tree canopy new plan
 

747
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,960
here okay so the tree canopy new plan
yeah again let's do it about here we

748
00:19:59,960 --> 00:19:59,970
yeah again let's do it about here we
 

749
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,550
yeah again let's do it about here we
will have not one not two but we're

750
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:04,560
will have not one not two but we're
 

751
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,670
will have not one not two but we're
going to try three trees grown kind of

752
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:07,680
going to try three trees grown kind of
 

753
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,340
going to try three trees grown kind of
close together let's put another one

754
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:10,350
close together let's put another one
 

755
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:15,800
close together let's put another one
here and hopefully that makes a decent

756
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:15,810
here and hopefully that makes a decent
 

757
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,190
here and hopefully that makes a decent
sized tree canopy and if we do it at

758
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
sized tree canopy and if we do it at
 

759
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,250
sized tree canopy and if we do it at
slightly different heights and and not

760
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:22,260
slightly different heights and and not
 

761
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,230
slightly different heights and and not
really in a straight line it should look

762
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
really in a straight line it should look
 

763
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,690
really in a straight line it should look
pretty organic I think so we'll have

764
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:26,700
pretty organic I think so we'll have
 

765
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,850
pretty organic I think so we'll have
another one there let's put the other

766
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:28,860
another one there let's put the other
 

767
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:34,690
another one there let's put the other
one maybe here feels like a good offset

768
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:34,700
one maybe here feels like a good offset
 

769
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,870
one maybe here feels like a good offset
alright let's put this one I will put it

770
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
alright let's put this one I will put it
 

771
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,430
alright let's put this one I will put it
level with that one because the tree is

772
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:40,440
level with that one because the tree is
 

773
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,080
level with that one because the tree is
going to grow slightly different too

774
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,090
going to grow slightly different too
 

775
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,920
going to grow slightly different too
sometimes they're different heights I

776
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:45,930
sometimes they're different heights I
 

777
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,190
sometimes they're different heights I
mean okay ooh that's not a tree that's a

778
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
mean okay ooh that's not a tree that's a
 

779
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,930
mean okay ooh that's not a tree that's a
tree oh we got a sapling from that that

780
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:50,940
tree oh we got a sapling from that that
 

781
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:58,760
tree oh we got a sapling from that that
was lucky okay do that this might be

782
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:58,770
was lucky okay do that this might be
 

783
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:03,320
was lucky okay do that this might be
amazing if it works it might be but it

784
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,330
amazing if it works it might be but it
 

785
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,500
amazing if it works it might be but it
might not turn out at all we'll see okay

786
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:06,510
might not turn out at all we'll see okay
 

787
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,830
might not turn out at all we'll see okay
so we do that let's just take a look at

788
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
so we do that let's just take a look at
 

789
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:19,880
so we do that let's just take a look at
the tree canopy um it's pretty messy

790
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:19,890
the tree canopy um it's pretty messy
 

791
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,100
the tree canopy um it's pretty messy
like I'm expecting I'll have to add to

792
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,110
like I'm expecting I'll have to add to
 

793
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,540
like I'm expecting I'll have to add to
it still but it does cover a much better

794
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:26,550
it still but it does cover a much better
 

795
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,930
it still but it does cover a much better
area so now I'm going to remove these

796
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:29,940
area so now I'm going to remove these
 

797
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,659
area so now I'm going to remove these
trunks and I'm going to grow another

798
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:32,669
trunks and I'm going to grow another
 

799
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:37,759
trunks and I'm going to grow another
tree right in the middle and start

800
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:37,769
tree right in the middle and start
 

801
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:40,580
tree right in the middle and start
bulking it up again hopefully that's

802
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:40,590
bulking it up again hopefully that's
 

803
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:46,580
bulking it up again hopefully that's
quicker we will see so this one took

804
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:46,590
quicker we will see so this one took
 

805
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,909
quicker we will see so this one took
about 15 to 20 minutes it's a fair bit

806
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:49,919
about 15 to 20 minutes it's a fair bit
 

807
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,549
about 15 to 20 minutes it's a fair bit
rougher there's some flat spots on it

808
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:52,559
rougher there's some flat spots on it
 

809
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,369
rougher there's some flat spots on it
and stuff but it's not too too bad I

810
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:55,379
and stuff but it's not too too bad I
 

811
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:58,100
and stuff but it's not too too bad I
don't think so it's a little bit quicker

812
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,110
don't think so it's a little bit quicker
 

813
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,009
don't think so it's a little bit quicker
than that method we use there but not

814
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:01,019
than that method we use there but not
 

815
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,409
than that method we use there but not
quite as polished whoop

816
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:03,419
quite as polished whoop
 

817
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,560
quite as polished whoop
but still you know 15 20 minutes that's

818
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:06,570
but still you know 15 20 minutes that's
 

819
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,230
but still you know 15 20 minutes that's
that's a lot of time for a single tree

820
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,240
that's a lot of time for a single tree
 

821
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,840
that's a lot of time for a single tree
so having a lot of these custom trees

822
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:11,850
so having a lot of these custom trees
 

823
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,299
so having a lot of these custom trees
might be difficult to pull off like I

824
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:14,309
might be difficult to pull off like I
 

825
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:17,360
might be difficult to pull off like I
wanted so maybe we'll just have a few

826
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,370
wanted so maybe we'll just have a few
 

827
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,080
wanted so maybe we'll just have a few
standard around the other thing I was

828
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,090
standard around the other thing I was
 

829
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,450
standard around the other thing I was
curious about you know on the survival

830
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:23,460
curious about you know on the survival
 

831
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,340
curious about you know on the survival
of the fittest map how they have the

832
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:25,350
of the fittest map how they have the
 

833
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,240
of the fittest map how they have the
stone scattered kind of randomly all

834
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,250
stone scattered kind of randomly all
 

835
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,799
stone scattered kind of randomly all
over the place I think that looks pretty

836
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:30,809
over the place I think that looks pretty
 

837
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:34,310
over the place I think that looks pretty
cool actually have like boulders and

838
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
cool actually have like boulders and
 

839
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,600
cool actually have like boulders and
stuff I think I want to try add some of

840
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:38,610
stuff I think I want to try add some of
 

841
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,560
stuff I think I want to try add some of
that on the ground okay I just did a

842
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:42,570
that on the ground okay I just did a
 

843
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,899
that on the ground okay I just did a
little sample here I want to see what

844
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:44,909
little sample here I want to see what
 

845
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:46,549
little sample here I want to see what
you guys think about it before I do more

846
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:46,559
you guys think about it before I do more
 

847
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,999
you guys think about it before I do more
so let me know I think maybe I put a

848
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:50,009
so let me know I think maybe I put a
 

849
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,379
so let me know I think maybe I put a
little too much down though it might be

850
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:51,389
little too much down though it might be
 

851
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:56,570
little too much down though it might be
too dense anyway that is just an idea

852
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:56,580
too dense anyway that is just an idea
 

853
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,850
too dense anyway that is just an idea
you need like it's some random stuff

854
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:58,860
you need like it's some random stuff
 

855
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,139
you need like it's some random stuff
scattered throughout here I think to

856
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:00,149
scattered throughout here I think to
 

857
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:02,779
scattered throughout here I think to
make it more interesting so I probably

858
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:02,789
make it more interesting so I probably
 

859
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:04,490
make it more interesting so I probably
want to add some flowers and stuff as

860
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:04,500
want to add some flowers and stuff as
 

861
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,909
want to add some flowers and stuff as
well maybe some random leaves and debris

862
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:07,919
well maybe some random leaves and debris
 

863
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,460
well maybe some random leaves and debris
that kind of stuff maybe some paths yeah

864
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:12,470
that kind of stuff maybe some paths yeah
 

865
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,019
that kind of stuff maybe some paths yeah

hearthstone video I don't know if there
 

903
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,860
hearthstone video I don't know if there
would be any interest in that but the

904
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:09,870
would be any interest in that but the
 

905
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,690
would be any interest in that but the
expansion came out I got to buy a bunch

906

expansion came out I got to buy a bunch
 

907
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,139
expansion came out I got to buy a bunch
of packs and and maybe do an arena run I

908
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:15,149
of packs and and maybe do an arena run I
 

909
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:17,539
of packs and and maybe do an arena run I
don't know probably is a one-off video

910
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:17,549
don't know probably is a one-off video
