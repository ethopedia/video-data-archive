let's take a pic let's take some blocks
 

217
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,390
let's take a pic let's take some blocks
uh that is the new cobblestone texture

218
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
uh that is the new cobblestone texture
 

219
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,749
uh that is the new cobblestone texture
so this was

220
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
so this was
 

221
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,590
so this was
there used to be an old texture that had

222
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
there used to be an old texture that had
 

223
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,550
there used to be an old texture that had
like black lines in it it was pretty bad

224
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
like black lines in it it was pretty bad
 

225
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,469
like black lines in it it was pretty bad
should we take a sign now we've had

226
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
should we take a sign now we've had
 

227
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,430
should we take a sign now we've had
enough crazy signs for today

228
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
enough crazy signs for today
 

229
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,550
enough crazy signs for today
what is that sound is that uh

230
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560

 

231
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,469

where is that coming from is it down

232
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
where is that coming from is it down
 

233
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,150
where is that coming from is it down
here

234
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160

 

235
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,870

oh man okay

236
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
oh man okay
 

237
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,150
oh man okay
what i am already confused i thought we

238
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
what i am already confused i thought we
 

239
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,430
what i am already confused i thought we
shut this thing down

240
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
shut this thing down
 

241
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,870
shut this thing down
didn't we or wait a minute this was

242
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
didn't we or wait a minute this was
 

243
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,030
didn't we or wait a minute this was
i think this was the first mob system i

244
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
i think this was the first mob system i
 

245
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,950
i think this was the first mob system i
built right

246
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
built right
 

247
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,270
built right
then we must have made a second one and

248
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
then we must have made a second one and
 

249
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,790
then we must have made a second one and
shut that one down

250
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
shut that one down
 

251
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,909
shut that one down
and then we made a third one

252
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
and then we made a third one
 

253
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,629
and then we made a third one
and then a fourth one a pretty big part

254
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
and then a fourth one a pretty big part
 

255
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,790
and then a fourth one a pretty big part
of my series used to be mob systems

256
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
of my series used to be mob systems
 

257
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,070
of my series used to be mob systems
trying to figure out how to

258
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
trying to figure out how to
 

259
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,189
trying to figure out how to
make them and stuff uh

260
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
make them and stuff uh
 

261
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,629
make them and stuff uh
yeah back in the day like

262
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
yeah back in the day like
 

263
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,790
yeah back in the day like
even simple things that we take for

264
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
even simple things that we take for
 

265
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,469
even simple things that we take for
granted like

266
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
granted like
 

267
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,189
granted like
uh it was common in old mob systems just

268
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
uh it was common in old mob systems just
 

269
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,990
uh it was common in old mob systems just
to have like a pressure

270
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
to have like a pressure
 

271
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,510
to have like a pressure
plate between the water streams or

272
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
plate between the water streams or
 

273
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,430
plate between the water streams or
something like that it wasn't until i

274
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
something like that it wasn't until i
 

275
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,310
something like that it wasn't until i
built this that i got the idea of hey

276
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
built this that i got the idea of hey
 

277
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,990
built this that i got the idea of hey
you know what you can do a sign trick

278
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
you know what you can do a sign trick
 

279
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,430
you know what you can do a sign trick
like this and then the water will just

280
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
like this and then the water will just
 

281
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,430
like this and then the water will just
flows over top and

282
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
flows over top and
 

283
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,230
flows over top and
and it's seamless because before the

284
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
and it's seamless because before the
 

285
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,029
and it's seamless because before the
mobs would like

286
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
mobs would like
 

287
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,629
mobs would like
step on the pressure plates and then you

288
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
step on the pressure plates and then you
 

289
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,070
step on the pressure plates and then you
would have to wait for them to cross

290
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
would have to wait for them to cross
 

291
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,110
would have to wait for them to cross
over to the

292
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
over to the
 

293
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,790
over to the
the next stream and it took a really

294
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
the next stream and it took a really
 

295
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,550
the next stream and it took a really
long time

296
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
long time
 

297
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,070
long time
and then i think later even at this time

298
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
and then i think later even at this time
 

299
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,510
and then i think later even at this time
the the trick with

300
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
the the trick with
 

301
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,430
the the trick with
stopping spiders from spawning wasn't

302
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
stopping spiders from spawning wasn't
 

303
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,870
stopping spiders from spawning wasn't
known i don't think it

304
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
known i don't think it
 

305
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,150
known i don't think it
i think i figured that out later

306
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
i think i figured that out later
 

307
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,309
i think i figured that out later
hey guy be nice

308
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319

 

309
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,070

oh man
 

311
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,150
oh man
he's pretty nice signs signs galore

312
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160

 

313
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,150

that did like no damage oh yeah and the

314
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
that did like no damage oh yeah and the
 

315
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,909
that did like no damage oh yeah and the
first mob evader here

316
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
first mob evader here
 

317
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,510
first mob evader here
yeah this was uh when i was trying to

318
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
yeah this was uh when i was trying to
 

319
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,909
yeah this was uh when i was trying to
figure out how to move mobs upward

320
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
figure out how to move mobs upward
 

321
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,990
figure out how to move mobs upward
without getting stuck

322
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
without getting stuck
 

323
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,830
without getting stuck
did i never i must not have shut that

324
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
did i never i must not have shut that
 

325
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,029
did i never i must not have shut that
down either

326
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
down either
 

327
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,189
down either
because all right now i'm lost

328
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
because all right now i'm lost
 

329
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,350
because all right now i'm lost
this is a bit of a tour for me too like

330
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
this is a bit of a tour for me too like
 

331
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,950
this is a bit of a tour for me too like
we're gonna be looking at stuff

332
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
we're gonna be looking at stuff
 

333
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,230
we're gonna be looking at stuff
and i anything that grabs my attention

334
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
and i anything that grabs my attention
 

335
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,510
and i anything that grabs my attention
basically

basically
 

337
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,510
basically
here let's take the what did we call

338
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
here let's take the what did we call
 

339
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,110
here let's take the what did we call

to the nether and then
 

369
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,790
to the nether and then
this must be the mob system look at that

370
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
this must be the mob system look at that
 

371
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,510
this must be the mob system look at that
i thought

372
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
i thought
 

373
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,710

then
i built a passive mob system up there i

400
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
i built a passive mob system up there i
 

401
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,390
i built a passive mob system up there i
think that's what's running right now

what's up with this guy did they not uh
suffocate

472
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
suffocate
 

473
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,269
suffocate
oh yeah that's right they didn't

474
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279

00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
suffocate for a long time
 

477
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,230
suffocate for a long time
in the game i forgot about that

478
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
in the game i forgot about that
 

479
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,790
in the game i forgot about that
they used to like wash up onto the

480
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
they used to like wash up onto the
 

481
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,310
they used to like wash up onto the
ground and then they would get stuck

482
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
ground and then they would get stuck
 

483
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,430
ground and then they would get stuck
like that

484
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
like that
 

485
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,590
like that
i think

486
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600

 

487
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,030

okay oh

488
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
okay oh
 

489
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,350
okay oh
there's this switch here what does this

490
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
there's this switch here what does this
 

491
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,389
there's this switch here what does this
do

492
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
do
 

493
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,750
do
opens all the doors i guess

494
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
opens all the doors i guess
 

495
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,670
opens all the doors i guess
yeah looks like it was there another one

496
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
yeah looks like it was there another one
 

497
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,030
yeah looks like it was there another one
on this side for the

498
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
on this side for the
 

499
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,150
on this side for the
the middle yeah

500
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
the middle yeah
 

501
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,389
the middle yeah
okay this was like drop the mobs in the

502
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
okay this was like drop the mobs in the
 

503
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,750
okay this was like drop the mobs in the
middle and then this was supposed to

504
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
middle and then this was supposed to
 

505
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,350
middle and then this was supposed to
open up and fry them

506
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
open up and fry them
 

507
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,790
open up and fry them
i think anyway we spent a lot of time

508
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800

what would we use it for though i wonder
i think the way this worked i had to

704
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
i think the way this worked i had to
 

705
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,310
i think the way this worked i had to
have items on both pressure plates yeah

706
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
have items on both pressure plates yeah
 

707
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,629
have items on both pressure plates yeah
then

708

working like the hostile one we'll have
 

947
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,430
working like the hostile one we'll have
to go down and check

948

to go down and check
 

949
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,150
to go down and check
let's see let's take a look here this

950

those guys were getting separated up
 

977
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,149
those guys were getting separated up
higher i guess

978
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,159

messy looking
 

1013
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,510
messy looking
i think if it was a pig they would fall

1014
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
i think if it was a pig they would fall

i got a little bit of bone meal here

1354
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:43,840

 

1355
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,950

oh oh we might be surrounded

1356
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:48,960
oh oh we might be surrounded
 

1357
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,909
oh oh we might be surrounded
you would stand in the middle you could

1358
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:51,919
you would stand in the middle you could
 

1359
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:52,710
you would stand in the middle you could
uh

1360
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
uh
 

1361
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,310
uh
spam bone meal on the grass and it would

1362
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
spam bone meal on the grass and it would
 

1363
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,070
spam bone meal on the grass and it would
it would plant like flowers and grass up

1364
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
it would plant like flowers and grass up
 

1365
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,110
it would plant like flowers and grass up
there

1366
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,120
there
 

1367
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,510
there
then you take a water bucket

1368
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,520

 

1369
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,070

place it here and it would harvest all

1370
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080
place it here and it would harvest all

1373
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,830
the grass
and the seeds and stuff and they would

1374
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:09,840
and the seeds and stuff and they would
 

1375
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,350
and the seeds and stuff and they would
all come washing down

1376
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
all come washing down
 

1377
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,909
all come washing down
here

1378
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:15,919

 

1379
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,830

so many animals yeah you see there's

1380
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:17,840
so many animals yeah you see there's
 

1381
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,510
so many animals yeah you see there's
some flowers and stuff but

1382
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:19,520
some flowers and stuff but
 

1383
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,310
some flowers and stuff but
yeah aha still works

00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,320

 

1385
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,230

still works and then we found out you

1386
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,240
still works and then we found out you
 

1387
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,830
still works and then we found out you
could just use dark rooms to harvest

1388
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:29,840
could just use dark rooms to harvest
 

1389
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,630
could just use dark rooms to harvest
flowers and this was obsolete

1390
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:32,640
flowers and this was obsolete
 

1391
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,909
flowers and this was obsolete
like the day after i built it um

1392
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:37,919

 

1393
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,990

okay some more motivator testing over

1394
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,000
okay some more motivator testing over
 

1395
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,230
okay some more motivator testing over
here nothing too interesting out here so

1396
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
here nothing too interesting out here so
 

1397
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,830
here nothing too interesting out here so
let's head back

1398
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:43,840
let's head back
 

1399
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,230
let's head back
no

1400
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240

 

1401
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,750

this thing still works guys

1402
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:55,760

 

1403
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,190

the spider sizzler oh i love that thing
 

1405
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,190
the spider sizzler oh i love that thing
i was doing a test here to see how far

1406
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,200
i was doing a test here to see how far
 

1407
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,230
i was doing a test here to see how far
you could drop mobs

1408
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,240
you could drop mobs
 

1409
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,750
you could drop mobs
before they would die to figure out uh

1410
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:05,760
before they would die to figure out uh
 

1411
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,230
before they would die to figure out uh
how much fall damage they could take

1412
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,240
how much fall damage they could take
 

1413
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,789
how much fall damage they could take
because

1414
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:08,799
because
 

1415
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,750
because
back then there was no wiki or anything

1416
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:11,760
back then there was no wiki or anything
 

1417
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,950
back then there was no wiki or anything
had to do research

1418
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:12,960
had to do research
 

1419
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,830
had to do research
on your own to figure that kind of stuff

1420
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:16,840

 

1421
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,389

out

1422
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:18,399

but yeah you guys remember this let's
 

1471
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,230
but yeah you guys remember this let's
see i think this still works

1472
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,240
see i think this still works
 

1473
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,710

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,789
yeah that was to turn uh or to bring up
the half slabs that stops the spiders

1476
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:40,799
the half slabs that stops the spiders
 

1477
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,070
the half slabs that stops the spiders
from spawning

1478
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,080
from spawning
 

1479
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,269
from spawning
in here at a flip of a switch

1480
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:47,279

 

1481
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,310

oh and then this is the lights and since

1482
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:50,320
oh and then this is the lights and since
 

1483
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,830
oh and then this is the lights and since
the lights are on that's why we're not

1484
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:51,840
the lights are on that's why we're not
 

1485
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,269
the lights are on that's why we're not
getting any mobs

1486
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:55,279

 

1487
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,509

what else was there

1488
00:32:59,509 --> 00:32:59,519

 

1489
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,590

i think this is just wiring axis and

1490
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:01,600
i think this is just wiring axis and
 

1491
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,430
i think this is just wiring axis and
stuff this one went up

1492
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,440
stuff this one went up
 

1493
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,230
stuff this one went up
to the light control the way i did the

1494
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,240
to the light control the way i did the
 

1495
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,830
to the light control the way i did the
lights was with lava though it was

1496
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:08,840
lights was with lava though it was
 

1497
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,669
lights was with lava though it was
insane so many pistons

1498
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:13,679
insane so many pistons
 

1499
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,190
insane so many pistons
and redstone and stuff up here

1500
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,200
and redstone and stuff up here
 

1501
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,669
and redstone and stuff up here
uh and then there was a was it a piston

1502
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
uh and then there was a was it a piston
 

1503
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,269
uh and then there was a was it a piston
elevator here or how do we get back up

1504
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:23,279
elevator here or how do we get back up
 

1505
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,750
elevator here or how do we get back up
see the lights are off mobs are spawning

1506
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:25,760
see the lights are off mobs are spawning
 

1507
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,669
see the lights are off mobs are spawning
let me check

1508
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:27,679
let me check
 

1509
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,909
let me check
yeah they are good we're getting spiders

1510

and stuff too
 

1513
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,630
and stuff too
quick drop this must be the way up over

1514
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:34,640
quick drop this must be the way up over
 

1515
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,909
quick drop this must be the way up over
here

1516
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:35,919
here
 

1517
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,110
here
surface elevator was it just a

that uh
 

1539
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,389

in the past i didn't use like super flat

1540
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:08,399
in the past i didn't use like super flat
 

1541
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,829
in the past i didn't use like super flat
worlds or anything like that we didn't

1542

worlds or anything like that we didn't
have creative mode

1544
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,520
have creative mode
 

1545
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,829

so a lot of my tutorials and stuff i did

1546
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:13,839
so a lot of my tutorials and stuff i did
 

1547
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,589
so a lot of my tutorials and stuff i did
actually in this world and that's where

1548
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:15,599
actually in this world and that's where
 

1549
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,990
actually in this world and that's where
i figured out the

1550
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,000
i figured out the
 

1551
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,950
i figured out the
daylight sensor trick thing thingamajig

1552
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:20,960
daylight sensor trick thing thingamajig
 

1553
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,829
daylight sensor trick thing thingamajig
and did the tutorial and all that

1554
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:23,839
and did the tutorial and all that
 

1555
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,030
and did the tutorial and all that

1557
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,629
um mobs should be spawning now we are
running really low on time though so i'm

1558
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:28,639
running really low on time though so i'm
 

1559
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,149
running really low on time though so i'm
trying to hurry but i do want to see

1560
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:30,159
trying to hurry but i do want to see

this

1562
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:33,359

 

1563
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,950

yeah look at them now look how many

1564
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:34,960
yeah look at them now look how many
 

1565
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,950
yeah look at them now look how many
there are

1566
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:36,960
there are
 

1567
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,790
there are
oh wow yeah i just checked we're really

1568
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:40,800
oh wow yeah i just checked we're really
 

1569
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,790
oh wow yeah i just checked we're really
low on time here so

1570
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:42,800
low on time here so
 

1571
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,710
low on time here so
maybe we'll just check a few more things

1572
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:44,720
maybe we'll just check a few more things
 

1573
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,950
maybe we'll just check a few more things
that is the 360 cannon over there

1574
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:48,960
that is the 360 cannon over there
 

1575
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,510
that is the 360 cannon over there
and i believe is it down here yeah down

1576
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:51,520
and i believe is it down here yeah down
 

1577
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,190
and i believe is it down here yeah down
here there's a slime farm i want to

1578
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,200
here there's a slime farm i want to
 

1579
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,470
here there's a slime farm i want to
check out

1580
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
check out
 

1581
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,230
check out
then we are going to head over to the

1582
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,240
then we are going to head over to the
 

1583
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,829
then we are going to head over to the
ice base

1584
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:57,839
ice base
 

1585
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,150
ice base
and that will probably be about it i

1586
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,160
and that will probably be about it i
 

1587
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,670
and that will probably be about it i
think for the tour there's more stuff we

1588
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:01,680
think for the tour there's more stuff we
 

1589
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:01,990
think for the tour there's more stuff we
could

1590
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,000
could
 

1591
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,430
could
check out but uh nothing

1592
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:05,440
check out but uh nothing
 

1593
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,750
check out but uh nothing
too significant that i can think of i

1594
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:07,760
too significant that i can think of i
 

1595
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,950
too significant that i can think of i
might have missed something though i

1596
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:08,960
might have missed something though i
 

1597
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,670
might have missed something though i
hope i didn't

1598
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:11,680
hope i didn't
 

1599
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,390
hope i didn't

but oh there's that creeper in there no
no all right so that's the slime farm

1624
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:51,359
no all right so that's the slime farm
 

1625
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,390
no all right so that's the slime farm
we're getting out of here we are so done

1626
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:54,400
we're getting out of here we are so done
 

1627
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,069
we're getting out of here we are so done
we are so done i think the water they

1628
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:58,079
we are so done i think the water they
 

1629
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,470
we are so done i think the water they
gonna shoot me

1630
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:00,480
gonna shoot me
 

1631
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,310
gonna shoot me
now we're good the water pushes all the

1632
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:02,320
now we're good the water pushes all the
 

1633
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,990
now we're good the water pushes all the
mobs to corner though

1634
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,000
mobs to corner though
 

1635
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,349
mobs to corner though
uh there's a whole line of pistons there

1636
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:07,359
uh there's a whole line of pistons there
 

1637
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,550
uh there's a whole line of pistons there
all right to the the ice base

1638
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:10,560
all right to the the ice base
 

1639
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,910
all right to the the ice base
can we get there through the nether

1640
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:11,920
can we get there through the nether
 

1641
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,470
can we get there through the nether
maybe we will try that too

1642
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:14,480
maybe we will try that too
 

1643
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,470
maybe we will try that too
yeah so let's go through the nether and

1644
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:16,480
yeah so let's go through the nether and
 

1645
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,630
yeah so let's go through the nether and
see if there's a portal

1646
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:18,640
see if there's a portal
 

1647
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,630
see if there's a portal
we can take through there this i believe

1648
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:20,640
we can take through there this i believe
 

1649
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,550
we can take through there this i believe
calls the cart down from the top

1650
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,560
calls the cart down from the top
 

1651
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,510
calls the cart down from the top
so it's always wherever we are right

1652
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:27,520
so it's always wherever we are right
 

1653
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,109
so it's always wherever we are right
maybe eventually there we go

1654
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:31,119
maybe eventually there we go
 

1655
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,230
maybe eventually there we go
it does it all right

1656
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:34,240
it does it all right
 

1657
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,750
it does it all right
so let's go check out the nether i know

1658
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:35,760
so let's go check out the nether i know
 

1659
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,430
so let's go check out the nether i know
we have a 360 cannon in the nether

1660
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:39,440
we have a 360 cannon in the nether
 

1661
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,829
we have a 360 cannon in the nether
for sure oh goody well we're stuck

1662
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
for sure oh goody well we're stuck
 

1663
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:51,190
for sure oh goody well we're stuck
gg um a little safe house here

1664
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,200

 

1665
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,109

what else oh i see a path

1666
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:55,119
what else oh i see a path
 

1667
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,550
what else oh i see a path
is that what we need to take there's

1668
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:56,560
is that what we need to take there's
 

1669
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,230
is that what we need to take there's
also a lower path i think

1670
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,240
also a lower path i think
 

1671
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,069
also a lower path i think
it's so dark

1672
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:04,079

 

1673
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,270

what is this path here

1674
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,280
what is this path here
 

1675
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,790
what is this path here
man there's a way down

1676
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:12,800
man there's a way down
 

1677
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,950
man there's a way down
let's take some boats we might need them

1678
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:16,960

 

1679
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,190

here let's turn these these fools down

1680
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,200
here let's turn these these fools down
 

1681
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,030
here let's turn these these fools down
too because they're really annoying

1682
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,040
too because they're really annoying
 

1683

this goes here and then you put the

1772
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:23,359
this goes here and then you put the
 

1773
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:23,910
this goes here and then you put the
other one

1774
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:23,920
other one
 

1775
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,750
other one
next to it to start it right

1779
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,270
beautiful yeah it definitely seems kind
of broken here i got it to work once so

1780
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:35,280

 

1781
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,349

there we go yay

there we go yay
 

1783
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,270
there we go yay
i think at this point of time though in

1784
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,280
i think at this point of time though in
 

1785
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,950
i think at this point of time though in
the game it's kind of broken for

1786
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:42,960
the game it's kind of broken for
 

1787
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,430
the game it's kind of broken for
whatever reason

1788
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:45,440
whatever reason
 

1789
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,790
whatever reason
and then it goes here there's another

1790
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:48,800
and then it goes here there's another
 

1791
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,310
and then it goes here there's another
one to send you back

1792
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:50,320
one to send you back
 

1793
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,069
one to send you back

stuff like that that was some really fun

1796
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:54,839
stuff like that that was some really fun
 

1797
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,310
stuff like that that was some really fun
stuff uh

1798
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,320
stuff uh
 

1799
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,390
stuff uh
then this goes down is this just to the

1800
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:58,400
then this goes down is this just to the
 

1801
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,750
then this goes down is this just to the
cannon

1802
00:39:59,750 --> 00:39:59,760
cannon
 

1803
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,550
cannon
i may not have i may not have had a

1804
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:02,560
i may not have i may not have had a
 

1805
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,270
i may not have i may not have had a
portal to the ice base

1806
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:07,280

 

1807
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,950

i think this just goes to the cannon

1808
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:08,960
i think this just goes to the cannon
 

1809
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,430

huh you know back then i didn't know how
 

1813
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,750
huh you know back then i didn't know how
portals worked and i might have been

1814
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:15,760
portals worked and i might have been
 

1815
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,470
portals worked and i might have been
afraid to

1816
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,480
afraid to
 

1817
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,150
afraid to
try use them

1818
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,160

 

1819
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,150

this thing was pretty cool too

1820
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,160
this thing was pretty cool too
 

1821
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,950

the wiring on this thing was pretty fun
 

1825
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,430
the wiring on this thing was pretty fun
to figure out

1826
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:33,440
to figure out
 

1827
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,430
to figure out
and it exploded many times how do you

1828
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:35,440
and it exploded many times how do you
 

1829
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,990
and it exploded many times how do you
get down

1830
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,000
get down
 

1831
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,510
get down
the variable timer on it let's just go

1832
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:41,520
the variable timer on it let's just go
 

1833
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,550
the variable timer on it let's just go
down like this

1834
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:42,560
down like this
 

1835
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:49,349
down like this
oh i think a gas shot at it

1836
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:49,359

 

1837
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,550

ah no no tnt here that's too bad

1838
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:54,560

 

1839
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,710

okay i had a lot of trouble finding this

1840
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:56,720
okay i had a lot of trouble finding this
 

1841
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,950
okay i had a lot of trouble finding this
place so i just reloaded the backup

1842
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:58,960
place so i just reloaded the backup
 

1843
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,069
place so i just reloaded the backup
i have and this is how it starts

1844
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:04,079
i have and this is how it starts
 

1845
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,630
i have and this is how it starts
woohoo let's let's try to figure out how

1846
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:06,640
woohoo let's let's try to figure out how
 

1847
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,030
woohoo let's let's try to figure out how
to get out of here without dying

1848
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,040
to get out of here without dying
 

1849
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,670
to get out of here without dying

00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:12,400
there was like lava that flowed down all
 

2029
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,829
there was like lava that flowed down all
the way through all the

2030
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:13,839
the way through all the
 

2031
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,910
the way through all the
the spawning pads and could shut this

2032
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:15,920
the spawning pads and could shut this
 

2033
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,190
the spawning pads and could shut this
one off

2034
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:19,200
one off
 

2035
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,870
one off
that lets water out okay

2036
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:22,880
that lets water out okay
 

2037
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,710
that lets water out okay
and then it flows over all the pads and

2038
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
and then it flows over all the pads and
 

2039
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,870
and then it flows over all the pads and
you can shut the pads off doing that

2040
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:26,880
you can shut the pads off doing that
 

2041
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,950
you can shut the pads off doing that

right

2096
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:37,920

 

2097
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,030

that's not as cool though

2100
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:46,160

 

2101
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,270

oh possibly

2102
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:51,280
oh possibly
 

2103
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,390
oh possibly
this doesn't work in 173 this might have

2104
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,400
this doesn't work in 173 this might have
 

2105
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,589
this doesn't work in 173 this might have
been

2106
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:55,599
been
 

2107
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,470

i think at this point tnt lost the

2110
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:02,880
i think at this point tnt lost the
 

2111
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,510
i think at this point tnt lost the
ability

2112
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:03,520
