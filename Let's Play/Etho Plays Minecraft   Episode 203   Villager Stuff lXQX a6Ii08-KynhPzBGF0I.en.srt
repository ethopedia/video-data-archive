over here this giant
reed farm just the simple

86
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
reed farm just the simple
 

87
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,510

and it's gotten pretty big
 

91
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,270
and it's gotten pretty big
because i haven't really had a like

92
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
because i haven't really had a like
 

93
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,109
because i haven't really had a like
large sections of time where i could

94
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
large sections of time where i could
 

95
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,550

98
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
so i just would come on here for a few
 

99
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:01,910
so i just would come on here for a few
minutes

100
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
minutes
 

101
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,030
minutes
work on this and then do that a little

102
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
work on this and then do that a little
 

103
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,830
work on this and then do that a little
bit every day

104
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
bit every day
 

105
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,790
bit every day
um and this tip growing and growing

106
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
um and this tip growing and growing
 

107
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,910
um and this tip growing and growing
and there's quite a bit of sugarcane

108
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
and there's quite a bit of sugarcane
 

109
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,630
and there's quite a bit of sugarcane
here

110
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
here
 

111
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,150
here
so it's just a simple farm there's no

112
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
so it's just a simple farm there's no
 

113
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,750
so it's just a simple farm there's no
automatic harvesting or anything like

114
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
automatic harvesting or anything like
 

115
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,550
automatic harvesting or anything like
that but

116
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
that but
 

117
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,630
that but
it's very very dense so we can just

118
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
it's very very dense so we can just
 

119
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,869
it's very very dense so we can just
do this and it should be

120
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879

 

121
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,630

really effective i would think just

122
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
really effective i would think just
 

123
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,910
really effective i would think just
because of the sheer

124
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
because of the sheer
 

125
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,190
because of the sheer
number

126
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200

 

127
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,110

of sugar cane here i think this will

128
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
of sugar cane here i think this will
 

129
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,030
of sugar cane here i think this will
fill up our inventory pretty quick

130
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040

 

131
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,229

and all it is is water with lily pads

132
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
and all it is is water with lily pads
 

133
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,150
and all it is is water with lily pads
above so we can run through here without

134
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
above so we can run through here without
 

135
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,390
above so we can run through here without
falling in every

136
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
falling in every
 

137
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,990
falling in every
every couple steps we take into the

138
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
every couple steps we take into the
 

139
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,790
every couple steps we take into the
water and below the water is a glowing

140
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
water and below the water is a glowing
 

141
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,949
water and below the water is a glowing
pumpkin so even at night

142
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
pumpkin so even at night
 

143
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,270
pumpkin so even at night
don't have to worry about mobs spawning

144
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
don't have to worry about mobs spawning
 

145
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,630
don't have to worry about mobs spawning
in here

146
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
in here
 

147
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,070
in here
and messing up my patterns and reeds and

148
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
and messing up my patterns and reeds and
 

149
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,670
and messing up my patterns and reeds and
all that

150
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680

 

151
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,110

so that's pretty cool

152
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120

 

153
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,190

oh yeah go over top

154
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
oh yeah go over top
 

155
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,710
oh yeah go over top
give a nice overview and i may continue

156
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
give a nice overview and i may continue
 

157
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,630
give a nice overview and i may continue
to expand it some more i'm not sure at

158
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
to expand it some more i'm not sure at
 

159
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,270
to expand it some more i'm not sure at
this point it's

160
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
this point it's
 

161
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,830
this point it's
uh it's pretty quick like

162
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840

 

163
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,149

i don't know i'm in the area so it just

164
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
i don't know i'm in the area so it just
 

165
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,229
i don't know i'm in the area so it just
grows and grows and grows

166
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
grows and grows and grows
 

167
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,270
grows and grows and grows
and don't need don't need to overdo it

168
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
and don't need don't need to overdo it
 

169
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,830
and don't need don't need to overdo it
but i might expand it some more

170
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
but i might expand it some more
 

171
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,110
but i might expand it some more
that way or something we'll see

172
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120

put the ice between the snowflake
 

195
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,110
put the ice between the snowflake
like we talked about and i don't know if

196
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
like we talked about and i don't know if

i'll
 

199
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,070
i'll
bother shaping it this episode might do

200
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
bother shaping it this episode might do
 

201
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,270
bother shaping it this episode might do
that in the future

202
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
that in the future
 

203
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,429
that in the future
but i'm going to film those spaces right

204
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
but i'm going to film those spaces right
 

205
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,070
but i'm going to film those spaces right
now

206
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080

 

207
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,830

man look at that i thought this the

208
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
man look at that i thought this the
 

209
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,270
man look at that i thought this the
field was going to look huge from up

210
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
field was going to look huge from up
 

211
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,229
field was going to look huge from up
here but it's this

212
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
here but it's this
 

213
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,430
here but it's this
tiny little thing

214
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440

 

215
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,550

it looks so big from down low though

216
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
it looks so big from down low though
 

217
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,110
it looks so big from down low though
oh well um yeah it's going to give us a

218
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
oh well um yeah it's going to give us a
 

219
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,990
oh well um yeah it's going to give us a
lot

220
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
lot
 

221
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,909
lot
of sugar cane i didn't even finish

222
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
of sugar cane i didn't even finish
 

223
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,430
of sugar cane i didn't even finish
harvesting it yet

224
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
harvesting it yet
 

225
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,110
harvesting it yet
and it wasn't even fully grown when i

226
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
and it wasn't even fully grown when i
 

227
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,030
and it wasn't even fully grown when i
did start

228
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
did start
 

229
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,950
did start
um looks like i'm gonna run out ice

230
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
um looks like i'm gonna run out ice
 

231
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,710
um looks like i'm gonna run out ice
though and i have to go harvest some

232
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
though and i have to go harvest some
 

233
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,830
though and i have to go harvest some
more

234
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
more
 

235
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,070
more
i use up four stacks pretty quickly yeah

236
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
i use up four stacks pretty quickly yeah
 

237
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,350
i use up four stacks pretty quickly yeah
it turns out

238
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
it turns out
 

239
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,150
it turns out
like every every water spot there was an

240
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
like every every water spot there was an
 

241
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,070
like every every water spot there was an
ice block that i just

242
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
ice block that i just
 

243
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,310
ice block that i just
that i let melt or i broke it myself so

244
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
that i let melt or i broke it myself so
 

245
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,790
that i let melt or i broke it myself so
the nice thing about ice is it's like

246
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
the nice thing about ice is it's like
 

247
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,950
the nice thing about ice is it's like
water that stacks you can you can bring

248
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
water that stacks you can you can bring
 

249
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,990
water that stacks you can you can bring
it with you

250
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
it with you
 

251
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,909
it with you
places really easy instead of using

252
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
places really easy instead of using
 

253
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,670
places really easy instead of using
water buckets so that's kind of

254
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
water buckets so that's kind of
 

255
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,950
water buckets so that's kind of
what i've gotten into doing now

256
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
what i've gotten into doing now
 

257
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,590
what i've gotten into doing now
uh well let's see how this looks anyway

258
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
uh well let's see how this looks anyway
 

259
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,430
uh well let's see how this looks anyway
go get some more ice

260
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
go get some more ice
 

261
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,909
go get some more ice
decide if we like it oh yeah that's

262
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
decide if we like it oh yeah that's
 

263
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,710
decide if we like it oh yeah that's
that's pretty cool

264
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
that's pretty cool
 

265
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,909
that's pretty cool
yeah i like that cool

266
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
yeah i like that cool
 

267
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,350
yeah i like that cool
here's a night shot of the thing very

268
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
here's a night shot of the thing very
 

269
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,070
here's a night shot of the thing very
bright

270
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080

 

271
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:46,629

oh yeah

272
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639

 

273
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,710

excellent so we got enough ice to finish

274
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
excellent so we got enough ice to finish
 

275
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,710
excellent so we got enough ice to finish
the snowflake finally

276
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
the snowflake finally
 

277
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,550
the snowflake finally
it looks pretty cool no pun intended

278
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
it looks pretty cool no pun intended
 

279
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,870
it looks pretty cool no pun intended
and we can see through we won't fall

280
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
and we can see through we won't fall
 

281
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,029
and we can see through we won't fall
through

282
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
through
 

283
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,790
through
let's go check it out from below um

284
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
let's go check it out from below um
 

285
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,150
let's go check it out from below um
gotta be real careful with the lighting

286
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
gotta be real careful with the lighting
 

287
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,990
gotta be real careful with the lighting
up here haven't figured it out yet

288
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
up here haven't figured it out yet
 

289
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,790
up here haven't figured it out yet
otherwise this ice will start melting

290
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
otherwise this ice will start melting
 

291
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,830
otherwise this ice will start melting
and water will flow down if we update it

292
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
and water will flow down if we update it
 

293
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,710
and water will flow down if we update it
i'm glad that like when ice melts it

294
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
i'm glad that like when ice melts it
 

295
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,430
i'm glad that like when ice melts it
still

296
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
still
 

297
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,350
still
and it creates water the water doesn't

298
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
and it creates water the water doesn't
 

299
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,550
and it creates water the water doesn't
start flowing

300
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
start flowing
 

301
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,070
start flowing
automatically on its own you still have

302
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
automatically on its own you still have
 

303
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,230
automatically on its own you still have
to update it which is

304
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
to update it which is
 

305
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,469
to update it which is
always a good thing otherwise you can

306
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
always a good thing otherwise you can
 

307
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,670
always a good thing otherwise you can
easily make a mess

308
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
easily make a mess
 

309
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,469
easily make a mess
of things oh yeah that looks pretty good

310
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
of things oh yeah that looks pretty good
 

311
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,110
of things oh yeah that looks pretty good
cool so that's just the 2d version of it

312
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
cool so that's just the 2d version of it
 

313
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,070
cool so that's just the 2d version of it
i still plan on

314
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
i still plan on
 

315
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,110
i still plan on
shaping it like i said i wanted to

316
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
shaping it like i said i wanted to
 

317
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,189
shaping it like i said i wanted to
start out thin at the edges and kind of

318
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
start out thin at the edges and kind of
 

319
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,710
start out thin at the edges and kind of
get

320
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
get
 

321
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,110
get
slowly get thicker and thicker and then

322
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
slowly get thicker and thicker and then
 

323
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,830
slowly get thicker and thicker and then
quickly get fatter and fatter

324
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
quickly get fatter and fatter
 

325
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,189
quickly get fatter and fatter
and make it sort of cone-shaped

326
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
and make it sort of cone-shaped
 

327
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,950
and make it sort of cone-shaped
have an ice elevator all the way up

328
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
have an ice elevator all the way up
 

329
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,710
have an ice elevator all the way up
actually that's something we'll do in

330
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
actually that's something we'll do in
 

331
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,309
actually that's something we'll do in
another day or

332
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
another day or
 

333
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,230
another day or
or something um

334
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240

 

335
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,749

oh do that accidentally hit right click

336
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
oh do that accidentally hit right click
 

337
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,790
oh do that accidentally hit right click
um yeah

338
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
um yeah
 

339
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,870
um yeah

exactly when i tried it
 

683
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,350
exactly when i tried it
before it was solid underground

684
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
before it was solid underground
 

685
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,870
before it was solid underground

entrance to the village what we're gonna
 

739
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,150
entrance to the village what we're gonna
blow up here

740
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
blow up here
 

741
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,150
blow up here
and then we can expand it further later

742
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160

 

743
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,670

up here and then we will continue to
 

785
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,830
up here and then we will continue to
expand it though as we get more into

786
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
expand it though as we get more into
 

787
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,110

tnt this was all i had

788
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120

790
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799

 

791
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,150

very good

792
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160

 

793
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,270

um you know what on second thought this

794
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
um you know what on second thought this
 

795
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,549
um you know what on second thought this
isn't quite what i want

796
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
isn't quite what i want
 

797
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,950
isn't quite what i want
uh what i'm would prefer is if the

798
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
uh what i'm would prefer is if the
 

799
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,909
uh what i'm would prefer is if the
ground was

800
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
ground was
 

801
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,310
ground was
about five blocks higher and the ceiling

802
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,320
about five blocks higher and the ceiling
 

803
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,310
about five blocks higher and the ceiling
went up five blocks more too

804
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
went up five blocks more too
 

805
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,230
went up five blocks more too
so we should have put that blast a

806
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
so we should have put that blast a
 

807
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,990
so we should have put that blast a
little bit higher

808
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000

 

809
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,830

this is i think this is too much of a

810
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
this is i think this is too much of a
 

811
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,310
this is i think this is too much of a
drop and that ceiling isn't as high as i

812
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,320
drop and that ceiling isn't as high as i
 

813
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,110
drop and that ceiling isn't as high as i
would have liked

814
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120
would have liked
 

815
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,830
would have liked
so i'm gonna reload the back up we'll

816
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
so i'm gonna reload the back up we'll
 

817
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,270
so i'm gonna reload the back up we'll
try it again

818
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
try it again
 

819
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,669
try it again
except a little bit higher

820
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679

 

821
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,669

all right so i repositioned it it's

822
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
all right so i repositioned it it's
 

823
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,830
all right so i repositioned it it's
about five blocks higher now

824
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
about five blocks higher now
 

825
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,870
about five blocks higher now
um being pretty picky about this i know

826
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:46,880
um being pretty picky about this i know
 

827
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,150
um being pretty picky about this i know
i know but it'll save me a lot of work

828
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
i know but it'll save me a lot of work
 

829
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,110
i know but it'll save me a lot of work
if i get this

830
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
if i get this
 

831
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,710
if i get this
first blast right i think

832
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
first blast right i think
 

833
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,549
first blast right i think
has a big effect on the project so i

834
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,559
has a big effect on the project so i
 

835
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,390
has a big effect on the project so i
want to make sure it's right

836
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400
want to make sure it's right
 

837
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,669
want to make sure it's right
or the way i want it

838
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:01,679
or the way i want it
 

839
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,310
or the way i want it
which may not be right um

840
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320
which may not be right um
 

841
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,990
which may not be right um

843
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,070

to do about the borders because i wanted
 

997
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,470
to do about the borders because i wanted
a

998

a
 

999
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,029
a
like a one wide border over here and we

1000
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:03,039
like a one wide border over here and we
 

1001
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,950
like a one wide border over here and we
also have sort of a border here with the

1002
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:04,960
also have sort of a border here with the
 

1003
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,870
also have sort of a border here with the
logs

1004
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:06,880
logs
 

1005
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,110
logs
but now we can place logs sideways or

1006
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
but now we can place logs sideways or
 

1007
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,789
but now we can place logs sideways or
something apparently

1008

something apparently
 

1009
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,470
something apparently
so i was thinking it might look good if

1010
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,480
so i was thinking it might look good if
 

1011
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,230
so i was thinking it might look good if
we had these sideways so it would be

1012
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,240
we had these sideways so it would be
 

1013
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,270
we had these sideways so it would be
dark

1014
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
dark
 

1015
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,149
dark
instead of light like that and also put

00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
instead of light like that and also put
 

1017
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,350
instead of light like that and also put
them sideways

1018
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
them sideways
 

1019
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,110
them sideways
here to get the wood look

1020
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
here to get the wood look
 

1021
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,270
here to get the wood look
um i had let's see if i can figure out

1022
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:25,280
um i had let's see if i can figure out
 

1023
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,590
um i had let's see if i can figure out
how to put them sideways

1024
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:27,600
how to put them sideways
 

1025
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,230
how to put them sideways
apparently it's really easy oh cool

1026
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240
apparently it's really easy oh cool
 

1027
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,510
apparently it's really easy oh cool
that was easier than i thought um how do

1028
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
that was easier than i thought um how do
 

1029
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,669
that was easier than i thought um how do
you put them

1030
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:39,679

 

1031
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,830

i guess it's like placing a piston type

1032
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:41,840
i guess it's like placing a piston type
 

1033
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,190
i guess it's like placing a piston type
thing

1034
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
thing
 

1035
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,630
thing
oh i bet you can do a lot of cool stuff

1036
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:46,640
oh i bet you can do a lot of cool stuff
 

1037
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,830
oh i bet you can do a lot of cool stuff
with that

1038
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:47,840
with that
 

1039
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,149
with that
okay so yeah we can probably put this

1040
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:50,159
okay so yeah we can probably put this
 

1041
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,830
okay so yeah we can probably put this
stuff sideways

1042
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
stuff sideways
 

1043
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,430
stuff sideways
um

1044
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,440

 

1045
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,590

not sure how that would oh wait wait a

1046
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
not sure how that would oh wait wait a
 

1047
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,710
not sure how that would oh wait wait a
minute the grain

1048
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720
minute the grain
 

1049
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,230
minute the grain
is like that then

1050
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,240
is like that then
 

1051
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:11,990
is like that then
hmm i wonder if that's better

1052
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000

 

1053
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,710

that looks so weird why does that look

1054
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
that looks so weird why does that look
 

1055
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,350
that looks so weird why does that look
so weird

1056
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
so weird
 

1057
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,669
so weird
is it different by the direction like if

1058
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
is it different by the direction like if
 

1059
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,350
is it different by the direction like if
i place one like this and then i place

1060
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,360
i place one like this and then i place
 

1061
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,029
i place one like this and then i place
one like this

1062
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,039
one like this
 

1063
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,070
one like this
it's gonna be the same yeah it's the

1064
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080
it's gonna be the same yeah it's the
 

1065
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,750
it's gonna be the same yeah it's the
same

1066
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760

 

1067
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,830

pretty sure

1068
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840

 

1069
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,350

well yeah it is it's the same

1070
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:39,360
well yeah it is it's the same
 

1071
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,590
well yeah it is it's the same
okay

1072
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600

 

1073
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:53,750

hmm trying to decide if i like it or not

1074
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:53,760

 

1075
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,510

maybe i'll put a few of those down

1076
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
maybe i'll put a few of those down
 

1077
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,590
maybe i'll put a few of those down
anyway another thing i want to check

1078
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600
anyway another thing i want to check
 

1079
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,510
anyway another thing i want to check
out i'll put a few of those down and

1080
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
out i'll put a few of those down and
 

1081
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,510
out i'll put a few of those down and
we'll check that in just a bit

1082
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520
we'll check that in just a bit
 

1083
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,590
we'll check that in just a bit
but uh i know in the past if you had ice

1084
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,600
but uh i know in the past if you had ice
 

1085
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,909
but uh i know in the past if you had ice
and half slabs above you would still get

1086
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:07,919
and half slabs above you would still get
 

1087
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,110
and half slabs above you would still get
the

1088
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,120
the
 

1089
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,710
the
would still be like you're on ice

1090
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
would still be like you're on ice
 

1091
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,310
would still be like you're on ice
walking on the half slab so we're going

1092
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
walking on the half slab so we're going
 

1093
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,029
walking on the half slab so we're going
to try that out

1094
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
to try that out
 

1095
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,710
to try that out
see if it still works i'm a little

1096
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,720
see if it still works i'm a little
 

1097
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,310
see if it still works i'm a little
scared of using it because it might get

1098
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
scared of using it because it might get
 

1099
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,750
scared of using it because it might get
patched

1100
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:19,760
patched
 

1101
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,789
patched
everything seems to get patched if i use

1102
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
everything seems to get patched if i use
 

1103
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,789
everything seems to get patched if i use
it in my world

1104
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:24,799
it in my world
 

1105
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,390
it in my world
get out of here torches

1106
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,400
get out of here torches
 

1107
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,990
get out of here torches
um

1108
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,000

 

1109
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,390

if we use ice with this project we can

1110
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:34,400
if we use ice with this project we can
 

1111
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,909
if we use ice with this project we can
only use a certain amount

1112
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:35,919
only use a certain amount
 

1113
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,350
only use a certain amount
because i'm worried it's going to start

1114
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,360
because i'm worried it's going to start
 

1115
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,590
because i'm worried it's going to start
melting

1116
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
melting
 

1117
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,470
melting
okay so when you jump on ice you kind of

1118
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:42,480
okay so when you jump on ice you kind of
 

1119
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,190
okay so when you jump on ice you kind of
take off

1120
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
take off
 

1121
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,029
take off
you get a speed boost let's see if we

1122
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039
you get a speed boost let's see if we
 

1123
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,470
you get a speed boost let's see if we
get the same thing with this

1124
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,480
get the same thing with this
 

1125
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,710
get the same thing with this
also you can slide items on ice

1126
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,720
also you can slide items on ice
 

1127
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,470
also you can slide items on ice
oh it still does work on half slabs it's

1128
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,480
oh it still does work on half slabs it's
 

1129
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,710
oh it still does work on half slabs it's
cool

1130
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
cool
 

1131
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,310
cool
very cool so let's just make sure it

1132
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
very cool so let's just make sure it
 

1133
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,029
very cool so let's just make sure it
works with us

1134
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:01,039
works with us
 

1135
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:07,269
works with us
yeah i think it did there yeah

1136
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:07,279

 

1137
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,830

so we can hide the ice underground and

1138
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:09,840
so we can hide the ice underground and
 

1139
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,750
so we can hide the ice underground and
then we can have half slabs two like we

1140
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
then we can have half slabs two like we
 

1141
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,190
then we can have half slabs two like we
wanted because i didn't want it to be

1142
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,200
wanted because i didn't want it to be
 

1143
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,950
wanted because i didn't want it to be
two blocks down i only wanted it one and

1144
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:16,960
two blocks down i only wanted it one and
 

1145
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,630
two blocks down i only wanted it one and
a half down

1146
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,640
a half down
 

1147
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,590
a half down
so that works out perfect

1148
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600

 

1149
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,269

also it probably won't melt if it's

1150
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:25,279
also it probably won't melt if it's
 

1151
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,149
also it probably won't melt if it's
covered like that right

1152
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:28,159
covered like that right
 

1153
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,789
covered like that right
which is another benefit don't have to

1154
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:30,799
which is another benefit don't have to
 

1155
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,269
which is another benefit don't have to
worry about that

1156
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279
worry about that
 

1157
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,430
worry about that
um

1158
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,440

 

1159
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,710

what else should we do with these stairs

1160
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:40,720
what else should we do with these stairs
 

1161
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,070
what else should we do with these stairs
i'll probably keep the light wood

1162
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
i'll probably keep the light wood
 

1163
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,750
i'll probably keep the light wood
and then have dark wood it highlights

1164
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:43,760
and then have dark wood it highlights
 

1165
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,669
and then have dark wood it highlights
the stairs if it's light here and dark

1166
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:45,679
the stairs if it's light here and dark
 

1167
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,149
the stairs if it's light here and dark
here

1168
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:46,159
here
 

1169
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,310
here
instead of having this the dark the dark

1170
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320
instead of having this the dark the dark
 

1171
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,310
instead of having this the dark the dark
planks as well

1172
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
planks as well
 

1173
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:59,220
planks as well
do this just see how this looks

1174
00:26:59,220 --> 00:26:59,230

 

1175
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:03,430

[Music]

1176
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,440

 

1177
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,350

we're not going to do it all one color

1178
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:05,360
we're not going to do it all one color
 

1179
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,630
we're not going to do it all one color
like this i just wanna

1180
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:06,640
like this i just wanna
 

1181
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,029
like this i just wanna
see the shape see if it's something we'd

1182
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:09,039
see the shape see if it's something we'd
 

1183
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,430
see the shape see if it's something we'd
like

1184
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440

 

1185
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,630

yeah it's pretty good okay

1186
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:14,640
yeah it's pretty good okay
 

1187
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,710
yeah it's pretty good okay
uh to figure out the actual size of this

1188
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
uh to figure out the actual size of this
 

1189
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,110
uh to figure out the actual size of this
room i need to take inventory of every

1190
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,120
room i need to take inventory of every
 

1191
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,070
room i need to take inventory of every
single item

1192
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,080
single item
 

1193
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,310
single item
in the game organize it into groups

1194
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:24,320
in the game organize it into groups
 

1195
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,750
in the game organize it into groups
and figure out how many chests i need

1196
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:27,760
and figure out how many chests i need
 

1197
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,190
and figure out how many chests i need
and once i got that all figured out i'll

1198
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:31,200
and once i got that all figured out i'll
 

1199
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,350
and once i got that all figured out i'll
figure out i'll be able to figure out

1200
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,360
figure out i'll be able to figure out
 

1201
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,470
figure out i'll be able to figure out
how far apart

1202
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:34,480
how far apart
 

1203
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,990
how far apart
i want this from the wall

1204
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,000
i want this from the wall
 

1205
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,070
i want this from the wall
type thing so that's something i do

1206
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,080
type thing so that's something i do
 

1207
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,149
type thing so that's something i do
off-camera sometime

1208
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:42,159
off-camera sometime
 

1209
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,990
off-camera sometime
uh probably take me a couple hours to

1210
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,000
uh probably take me a couple hours to
 

1211
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,350
uh probably take me a couple hours to
organize it all

1212
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
organize it all
 

1213
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,630
organize it all
it's the same thing i did with the old

1214
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
it's the same thing i did with the old
 

1215
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,830
it's the same thing i did with the old
storage room just

1216
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:49,840
storage room just
 

1217
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,430
storage room just
a lot more items now than back then

1218
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,440
a lot more items now than back then
 

1219
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,870
a lot more items now than back then
so it'll take even longer

1220
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:56,880

 

1221
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,110

but yeah this is cool

1222
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,120

 

1223
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:11,029

no that doesn't look good not doing that

1224
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039

 

1225
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,470

and you know what i don't like the

1226
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:12,480
and you know what i don't like the
 

1227
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,630
and you know what i don't like the
sideways logs for these either

1228
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:14,640
sideways logs for these either
 

1229
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,549
sideways logs for these either
so we're not doing them there

1230
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559

 

1231
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,590

i want to get those back

1232
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:21,600
i want to get those back
 

1233
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,870
i want to get those back
yeah i just realized we got to

1234
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:22,880
yeah i just realized we got to
 

1235
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,710
yeah i just realized we got to
incorporate snow somehow too

1236
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
incorporate snow somehow too
 

1237
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,630
incorporate snow somehow too
we can't just have snow in the middle we

1238
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:26,640
we can't just have snow in the middle we
 

1239
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,750
we can't just have snow in the middle we
need it

1240
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:27,760
need it
 

1241
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,470
need it
on the outside as well to carry out the

1242
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:30,480
on the outside as well to carry out the
 

1243
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,870
on the outside as well to carry out the
feel

1244
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:32,880

 

1245
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,669

um so i got some snow with us we're

1246
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:35,679
um so i got some snow with us we're
 

1247
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,190
um so i got some snow with us we're
going to try to play with this some more

1248
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,200
going to try to play with this some more
 

1249
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,510
going to try to play with this some more
and again this doesn't need to be grass

1250
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:41,520
and again this doesn't need to be grass
 

1251
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,830
and again this doesn't need to be grass
it probably won't be when we're done

1252
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:45,840
it probably won't be when we're done
 

1253
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,710
it probably won't be when we're done
i was wondering how it would look if we

1254
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:48,720
i was wondering how it would look if we
 

1255
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,190
i was wondering how it would look if we
did

1256
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200
did
 

1257
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,630
did
an outline here

1258
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:54,640

 

1259
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,830

so the half slabs would come up to the

1260
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:56,840
so the half slabs would come up to the
 

1261
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,230
so the half slabs would come up to the
snow

1262
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,240
snow
 

1263
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,789
snow
and it would go all the way around this

1264
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:02,799

 

1265
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,710

type thing now let's go get some more of

1266
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:06,720
type thing now let's go get some more of
 

1267
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,590
type thing now let's go get some more of
these

1268
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:07,600
these
 

1269
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,990
these
underneath the half slabs will be ice so

1270
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,000
underneath the half slabs will be ice so
 

1271
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,190
underneath the half slabs will be ice so
we can jump around quickly and

1272
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
we can jump around quickly and
 

1273
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,510
we can jump around quickly and
and why not oh ooh

1274
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:17,520

 

1275
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,350

did not know i had that there i have a

1276
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360
did not know i had that there i have a
 

1277
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,950
did not know i had that there i have a
lot of iron now

1278
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:20,960
lot of iron now
 

1279
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,149
lot of iron now
lots of lots of materials

1280
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:24,159
lots of lots of materials
 

1281
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,190
lots of lots of materials
of all types

1282
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,200
of all types
 

1283
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,990
of all types
yeah let's see how this goes

1284
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,000

 

1285
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,750

and we could we could change this too

1286
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
and we could we could change this too
 

1287
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,789
and we could we could change this too
like we could have the dark plank

1288
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:36,799
like we could have the dark plank
 

1289
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,470
like we could have the dark plank
half slabs here and then with the border

1290
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:40,480
half slabs here and then with the border
 

1291
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,870
half slabs here and then with the border
and then

1292
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:40,880
and then
 

1293
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,630
and then
have the light ones on the inside type

1294
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:42,640
have the light ones on the inside type
 

1295
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:52,340
have the light ones on the inside type
thing or something like that

1296
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,350

 

1297
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,669

[Music]

1298
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:53,679
[Music]
 

1299
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,870
[Music]
it's not too bad because we could have

1300
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:56,880
it's not too bad because we could have
 

1301
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,950
it's not too bad because we could have
have snow here and then on this side we

1302
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:58,960
have snow here and then on this side we
 

1303
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,149
have snow here and then on this side we
could also have

1304
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:00,159
could also have
 

1305
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,750
could also have
a line of snow then it would carry out

1306
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:01,760
a line of snow then it would carry out
 

1307
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,590
a line of snow then it would carry out
the look pretty good

1308
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:05,600

 

1309
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,310

maybe because we don't have enough snow

1310
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,320
maybe because we don't have enough snow
 

1311
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,070
maybe because we don't have enough snow
snow themed stuff and if we cover up the

1312
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,080
snow themed stuff and if we cover up the
 

1313
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:20,830
snow themed stuff and if we cover up the
ice it's going to be even less

1314
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:20,840

 

1315
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,230

okay

1316
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,240

 

1317
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,990

yeah this is kind of what i was thinking

1318
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,000
yeah this is kind of what i was thinking
 

1319
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,830
yeah this is kind of what i was thinking
with the dark planks have them go around

1320
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:27,840
with the dark planks have them go around
 

1321
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,710
with the dark planks have them go around
the snow like this

1322
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:28,720
the snow like this
 

1323
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,909
the snow like this
as well then we have the light planks

1324
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:31,919
as well then we have the light planks
 

1325
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,630
as well then we have the light planks
here and depending on how wide these

1326
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:34,640
here and depending on how wide these
 

1327
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,510
here and depending on how wide these
become we

1328
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:35,520
become we
 

1329
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,029
become we
will try to mix some

1330
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:39,039
will try to mix some
 

1331
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,310
will try to mix some
dark plant texture in with them as well

1332
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,320
dark plant texture in with them as well
 

1333
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,750
dark plant texture in with them as well
just so it's not plain anywhere

1334
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:45,760
just so it's not plain anywhere
 

1335
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,510
just so it's not plain anywhere
what do you guys think do you like that

1336
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,520
what do you guys think do you like that
 

1337
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,750
what do you guys think do you like that
yes no

1338
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:49,760
yes no
 

1339
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,950
yes no
i think it could be pretty cool i'm

1340
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:52,960
i think it could be pretty cool i'm
 

1341
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,230
i think it could be pretty cool i'm
still deciding if i want to keep the

1342
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,240
still deciding if i want to keep the
 

1343
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,870
still deciding if i want to keep the
grass or not it really does look good

1344
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:56,880
grass or not it really does look good
 

1345
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,149
grass or not it really does look good
but i don't want to copy the old

1346
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
but i don't want to copy the old
 

1347
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,310
but i don't want to copy the old
design either not that we really are

1348
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,320
design either not that we really are
 

1349
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,750
design either not that we really are
this is already quite different than

1350
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:03,760
this is already quite different than
 

1351
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,110
this is already quite different than
what i'm used to

1352
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
