without way iron golems work look look
 

195
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,280

right there for some reason most the
 

197

right there for some reason most the
mobs will actually try to kill iron

198
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:31,510
mobs will actually try to kill iron
 

199
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,240
mobs will actually try to kill iron
golems like they'll actually chase after

200
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,250
golems like they'll actually chase after
 

201
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,230
golems like they'll actually chase after
them and attack them before that didn't

202
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,240
them and attack them before that didn't
 

203
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,180
them and attack them before that didn't
happen and the iron golems would just

204
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,190
happen and the iron golems would just
 

205
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,280
happen and the iron golems would just
kill everything and not get attacked

206
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,290
kill everything and not get attacked
 

207
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,430
kill everything and not get attacked
back pretty much so now in the 30c

208
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:44,440
back pretty much so now in the 30c
 

209
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,090
back pretty much so now in the 30c
snapshot it looks like they still can

210
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:48,100
snapshot it looks like they still can
 

211
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,760
snapshot it looks like they still can
attack the zombie pigmen without getting

212
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:50,770
attack the zombie pigmen without getting
 

213
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,070
attack the zombie pigmen without getting
attacked back oh you see that baby

214
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,080
attacked back oh you see that baby
 

215
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,800
attacked back oh you see that baby
chasing after the iron golem though down

216
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:55,810
chasing after the iron golem though down
 

217
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,740
chasing after the iron golem though down
there um what's going for a closer look

218
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:00,750
there um what's going for a closer look
 

219
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,050
there um what's going for a closer look
yeah so we have to do something about

220
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:04,060
yeah so we have to do something about
 

221
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,080
yeah so we have to do something about
this because the iron golems are taking

222
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,090
this because the iron golems are taking
 

223
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,430
this because the iron golems are taking
damage over time here and eventually

224
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:08,440
damage over time here and eventually
 

225
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,880
damage over time here and eventually
they'll all die unless we can somehow

226
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:11,890
they'll all die unless we can somehow
 

227
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,670
they'll all die unless we can somehow
heal them right so we're going to be

228
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:14,680
heal them right so we're going to be
 

229
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,750
heal them right so we're going to be
using regen potions why is the tool text

230
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:18,760
using regen potions why is the tool text
 

231
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,040
using regen potions why is the tool text
behind these I can't read it we're gonna

232
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,050
behind these I can't read it we're gonna
 

233
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,070
behind these I can't read it we're gonna
try to use regen potions no here we go

234
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
try to use regen potions no here we go
 

235
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,280
try to use regen potions no here we go
he's like even creepers will chase after

236
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,290
he's like even creepers will chase after
 

237
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,260
he's like even creepers will chase after
iron golems and just explode on them

238
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,270
iron golems and just explode on them
 

239
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,029
iron golems and just explode on them
it's crazy

240
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:34,039

 

241
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,969

it's a chicken after them not you too

242
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:37,979
it's a chicken after them not you too
 

243
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:41,989
it's a chicken after them not you too
chicken come on they're good guys so my

244
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:41,999
chicken come on they're good guys so my
 

245
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,290
chicken come on they're good guys so my
plan this is what we're going to do I

246
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:44,300
plan this is what we're going to do I
 

247
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,969
plan this is what we're going to do I
think we should try to get a magma cube

248
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:46,979
think we should try to get a magma cube
 

249
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,329
think we should try to get a magma cube
on the roof here name them with a

250
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:50,339
on the roof here name them with a
 

251
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:51,799
on the roof here name them with a
nametag I'm going to use Uncle Leo

252
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:51,809
nametag I'm going to use Uncle Leo
 

253
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:55,629
nametag I'm going to use Uncle Leo
because I had that laying around and

254
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:55,639
because I had that laying around and
 

255
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:58,399
because I had that laying around and
when a magma cube is in the middle here

256
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:58,409
when a magma cube is in the middle here
 

257
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:02,570
when a magma cube is in the middle here
all these iron golems will will flock to

258
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:02,580
all these iron golems will will flock to
 

259
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,010
all these iron golems will will flock to
the middle and try to attack it but they

260
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,020
the middle and try to attack it but they
 

261
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,379
the middle and try to attack it but they
won't be able to reach it I believe and

262
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:06,389
won't be able to reach it I believe and
 

263
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:09,709
won't be able to reach it I believe and
then if I'm here in the middle as well

264
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:09,719
then if I'm here in the middle as well
 

265
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,779
then if I'm here in the middle as well
nothing else can spawn so it'll be the

266
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:11,789
nothing else can spawn so it'll be the
 

267
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:13,369
nothing else can spawn so it'll be the
only mob that they'll be able to track

268
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:13,379
only mob that they'll be able to track
 

269
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,799
only mob that they'll be able to track
so they'll all flock to the middle and

270
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:15,809
so they'll all flock to the middle and
 

271
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:17,929
so they'll all flock to the middle and
then we dispense a regen potion on them

272
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:17,939
then we dispense a regen potion on them
 

273
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,489
then we dispense a regen potion on them
and if we do that every so often that

274
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:19,499
and if we do that every so often that
 

275
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:23,029
and if we do that every so often that
should keep them alive and then after we

276
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
should keep them alive and then after we
 

277
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,879
should keep them alive and then after we
dispense the regen potion move myself

278
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:25,889
dispense the regen potion move myself
 

279
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,649
dispense the regen potion move myself
and the magma cube away from here away

280
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:30,659
and the magma cube away from here away
 

281
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,439
and the magma cube away from here away
from the middle up to there or something

282
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:32,449
from the middle up to there or something
 

283
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:36,829
from the middle up to there or something
on a rail line and then stuff can stuff

284
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:36,839
on a rail line and then stuff can stuff
 

285
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,239
on a rail line and then stuff can stuff
we'll be able to spawn here again and

286
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,249
we'll be able to spawn here again and
 

287
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,980
we'll be able to spawn here again and
iron golems will start tracking the

288
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:39,990
iron golems will start tracking the
 

289
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,809
iron golems will start tracking the
other mobs so that is the plan I guess

290
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:44,819
other mobs so that is the plan I guess
 

291
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,489
other mobs so that is the plan I guess
we gotta try to get a magma cube on the

292
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:46,499
we gotta try to get a magma cube on the
 

293
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:51,889
we gotta try to get a magma cube on the
roof that should be fun there's

294
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:51,899
roof that should be fun there's
 

295
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,760
roof that should be fun there's
something wrong with these guys they

296
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:55,770
something wrong with these guys they
 

297
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:00,860
something wrong with these guys they
just take it now all right I can live

298
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:00,870
just take it now all right I can live
 

299
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,480
just take it now all right I can live
with that um I'm just making a little

300
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:05,490
with that um I'm just making a little
 

301
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,249
with that um I'm just making a little
spotting platform at the top here and

302
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:07,259
spotting platform at the top here and
 

303
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,829
spotting platform at the top here and
hopefully we get a magma cube okay I

304
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:12,839
hopefully we get a magma cube okay I
 

305
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,799
hopefully we get a magma cube okay I
just had another idea though this one

306
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:15,809
just had another idea though this one
 

307
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:20,570
just had another idea though this one
might be way better I'm pretty sure the

308
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:20,580
might be way better I'm pretty sure the
 

309
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,070
might be way better I'm pretty sure the
only reason the zombies are spawning is

310
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
only reason the zombies are spawning is
 

311
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,779
only reason the zombies are spawning is
because there's dark spots in the nether

312
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:23,789
because there's dark spots in the nether
 

313
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:25,429
because there's dark spots in the nether
here so I'm lighting up all these little

314
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:25,439
here so I'm lighting up all these little
 

315
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,540
here so I'm lighting up all these little
dark patches where it's like light level

316
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:28,550
dark patches where it's like light level
 

317
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,409
dark patches where it's like light level
gets down to seven in very few places

318
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:33,419
gets down to seven in very few places
 

319
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,110
gets down to seven in very few places
but it does if we light all those up I'm

320
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,120
but it does if we light all those up I'm
 

321
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,699
but it does if we light all those up I'm
pretty sure the zombies won't spawn any

322
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:37,709
pretty sure the zombies won't spawn any
 

323
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:40,909
pretty sure the zombies won't spawn any
more and if they don't spawn these guys

324
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:40,919
more and if they don't spawn these guys
 

325
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,670
more and if they don't spawn these guys
aren't going to take much damage the

326
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
aren't going to take much damage the
 

327
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,590
aren't going to take much damage the
only thing that will damage them is the

328
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
only thing that will damage them is the
 

329
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,590
only thing that will damage them is the
magma cubes and

330
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:46,600
magma cubes and
 

331
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,990
magma cubes and
doesn't happen very often and it turns

332
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
doesn't happen very often and it turns
 

333
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,139
doesn't happen very often and it turns
out the plan works perfectly there's no

334
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:55,149

339
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:01,470
all the lights out of the ceiling
they're in the ground now and I had to

340
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:01,480
they're in the ground now and I had to
 

341
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,939
they're in the ground now and I had to
redo it a couple times it turns out I

342
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:04,949
redo it a couple times it turns out I
 

343
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:07,379
redo it a couple times it turns out I
learned something new today those

344
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:07,389
learned something new today those
 

345
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:10,379
learned something new today those
zombies that spawn when you when you hit

346
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:10,389
zombies that spawn when you when you hit
 

347
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:12,030
zombies that spawn when you when you hit
a zombie in it like calls for

348
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,040
a zombie in it like calls for
 

349
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,490
a zombie in it like calls for
reinforcements that happens at light

350
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:14,500
reinforcements that happens at light
 

351
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,460
reinforcements that happens at light
level 9 and less so right now the

352
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:17,470
level 9 and less so right now the
 

353
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,040
level 9 and less so right now the
darkest spot in here is light level 10

354
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,050
darkest spot in here is light level 10
 

355
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,319
darkest spot in here is light level 10
and it goes up from there

356
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:22,329
and it goes up from there
 

357
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,800
and it goes up from there
so they can't spawn anywhere anymore

358
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:24,810
so they can't spawn anywhere anymore
 

359
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,470
so they can't spawn anywhere anymore
which is great and these guys should

360
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
which is great and these guys should
 

361
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,340
which is great and these guys should
stay alive much much longer because of

362
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,350
stay alive much much longer because of
 

363
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,800
stay alive much much longer because of
that I might try to change out these

364
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:34,810
that I might try to change out these
 

365
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,730
that I might try to change out these
glow stones with a block that gives off

366
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:38,740
glow stones with a block that gives off
 

367
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,069
glow stones with a block that gives off
light but doesn't take away a spawning

368
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:41,079
light but doesn't take away a spawning
 

369
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:43,680
light but doesn't take away a spawning
space I haven't tried those lamps the

370
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:43,690
space I haven't tried those lamps the
 

371
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,620
space I haven't tried those lamps the
new lamps if they work like glowstone or

372
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:46,630
new lamps if they work like glowstone or
 

373
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,999
new lamps if they work like glowstone or
not the sea lanterns if they don't we

374
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:51,009
not the sea lanterns if they don't we
 

375
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:55,679
not the sea lanterns if they don't we
can try maybe putting in just regular

376
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:55,689
can try maybe putting in just regular
 

377
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:58,050
can try maybe putting in just regular
glowstone lamps and I think those will

378
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:58,060
glowstone lamps and I think those will
 

379
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,780
glowstone lamps and I think those will
allow spawns oh yeah we got one we got

380
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:03,790
allow spawns oh yeah we got one we got

little spawning platform outside of the
 

385
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,650
little spawning platform outside of the
thing here oh don't tell me I ain't an

398
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:31,300
there's a chance the zombies will spawn
 

399
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,519
there's a chance the zombies will spawn
out here because it's dark enough and

after a couple zombies here we actually
 

403
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,929
after a couple zombies here we actually
got a zombie villager and hopefully he

00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:39,939
got a zombie villager and hopefully he
 

405
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,790
got a zombie villager and hopefully he
turns into a clerk so I can get rid of

406
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:41,800
turns into a clerk so I can get rid of
 

407

else

454
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:57,670

 

455
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,519

yes let's check out how these lamps work

456
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:00,529
yes let's check out how these lamps work
 

457
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,190
yes let's check out how these lamps work
or they like glowstone or do they

458
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
or they like glowstone or do they
 

459
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,199
or they like glowstone or do they
function like a solid block do you put a

460
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:05,209
function like a solid block do you put a
 

461
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:09,340
function like a solid block do you put a
torch on it no you can't can you pass a

462
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,350
torch on it no you can't can you pass a
 

463
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,930
torch on it no you can't can you pass a
redstone signal through it no you can't

464
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:13,940
redstone signal through it no you can't
 

465
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,449
redstone signal through it no you can't
okay so it's like glowstone which means

466
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:16,459
okay so it's like glowstone which means
 

467
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:21,579
okay so it's like glowstone which means
stuff probably doesn't spawn on it let's
