00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
uh we'll check this out again at the end
 

361
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,309
uh we'll check this out again at the end
of the rube goldberg

362
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
of the rube goldberg
 

363
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,150
of the rube goldberg
berg machine let's go ahead and head

364
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
berg machine let's go ahead and head
 

365
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,350
berg machine let's go ahead and head
back and we're going to start

366
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
back and we're going to start
 

367
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,629
back and we're going to start
adding on to we didn't blow up

368
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
adding on to we didn't blow up
 

369
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,029
adding on to we didn't blow up
i'm actually surprised we'll add on a

370
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
i'm actually surprised we'll add on a
 

371
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,309
i'm actually surprised we'll add on a
little bit more to it here

372
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
little bit more to it here
 

373
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,550
little bit more to it here
and uh maybe we can talk a little bit as

374
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
and uh maybe we can talk a little bit as
 

375
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,830
and uh maybe we can talk a little bit as
i do that

376
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840

 

377
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,150

here we go moment of truth

404
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400

 

405
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,350

yes it finally works we got floaty

406
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
yes it finally works we got floaty
 

407
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,790
yes it finally works we got floaty
gravel

408
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
gravel
 

409
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,309
gravel
yes so we tried this other day i thought

410
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
yes so we tried this other day i thought
 

411
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,909
yes so we tried this other day i thought
i was doing it wrong maybe because i

412
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
i was doing it wrong maybe because i
 

413
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,430
i was doing it wrong maybe because i
just could not get it to work but i

414
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
just could not get it to work but i
 

415
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,589
just could not get it to work but i
guess it was the version number so

416
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
guess it was the version number so
 

417
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,029
guess it was the version number so
we are in 1.8.3 now um

418
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
we are in 1.8.3 now um
 

419
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,790
we are in 1.8.3 now um
i need to use this version for today

420
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
i need to use this version for today
 

421
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,869
i need to use this version for today
because of that final part

422
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
because of that final part
 

423
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,350
because of that final part
it was crashing in the other version we

424
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
it was crashing in the other version we
 

425
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,790
it was crashing in the other version we
were just on

426
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
were just on
 

427
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,230
were just on
but unfortunately this newer version is

428
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
but unfortunately this newer version is
 

429
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,909
but unfortunately this newer version is
not nearly as optimized

430
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
not nearly as optimized
 

431
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,670
not nearly as optimized
for for my computer anyway so it runs a

432
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
for for my computer anyway so it runs a
 

433
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,070
for for my computer anyway so it runs a
lot

434
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
lot
 

435
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,110
lot
slower but we'll have to live with it

436
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
slower but we'll have to live with it
 

437
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,350
slower but we'll have to live with it
for today

438
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
for today
 

439
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,469
for today
so the next part of this rube goldberg

440
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
so the next part of this rube goldberg
 

441
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:42,949
so the next part of this rube goldberg
machine

442
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
machine
 

443
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,310
machine
that we're gonna do is like a floaty

444
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
that we're gonna do is like a floaty
 

445
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,150
that we're gonna do is like a floaty
gravel section

446
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
gravel section
 

447
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,389
gravel section
and we're gonna do like carpet bombing

448
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
and we're gonna do like carpet bombing
 

449
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,670
and we're gonna do like carpet bombing
yes carpet bombing i just cannot get

450
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:53,680
yes carpet bombing i just cannot get
 

451
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,389
yes carpet bombing i just cannot get
away

452
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
away
 

453
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,430
away
from the tnt it's so much fun uh so what

454
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
from the tnt it's so much fun uh so what
 

455
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,790
from the tnt it's so much fun uh so what
we'll do we'll set up like little

456
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
we'll do we'll set up like little
 

457
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,829
we'll do we'll set up like little
platforms every so often

458
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
platforms every so often
 

459
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,470
platforms every so often
with these like gravel hairs connecting

460
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
with these like gravel hairs connecting
 

461
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,310
with these like gravel hairs connecting
to them when the gravel gets up to here

462
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
to them when the gravel gets up to here
 

463
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,670
to them when the gravel gets up to here
it's going to make the whole platform

464
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
it's going to make the whole platform
 

465
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,710
it's going to make the whole platform
fall

466
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
fall
 

467
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,790
fall
and basically

468
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800
and basically
 

469
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,990
and basically
we'll just try d1 here

470
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
we'll just try d1 here
 

471
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,230
we'll just try d1 here
we gotta put flowers up on here actually

472
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
we gotta put flowers up on here actually
 

473
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,790
we gotta put flowers up on here actually
we should shape it maybe too

474
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
we should shape it maybe too
 

475
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,990
we should shape it maybe too
let's make the edges a little bit taller

476
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000

 

477
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,670

and yeah so then we just put down our

478
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
and yeah so then we just put down our
 

479
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,470
and yeah so then we just put down our
flowers

480
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480

 

481
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,269

oh i was like is that four blocks wide

482
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
oh i was like is that four blocks wide
 

483
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,949
oh i was like is that four blocks wide
because the the flower is

484
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
because the the flower is
 

485
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,790
because the the flower is
really close to that one and really far

486
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
really close to that one and really far
 

487
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,470
really close to that one and really far
away from that one but it's just

488
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
away from that one but it's just
 

489
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,070
away from that one but it's just
the randomness of it all right

490
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
the randomness of it all right
 

491
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,190
the randomness of it all right
and how tough is this going to be to do

492
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
and how tough is this going to be to do
 

493
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,110
and how tough is this going to be to do
then we gotta put the gravel down

494
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120

 

495
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,630

i have a feeling it's gonna be very

496
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
i have a feeling it's gonna be very
 

497
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,870
i have a feeling it's gonna be very
tough because

498
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880

 

499
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,710

because it's really hard to place things

500
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
because it's really hard to place things
 

501
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,990
because it's really hard to place things
now

502
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
now
 

503
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,509
now
i guess i'll have to go on top here

504
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
i guess i'll have to go on top here
 

505
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,230
i guess i'll have to go on top here
like so do this

506
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240

 

507
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,470

and afterwards i'm going to go

508
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
and afterwards i'm going to go
 

509
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,069
and afterwards i'm going to go
underneath and just remove all the

510
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
underneath and just remove all the
 

511
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,829
underneath and just remove all the
flowers and everything should stay

512
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:16,839
flowers and everything should stay
 

513
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,030
flowers and everything should stay
floating

514
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
floating
 

515
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,310
floating
yeah we'll just do something like this

516
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
yeah we'll just do something like this
 

517
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,509
yeah we'll just do something like this
and then put a track in the middle

518
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
and then put a track in the middle
 

519
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,829
and then put a track in the middle
and if tnt minecarts fall three or more

520
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
and if tnt minecarts fall three or more
 

521
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,430
and if tnt minecarts fall three or more
blocks they explode

522
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
blocks they explode
 

523
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,590
blocks they explode
so then we just need that like like

524
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
so then we just need that like like
 

525
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,430
so then we just need that like like
there and when this whole thing comes

526
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
there and when this whole thing comes
 

527
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,990
there and when this whole thing comes
crashing down it's going to explode and

528
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
crashing down it's going to explode and
 

529
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,670
crashing down it's going to explode and
when it hits the ground

530
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
when it hits the ground
 

531
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,470
when it hits the ground
so we'll set up a few of those and

532
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
so we'll set up a few of those and
 

533
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,990
so we'll set up a few of those and
hopefully that's a cool

534
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
hopefully that's a cool
 

535
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,269
hopefully that's a cool
cool little thing to our track here

536
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
cool little thing to our track here
 

537
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,750
cool little thing to our track here
okay so we are pretty much done with

538
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
okay so we are pretty much done with
 

539
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,590
okay so we are pretty much done with
this here look at this

540
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
this here look at this
 

541
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,069
this here look at this
doesn't this look crazy uh it's

542
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
doesn't this look crazy uh it's
 

543
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,509
doesn't this look crazy uh it's
definitely one of the stranger things

544
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
definitely one of the stranger things
 

545
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,630
definitely one of the stranger things
i've done

546
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
i've done
 

547
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,190
i've done
um now we got to remove all the flowers

548
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
um now we got to remove all the flowers
 

549
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,790
um now we got to remove all the flowers
i'm not going to make this any bigger i

550
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
i'm not going to make this any bigger i
 

551
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,470
i'm not going to make this any bigger i
realized as i was making this

552
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
realized as i was making this
 

553
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,910
realized as i was making this
it has a critical flaw and

554
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:03,920
it has a critical flaw and
 

555
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,949
it has a critical flaw and
if we make it any bigger it's probably

556
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
if we make it any bigger it's probably
 

557
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,710
if we make it any bigger it's probably
going to be a bad idea

558
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
going to be a bad idea
 

559
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,150
going to be a bad idea
do you know what's wrong with it do you

560
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
do you know what's wrong with it do you
 

561
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,790
do you know what's wrong with it do you
know what the oversight is

562
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
know what the oversight is
 

563
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,430
know what the oversight is
uh enderman can pick up gravel

564
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440

 

565
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,470

yeah that's a little bit tricky

566
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
yeah that's a little bit tricky
 

567
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,750
yeah that's a little bit tricky
to avoid i'd lit up as best as i can up

568
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
to avoid i'd lit up as best as i can up
 

569
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,590
to avoid i'd lit up as best as i can up
here just so hopefully it doesn't happen

570
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
here just so hopefully it doesn't happen
 

571
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,069
here just so hopefully it doesn't happen
but they can pick up gravelly and pick

572
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
but they can pick up gravelly and pick
 

573
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:28,790
but they can pick up gravelly and pick
up sand

574
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
up sand
 

575
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,230
up sand
i would have had to build this out of

576
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
i would have had to build this out of
 

577
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,230
i would have had to build this out of
either anvils or dragon eggs

578
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
either anvils or dragon eggs
 

579
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,630
either anvils or dragon eggs
which i can't get either of those very

580
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
which i can't get either of those very
 

581
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,949
which i can't get either of those very
easily so

582
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
easily so
 

583
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,030
easily so
we'll have to leave it at this now to

584
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
we'll have to leave it at this now to
 

585
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,870
we'll have to leave it at this now to
remove the flowers

586
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
remove the flowers
 

587
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,150
remove the flowers

this is going to be tough i guess we
 

589
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,069
this is going to be tough i guess we
have to do the outside ones first like

590
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
have to do the outside ones first like
 

591
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:46,790
have to do the outside ones first like
before the

592
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
before the
 

593
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,670
before the
interior ones because when we break

594
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
interior ones because when we break
 

595
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,629
interior ones because when we break
these it's going to update

596
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
