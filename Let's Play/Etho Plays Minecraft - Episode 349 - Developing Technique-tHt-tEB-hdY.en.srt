really sure why but I had this
inspiration to do a bunch of

194
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:20,540
inspiration to do a bunch of
 

195
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,330
inspiration to do a bunch of
terraforming here and we made this pit

196
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:23,340
terraforming here and we made this pit
 

197
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,050
terraforming here and we made this pit
and it might have seemed really random

198
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,060
and it might have seemed really random
 

199
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,500
and it might have seemed really random

that's dumb sometimes sometimes when I'm

202
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:33,960
that's dumb sometimes sometimes when I'm
 

203
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,900
that's dumb sometimes sometimes when I'm
recording these episodes I actually I

204
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:35,910
recording these episodes I actually I
 

205
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,909
recording these episodes I actually I
have a plan I like playing chess I think

four or five turns ahead of myself now

208
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:43,689
four or five turns ahead of myself now
 

209
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:47,519
four or five turns ahead of myself now
um so the reason why I dug this is I

210
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:47,529
um so the reason why I dug this is I
 

211
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:51,300
um so the reason why I dug this is I
thought this would be a good thing to

212
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,310
thought this would be a good thing to
 

213
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,879
thought this would be a good thing to
Center the chicken farm on so at the top

214
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:53,889
Center the chicken farm on so at the top
 

215
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:56,369
Center the chicken farm on so at the top
of this mountain here is where I'm going

216
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:56,379
of this mountain here is where I'm going
 

217
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:58,679
of this mountain here is where I'm going
to put that machine that shoots the eggs

218
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:58,689
to put that machine that shoots the eggs
 

219
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:01,589
to put that machine that shoots the eggs
and creates the chickens and then we

220
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:01,599
and creates the chickens and then we
 

221
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,540
and creates the chickens and then we
will be able to see them float down as

222
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:03,550
will be able to see them float down as
 

223
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,959
will be able to see them float down as
we pass by this pit like as we're

224
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:06,969
we pass by this pit like as we're
 

225
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:08,999
we pass by this pit like as we're
walking by every so often just randomly

226
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:09,009
walking by every so often just randomly
 

227
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:12,119
walking by every so often just randomly
we will see a baby chicken fall down and

228
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:12,129
we will see a baby chicken fall down and
 

229
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:15,200
we will see a baby chicken fall down and
very slowly sink down there and then I

230
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,210
very slowly sink down there and then I
 

231
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,129
very slowly sink down there and then I
don't know what we're doing at the

232
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:17,139
don't know what we're doing at the
 

233
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:18,809
don't know what we're doing at the
bottom of that yet but I'm guessing it's

234
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:18,819
bottom of that yet but I'm guessing it's
 

235
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:21,689
bottom of that yet but I'm guessing it's
going to involve like ocelots and

236
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:21,699
going to involve like ocelots and
 

237
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:25,110
going to involve like ocelots and
chickens and like lions being let out of

238
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
chickens and like lions being let out of
 

239
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,929
chickens and like lions being let out of
their den to kill kill the chickens for

240
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:27,939
their den to kill kill the chickens for
 

241
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:31,050
their den to kill kill the chickens for
sort of thing every so often but we will

242
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:31,060
sort of thing every so often but we will
 

243
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,219
sort of thing every so often but we will
worry about that more later

244
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:32,229
worry about that more later
 

245
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:34,260
worry about that more later
so let me I'm going to set it up off

246
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,270
so let me I'm going to set it up off
 

247
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,439
so let me I'm going to set it up off
camera since I showed it already and we

248
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:37,449
camera since I showed it already and we
 

249
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,769
camera since I showed it already and we
will continue and here it is everybody

250
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:40,779
will continue and here it is everybody
 

251
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:47,959
will continue and here it is everybody
it's all set up seems to be working okay

252
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:47,969

 

253
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:53,339

so cool now I I have to just try I want

254
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:53,349
so cool now I I have to just try I want
 

255
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:55,409
so cool now I I have to just try I want
to see what it does this is a stupid

256
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:55,419
to see what it does this is a stupid
 

257
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:04,230

together and we will see what kind of
 

263
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,969
together and we will see what kind of
trajectory they take when they get

264
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:11,979
trajectory they take when they get
 

265
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:13,740
trajectory they take when they get
launched out of there the items move

266
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:13,750
launched out of there the items move
 

267
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,909
launched out of there the items move
farther than then entities dues like the

268
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
farther than then entities dues like the
 

269
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,309
farther than then entities dues like the
mobs will the chickens will so we got to

270
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
mobs will the chickens will so we got to
 

271
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,579

try with them specifically oh yeah and I

272
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:23,589
try with them specifically oh yeah and I
 

273
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:25,350

decided not to put it on top of the

274
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
decided not to put it on top of the
 

275
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,850
decided not to put it on top of the
mountain by the way I put it over there

276
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:26,860
mountain by the way I put it over there
 

277
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,300
mountain by the way I put it over there
instead the reason for that is I checked

278
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,310
instead the reason for that is I checked
 

279
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,059
instead the reason for that is I checked
and the top of the mountain was over 64

280
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:33,069
and the top of the mountain was over 64
 

281
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:36,240
and the top of the mountain was over 64
blocks away from from down there and you

282
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,250
blocks away from from down there and you
 

283
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,459
blocks away from from down there and you
cannot see like cows and chickens in

284
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:38,469
cannot see like cows and chickens in
 

285
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:40,110
cannot see like cows and chickens in
that if there are 64 blocks away from

286
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,120
that if there are 64 blocks away from
 

287
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,029
that if there are 64 blocks away from
you so you wouldn't be able to see them

288
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:42,039
you so you wouldn't be able to see them
 

289
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:44,639
you so you wouldn't be able to see them

00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:37,460
chickens
why can't you see chickens wait a minute

320
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:37,470
why can't you see chickens wait a minute
 

321
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,290
why can't you see chickens wait a minute
you can't see baby chickens from 64

322
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:40,300
you can't see baby chickens from 64
 

323
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,750
you can't see baby chickens from 64
blocks away I just not they have a

324
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:42,760
blocks away I just not they have a
 

325
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,900
blocks away I just not they have a
shorter range then maybe I did that test

326
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:45,910
shorter range then maybe I did that test
 

327
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,200
shorter range then maybe I did that test
wrong I went to a creative world and

328
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,210
wrong I went to a creative world and
 

329
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,940
wrong I went to a creative world and
flew above it like a sheep or something

330
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:50,950
flew above it like a sheep or something
 

331
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,760
flew above it like a sheep or something
you had cows n' and cheaper different

332
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:53,770
you had cows n' and cheaper different
 

333
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,530
you had cows n' and cheaper different
that definitely different I don't know

334
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:55,540
that definitely different I don't know
 

335
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,320
that definitely different I don't know
if chickens have a shorter range but

336
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,330
if chickens have a shorter range but
 

337
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,850
if chickens have a shorter range but
baby chickens definitely do huh well

338
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:02,860
baby chickens definitely do huh well
 

339
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,220
baby chickens definitely do huh well
then maybe we will lower it even more

340
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:05,230
then maybe we will lower it even more
 

341
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,660
then maybe we will lower it even more
because I do want to see them getting

342
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:06,670
because I do want to see them getting
 

343
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:11,430
because I do want to see them getting
launched out of there I was watching

344
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
launched out of there I was watching
 

345
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,040
launched out of there I was watching
that video and I was tapped out The

346
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,050
that video and I was tapped out The
 

347
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,340
that video and I was tapped out The
Creeper got me so I moved it from about

348
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,350
Creeper got me so I moved it from about
 

349
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,740
Creeper got me so I moved it from about
there to over here now it's it's a lot

350
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:19,750
there to over here now it's it's a lot
 

351
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,600
there to over here now it's it's a lot
closer to the pits we should be able to

352
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:21,610
closer to the pits we should be able to
 

353
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,240
closer to the pits we should be able to
see them at this range so let's try it

354
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,250
see them at this range so let's try it
 

355
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,910
see them at this range so let's try it
out just to make sure put a few all

356
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
out just to make sure put a few all
 

357
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,340
out just to make sure put a few all
right let's not fall down I just want to

358
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,350
right let's not fall down I just want to
 

359
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,650
right let's not fall down I just want to
make sure we can see them getting

360
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:34,660
make sure we can see them getting
 

361
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:42,780
make sure we can see them getting
launched Oh No still can't see them why

362
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:42,790
launched Oh No still can't see them why
 

363
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,830
launched Oh No still can't see them why
is that

364
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:46,840

 

365
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,840

that is really weird I thought for sure

366
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:48,850
that is really weird I thought for sure
 

367
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,690
that is really weird I thought for sure
we would be able to see him now it's

368
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:51,700
we would be able to see him now it's
 

369
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,880
we would be able to see him now it's
almost like it doesn't want to render

370
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:53,890
almost like it doesn't want to render
 

371
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,590
almost like it doesn't want to render
them right when they get launched for

372
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
them right when they get launched for
 

373
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,060
them right when they get launched for
some reason still going yet still going

374
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,070
some reason still going yet still going
 

375
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,900
some reason still going yet still going
oh oh the poor chickens are taking

376
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:03,910
oh oh the poor chickens are taking
 

377
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,560
oh oh the poor chickens are taking
damage

378
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:06,570

 

379
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:12,210

well darn what do we do now so I guess

380
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:12,220
well darn what do we do now so I guess
 

381
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,860
well darn what do we do now so I guess
I'm just going to put the the chickens

382
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:13,870
I'm just going to put the the chickens
 

383
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,920
I'm just going to put the the chickens
in here and they will randomly drop eggs

384
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:16,930
in here and they will randomly drop eggs
 

385
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,930
in here and they will randomly drop eggs
over time and we will randomly get baby

386
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:18,940
over time and we will randomly get baby
 

387
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,180
over time and we will randomly get baby
chickens falling down and we will

388
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,190
chickens falling down and we will
 

389
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,580
chickens falling down and we will
revisit this again later though because

390
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:23,590
revisit this again later though because
 

391
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,620
revisit this again later though because
I I do want to do more with this this

392
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:25,630
I I do want to do more with this this
 

393
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,500
I I do want to do more with this this
idea this is not it but I don't want to

394
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:28,510
idea this is not it but I don't want to
 

395
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,540
idea this is not it but I don't want to
I want to spend the whole episode on

396
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:30,550
I want to spend the whole episode on
 

397
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,210
I want to spend the whole episode on
this either trying to do the slow so the

398
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:33,220
this either trying to do the slow so the
 

399
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,220
this either trying to do the slow so the
way don't rock him out whoa that was it

400
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,230
way don't rock him out whoa that was it
 

401
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:40,650
way don't rock him out whoa that was it
that was a quad oh man I'm getting so

402
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:40,660
that was a quad oh man I'm getting so
 

403
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,450
that was a quad oh man I'm getting so
many quads lately it's amazing

404
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:42,460
many quads lately it's amazing
 

405
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,170
many quads lately it's amazing
all right that's probably good oh don't

406
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:46,180
all right that's probably good oh don't
 

407
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,700
all right that's probably good oh don't
look don't look everybody all right

408
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:50,710
look don't look everybody all right
 

409
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,220
look don't look everybody all right
everybody so next up we are going to be

410
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,230
everybody so next up we are going to be
 

411
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,560
everybody so next up we are going to be
checking out my building plan for this

412
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:55,570
checking out my building plan for this
 

413
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,100
checking out my building plan for this
area which I'm not too confident about

414
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,110
area which I'm not too confident about
 

415
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,310
area which I'm not too confident about
as you know I'm not a very confident

416
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:01,320
as you know I'm not a very confident
 

417
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,790
as you know I'm not a very confident
with my building skills but this is my

418
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:05,800
with my building skills but this is my
 

419
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,160
with my building skills but this is my
plan this is what we're going to do so I

420
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,170
plan this is what we're going to do so I
 

421
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,260
plan this is what we're going to do so I
have a really hard time just building

422
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:10,270
have a really hard time just building
 

423
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,590
have a really hard time just building
something from scratch it's it's not it

424
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
something from scratch it's it's not it
 

425
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,890
something from scratch it's it's not it
usually doesn't turn out well um so I'm

426
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:16,900
usually doesn't turn out well um so I'm
 

427
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,340
usually doesn't turn out well um so I'm
going to be doing like these wireframe

428
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:19,350
going to be doing like these wireframe
 

429
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,860
going to be doing like these wireframe
setups before I do a build that way I

430
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:22,870
setups before I do a build that way I
 

431
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,740
setups before I do a build that way I
have like I can I didn't put random

432
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:25,750
have like I can I didn't put random
 

433
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,240
have like I can I didn't put random
shapes together like this that's

434
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,250
shapes together like this that's
 

435
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,090
shapes together like this that's
something I can do for sure and then

436
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,100
something I can do for sure and then
 

437
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,180
something I can do for sure and then
from that I can tell like what what I

438
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,190
from that I can tell like what what I
 

439
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,700
from that I can tell like what what I
like with the shapes like I'd make sure

440
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:35,710
like with the shapes like I'd make sure
 

441
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,440
like with the shapes like I'd make sure
there's depth to it I can make sure

442
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,450
there's depth to it I can make sure
 

443
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,230
there's depth to it I can make sure
there's varying Heights and and whatnot

444
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
there's varying Heights and and whatnot
 

445
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,980
there's varying Heights and and whatnot
and if you do that usually get a pretty

446
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:43,990
and if you do that usually get a pretty
 

447
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:49,500
and if you do that usually get a pretty
cool in-depth building with if you have

448
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:49,510
cool in-depth building with if you have
 

449
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,580
cool in-depth building with if you have
a lot of shapes to it

450
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:50,590
a lot of shapes to it
 

451
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:56,280
a lot of shapes to it
now the actual building theme is going

452
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:56,290
now the actual building theme is going
 

453
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,470
now the actual building theme is going
to be possibly

454
00:11:59,470 --> 00:11:59,480
to be possibly
 

455
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,710
to be possibly
it possibly a disaster I had this idea

456
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
it possibly a disaster I had this idea
 

457
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,990
it possibly a disaster I had this idea
today that we would try n stone and

458
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:07,000
today that we would try n stone and
 

459
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,340
today that we would try n stone and
let's just see what it looks like here

460
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,350
let's just see what it looks like here
 

461
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,180
let's just see what it looks like here
okay so the N stone would be sort of the

462
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,190
okay so the N stone would be sort of the
 

463
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,069
okay so the N stone would be sort of the
back color because I don't want just

464
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:15,079
back color because I don't want just
 

465
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:17,230
back color because I don't want just
great the thing about just gray is it

466
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,240
great the thing about just gray is it
 

467
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,430
great the thing about just gray is it
doesn't look very good from a distance

468
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:20,440
doesn't look very good from a distance
 

469
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,500
doesn't look very good from a distance
so if we have a color mixed in with it

470
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:23,510
so if we have a color mixed in with it
 

471
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,480
so if we have a color mixed in with it
that would be awesome so I want to try n

472
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,490
that would be awesome so I want to try n
 

473
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,379
that would be awesome so I want to try n
stone and stone looks good with green

474
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:28,389
stone and stone looks good with green
 

475
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,569
stone and stone looks good with green
colors as well I find it also looks

476
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:31,579
colors as well I find it also looks
 

477

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:44,060
what am I looking for there we go we got
 

487
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,000
what am I looking for there we go we got
our leaves on us yes okay so somehow

488
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,010
our leaves on us yes okay so somehow
 

489
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,470
our leaves on us yes okay so somehow
this will be like the background to the

490
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
this will be like the background to the
 

491
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,379
this will be like the background to the
builds we got to put stone in front of

492
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:53,389
builds we got to put stone in front of
 

493
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:55,120
builds we got to put stone in front of
that runic stone because we're kind of

494
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,130
that runic stone because we're kind of
 

495
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,730
that runic stone because we're kind of
doing a root ruin theme right umm stone

496
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:00,740
doing a root ruin theme right umm stone
 

497
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,860
doing a root ruin theme right umm stone
goes pretty good with n stone I would

498
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:02,870
goes pretty good with n stone I would
 

499
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,319
goes pretty good with n stone I would
say and just like somehow I don't know

500
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:08,329
say and just like somehow I don't know
 

501
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,430
say and just like somehow I don't know
break it up enough that it looks good

502
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:12,440
break it up enough that it looks good
 

503
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,759
break it up enough that it looks good
and then have like little bits of this

504
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:15,769
and then have like little bits of this
 

505
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,400
and then have like little bits of this
showing in places and then dress it up

506
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,410
showing in places and then dress it up
 

507
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,530
showing in places and then dress it up
with leaves afterwards we're going to be

508
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:20,540
with leaves afterwards we're going to be
 

509
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,710
with leaves afterwards we're going to be
using jungle leaves I saw this really

510
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:23,720
using jungle leaves I saw this really
 

511
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,110
using jungle leaves I saw this really
cool thing in some of that inspiration

512
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,120
cool thing in some of that inspiration
 

513
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,379
cool thing in some of that inspiration
stuff you guys sent me and one of the

514
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:29,389
stuff you guys sent me and one of the
 

515
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:32,100
stuff you guys sent me and one of the
things that was sent to me somebody had

516
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,110
things that was sent to me somebody had
 

517
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,780
things that was sent to me somebody had
jungle leaves mixed with birch leaves

518
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:34,790
jungle leaves mixed with birch leaves
 

519
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,420
jungle leaves mixed with birch leaves
and oak leaves and it just looked really

520
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:37,430
and oak leaves and it just looked really
 

521
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,329
and oak leaves and it just looked really
really cool so I think we'll be doing

522
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:40,339
really cool so I think we'll be doing
 

523
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:46,540
really cool so I think we'll be doing
that a fair bit oops now to do it those

524
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:46,550
that a fair bit oops now to do it those
 

525
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,290
that a fair bit oops now to do it those
might be a bit painful but yeah just the

526
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:50,300
might be a bit painful but yeah just the
 

527
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,360
might be a bit painful but yeah just the
three different types when you see it on

528
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,370
three different types when you see it on
 

529
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,150
three different types when you see it on
a large steel it looks really cool um

530
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:55,160
a large steel it looks really cool um
 

531
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
a large steel it looks really cool um
and yeah it looks pretty good with n

532
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,170
and yeah it looks pretty good with n
 

533
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:03,430
and yeah it looks pretty good with n
stone I would say oh but to do runic

534
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
stone I would say oh but to do runic
 

535
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,439
stone I would say oh but to do runic
stone stuff is what I'm gonna have the

536
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:05,449
stone stuff is what I'm gonna have the
 

537
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:07,329
stone stuff is what I'm gonna have the
most trouble with I haven't I have no

538
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:07,339
most trouble with I haven't I have no
 

539
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:12,040
most trouble with I haven't I have no
experience with that thankfully we're in

540
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,050
experience with that thankfully we're in
 

541
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,240
experience with that thankfully we're in
a forest biome though

542
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,250
a forest biome though
 

543
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,650
a forest biome though
the green actually looks pretty decent

544
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:14,660
the green actually looks pretty decent
 

545
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:20,050
the green actually looks pretty decent
oh yeah and if we want to use wooden

546
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,060
oh yeah and if we want to use wooden
 

547
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,780
oh yeah and if we want to use wooden
places I find spruce wood looks really

548
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:22,790
places I find spruce wood looks really
 

549
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,870
places I find spruce wood looks really
nice with n stone as well and we could

550
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:25,880
nice with n stone as well and we could
 

551
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,000
nice with n stone as well and we could
even use slime blocks in places if we

552
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,010
even use slime blocks in places if we
 

553
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,730
even use slime blocks in places if we
want if I ever get mycelium it that

554
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:30,740
want if I ever get mycelium it that
 

555
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,220
want if I ever get mycelium it that
looks really nice with n stone if I go

556
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,230
looks really nice with n stone if I go
 

557
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,960
looks really nice with n stone if I go
on and change it up in areas so it's not

558
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:34,970
on and change it up in areas so it's not
 

559
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,710
on and change it up in areas so it's not
always green grass around yeah so I

560
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:38,720
always green grass around yeah so I
 

561
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,940
always green grass around yeah so I
think we'll have a lot of options with

562
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:39,950
think we'll have a lot of options with
 

563
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,980
think we'll have a lot of options with
this and hopefully we can come up with

564
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:41,990
this and hopefully we can come up with
 

565
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,420
this and hopefully we can come up with
something that looks cool okay so this

566
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:46,430
something that looks cool okay so this
 

567
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,830
something that looks cool okay so this
is my first attempt on the actual

568
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:47,840
is my first attempt on the actual
 

569
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,740
is my first attempt on the actual
structure and not going so well this is

570
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:50,750
structure and not going so well this is
 

571
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,290
structure and not going so well this is
way too random we need we need more

572
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:53,300
way too random we need we need more
 

573
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,970
way too random we need we need more
order to it okay so what is this what's

574
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:57,980
order to it okay so what is this what's
 

575
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,250
order to it okay so what is this what's
going on here this is my attempt at

576
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:00,260
going on here this is my attempt at
 

577
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,190
going on here this is my attempt at
making an actual method or technique to

578
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:03,200
making an actual method or technique to
 

579
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,040
making an actual method or technique to
my building style I'm not just going to

580
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,050
my building style I'm not just going to
 

581
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,800
my building style I'm not just going to
place random blocks and hope it turns

582
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:08,810
place random blocks and hope it turns
 

583
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,560
place random blocks and hope it turns
out good this will give it a bit more

584
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:11,570
out good this will give it a bit more
 

585
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,270
out good this will give it a bit more
order because you can see what I'm doing

586
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:13,280
order because you can see what I'm doing
 

587
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,140
order because you can see what I'm doing
here is I'm giving it a structure to the

588
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,150
here is I'm giving it a structure to the
 

589
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,240
here is I'm giving it a structure to the
building and then I'm in regular

590
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,250
building and then I'm in regular
 

591
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,130
building and then I'm in regular
intervals revealing pieces of the end

592
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:21,140
intervals revealing pieces of the end
 

593
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,280
intervals revealing pieces of the end
the end stone every so often and not not

594
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,290
the end stone every so often and not not
 

595
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,950
the end stone every so often and not not
always in the same shape the way I say

596
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:26,960
always in the same shape the way I say
 

597
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,390
always in the same shape the way I say
there's two ways we could do this we

598
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:28,400
there's two ways we could do this we
 

599
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,890
there's two ways we could do this we
could either have a like real order like

600
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:31,900
could either have a like real order like
 

601
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,620
could either have a like real order like
like pillars every few blocks and then

602
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:35,630
like pillars every few blocks and then
 

603
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,829
like pillars every few blocks and then
try to deteriorate those or we could do

604
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:38,839
try to deteriorate those or we could do
 

605
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,420
try to deteriorate those or we could do
something like this where it's pretty

606
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:40,430
something like this where it's pretty
 

607
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,890
something like this where it's pretty
chaotic and this I think I will find

608
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:44,900
chaotic and this I think I will find
 

609
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,060
chaotic and this I think I will find
easier to do actually this almost looks

610
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,070
easier to do actually this almost looks
 

611
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,210
easier to do actually this almost looks
like it's peeling in places like a bunch

612
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:52,220
like it's peeling in places like a bunch
 

613
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,160
like it's peeling in places like a bunch
of blocks fell off here and here and

614
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,170
of blocks fell off here and here and
 

615
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,170
of blocks fell off here and here and
here this is not the final version

616
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:56,180
here this is not the final version
 

617
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,030
here this is not the final version
though this is just like the first pass

618
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,040
though this is just like the first pass
 

619
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,820
though this is just like the first pass
I just want to get the shape of the the

620
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:00,830
I just want to get the shape of the the
 

621
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,890
I just want to get the shape of the the
ruins in mind and now I'm going to go

622
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:02,900
ruins in mind and now I'm going to go
 

623
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,370
ruins in mind and now I'm going to go
over it again with the other blocks and

624
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:05,380
over it again with the other blocks and
 

625
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,400
over it again with the other blocks and
give it a lot more detail so what I've

626
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:09,410
give it a lot more detail so what I've
 

627
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,070
give it a lot more detail so what I've
found so far is we can't have a lot of a

628
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,080
found so far is we can't have a lot of a
 

629
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,420
found so far is we can't have a lot of a
lot of different types of block so we

630
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:13,430
lot of different types of block so we
 

631
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,660
lot of different types of block so we
have to narrow it down and maybe change

632
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:16,670
have to narrow it down and maybe change
 

633
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,460
have to narrow it down and maybe change
it up in different places to use these

634
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:18,470
it up in different places to use these
 

635
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,870
it up in different places to use these
other ones but like if I'm to choose

636
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,880
other ones but like if I'm to choose
 

637
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,440
other ones but like if I'm to choose
between this and this these two don't

638
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:26,450
between this and this these two don't
 

639
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,070
between this and this these two don't
actually go

640
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:27,080
actually go
 

641
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,940
actually go
together all that well I find and I like

642
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:30,950
together all that well I find and I like
 

643
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,650
together all that well I find and I like
this one more because it's more green so

644
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:32,660
this one more because it's more green so
 

645
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,360
this one more because it's more green so
I'm not going to be using this mossy

646
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,370
I'm not going to be using this mossy
 

647
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,020
I'm not going to be using this mossy
stuff I do really like the cracked stone

648
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,030
stuff I do really like the cracked stone
 

649
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,740
stuff I do really like the cracked stone
though so we'll probably be using that

650
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:41,750
though so we'll probably be using that
 

651
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,110
though so we'll probably be using that
cobblestone is great as always

652
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:46,120
cobblestone is great as always
 

653
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,930
cobblestone is great as always
chiseled should we try chiseled maybe in

654
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:49,940
chiseled should we try chiseled maybe in
 

655
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,200
chiseled should we try chiseled maybe in
a few places that would look good and

656
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,210
a few places that would look good and
 

657
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,610
a few places that would look good and
then of course we got to use the stairs

658
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:54,620
then of course we got to use the stairs
 

659
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,050
then of course we got to use the stairs
and half slabs Oh

660
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,060

 

661
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,270

but anyway let me try this again I'm

662
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:01,280
but anyway let me try this again I'm
 

663
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
but anyway let me try this again I'm
going to do the second pass on this and

664
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,290
going to do the second pass on this and
 

665
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,390
going to do the second pass on this and
let's see what it looks like and here we

666
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:07,400
let's see what it looks like and here we
 

667
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,520
let's see what it looks like and here we
have it after some detailing so it still

668
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:09,530
have it after some detailing so it still
 

669
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,640
have it after some detailing so it still
has the same basic patches in it right

670
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:12,650
has the same basic patches in it right
 

671
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,820
has the same basic patches in it right
but we have stairs and slabs mixed in we

672
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:15,830
but we have stairs and slabs mixed in we
 

673
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,400
but we have stairs and slabs mixed in we
have the cracked and the mossy mixed in

674
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,410
have the cracked and the mossy mixed in
 

675
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,199
have the cracked and the mossy mixed in
and it gives a pretty random ish and

676
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,209
and it gives a pretty random ish and
 

677
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,390
and it gives a pretty random ish and
chaotic looking structure but it still

678
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:25,400
chaotic looking structure but it still
 

679
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,699
chaotic looking structure but it still
has structure to it like you can see I'm

680
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:27,709
has structure to it like you can see I'm
 

681
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,860
has structure to it like you can see I'm
creating a flow from the bottom here all

682
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:29,870
creating a flow from the bottom here all
 

683
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,380
creating a flow from the bottom here all
the way to the top so it's almost like

684
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,390
the way to the top so it's almost like
 

685
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,340
the way to the top so it's almost like
it's a pillar of strength there and you

686
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:36,350
it's a pillar of strength there and you
 

687
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,180
it's a pillar of strength there and you
know there there is a some logic to it

688
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,190
know there there is a some logic to it
 

689
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,670
know there there is a some logic to it
but I feel I don't know if I'm gonna I'm

690
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:42,680
but I feel I don't know if I'm gonna I'm
 

691
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,170
but I feel I don't know if I'm gonna I'm
gonna keep it like this what do you guys

692
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:44,180
gonna keep it like this what do you guys
 

693
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,770
gonna keep it like this what do you guys
think

694
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:44,780
think
 

695
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,380
think
I almost feel it's still too chaotic

696
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:47,390
I almost feel it's still too chaotic
 

697
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,600
I almost feel it's still too chaotic
like there's blocks all over the place

698
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:49,610
like there's blocks all over the place
 

699
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,700
like there's blocks all over the place
maybe that's not weighted the way to do

700
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:51,710
maybe that's not weighted the way to do
 

701
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,220
maybe that's not weighted the way to do
it maybe we should set some further

702
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,230
it maybe we should set some further
 

703
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,370
it maybe we should set some further
rules like mossy must be near the ground

704
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:57,380
rules like mossy must be near the ground
 

705
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:04,000
rules like mossy must be near the ground
or um maybe a special type of decay to

706
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,010
or um maybe a special type of decay to
 

707
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,300
or um maybe a special type of decay to
it like from most the Kate the least

708
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:07,310
it like from most the Kate the least
 

709
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,620
it like from most the Kate the least
decay I would say it goes cobble maybe

710
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:11,630
decay I would say it goes cobble maybe
 

711
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,090
decay I would say it goes cobble maybe
we set a rule that we can only have

712
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,100
we set a rule that we can only have
 

713
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,630
we set a rule that we can only have
mossy if it's by cobble and then it

714
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,640
mossy if it's by cobble and then it
 

715
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,360
mossy if it's by cobble and then it
would go cracks I feel is less decayed

716
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,370
would go cracks I feel is less decayed
 

717
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,570
would go cracks I feel is less decayed
then then that and then finally not

718
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:22,580
then then that and then finally not
 

719
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,610
then then that and then finally not
decayed would be that so we may want to

720
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:27,620
decayed would be that so we may want to
 

721
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,830
decayed would be that so we may want to
try that like to have specific patches

722
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
try that like to have specific patches
 

723
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,330
try that like to have specific patches
of the J and then keep that flow to it

724
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:33,340
of the J and then keep that flow to it
 

725
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,530
of the J and then keep that flow to it
might make it look better might be

726
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:35,540
might make it look better might be
 

727
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,560
might make it look better might be
difficult to do those well but I'm going

728
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:38,570
difficult to do those well but I'm going
 

729
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,720
difficult to do those well but I'm going
to go through this and stand to see what

730
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:40,730
to go through this and stand to see what
 

731
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,049
to go through this and stand to see what
it looks

732
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:41,059
it looks
 

733
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,690
it looks
after I add the leaves and stuff also I

734
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:43,700
after I add the leaves and stuff also I
 

735
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,159
after I add the leaves and stuff also I
will say something else here areas like

736
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:48,169
will say something else here areas like
 

737
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,749
will say something else here areas like
this where there is a big cluster of

738
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:49,759
this where there is a big cluster of
 

739
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,879
this where there is a big cluster of
stone together especially near the

740
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:51,889
stone together especially near the
 

741
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:55,180
stone together especially near the
ground like this I want to add further

742
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:55,190
ground like this I want to add further
 

743
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,489
ground like this I want to add further
depth to it like maybe I would do

744
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:57,499
depth to it like maybe I would do
 

745
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:00,639
depth to it like maybe I would do
something like this here and just create

746
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:00,649
something like this here and just create
 

747
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:05,310
something like this here and just create
little extra pieces of 3d depth you know

748
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:05,320
little extra pieces of 3d depth you know
 

749
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,619
little extra pieces of 3d depth you know
that I find is the secret to making

750
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:08,629
that I find is the secret to making
 

751
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:11,769
that I find is the secret to making
things look better I'm not a good

752
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:11,779
things look better I'm not a good
 

753
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,720
things look better I'm not a good
builder but I do understand some

754
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:13,730
builder but I do understand some
 

755
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,720
builder but I do understand some
technique to it like having lots of 3d

756
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:16,730
technique to it like having lots of 3d
 

757
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,749
technique to it like having lots of 3d
depth is really important it gives all

758
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:19,759
depth is really important it gives all
 

759
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,529
depth is really important it gives all
kinds of shadows and stuff and if you

760
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:23,539
kinds of shadows and stuff and if you
 

761
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:26,379
kinds of shadows and stuff and if you
can find places like right now we

762
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:26,389
can find places like right now we
 

763
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:27,940
can find places like right now we
basically have two layers we have this

764
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:27,950
basically have two layers we have this
 

765
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,560
basically have two layers we have this
front one and then we have that end

766
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:29,570
front one and then we have that end
 

767
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,440
front one and then we have that end
stone behind it which is good but if we

768
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:32,450
stone behind it which is good but if we
 

769
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,539
stone behind it which is good but if we
can add even more to that and bring it

770
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:34,549
can add even more to that and bring it
 

771
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,639
can add even more to that and bring it
out further all the better and that's

772
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:36,649
out further all the better and that's
 

773
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:38,619
out further all the better and that's
also why leaves are awesome because they

774
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:38,629
also why leaves are awesome because they
 

775
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:42,159
also why leaves are awesome because they
give a lot of depth as we can see here

776
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:42,169
give a lot of depth as we can see here
 

777
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:45,430
give a lot of depth as we can see here
so this is basically the run-through of

778
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
so this is basically the run-through of
 

779
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,980
so this is basically the run-through of
making the structures if we go through

780
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:47,990
making the structures if we go through
 

781
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,230
making the structures if we go through
with this plan I want you guys feedback

782
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,240
with this plan I want you guys feedback
 

783
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,869
with this plan I want you guys feedback
what you think does it need more or less

784
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:52,879
what you think does it need more or less
 

785
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:54,669
what you think does it need more or less
of something like more leaves less

786
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:54,679
of something like more leaves less
 

787
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,019
of something like more leaves less
leaves more order less order you know

788
00:19:59,019 --> 00:19:59,029
leaves more order less order you know
 

789
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:01,119
leaves more order less order you know
kind of the different points we touched

790
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:01,129
kind of the different points we touched
 

791
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:04,299
kind of the different points we touched
on today I want your feedback so this is

792
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:04,309
on today I want your feedback so this is
 

793
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:06,310
on today I want your feedback so this is
it with the leaves and you can see I got

794
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
it with the leaves and you can see I got
 

795
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,629
it with the leaves and you can see I got
the three different types of the leaves

796
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:07,639
the three different types of the leaves
 

797
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,749
the three different types of the leaves
mixed in there's lots of variety to it

798
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:10,759
mixed in there's lots of variety to it
 

799
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,830
mixed in there's lots of variety to it
and that's why it looks so organic and I

800
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:14,840
and that's why it looks so organic and I
 

801
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,230
and that's why it looks so organic and I
also have flowers we add grass we add

802
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:17,240
also have flowers we add grass we add
 

803
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,320
also have flowers we add grass we add
vines I'm considering also using the

804
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:20,330
vines I'm considering also using the
 

805
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,230
vines I'm considering also using the
spruce planks for the the ground the

806
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:23,240
spruce planks for the the ground the
 

807
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,840
spruce planks for the the ground the
pass you know that actually looks pretty

808
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:25,850
pass you know that actually looks pretty
 

809
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,529
pass you know that actually looks pretty
cool and try to keep it organic as well

810
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:29,539
cool and try to keep it organic as well
 

811
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:32,919
cool and try to keep it organic as well
like just random ins and outs to it

812
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:32,929
like just random ins and outs to it
 

813
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,139
like just random ins and outs to it
raised areas lowered areas I think that

814
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:35,149
raised areas lowered areas I think that
 

815
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:40,570
raised areas lowered areas I think that
would look pretty cool um but yeah let

816
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:40,580
would look pretty cool um but yeah let
 

817
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,879
would look pretty cool um but yeah let
me know what you think again I'm trying

818
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:42,889
me know what you think again I'm trying
 

819
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:44,649
me know what you think again I'm trying
to develop a technique so when it comes

820
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:44,659
to develop a technique so when it comes
 

821
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,529
to develop a technique so when it comes
to building if I know the order to do

822
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:47,539
to building if I know the order to do
 

823
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,389
to building if I know the order to do
things it'll actually be really easy for

824
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:49,399
things it'll actually be really easy for
 

825
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:54,100
things it'll actually be really easy for
me and I can I can big I can build

826
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,110
me and I can I can big I can build
 

827
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,880
me and I can I can big I can build
structures all

828
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:54,890
structures all
 

829
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,860
structures all
over the place I got the wireframe thing

830
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:56,870
over the place I got the wireframe thing
 

831
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,580
over the place I got the wireframe thing
figured out I got the colors figured out

832
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:00,590
figured out I got the colors figured out
 

833
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,180
figured out I got the colors figured out
like that's the order of development all

834
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,190
like that's the order of development all
 

835
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,430
like that's the order of development all
figured out basically here so it's it's

836
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:06,440
figured out basically here so it's it's
 

837
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,560
figured out basically here so it's it's
pretty easy actually yeah anyway that is

838
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:11,570
pretty easy actually yeah anyway that is
 

839
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,390
pretty easy actually yeah anyway that is
it that's that's where I'm going to

840
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:13,400
it that's that's where I'm going to
 

841
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,680
it that's that's where I'm going to
leave it here until I get your feedback

842
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:14,690
leave it here until I get your feedback
 

843
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,930
leave it here until I get your feedback
and then later we will be able to build

844
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:16,940
and then later we will be able to build
 

845
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,230
and then later we will be able to build
and as as we do things of course we'll

846
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
and as as we do things of course we'll
 

847
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,060
and as as we do things of course we'll
have redstone devices mixed in

848
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,070
have redstone devices mixed in
 

849
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,340
have redstone devices mixed in
throughout and those will be sort of the

850
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:24,350
throughout and those will be sort of the
 

851
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,640
throughout and those will be sort of the
focus points okay one more thing here

852
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:27,650
focus points okay one more thing here
 

853
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,920
focus points okay one more thing here
before we move on I just realized I made

854
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:29,930
before we move on I just realized I made
 

855
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,770
before we move on I just realized I made
a mistake with the leaves here so

856
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:32,780
a mistake with the leaves here so
 

857
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,180
a mistake with the leaves here so
whenever you're building something it's

858
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,190
whenever you're building something it's
 

859
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,850
whenever you're building something it's
also really important to every so often

860
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:36,860
also really important to every so often
 

861
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,880
also really important to every so often
just take a step back look at it look at

862
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:39,890
just take a step back look at it look at
 

863
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,150
just take a step back look at it look at
how it's going maybe imagine how you

864
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:43,160
how it's going maybe imagine how you
 

865
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,750
how it's going maybe imagine how you
want it to to flow and all that you want

866
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:46,760
want it to to flow and all that you want
 

867
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,580
want it to to flow and all that you want
to check it from a distance as well as

868
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:48,590
to check it from a distance as well as
 

869
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,940
to check it from a distance as well as
important things with a lot of detail

870
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:51,950
important things with a lot of detail
 

871
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,980
important things with a lot of detail
that are very chaotic generally don't

872
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:53,990
that are very chaotic generally don't
 

873
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:58,030
that are very chaotic generally don't
look as good from a distance unless they

874
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,040
look as good from a distance unless they
 

875
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,370
look as good from a distance unless they
have some flow to it like these leaves

876
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:00,380
have some flow to it like these leaves
 

877
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,800
have some flow to it like these leaves
give it a lot of flow there's a lot of

878
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:02,810
give it a lot of flow there's a lot of
 

879
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,050
give it a lot of flow there's a lot of
order to them because they're basically

880
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:05,060
order to them because they're basically
 

881
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,910
order to them because they're basically
all the same color and you can see a

882
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:06,920
all the same color and you can see a
 

883
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,740
all the same color and you can see a
pattern to it that way from a distance

884
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:08,750
pattern to it that way from a distance
 

885
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,110
pattern to it that way from a distance
I'm saying with the the blotches a

886
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
I'm saying with the the blotches a
 

887
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,480
I'm saying with the the blotches a
yellow there and it would look better if

888
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:15,490
yellow there and it would look better if
 

889
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,830
yellow there and it would look better if
from a distance if I didn't have all

890
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
from a distance if I didn't have all
 

891
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,990
from a distance if I didn't have all
this chaotic cobble mixed in with the

892
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000
this chaotic cobble mixed in with the
 

893
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,120
this chaotic cobble mixed in with the
stone if it was more like groups of

894
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,130
stone if it was more like groups of
 

895
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,190
stone if it was more like groups of
stone with groups of cobble it would

896
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:24,200
stone with groups of cobble it would
 

897
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,610
stone with groups of cobble it would
look better I think but the big mistake

898
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:27,620
look better I think but the big mistake
 

899
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,950
look better I think but the big mistake
I want to point out looks pretty good

900
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:29,960
I want to point out looks pretty good
 

901
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,750
I want to point out looks pretty good
from this angle the thing that doesn't

902
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:31,760
from this angle the thing that doesn't
 

903
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,440
from this angle the thing that doesn't
look so good is from this angle here we

904
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,450
look so good is from this angle here we
 

905
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,390
look so good is from this angle here we
got these big patches of end stone

906
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:37,400
got these big patches of end stone
 

907
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,780
got these big patches of end stone
totally exposed like that I need to move

908
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:40,790
totally exposed like that I need to move
 

909
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,930
totally exposed like that I need to move
the leaves a little closer to them

910
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:42,940
the leaves a little closer to them
 

911
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,130
the leaves a little closer to them
because when it's like this you don't

912
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,140
because when it's like this you don't
 

913
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,630
because when it's like this you don't
have the depths anymore the leaves

914
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640
have the depths anymore the leaves
 

915
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,150
have the depths anymore the leaves
aren't in front of them which doesn't

916
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,160
aren't in front of them which doesn't
 

917
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,760
aren't in front of them which doesn't
look as good compared to over here which

918
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:51,770
look as good compared to over here which
 

919
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,070
look as good compared to over here which
from this angle this these leaves here

920
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,080
from this angle this these leaves here
 

921
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,840
from this angle this these leaves here
just happened to go in front of it

922
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:57,850

 

923
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,100

actually a little bit scared of this

924
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,110
actually a little bit scared of this
 

925
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:03,299
actually a little bit scared of this
door now Oh

926
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:03,309

 

927
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:05,879

all right these are the lighting errors

928
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:05,889
all right these are the lighting errors
 

929
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:07,230
all right these are the lighting errors
I was talking about earlier too by the

930
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:07,240
I was talking about earlier too by the
 

931
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,960
I was talking about earlier too by the
way they seem to be fixed in the latest

932
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:09,970
way they seem to be fixed in the latest
 

933
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,169
way they seem to be fixed in the latest
snapshot which is great but anyway here

934
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:13,179
snapshot which is great but anyway here
 

935
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:16,110
snapshot which is great but anyway here
is the comments for today I picked out

936
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,120
is the comments for today I picked out
 

937
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,320
is the comments for today I picked out
two first one says a etho how do you

938
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:19,330
two first one says a etho how do you
 

939
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,450
two first one says a etho how do you
come up with title names do you find it

940
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:21,460
come up with title names do you find it
 

941
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:28,230
come up with title names do you find it
difficult oh my is so difficult title

942
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,240
difficult oh my is so difficult title
 

943
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,110
difficult oh my is so difficult title
names descriptions and video tags are

944
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,120
names descriptions and video tags are
 

945
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,779
names descriptions and video tags are
the bane of YouTube for me it is so

946
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:36,789
the bane of YouTube for me it is so
 

947
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:39,509
the bane of YouTube for me it is so
difficult I many times now I actually

948
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:39,519
difficult I many times now I actually
 

949
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,509
difficult I many times now I actually
find I use the same title and just

950
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:42,519
find I use the same title and just
 

951
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,549
find I use the same title and just
before I release it I'm like you know

952
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:44,559
