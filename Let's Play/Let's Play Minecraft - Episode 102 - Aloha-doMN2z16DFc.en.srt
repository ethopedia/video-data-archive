building the mob system I believe is

326
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:53,960
building the mob system I believe is
 

327
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,620
building the mob system I believe is
when it began like if I was in my

328
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:56,630
when it began like if I was in my
 

329
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,270
when it began like if I was in my
storage room and a creeper was about to

330
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:58,280
storage room and a creeper was about to
 

331
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,630
storage room and a creeper was about to
blow up

332
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
blow up
 

333
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,510

I would quickly switch the peaceful like

334
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:01,520
I would quickly switch the peaceful like
 

335
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,520
I would quickly switch the peaceful like
a baby and I just started cheating more

336
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:06,530
a baby and I just started cheating more
 

337
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,990
a baby and I just started cheating more
and more and eventually I just started

338
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
and more and eventually I just started
 

339
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,700
and more and eventually I just started
playing on peaceful a lot of the times

340
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:09,710
playing on peaceful a lot of the times
 

341
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,410
playing on peaceful a lot of the times
every now and then I would switch back

342
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:11,420
every now and then I would switch back
 

343
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,780
every now and then I would switch back
to hard and and try to make an effort to

344
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:13,790
to hard and and try to make an effort to
 

345
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,190
to hard and and try to make an effort to
get back to it but I just couldn't

346
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
get back to it but I just couldn't
 

347
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,310

in the future you know if diamond blocks

354
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:26,900
in the future you know if diamond blocks
 

355
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,890
in the future you know if diamond blocks
are gonna blow up you're more likely to

356
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:29,900
are gonna blow up you're more likely to
 

357
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,370
are gonna blow up you're more likely to
press the Steep and go to peaceful then

358

now so I read on the forums today that

696
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:45,720
now so I read on the forums today that
 

697
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:53,360
now so I read on the forums today that
passive mobs seem to spawn about every

698
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,370
passive mobs seem to spawn about every
 

699
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,120
passive mobs seem to spawn about every
for it the game checks every 400 ticks

700
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,130
for it the game checks every 400 ticks
 

701
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,250
for it the game checks every 400 ticks
if they should spawn instead of every

702
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:58,260
if they should spawn instead of every
 

703
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,360
if they should spawn instead of every
tick like that did before so yeah it's a

704
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,370
tick like that did before so yeah it's a
 

705
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,830
tick like that did before so yeah it's a
lot they're a lot rarer now but they

706
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:06,840
lot they're a lot rarer now but they
 

707
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,140
lot they're a lot rarer now but they
don't seem to de-spawn like they used to

708
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,150
don't seem to de-spawn like they used to
 

709
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:15,980
don't seem to de-spawn like they used to
from what I've noticed so yeah they are

710
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:15,990
from what I've noticed so yeah they are
 

711
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:23,260
from what I've noticed so yeah they are
more persistent they're around longer

712
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:23,270

 

713
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:32,300

go do some quick exploring I think the
episodes almost at the end though don't

718
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:39,660
episodes almost at the end though don't
 

719
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,900
episodes almost at the end though don't
need that

720
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:40,910
need that
 

721
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:46,709
need that
oops I'll put that stuff in there

okay where should we go let's go check
 

725
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:54,399
okay where should we go let's go check
out well one of the best ways to explore

726
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:54,409
out well one of the best ways to explore
 

727
00:25:54,409 --> 00:26:07,560
out well one of the best ways to explore
is with the boats all out of order here

728
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:07,570

 

729
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:14,529

let's not lose a spot and let's see

730
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:14,539
let's not lose a spot and let's see
 

731
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,419
let's not lose a spot and let's see
what's around so there's a pine forest

00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:16,429
what's around so there's a pine forest
 

733
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:21,549
what's around so there's a pine forest
over there there's only like six biomes

734
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:21,559
over there there's only like six biomes
 

735
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,859
over there there's only like six biomes
now right there's a what do we have we

736
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:23,869
now right there's a what do we have we
 

737
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:26,729
now right there's a what do we have we
have Mountain we have swamp pine forest

738
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:26,739
have Mountain we have swamp pine forest
 

739
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:32,310
have Mountain we have swamp pine forest
regular forest there's Plains ocean

740
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
regular forest there's Plains ocean
 

741
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,139

seven so there's seven biomes now I'm

744
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:42,789
seven so there's seven biomes now I'm
 

745
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:46,989
seven so there's seven biomes now I'm
assuming if you have a 1.73 worlds

746
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:46,999
assuming if you have a 1.73 worlds
 

747
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:49,209
assuming if you have a 1.73 worlds
whatever biomes you had before got

748
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:49,219
whatever biomes you had before got
 

749
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:53,399
whatever biomes you had before got
converted to one of the seven new ones

750
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:53,409
converted to one of the seven new ones
 

751
00:26:53,409 --> 00:27:01,180
converted to one of the seven new ones
I'm assuming okay lots of water around I

752
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,190
I'm assuming okay lots of water around I
 

753
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:08,010
I'm assuming okay lots of water around I
hope this is an ocean

754
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:08,020

 

755
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,820

I think the ocean and the pine forest

756
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:11,830
I think the ocean and the pine forest
 

757
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:18,620
I think the ocean and the pine forest

are my least favorite we got some pigs
but with the passive mobs I'm guessing

760
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,120
but with the passive mobs I'm guessing
 

761
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,650
but with the passive mobs I'm guessing
if you continue to explore if you leave

762
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:25,660
if you continue to explore if you leave
 

763
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,250
if you continue to explore if you leave
the area they darn it they probably

764
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:29,260
the area they darn it they probably
 

765
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,549
the area they darn it they probably
