00:02:59,680 --> 00:02:59,690
all pretty much filled up with
 

101
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,920

to make a few thousand fireworks I'm

106
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:07,790
to make a few thousand fireworks I'm
 

107
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,550
to make a few thousand fireworks I'm
pretty sure before we have to refill it

108
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:09,560
pretty sure before we have to refill it
 

109
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,050
pretty sure before we have to refill it
which is awesome and yeah this dropper

110
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,060
which is awesome and yeah this dropper
 

111
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,670
which is awesome and yeah this dropper
here this was a suggestion in the

112
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
here this was a suggestion in the
 

113
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,590
here this was a suggestion in the
comments that I add one dropper that

114
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:17,600
comments that I add one dropper that
 

115
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,860
comments that I add one dropper that
gets activated every time we fire this

116
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:20,870
gets activated every time we fire this
 

117
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,240
gets activated every time we fire this
because there was a problem where we

118
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,250
because there was a problem where we
 

119
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,340
because there was a problem where we
sometimes weren't getting a color and

120
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:24,350
sometimes weren't getting a color and
 

121
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,680
sometimes weren't getting a color and
you need a color to make the firework

122
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:26,690
you need a color to make the firework
 

123
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,100
you need a color to make the firework
star so now this gets activated 100% of

124
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,110
star so now this gets activated 100% of
 

125
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,320
star so now this gets activated 100% of
the time so we're guaranteed to get at

126
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,330
the time so we're guaranteed to get at
 

127
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,810
the time so we're guaranteed to get at
least one color and then there's a

128
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:34,820
least one color and then there's a
 

129
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,490
least one color and then there's a
random chance we might get more than one

130
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:36,500
random chance we might get more than one
 

131
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,190
random chance we might get more than one
from these other droppers I just

132
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
from these other droppers I just
 

133
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,670
from these other droppers I just
installed this thing here and try it out

134
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
installed this thing here and try it out
 

135
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,830
installed this thing here and try it out
we stand in the spot when we craft the

136
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
we stand in the spot when we craft the
 

137
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,600
we stand in the spot when we craft the
fireworks star we then throw it into the

138
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:46,610
fireworks star we then throw it into the
 

139
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,090
fireworks star we then throw it into the
hopper and that makes it send out a

140
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,100
hopper and that makes it send out a
 

141
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,410
hopper and that makes it send out a
signal to up here and it tells it to

142
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:53,420
signal to up here and it tells it to
 

143
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,030
signal to up here and it tells it to
send us the stuff to make another star

144
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
send us the stuff to make another star
 

145
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,430
send us the stuff to make another star
so it keeps the cycle going for as long

146
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:57,440
so it keeps the cycle going for as long
 

147
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,819
so it keeps the cycle going for as long
as we want these two droppers they get

148
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:00,829
as we want these two droppers they get
 

149
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:02,440
as we want these two droppers they get
activated every single time because you

150
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,450
activated every single time because you
 

151
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,630
activated every single time because you
need at least one die and at least one

152
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
need at least one die and at least one
 

153
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,759
need at least one die and at least one
gunpowder we're actually only one

154
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:06,769
gunpowder we're actually only one
 

155
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,759
gunpowder we're actually only one
gunpowder not at least one to make a

00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:09,769
gunpowder not at least one to make a
 

157
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:11,470
gunpowder not at least one to make a
star and then the rest this stuff is all

158
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:11,480
star and then the rest this stuff is all
 

159
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,420
star and then the rest this stuff is all
random alright so let's try it out and

160
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:15,430
random alright so let's try it out and
 

161
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,500
random alright so let's try it out and
I'll try to tell you guys a little story

162
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:17,510
I'll try to tell you guys a little story
 

163

00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,970
on it too much nothing's really getting
built and I kind of losing inspiration

500
00:12:59,970 --> 00:12:59,980
built and I kind of losing inspiration
 

501
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,850
built and I kind of losing inspiration
on it now that doesn't necessarily mean

502
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:02,860
on it now that doesn't necessarily mean
 

503
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,640
on it now that doesn't necessarily mean
it's ending but just at the time being I

504
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:05,650
it's ending but just at the time being I
 

505

really have the option to start a lot of
 

575
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,690
really have the option to start a lot of
projects so because you know there's the

576
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:57,700
projects so because you know there's the
 

577
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,410
projects so because you know there's the
map resets and also I don't want to like

578
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:00,420
map resets and also I don't want to like
 

579
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,540
map resets and also I don't want to like
get take over the map you know have a

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:03,550
get take over the map you know have a
 

581
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,670
get take over the map you know have a
million projects going on all over the

582
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
million projects going on all over the
 

583
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,450
million projects going on all over the
base because then it's like how do you

584
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:09,460
base because then it's like how do you
 

585
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,519
base because then it's like how do you
things I guess I don't know it just

586
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:11,529
things I guess I don't know it just

anyway I've talked about that enough I

590
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:16,930
anyway I've talked about that enough I
 

591
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,570
anyway I've talked about that enough I
think ever since I stopped doing it

592
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:21,580
think ever since I stopped doing it
 

593
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,010
think ever since I stopped doing it
though I have really enjoyed my

594
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,020
though I have really enjoyed my
 

595
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,720
though I have really enjoyed my
single-player series a lot more like

596
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:24,730
single-player series a lot more like
 

597

598
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:27,640
it's kind of tough to to keep coming up
 

599
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,790
it's kind of tough to to keep coming up
with ideas all the time like when you

600
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:29,800
with ideas all the time like when you
 

601
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,760
with ideas all the time like when you
have two vanilla series going on it's

602
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:32,770
have two vanilla series going on it's
 

603
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,440
have two vanilla series going on it's
easy to watch episodes but to actually

604
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:34,450
easy to watch episodes but to actually
 

605
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,610
easy to watch episodes but to actually
make them sometimes can be tricky to

606
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:38,620
make them sometimes can be tricky to
 

607
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,820
make them sometimes can be tricky to
think of what you're gonna do when every

think of what you're gonna do when every
 

609
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,570
think of what you're gonna do when every

every time now I just need like one idea
every time and it's just a lot easier

616
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,100
every time and it's just a lot easier
 

617
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,270
every time and it's just a lot easier
I've been finding anyway I've been

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,070

642
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,080
when I've only had four hours asleep is
 

643
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,640
when I've only had four hours asleep is
tricky

644
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:32,650
tricky
 

645
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:37,380
tricky
um there's that I've also become a

646
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:37,390
um there's that I've also become a
 

647
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,630
um there's that I've also become a
little less interested in the series

648
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:39,640
little less interested in the series
 

649
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,900
little less interested in the series
because it's been going on for so long

650
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:41,910
because it's been going on for so long
 

651
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,590
because it's been going on for so long
nothing really changes with it lately I

652
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:46,600
nothing really changes with it lately I
 

653
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,300
nothing really changes with it lately I
found I don't watch other people's

654
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:48,310
found I don't watch other people's
 

655
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,300
found I don't watch other people's
episodes even like I don't really care

656
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,310
episodes even like I don't really care
 

657
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,280
episodes even like I don't really care
it says I don't know I've kind of had

658
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,290
it says I don't know I've kind of had
 

659
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,300
it says I don't know I've kind of had
enough of it I think

660
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,310

 

661
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,980

I used to watch every single episode

662
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:58,990
I used to watch every single episode
 

663
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,470
I used to watch every single episode
everybody put up and look forward to it

664
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:01,480
everybody put up and look forward to it
 

665
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,559
everybody put up and look forward to it
and somehow that just changed over time

666
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:04,569
and somehow that just changed over time
 

667
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,929
and somehow that just changed over time
and I think this something similar has

668
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:06,939
and I think this something similar has
 

669
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,660
and I think this something similar has
happened because my views have dropped

670
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:09,670
happened because my views have dropped
 

671
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,199
happened because my views have dropped
also on that series like they have been

672
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:13,209
also on that series like they have been
 

673
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:15,390
also on that series like they have been
down a third or half of what they used

674
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:15,400
down a third or half of what they used
 

675
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,030
down a third or half of what they used
to be in the last few seasons so I think

676
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,040
to be in the last few seasons so I think
 

677
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,620
to be in the last few seasons so I think
either you guys are getting sick of it

678
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:19,630
either you guys are getting sick of it
 

679
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,240
either you guys are getting sick of it
or there's this more people playing or

680
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,250
or there's this more people playing or
 

681
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,319
or there's this more people playing or
more people to watch now but also

682
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:25,329
more people to watch now but also
 

683
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,929
more people to watch now but also
another big thing is I get a lot of

684
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:27,939
another big thing is I get a lot of
 

685
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:31,910
another big thing is I get a lot of
backlash in UHC whenever I do poorly and

686
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:31,920
backlash in UHC whenever I do poorly and
 

687
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,740
backlash in UHC whenever I do poorly and
that can be a little bit discouraging

688
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:34,750
that can be a little bit discouraging
 

689
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,040
that can be a little bit discouraging
especially the last season was probably

690
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,050
especially the last season was probably
 

691
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,370
especially the last season was probably
the worst so far there's a there was a

692
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:41,380
the worst so far there's a there was a
 

693
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,250
the worst so far there's a there was a

skin when you do YouTube it is true it

706
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,350
skin when you do YouTube it is true it
 

707
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,370
skin when you do YouTube it is true it
is definitely true but I never want to

708
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:05,380
is definitely true but I never want to
 

709
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,070
is definitely true but I never want to
get to the points because this is both a

710
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
get to the points because this is both a
 

711
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,050
get to the points because this is both a
hobby and a job for me I'd never want to

712
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,060
hobby and a job for me I'd never want to
 

713
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,490
hobby and a job for me I'd never want to
get to the point where that hobby part

714
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:11,500
get to the point where that hobby part
 

715
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,780
get to the point where that hobby part
is gone and I think if a youtuber

716
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:15,790
is gone and I think if a youtuber
 

717
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,100
is gone and I think if a youtuber
doesn't want to read his comments

718
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,110
doesn't want to read his comments
 

719
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,050
doesn't want to read his comments
anymore I think the hobby part is gone

721
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,750

don't want to look at the comments and
the thing is even if I choose not to it

738
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,310
the thing is even if I choose not to it
 

739
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,220
the thing is even if I choose not to it
doesn't matter because people comment on

doesn't matter because people comment on
 

741
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,830
doesn't matter because people comment on
my other videos with their UHC comments

then I don't want to look at those
comments either so it's kind of a

748
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:52,740
comments either so it's kind of a
 

749
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,340
comments either so it's kind of a
rippling effect

750
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:56,350
