but when i do redstone for some reason i

38
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960
but when i do redstone for some reason i
 

39
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,189
but when i do redstone for some reason i
always try to make it as compact as

40
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
always try to make it as compact as
 

41
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,709
always try to make it as compact as
possible

42
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
possible
 

43
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,830
possible
and it's very difficult to do that

44
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840
and it's very difficult to do that
 

45
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,790
and it's very difficult to do that
sometimes especially with this stupid

46
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,800
sometimes especially with this stupid
 

47
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,670
sometimes especially with this stupid
thing right here

48
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
thing right here
 

49
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,670

out though
 

53
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,510
out though
yeah so this is it this is a solution to

54
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
yeah so this is it this is a solution to
 

55
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,830
yeah so this is it this is a solution to
the whole thing i know i said i finished

56
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
the whole thing i know i said i finished

a long time ago but i meant like the

62
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
a long time ago but i meant like the
 

63
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,749
a long time ago but i meant like the
sorting system this part here i didn't

64
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
sorting system this part here i didn't
 

65
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,390
sorting system this part here i didn't
think

66
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
think
 

67
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,990
think
i'd even think about this part like i

68
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
i'd even think about this part like i
 

69
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,350
i'd even think about this part like i
didn't think it was going to be that

70
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
didn't think it was going to be that
 

71
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,550
didn't think it was going to be that
difficult but

72
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
difficult but
 

73
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,990
difficult but
oh man yeah i thought it i thought it

74
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
oh man yeah i thought it i thought it
 

75
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,429
oh man yeah i thought it i thought it
was going to be the simple part of the

76
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
was going to be the simple part of the
 

77
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,030
was going to be the simple part of the
the whole thing but no

78
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
the whole thing but no
 

79
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,030
the whole thing but no
i did not think that through too well

80
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
i did not think that through too well
 

81
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,550
i did not think that through too well
i'm not going to attempt to explain it

82
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
i'm not going to attempt to explain it
 

83
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,990
i'm not going to attempt to explain it
either because we can't even look at it

84
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
either because we can't even look at it
 

85
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,270
either because we can't even look at it
it's all

86
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
it's all
 

87
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,950
it's all
there's not enough space to walk and to

88
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
there's not enough space to walk and to
 

89
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,350
there's not enough space to walk and to
check it out which is a problem because

90
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
check it out which is a problem because
 

91
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,469
check it out which is a problem because
i have to

92
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479
i have to
 

93
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,630
i have to
try to copy this and i can't see what i

94
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
try to copy this and i can't see what i
 

95
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,030
try to copy this and i can't see what i
did even

96
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
did even
 

97
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,670
did even
so that'll be fun but the good news is

98
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
so that'll be fun but the good news is
 

99
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,109
so that'll be fun but the good news is
we got to figure it out we know how much

100
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
we got to figure it out we know how much
 

101
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,270
we got to figure it out we know how much
space it's going to take to work

102
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280
space it's going to take to work
 

103
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,350
space it's going to take to work
uh which means we can get on with

104
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
uh which means we can get on with
 

105
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,550
uh which means we can get on with
building this thing

106
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
building this thing
 

107
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,910
building this thing
and actually making some serious

108
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
and actually making some serious
 

109
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,389
and actually making some serious
progress with it which is cool

110
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
progress with it which is cool
 

111
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,709
progress with it which is cool
you can see i figured out how wide i

112
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
you can see i figured out how wide i
 

113
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,029
you can see i figured out how wide i
want the walkway to be

114
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
want the walkway to be
 

115
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,750
want the walkway to be
for the for the two tunnels so there'll

116
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
for the for the two tunnels so there'll
 

117
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,190
for the for the two tunnels so there'll
be a tunnel here and they'll probably be

118
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
be a tunnel here and they'll probably be
 

119
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,910
be a tunnel here and they'll probably be
one about

120
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
one about
 

121
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,750
one about
20 blocks or so this way um

122
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
20 blocks or so this way um
 

123
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,350
20 blocks or so this way um
so i guess maybe we'll start off today

124
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
so i guess maybe we'll start off today
 

125
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,270
so i guess maybe we'll start off today
with a little montage of me

with a little montage of me
 

127
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,630
with a little montage of me
building and then we'll probably go do

128
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
building and then we'll probably go do
 

129
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,750
building and then we'll probably go do
something else

130
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
something else
 

131
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:56,150

i had someone in the comments say i

162
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
i had someone in the comments say i
 

163
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,750
i had someone in the comments say i
haven't done that in a long time

164
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
haven't done that in a long time
 

165
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,509
haven't done that in a long time
which is true i used to do those like

166
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
which is true i used to do those like
 

167
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,350
which is true i used to do those like
every episode and then

168
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
every episode and then
 

169
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,670
every episode and then
kind of just forgot about them so if you

170
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
kind of just forgot about them so if you
 

171
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,110
kind of just forgot about them so if you
ever wonder what goes on behind the

all the block placing um so we got a
 

179
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,070
all the block placing um so we got a
fair bit done here that's probably all

180
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
fair bit done here that's probably all
 

181
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,990
fair bit done here that's probably all
we'll do for today we'll just keep keep

here kind of
 

197
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,670
here kind of
like this would be the tunnel

198
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
like this would be the tunnel
 

199
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,110
like this would be the tunnel
like right here um this would be the

200
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
like right here um this would be the
 

201
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,310
like right here um this would be the
left side of the tunnel and then

202
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
left side of the tunnel and then
 

203
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,790
left side of the tunnel and then
there'll be a right side um so we have

204
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
there'll be a right side um so we have
 

205
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,150
there'll be a right side um so we have
to clear out all this stone here

206
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
to clear out all this stone here
 

207
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,510
to clear out all this stone here

that but
 

233
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,510
that but
the whole line thing here does this work

maybe let's try without them

238
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
maybe let's try without them

what the colors looked like next to this

244
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
what the colors looked like next to this
 

245
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,270

if there's any that looked really bad

248
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
if there's any that looked really bad
 

249
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,670
if there's any that looked really bad
because

250
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
because
 

251
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,189
because
it's a blue floor maybe there's some

252
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
it's a blue floor maybe there's some
 

253
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,350
it's a blue floor maybe there's some
colors that don't go with that too well

254
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
colors that don't go with that too well
 

255
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,830
colors that don't go with that too well
but it's it's not too too bad i don't

256
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
but it's it's not too too bad i don't
 

257
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,710
but it's it's not too too bad i don't
think

258
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
think
 

259
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,590
think
what am i doing take these out was this

260
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
what am i doing take these out was this
 

261
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,870
what am i doing take these out was this
not still touch

262
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
not still touch
 

263
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,070
not still touch
oh it's not oops okay

264
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
oh it's not oops okay
 

265
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,670
oh it's not oops okay
do that so we could just have a straight

266
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
do that so we could just have a straight
 

267
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,550
do that so we could just have a straight
line too

268
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560

 

269
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,510

i don't know someone suggested i put uh

270
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
i don't know someone suggested i put uh
 

271
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,909
i don't know someone suggested i put uh
colored beacons like maybe one here

272
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
colored beacons like maybe one here
 

273
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,350
colored beacons like maybe one here
and then one here and then when we look

274
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
and then one here and then when we look
 

275
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,550
and then one here and then when we look
down the tunnel

276
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
down the tunnel
 

277
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,590
down the tunnel
we'll have a rainbow effect of the

278
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
we'll have a rainbow effect of the
 

279
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,110
we'll have a rainbow effect of the
beacons going all the way down i think

280
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
beacons going all the way down i think
 

281
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,590
beacons going all the way down i think
that's

282
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
that's
 

283
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,070
that's
really cool idea if we can do it be a

284
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
really cool idea if we can do it be a
 

285
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,830
really cool idea if we can do it be a
lot of beacons though

286
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
lot of beacons though
 

287
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,270
lot of beacons though
um the reason for the color codes

288
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
um the reason for the color codes
 

289
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,029
um the reason for the color codes
i would like to include these to help me

290
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
i would like to include these to help me
 

291
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,110
i would like to include these to help me
memorize where stuff is in the storage

292
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
memorize where stuff is in the storage
 

293
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,430
memorize where stuff is in the storage
room

294
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
room
 

295
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,029
room
just like one more extra memory trick to

296
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
just like one more extra memory trick to
 

297
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,430
just like one more extra memory trick to
remembering things

298
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
remembering things
 

299
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,990
remembering things
uh currently one of my other plans is to

300
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
uh currently one of my other plans is to
 

301
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,830
uh currently one of my other plans is to
hopefully

302
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
hopefully
 

303
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,189
hopefully
oh which fell down uh

304
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
oh which fell down uh
 

305
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,469
oh which fell down uh
we'll use these levers to sort of figure

306
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
we'll use these levers to sort of figure
 

307
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,430
we'll use these levers to sort of figure
out where stuff is

308
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
out where stuff is
 

309
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,950
out where stuff is
in the storage room like there's going

310
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
in the storage room like there's going
 

311
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,710
in the storage room like there's going
to be a top and a bottom floor

312
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
to be a top and a bottom floor
 

313
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,950
to be a top and a bottom floor
so maybe one lever will decide is it top

314
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
so maybe one lever will decide is it top
 

315
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,070
so maybe one lever will decide is it top
or bottom floor

316
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
or bottom floor
 

317
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,469
or bottom floor
there's going to be two tunnels so

318
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
there's going to be two tunnels so
 

319
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,629
there's going to be two tunnels so
another lever will decide is the left or

320
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
another lever will decide is the left or
 

321
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,550
another lever will decide is the left or
the right tunnel

322
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
the right tunnel
 

323
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,710
the right tunnel
there'll be a left and a right side for

324
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
there'll be a left and a right side for
 

325
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,230
there'll be a left and a right side for
each tunnel so that would be another

326
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
each tunnel so that would be another
 

327
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,590
each tunnel so that would be another
lever then they'll be the

328
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
lever then they'll be the
 

329
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,990
lever then they'll be the
first half second half and then first

330
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
first half second half and then first
 

331
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,350
first half second half and then first
half second half of that

332
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
half second half of that
 

333
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,909
half second half of that
and yeah basically if i know where

334
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
and yeah basically if i know where
 

335
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:46,870
and yeah basically if i know where
something is

336
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
something is
 

337
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,550
something is
in the storage room i'll be able to

338
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
in the storage room i'll be able to
 

339
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,390
in the storage room i'll be able to
figure it out without

340
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400

 

341
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,830

i heard some glass break or something

342
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
i heard some glass break or something
 

343
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,950
i heard some glass break or something
what was that was that in the game

344
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
what was that was that in the game
 

345
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,430
what was that was that in the game
all right i got distracted but anyway if

346
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
all right i got distracted but anyway if
 

347
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,189
all right i got distracted but anyway if
i know where something is in the storage

348
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
i know where something is in the storage
 

349
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,230
i know where something is in the storage
room i can

350
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
room i can
 

351
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,270
room i can
i can figure it out with the levers

352
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
i can figure it out with the levers
 

353
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,189
i can figure it out with the levers
without having to reference anything so

354
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
without having to reference anything so
 

355
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,749
without having to reference anything so
that

356
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
that
 

357
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,990
that
that's this one more trick we will

358
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
that's this one more trick we will
 

359
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,510
that's this one more trick we will
hopefully use

360
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
hopefully use
 

361
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,830
hopefully use
and if we get enough tricks like that it

362
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
and if we get enough tricks like that it
 

363
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,430
and if we get enough tricks like that it
should be pretty easy to

364
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
should be pretty easy to
 

365
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,830
should be pretty easy to
to know what code to use to get an item

366
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
to know what code to use to get an item
 

367
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,830
to know what code to use to get an item
without having to always check a book or

368
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
without having to always check a book or
 

369
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,430
without having to always check a book or
something which is also probably what

370
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
something which is also probably what
 

371
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,710
something which is also probably what
we'll use

372
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
we'll use
 

373
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,950
we'll use
so guys maybe we will do a few things

374
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
so guys maybe we will do a few things
 

375
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,309
so guys maybe we will do a few things
around the man cave here for

376
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
around the man cave here for
 

377
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,270
around the man cave here for
for a little while this window that we

378
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
for a little while this window that we
 

379
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,950
for a little while this window that we
we put in that sting

380
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
we put in that sting
 

381
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,950
we put in that sting

00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
bad
 

389
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,950
bad

uh but i just made it a couple of
 

395
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,270
uh but i just made it a couple of
changes to it now we can actually see

396
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
changes to it now we can actually see
 

397
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,430
changes to it now we can actually see
into this room before there was this

398
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
into this room before there was this
 

399
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,309
into this room before there was this
you see that uh the stone bricks there

400
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
you see that uh the stone bricks there
 

401
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,670
you see that uh the stone bricks there
that was running all the way across

402
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
that was running all the way across
 

403
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,150
that was running all the way across
and there was like no view but i lowered

404
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
and there was like no view but i lowered
 

405
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,029
and there was like no view but i lowered
that

406
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
that
 

407
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,309
that
um this entrance is such a mess i still

408
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
um this entrance is such a mess i still
 

409
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,830
um this entrance is such a mess i still
don't really know what i want to do with

410
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
don't really know what i want to do with
 

411

don't really know what i want to do with
it

412
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
it
 

413
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,869
it
but i think for sure we're going to put

414
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
but i think for sure we're going to put
 

415
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,029
but i think for sure we're going to put
in at least one more arch

416
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
in at least one more arch
 

417
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,790
in at least one more arch
so let's just go ahead and do that

418
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800

 

419
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,390

let's see do that and

420
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
let's see do that and
 

421
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,189
let's see do that and
i got some oak here i also made a couple

422
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
i got some oak here i also made a couple
 

423
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,510
i got some oak here i also made a couple
other changes

other changes
 

425
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,830
other changes

um in another spot in the manatee which
 

427
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,670
um in another spot in the manatee which
we'll go check out

428
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
we'll go check out
 

429
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,110
we'll go check out
oops and i want to try to add some more

oops oh man placing stairs so difficult
 

437
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,269
oops oh man placing stairs so difficult
why why is that all right let's see

438
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:49,279
why why is that all right let's see
 

439
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,389
why why is that all right let's see
yeah i can't place blocks period all

440
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
yeah i can't place blocks period all
 

441
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,110
yeah i can't place blocks period all
right

442
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
right
 

443
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,630
right
is this okay is this too close to the

444
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
is this okay is this too close to the
 

445
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,590
is this okay is this too close to the
stairs does it need to be taller

446
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
stairs does it need to be taller
 

447
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,790
stairs does it need to be taller
it feels a little close to the stairs

448
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
it feels a little close to the stairs
 

449
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,630
it feels a little close to the stairs
yep that might have been why i didn't do

450
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
yep that might have been why i didn't do
 

451
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,870
yep that might have been why i didn't do
it before we could raise it

452
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
it before we could raise it
 

453
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,990
it before we could raise it
a little bit more though

454
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
a little bit more though
 

455
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,230
a little bit more though
okay so i moved it up one more block

456
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
okay so i moved it up one more block
 

457
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,550
okay so i moved it up one more block
feels quite a bit better

458
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
feels quite a bit better
 

459
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,070
feels quite a bit better
with that extra space um still might be

460
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
with that extra space um still might be
 

461
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,190
with that extra space um still might be
too close though

462
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
too close though
 

463
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,430
too close though

thing
oh wrong way actually i guess it would

472
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
oh wrong way actually i guess it would
 

473
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:26,949
oh wrong way actually i guess it would
be

474
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
be
 

475
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,389
be
my big head wouldn't it because i'm the

476
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
my big head wouldn't it because i'm the
 

477
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,550
my big head wouldn't it because i'm the
one that's gonna get hit

478
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
one that's gonna get hit
 

479
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,389
one that's gonna get hit
all right we can go up no problem going

480
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
all right we can go up no problem going
 

481
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:40,070
all right we can go up no problem going
down oh i hit my head darn it

482
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080

 

483
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,070

this room is pretty much done in my
 

675
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,590
this room is pretty much done in my
opinion the only thing i thought about

676
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
opinion the only thing i thought about
 

677
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,670
opinion the only thing i thought about
today though is maybe it'd be cool if we

678
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
today though is maybe it'd be cool if we
 

679
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,470
today though is maybe it'd be cool if we
started adding

680
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
started adding
 

681
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,230
started adding
just a little bit more detail to the

682
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
just a little bit more detail to the
 

683
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,990
just a little bit more detail to the
walls this is all

684
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
walls this is all
 

685
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,870
walls this is all
stone if we had like some stone bricks

686
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
stone if we had like some stone bricks
 

687
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,949
stone if we had like some stone bricks
throughout it it might look cool

688
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
throughout it it might look cool
 

689
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,829
throughout it it might look cool
so let's just try that out just like

690
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
so let's just try that out just like
 

691
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,430
so let's just try that out just like
randomly mixed in every

692
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440
randomly mixed in every
 

693
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,509
randomly mixed in every
so often

694
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519

 

695
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,509

all right so let me uh let me work on

696
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
all right so let me uh let me work on
 

697
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,710
all right so let me uh let me work on
this actually you know what i also

698
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,720
this actually you know what i also
 

699
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,189
this actually you know what i also
brought andesite i wanted to try

700
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
brought andesite i wanted to try
 

701
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,110
brought andesite i wanted to try
where is it there it is it's in my it's

702
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120
where is it there it is it's in my it's
 

703
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,030
where is it there it is it's in my it's
in my hot bar

704
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
in my hot bar
 

705
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,829
in my hot bar
could do both or

706
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839

 

707
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,350

um not sure which i like more

708
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360

 

709
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,870

ah they're actually both pretty good

710
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880

 

711
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,710

yeah maybe we'll use both then

712
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720

 

713
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,550

ah you know what on second thought now

714
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
ah you know what on second thought now
 

715
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,389
ah you know what on second thought now
that i see it it kind of looks like my

716
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
that i see it it kind of looks like my
 

717
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,230
that i see it it kind of looks like my
walls have chicken pox

718
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
walls have chicken pox
 

719
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,269
walls have chicken pox
so that's that's not so good that's not

720
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
so that's that's not so good that's not
 

721
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,189
so that's that's not so good that's not
gonna work the andesite i don't like

722
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
gonna work the andesite i don't like
 

723
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,509
gonna work the andesite i don't like
um i'm gonna try stone brick though

724
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
um i'm gonna try stone brick though
 

725
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,189
um i'm gonna try stone brick though
andesite and the stone brick didn't go

726
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
andesite and the stone brick didn't go
 

727
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,629
andesite and the stone brick didn't go
well together so we have to use

728
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
well together so we have to use
 

729
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,949
well together so we have to use
one or the other i thought andesite

730
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
one or the other i thought andesite
 

731
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:31,829
one or the other i thought andesite
might be better

732
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:31,839
might be better
 

733
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,829
might be better
but now that i see it i don't like it

734
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
but now that i see it i don't like it
 

735
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,829
but now that i see it i don't like it
too much

736
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
too much
 

737
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,030
too much
but it was worth a shot alright

738
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040

 

739
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,189

yeah stone brick is a little more subtle

740
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
yeah stone brick is a little more subtle
 

741
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,350
yeah stone brick is a little more subtle
isn't it the andesite has that sharp

742
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
isn't it the andesite has that sharp
 

743
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,629
isn't it the andesite has that sharp
white line

744
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
white line
 

745
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,670
white line
on it which makes it uh stand out a

746
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
on it which makes it uh stand out a
 

747
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,269
on it which makes it uh stand out a
little too much i think

748
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279

 

749
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,430

you know what like i do like it here

750
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
you know what like i do like it here
 

751
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,509
you know what like i do like it here
it's it's not bad

752
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
it's it's not bad
 

753
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,230
it's it's not bad
but something i've kind of learned from

754
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
but something i've kind of learned from
 

755
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,829
but something i've kind of learned from
doing this

756
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
doing this
 

757
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,590
doing this
when you take it into context with the

758
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
when you take it into context with the
 

759
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,670
when you take it into context with the
rest of the room here this is a really

760
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
rest of the room here this is a really
 

761
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,670
rest of the room here this is a really
highly detailed room and when i see this

762
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:09,680
highly detailed room and when i see this
 

763
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,629
highly detailed room and when i see this
with the rest of the room it's just it's

764
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
with the rest of the room it's just it's
 

765
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,509
with the rest of the room it's just it's
too much

766
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:13,519
too much
 

767
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,910
too much
it's too much detail sometimes it's

768
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
it's too much detail sometimes it's
 

769
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,670
it's too much detail sometimes it's
better just to keep things simple

770
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680
better just to keep things simple
 

771
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,509
better just to keep things simple
because it just detracts from the rest

772
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
because it just detracts from the rest
 

773
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,629
because it just detracts from the rest
of the details

774
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
of the details
 

775
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,470
of the details
i would rather look at the leaves and

776
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
i would rather look at the leaves and
 

777
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,670
i would rather look at the leaves and
stuff than

778
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:23,680
stuff than
 

779
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,990
stuff than
the walls that aren't really all that

780
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
the walls that aren't really all that
 

781
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,150
the walls that aren't really all that
special

782
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
special
 

783
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,749
special
i was just thinking it's been a while

784
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:29,759
i was just thinking it's been a while
 

785
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,150
i was just thinking it's been a while
since we last updated our map here

786
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
since we last updated our map here
 

787
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,069
since we last updated our map here
i'm curious if anything will change on

788
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
i'm curious if anything will change on
 

789
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,670
i'm curious if anything will change on
it most of stuff we build is

790
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
it most of stuff we build is
 

791
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,749
it most of stuff we build is
either underground or outside the area

792
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
either underground or outside the area
 

793
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,509
either underground or outside the area
here but

794
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
here but
 

795
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,350
here but
i know we've done stuff on the snowflake

796
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
i know we've done stuff on the snowflake
 

797
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,550
i know we've done stuff on the snowflake
so let's try that out oh

798
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
so let's try that out oh
 

799
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,670
so let's try that out oh
that's the gold farm up there right

800

that's the gold farm up there right
 

801
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,310

oh yeah that looks different now um see
 

803
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,749
oh yeah that looks different now um see
the library i'm pretty sure has changed

804
00:15:59,749 --> 00:15:59,759

 

805
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,680

this is the library up here oh

806
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:03,690
this is the library up here oh
 

807
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,829
this is the library up here oh

darn it where'd it go i really wish
stuff didn't fly out of item frames like

814
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
stuff didn't fly out of item frames like
 

815
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,550
stuff didn't fly out of item frames like
that oh it's down there

816

the
 

823
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,310
the
map all right

824
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320

 

825
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,150

did i not look at it

826
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160

 

827
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,389

pretty sure it doesn't look like that

828
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:34,399
pretty sure it doesn't look like that
 

829
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,829
pretty sure it doesn't look like that
anymore why is it not

830
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
anymore why is it not
 

831
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,470
anymore why is it not
updating that is weird

832
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
updating that is weird
 

833
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,110
updating that is weird
all right i'll put it back because

834
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120

839
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,310

yeah like this should all be filled in

840
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
yeah like this should all be filled in
 

841
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,949
yeah like this should all be filled in

but it only
 

895
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,549
but it only
partially updated originally but when i

can we find it please tell me it didn't

1190

not that it would be a huge loss we got

1194
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
not that it would be a huge loss we got
 

1195
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,830
not that it would be a huge loss we got
14 from that that's pretty nice

1196

1199
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,630

not seeing it all right i'll look around

1200
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:52,640
not seeing it all right i'll look around
 

1201
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,710
not seeing it all right i'll look around
we should be able to find it though

1202
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:56,720

 

1203
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,870

kind of strange i looked around like

1204
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:58,880
kind of strange i looked around like
 

1205
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,070
kind of strange i looked around like
really pretty

1206
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,080
really pretty
 

1207
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,789
really pretty
thoroughly and i could not find it so

1208
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:02,799
thoroughly and i could not find it so
 

1209
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,950
thoroughly and i could not find it so
somehow it disappeared

1210
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
somehow it disappeared
 

1211
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,190

and it's like still out there somewhere

1214
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
and it's like still out there somewhere
 

1215
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,310
and it's like still out there somewhere
but i wanted to check the for any damage

1216
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
but i wanted to check the for any damage
 

1217
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,990
but i wanted to check the for any damage

because we did the fight right by it

1220
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
because we did the fight right by it
 

1221
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,350
because we did the fight right by it
looks like it's okay though they

1222
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,360
looks like it's okay though they
 

1223
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,470
looks like it's okay though they
don't really tend to shoot upwards

1224
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:22,480

 

1225
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,310

yeah i think we're okay still all right

1226
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,320
yeah i think we're okay still all right
 

1227
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,110

killing them so i'll have to replace

1236
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,360
killing them so i'll have to replace
 

1237
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,870
killing them so i'll have to replace
them soon

1238
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880
them soon
 

1239
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,029
them soon
but that's after a lot of use with this

1240
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
but that's after a lot of use with this
 

1241

okay everybody so that's gonna do it for
 

1245
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,549
okay everybody so that's gonna do it for
today but we do have a comment as usual

1246
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
today but we do have a comment as usual
 

1247

today but we do have a comment as usual
it says hey etho just wondering did you

1248
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:55,440
it says hey etho just wondering did you

think about using

1250
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
think about using
 

1251
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,630
think about using
item frames and comparators to control

1252
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
item frames and comparators to control
 

1253
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,990

one item frame now has eight possible

1256
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,240
one item frame now has eight possible
 

1257
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,390
one item frame now has eight possible
orientations so you'd only need two of

1258
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,400
orientations so you'd only need two of
 

1259
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,269
orientations so you'd only need two of
them

1260
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:05,279
them
 

1261
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,510
them
plus two levers or you could use three

1262
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,520
plus two levers or you could use three
 

1263
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,350
plus two levers or you could use three
of them and no levers

1264
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,360
of them and no levers
 

1265
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,830
of them and no levers
um that's instead of using the eight

1266
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:11,840
um that's instead of using the eight
 

1267
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,750
um that's instead of using the eight
levers like i'm planning

1268
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:13,760
levers like i'm planning
 

1269
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,909
levers like i'm planning
downside definitely is fitting in all

would be really sweet to use that

1280
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:25,679
would be really sweet to use that
 

1281
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,909
would be really sweet to use that
mechanic though so there are uh

1282
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:27,919
mechanic though so there are uh
 

1283
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,710

certain benefits to it you would only

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,470
certain benefits to it you would only
need three item frames instead of eight

it might be a little more difficult to

1294
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:40,559
it might be a little more difficult to
 

1295
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,630
it might be a little more difficult to
rotate the items and is just to flip the

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
rotate the items and is just to flip the

it also becomes more confusing

1300
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
it also becomes more confusing
 

1301
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,590
it also becomes more confusing
and less efficient when you're you're

1302
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:49,600
and less efficient when you're you're
 

1303
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,909
and less efficient when you're you're
going from an octal system to a binary

and like with that mental trick i have

1308
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:55,520
and like with that mental trick i have
 

1309
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,549
and like with that mental trick i have
in mind of

1310
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:56,559
in mind of
 

1311
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,830
in mind of
of uh keeping track of where items are

1312
00:26:59,830 --> 00:26:59,840
of uh keeping track of where items are
 

1313
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,110
of uh keeping track of where items are
in the storage room compared to uh

1314
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,120
in the storage room compared to uh
 

1315
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,470
in the storage room compared to uh
the levers like you can you can position

1316
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
the levers like you can you can position
 

1317
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,070
the levers like you can you can position
items according to the levers um

1318
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,080
items according to the levers um
 

1319
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,430
items according to the levers um
wouldn't be able to do that if we used

1320
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
wouldn't be able to do that if we used
 

1321
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,190
wouldn't be able to do that if we used
an octal system so there's

1322
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,200
an octal system so there's
 

1323
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,590
an octal system so there's
there's some benefits to both of them

1324
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:17,600
there's some benefits to both of them
 

1325
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,830
there's some benefits to both of them
but yeah anyway we'll look into it more

1326
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:19,840
but yeah anyway we'll look into it more
 

1327
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,470
but yeah anyway we'll look into it more
as we get closer to that

1328
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:22,480
as we get closer to that
 

1329
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,990
as we get closer to that

different but with
