use jump boost I find it kind of

326
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
use jump boost I find it kind of
 

327
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,360
use jump boost I find it kind of
annoying most of the time but with our

328

annoying most of the time but with our
 

329
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,910
annoying most of the time but with our
base we're going to design it with it in

330
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
base we're going to design it with it in
 

331
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,100
base we're going to design it with it in
mind so that it won't be annoying

332
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,110
mind so that it won't be annoying

we're going to go from this mountaintop

396
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,170
we're going to go from this mountaintop
 

397
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,350
we're going to go from this mountaintop
over here to over there I think is a

398
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
over here to over there I think is a
 

399
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,600
over here to over there I think is a
good place to set this up because we do

400
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:55,610
good place to set this up because we do
 

401
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,340
good place to set this up because we do
have that boat launcher we did a couple

402
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,350
have that boat launcher we did a couple
 

403
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,630
have that boat launcher we did a couple
episodes ago there that takes us to

404
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:00,640
episodes ago there that takes us to
 

405
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,769
episodes ago there that takes us to
around there right

406
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:02,779
around there right
 

407
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,410
around there right
but this mountain isn't actually

408
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:05,420
but this mountain isn't actually
 

409
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,780
but this mountain isn't actually
connected to this one so we have no way

410
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:07,790
connected to this one so we have no way
 

411
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,790
connected to this one so we have no way
of getting to over there currently so we

412
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:09,800
of getting to over there currently so we
 

413
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,920
of getting to over there currently so we
should we should have something so we'll

414
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:11,930
should we should have something so we'll
 

415
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,340
should we should have something so we'll
use this until we need something more

416
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:15,350
use this until we need something more
 

417
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,840
use this until we need something more
fancy because this will do the trick I

418
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:16,850
fancy because this will do the trick I
 

419
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,160
fancy because this will do the trick I
think I've never actually used one of

420
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,170
think I've never actually used one of
 

421
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,079
think I've never actually used one of
these and I'm hoping I set it up right

422
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:25,089

 

423
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:29,680

00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,480
idea is I think about 25 storage mine
Kurt should do the trick I want to make

640
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:58,490
Kurt should do the trick I want to make
 

641
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,850
Kurt should do the trick I want to make
it though where we'll have several of

642
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:00,860
it though where we'll have several of
 

643
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,190
it though where we'll have several of
these set up throughout the islands not

644
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
these set up throughout the islands not
 

645
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,850
these set up throughout the islands not
the island the mountain areas right in

646
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:06,860
the island the mountain areas right in
 

647
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,909
the island the mountain areas right in
various places like a layer I want like

648
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:09,919
various places like a layer I want like
 

649
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,020
various places like a layer I want like
at least four or five of these and if

650
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,030
at least four or five of these and if
 

651
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,669
at least four or five of these and if
you go up to one of the storage rooms

652
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
you go up to one of the storage rooms
 

653
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,350
you go up to one of the storage rooms
that doesn't have the storage minecarts

654
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,360
that doesn't have the storage minecarts
 

655
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,270
that doesn't have the storage minecarts
you hit a button and then all the mine

656
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
you hit a button and then all the mine
 

657
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,190
you hit a button and then all the mine
cards from what from the storage room

658
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
cards from what from the storage room
 

659
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,270
cards from what from the storage room
they're at will decide to move out and

660
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
they're at will decide to move out and
 

661
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,399
they're at will decide to move out and
make it make their way over to the

662
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:27,409
make it make their way over to the
 

663
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:30,490
make it make their way over to the
storage room you're at and hopefully get

664
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:30,500
storage room you're at and hopefully get
 

665
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,039
storage room you're at and hopefully get
there within a minute or so I don't know

666
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,049
there within a minute or so I don't know
 

667
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:35,549
there within a minute or so I don't know
exactly how it's going to work out but

668
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:35,559
exactly how it's going to work out but
 

669
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:39,250
exactly how it's going to work out but
yeah and basically if I'm working in one

670
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:39,260
yeah and basically if I'm working in one
 

671
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,799
yeah and basically if I'm working in one
area hit the button all the storage mine

672
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:41,809
area hit the button all the storage mine
 

673
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:44,260
area hit the button all the storage mine
cards we have arrived there and then if

674
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,270
cards we have arrived there and then if
 

675
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,870
cards we have arrived there and then if
I'm working in another area hit the

676
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:46,880
I'm working in another area hit the
 

677
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,409
I'm working in another area hit the
button

678
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:47,419
button
 

679
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,060
button
all the storage mine carts move over

680
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,070
all the storage mine carts move over
 

681
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,980
all the storage mine carts move over
there and that way it's nice and

682
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:50,990
there and that way it's nice and
 

683
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,530
there and that way it's nice and
convenient is I find with the man cave

684
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:53,540
convenient is I find with the man cave
 

685
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,680
convenient is I find with the man cave
here I have to run around a lot running

686
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:56,690
here I have to run around a lot running
 

687
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,780
here I have to run around a lot running
back and forth between our storage room

688
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:58,790
back and forth between our storage room
 

689
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:03,499
back and forth between our storage room
here I really like this design

690
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:03,509

 

691
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,210

that we got going on here and that's

692
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:06,220
that we got going on here and that's
 

693
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,489
that we got going on here and that's
what kind of what I'm trying to imitate

694
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:08,499
what kind of what I'm trying to imitate
 

695
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:10,999
what kind of what I'm trying to imitate
up there this is

696
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:11,009
up there this is
 

697
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:17,129
up there this is
what is it six twelve twelve Ches per

698
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:17,139
what is it six twelve twelve Ches per
 

699
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:21,149
what is it six twelve twelve Ches per
side 36 total and we're gonna try to get

700
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:21,159
side 36 total and we're gonna try to get
 

701
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:26,879
side 36 total and we're gonna try to get
it down to 25 maybe I think would be

702
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:26,889
it down to 25 maybe I think would be
 

703
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:29,639
it down to 25 maybe I think would be
good we'll have one storage room though

704
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:29,649
good we'll have one storage room though
 

705
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:32,009
good we'll have one storage room though
that's the main one so if we have extra

706
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:32,019
that's the main one so if we have extra
 

707
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:34,320
that's the main one so if we have extra
of anything we will drop stuff off there

708
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,330
of anything we will drop stuff off there
 

709
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,830
of anything we will drop stuff off there
like we'll have a cart area and a and

710
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
like we'll have a cart area and a and
 

711
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,710
like we'll have a cart area and a and
chest area so extra supplies we'll end

712
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:40,720
chest area so extra supplies we'll end
 

713
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,619
chest area so extra supplies we'll end
up at that one but to make this work

714
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:45,629
up at that one but to make this work
 

715
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:49,379
up at that one but to make this work
it's a bit complicated because we have

716
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:49,389
it's a bit complicated because we have
 

717
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,499
it's a bit complicated because we have
to set up a call button but also the way

718
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:51,509
to set up a call button but also the way
 

719
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:55,109
to set up a call button but also the way
to organize the carts we want them all

720
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:55,119
to organize the carts we want them all
 

721
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,399
to organize the carts we want them all
to converge down into one rail so it's

722
00:19:59,399 --> 00:19:59,409
to converge down into one rail so it's
 

723
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:01,710
to converge down into one rail so it's
nice and simple and then like transport

724
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:01,720
nice and simple and then like transport
 

725
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,629
nice and simple and then like transport
them from Mountain to mountain so it'll

726
00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:03,639
them from Mountain to mountain so it'll
 

727
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,999
them from Mountain to mountain so it'll
be flying through the air and and doing

728
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:06,009
be flying through the air and and doing
 

729
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:11,399
be flying through the air and and doing
fun slime block stuff and then when they

730
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:11,409
fun slime block stuff and then when they
 

731
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:13,560
fun slime block stuff and then when they
arrive at one of these stations they

732
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:13,570
arrive at one of these stations they
 

733
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,029
arrive at one of these stations they
need to arrange themselves in the right

734
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039
need to arrange themselves in the right
 

735
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,619
need to arrange themselves in the right
order so that they line up with the

736
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:16,629
order so that they line up with the
 

737
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:19,950
order so that they line up with the
signs we have that categorizes what's in

738
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:19,960
signs we have that categorizes what's in
 

739
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,470
signs we have that categorizes what's in
the cart so there's two ways to do it

740
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:25,480
the cart so there's two ways to do it
 

741
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,739
the cart so there's two ways to do it
we could have item detectors that detect

742
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:28,749
we could have item detectors that detect
 

743
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:30,359
we could have item detectors that detect
what's in the cart and then arrange

744
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:30,369
what's in the cart and then arrange
 

745
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:33,419
what's in the cart and then arrange
thing is based on that so that we could

746
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:33,429
thing is based on that so that we could
 

747
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:36,149
thing is based on that so that we could
send them in any order we want or we

748
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
send them in any order we want or we
 

749
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,609
send them in any order we want or we
could try to do it in a logical order so

750
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:38,619
could try to do it in a logical order so
 

751
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:41,399
could try to do it in a logical order so
that it's sort of based upon time so

752
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:41,409
that it's sort of based upon time so
 

753
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:43,169
that it's sort of based upon time so
that like maybe this minecart goes first

754
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:43,179
that like maybe this minecart goes first
 

755
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:45,389
that like maybe this minecart goes first
this one second third fourth fifth six

756
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:45,399
this one second third fourth fifth six
 

757
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:47,700
this one second third fourth fifth six
seven eight nine ten and then follow

758
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:47,710
seven eight nine ten and then follow
 

759
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,139
seven eight nine ten and then follow
their way out and then we have to

760
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:49,149
their way out and then we have to
 

761
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:52,499
their way out and then we have to
arrange it so that swoops this one ends

762
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:52,509
arrange it so that swoops this one ends
 

763
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:54,570
arrange it so that swoops this one ends
up over here again when it gets the next

764
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:54,580
up over here again when it gets the next
 

765
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,720
up over here again when it gets the next
place mmhmm right so out of those two

766
00:20:59,720 --> 00:20:59,730
place mmhmm right so out of those two
 

767
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,220
place mmhmm right so out of those two
methods I think doing it in order is

768
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,230
methods I think doing it in order is
 

769
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,840
methods I think doing it in order is
going to be the easiest way of doing it

770
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:03,850
going to be the easiest way of doing it
 

771
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,539
going to be the easiest way of doing it
and I do not have this worked out or

772
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:06,549
and I do not have this worked out or
 

773
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:08,369
and I do not have this worked out or
anything I just had this idea today in

774
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:08,379
anything I just had this idea today in
 

775
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:10,859
anything I just had this idea today in
fact and I'm going to work it out later

776
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:10,869
fact and I'm going to work it out later
 

777
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,720
fact and I'm going to work it out later
between this episode next one will

778
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:12,730
between this episode next one will
 

779
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,159
between this episode next one will
probably spend some time in creative

780
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:14,169
probably spend some time in creative
 

781
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:16,500
probably spend some time in creative
mode and and see if I can work out

782
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:16,510
mode and and see if I can work out
 

783
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,990
mode and and see if I can work out
the little details to it we can do a

784
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:19,000
the little details to it we can do a
 

785
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,690
the little details to it we can do a
little bit of that today though I got it

786
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:21,700
little bit of that today though I got it
 

787
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,200
little bit of that today though I got it
a simple experiment set up here first

788
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,210
a simple experiment set up here first
 

789
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,270
a simple experiment set up here first
thing we got to see is sort of the

790
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,280
thing we got to see is sort of the
 

791
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,940
thing we got to see is sort of the
spacing between the minecarts if we just

792
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:29,950
spacing between the minecarts if we just
 

793
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,220
spacing between the minecarts if we just
let them go on their own with no control

794
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,230
let them go on their own with no control
 

795
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,990
let them go on their own with no control
so I have power rail here mine carts

796
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,000
so I have power rail here mine carts
 

797

so I have power rail here mine carts
will fall fall down and we will see the

798
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000
will fall fall down and we will see the
 

799
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,550
will fall fall down and we will see the
distance between them and if if they get

800
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:44,560
distance between them and if if they get
 

801
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,780
distance between them and if if they get
in each other's way or anything like

802
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:45,790
in each other's way or anything like
 

803

that so sticky pistons going to remove
 

805
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:53,150
that so sticky pistons going to remove
the block and they'll fall down okay

806
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:53,160
the block and they'll fall down okay
 

807
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,770

that was what I was afraid of that

808
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:55,780
that was what I was afraid of that
 

809
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:01,440

didn't dykes we want it to be quick but

810
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:01,450
didn't dykes we want it to be quick but
 

811
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,000
didn't dykes we want it to be quick but
they kind of got in each other's way

812
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,010
they kind of got in each other's way
 

813
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,430
they kind of got in each other's way
there I don't know if we could get away

814
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,440
there I don't know if we could get away
 

815
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,140
there I don't know if we could get away
with that we might have to control it

816
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,150
with that we might have to control it
 

817
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:14,340
with that we might have to control it
more mmm darn I was really hoping it'd

818
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,350
more mmm darn I was really hoping it'd
 

819
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,200
more mmm darn I was really hoping it'd
be simpler so to be thorough we're going

820
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,210
be simpler so to be thorough we're going
 

821
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,310
be simpler so to be thorough we're going
to try this again

822
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,320
to try this again
 

823
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,440
to try this again
with a pretty similar setup the only

824
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:22,450
with a pretty similar setup the only
 

825
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,170
with a pretty similar setup the only
difference is I change this to a slope

826
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:25,180
difference is I change this to a slope
 

827
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,670
difference is I change this to a slope
track I'm not sure if that will have a

828
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:26,680
track I'm not sure if that will have a
 

829
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,700
track I'm not sure if that will have a
different result and I got rid of that

830
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:29,710
different result and I got rid of that
 

831
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,860
different result and I got rid of that
first curve because I'm sure that messes

832
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:31,870
first curve because I'm sure that messes
 

833
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,160
first curve because I'm sure that messes
things up too it probably won't work but

834
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,170
things up too it probably won't work but
 

835
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,260
things up too it probably won't work but
I wanted to see for sure so here we go

836
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:39,270
I wanted to see for sure so here we go
 

837
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,480

yeah they stole
 

839
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,070
yeah they stole
they still merge together they were fine

840
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,080
they still merge together they were fine
 

841
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,020
they still merge together they were fine
until they'd went around the curve too

842
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,030
until they'd went around the curve too
 

843
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,870
until they'd went around the curve too
but we definitely need a timer to space

844
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:49,880
but we definitely need a timer to space
 

845
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,910
but we definitely need a timer to space
them up a bit oh I have something to

show you here it is possible to separate

848
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,050
show you here it is possible to separate
 

849
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,500
show you here it is possible to separate
the cards it's not too tough just need a

850
00:22:59,500 --> 00:22:59,510
the cards it's not too tough just need a
 

851
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:05,020
the cards it's not too tough just need a
quick pulse you see it only sent one so

852
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,030
quick pulse you see it only sent one so
 

853
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,970
quick pulse you see it only sent one so
we need a timer to control the spacing

854
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:06,980
we need a timer to control the spacing
 

855
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,280
we need a timer to control the spacing
between them that's pretty easy to do

856
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,290
between them that's pretty easy to do
 

857
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:16,090
between them that's pretty easy to do
actually and then one five of them go

858
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:16,100
actually and then one five of them go
 

859
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,830
actually and then one five of them go
down we need to switch to the next

860
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
down we need to switch to the next
 

861
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,800
down we need to switch to the next
column do that five times and switch the

862
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:20,810
column do that five times and switch the
 

863
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,800
column do that five times and switch the
next one five times and we need like a

864
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:23,810
next one five times and we need like a
 

865
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,830
next one five times and we need like a
redstone thing to control that ah

866
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:26,840
redstone thing to control that ah
 

867
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,350
redstone thing to control that ah
and then when they arrive we need like

868
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:32,360
and then when they arrive we need like
 

869
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,720
and then when they arrive we need like
another redstone thing to control them

870
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:34,730
another redstone thing to control them
 

871
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,520
another redstone thing to control them
