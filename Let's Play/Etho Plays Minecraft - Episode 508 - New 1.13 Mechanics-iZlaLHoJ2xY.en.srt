out of here intricity okay I got some
 

207
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,530
out of here intricity okay I got some
iron as well for iron golems see if it's

208
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:50,540
iron as well for iron golems see if it's
 

209
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,370
iron as well for iron golems see if it's
any difference and nope can't use that

210
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:54,380
any difference and nope can't use that
 

211
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,860
any difference and nope can't use that
as expected so it's got to be these ones

212
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:58,870

 

213
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,880

huh yeah oh we got an achievements or

change and I want to try out with

220
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:09,710
change and I want to try out with
 

221
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,360
change and I want to try out with
dispensers too because you can equip you

222
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,370
dispensers too because you can equip you
 

223
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,550
dispensers too because you can equip you
equipped pumpkins on your heads before

224
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:15,560
equipped pumpkins on your heads before
 

225
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,130
equipped pumpkins on your heads before
with the face ones so you can do it with

226
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:18,140
with the face ones so you can do it with
 

227
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,010
with the face ones so you can do it with
the faceless ones so take off the helmet

228
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,020
the faceless ones so take off the helmet
 

229
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,719
the faceless ones so take off the helmet
let's try it with a face one yeah let's

230
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:25,729
let's try it with a face one yeah let's
 

231
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:31,390
let's try it with a face one yeah let's
try faceless no okay so they are they're

232
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:31,400
try faceless no okay so they are they're
 

233
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,330
try faceless no okay so they are they're
quite different then aha another pretty

234
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:34,340
quite different then aha another pretty
 

235
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,920
quite different then aha another pretty
relevant thing here you can make the

236
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:35,930
relevant thing here you can make the
 

237
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,360
relevant thing here you can make the
jack-o'-lanterns with the carved ones

238
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,370
jack-o'-lanterns with the carved ones
 

239
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,230
jack-o'-lanterns with the carved ones
but obviously not with the regular ones

240
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
but obviously not with the regular ones
 

241
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,630
but obviously not with the regular ones
got another surprise here they are just

242
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:43,640
got another surprise here they are just
 

243
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,409
got another surprise here they are just
everywhere aren't they apparently you

244
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:47,419
everywhere aren't they apparently you
 

245
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:49,420
everywhere aren't they apparently you
get the snow slabs now if I think you

246
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:49,430
get the snow slabs now if I think you
 

247
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,210
get the snow slabs now if I think you
have a silk touch shovel and I checked

248
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:52,220
have a silk touch shovel and I checked
 

249
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,650
have a silk touch shovel and I checked
the wiki page on this and it didn't have

250
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:53,660
the wiki page on this and it didn't have
 

251
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,300
the wiki page on this and it didn't have
anything about it so I think this is a

252
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,310
anything about it so I think this is a
 

253
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,980
anything about it so I think this is a
pretty obscure change all the redstone

254
00:05:59,980 --> 00:05:59,990
pretty obscure change all the redstone
 

255
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,430
pretty obscure change all the redstone
guys redstone is super laggy in this

256
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
guys redstone is super laggy in this
 

257
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,700
guys redstone is super laggy in this
update for some reason you might see

258
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:06,710
update for some reason you might see
 

259
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,900
update for some reason you might see
some frame dropping

260
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:07,910
some frame dropping
 

261
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,980
some frame dropping
in this episode I'm not sure um yeah

262
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:11,990
in this episode I'm not sure um yeah
 

263
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,810
in this episode I'm not sure um yeah
let's go over here because we tried this

264
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:13,820
let's go over here because we tried this
 

265
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,360
let's go over here because we tried this
I think last episode was just a regular

266

273
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,740
good job on it too it depends on how
many are in the in the block here so I

274
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:26,750
many are in the in the block here so I
 

275
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,200
many are in the in the block here so I
think this one's six you break it you

276
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,210
think this one's six you break it you
 

277
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,430

maybe was five yeah 5 this is 6 11 now

280
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,270
maybe was five yeah 5 this is 6 11 now
 

281
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,360
maybe was five yeah 5 this is 6 11 now

and this one 7 so we should have 18 yeah
alright everybody so I thought next

284
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:41,510
alright everybody so I thought next
 

285
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,330
alright everybody so I thought next
up here we would check out the water

286
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:43,340
up here we would check out the water
 

287
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,090
up here we would check out the water
mechanics in a bit more detail because I

288
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:46,100
mechanics in a bit more detail because I
 

289
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,830
mechanics in a bit more detail because I
know some of you that watch me don't

290
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
know some of you that watch me don't
 

291
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,670
know some of you that watch me don't
play the game anymore right and it would

292
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
play the game anymore right and it would
 

293
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,010
play the game anymore right and it would
be good if you guys know how it works so

294
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:54,020
be good if you guys know how it works so
 

295
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,750
be good if you guys know how it works so
that when we do stuff it with it in the

296
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:55,760
that when we do stuff it with it in the
 

297
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,280
that when we do stuff it with it in the
future it's not like well why is it

298
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,290
future it's not like well why is it
 

299
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,070
future it's not like well why is it
doing that you know also I think there's

300
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
doing that you know also I think there's
 

301
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,810
doing that you know also I think there's
a lot of confusion about the way the

302
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:01,820
a lot of confusion about the way the
 

303
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,940
a lot of confusion about the way the
water works because of maybe some of the

304
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:03,950
water works because of maybe some of the
 

305
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,560
water works because of maybe some of the
snapshots that work differently before

306
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:05,570
snapshots that work differently before
 

307
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,050
snapshots that work differently before
like when I was building the ice farm a

308
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,060
like when I was building the ice farm a
 

309
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,020
like when I was building the ice farm a
lot of you said that the water was gonna

310
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,030
lot of you said that the water was gonna
 

311
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,480
lot of you said that the water was gonna
pass through the trap doors which I

312
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:13,490
pass through the trap doors which I
 

313
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,270
pass through the trap doors which I
don't think is right right we'll find

314
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:16,280
don't think is right right we'll find
 

315
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,160
don't think is right right we'll find
out here let's let's try some stuff out

316
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,170
out here let's let's try some stuff out
 

317
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,100
out here let's let's try some stuff out
so as as we saw before items float in

318
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,110
so as as we saw before items float in
 

319
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,410
so as as we saw before items float in
water now so they don't drag along the

320
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:23,420
water now so they don't drag along the
 

321
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,650
water now so they don't drag along the
bottom that's kind of key if we place

322
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:26,660
bottom that's kind of key if we place
 

323
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,340
bottom that's kind of key if we place
like a ladder here yeah so you can still

324
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:30,350
like a ladder here yeah so you can still
 

325
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,880
like a ladder here yeah so you can still
have blocks like this with air spaces

326
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:33,890
have blocks like this with air spaces
 

327
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,730
have blocks like this with air spaces
right but if you want to turn them into

328
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:36,740
right but if you want to turn them into
 

329
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,890
right but if you want to turn them into
water blocks actually ladders might not

330
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:38,900
water blocks actually ladders might not
 

331
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,580
water blocks actually ladders might not
be one of them

332
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:39,590
be one of them
 

333
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,310
be one of them
oh no they are they are you place the

334
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:42,320
oh no they are they are you place the
 

335
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,390
oh no they are they are you place the
water bucket in it right so that's

336
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
water bucket in it right so that's
 

337
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,190
water bucket in it right so that's
that's a really cool way of doing it you

338
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:48,200
that's a really cool way of doing it you
 

339
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,340
that's a really cool way of doing it you
can have it both ways that way this is

340
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,350
can have it both ways that way this is
 

341
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,080
can have it both ways that way this is
good for me too though cuz I I don't

342
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,090
good for me too though cuz I I don't
 

343
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,260
good for me too though cuz I I don't
know how the water works either I saw a

344
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:56,270
know how the water works either I saw a
 

345
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,390
know how the water works either I saw a
lot of like reddit posts about it and I

346
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
lot of like reddit posts about it and I
 

347
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,070
lot of like reddit posts about it and I
think some of those some of those things

348
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
think some of those some of those things
 

349
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,900
think some of those some of those things
don't work anymore like that worked in

350
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:01,910
don't work anymore like that worked in
 

351
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,270
don't work anymore like that worked in
the snapshots so I guess the way it

352
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,280
the snapshots so I guess the way it
 

353
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,430
the snapshots so I guess the way it
works is if you have a water source

354
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:06,440
works is if you have a water source
 

355
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,980
works is if you have a water source
block and you place a block that to me

356
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:08,990
block and you place a block that to me
 

357
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,220
block and you place a block that to me
water logged in it's like a trapdoor it

358
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,230
water logged in it's like a trapdoor it
 

359
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,080
water logged in it's like a trapdoor it
automatically gets water logged same

360
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,090
automatically gets water logged same
 

361
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,870
automatically gets water logged same
with the ladder same with stairs same

362
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:16,880
with the ladder same with stairs same
 

363
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,310
with the ladder same with stairs same
with slabs so that's good if you're

364
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:18,320
with slabs so that's good if you're
 

365
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,810
with slabs so that's good if you're
building underwater like an underwater

366
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:19,820
building underwater like an underwater
 

367
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,370
building underwater like an underwater
base you don't have to place a water

368
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:21,380
base you don't have to place a water
 

369
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,400
base you don't have to place a water
bucket into the block every single time

370
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:24,410
bucket into the block every single time
 

371
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,900
bucket into the block every single time
you do it right also so like flowing

372
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:28,910
you do it right also so like flowing
 

373
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,930
you do it right also so like flowing
water doesn't go into a water laga Bowl

374
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:31,940
water doesn't go into a water laga Bowl
 

375
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,520
water doesn't go into a water laga Bowl
block like this right but if a situation

376
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:36,530
block like this right but if a situation
 

377
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,370
block like this right but if a situation
rises where a water source would be

378
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:39,380
rises where a water source would be
 

379
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,880
rises where a water source would be
created in it like that then it then

380
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:42,890
created in it like that then it then
 

381
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,040
created in it like that then it then
they'll spread there which is kind of

382
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,050
they'll spread there which is kind of
 

383
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,610
they'll spread there which is kind of
interesting so in our case with like the

384
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:47,620
interesting so in our case with like the
 

385
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,440
interesting so in our case with like the
the ice farm we have a row of trapdoors

386
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,450
the ice farm we have a row of trapdoors
 

387
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,770
the ice farm we have a row of trapdoors
kind of like this right and

388
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:55,780

 

389
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,940

let's grab some water here I should have

390
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:57,950
let's grab some water here I should have
 

391
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:03,150
let's grab some water here I should have
set this up earlier yeah so we have like

392
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,160
set this up earlier yeah so we have like
 

393
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,860
set this up earlier yeah so we have like
water sources all along one side here

394
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:05,870
water sources all along one side here
 

395
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,810
water sources all along one side here
right they won't spread to the trapdoors

396
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:07,820
right they won't spread to the trapdoors
 

397
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,900
right they won't spread to the trapdoors
until we place it here because then a

398
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:10,910
until we place it here because then a
 

399
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,270
until we place it here because then a
water source block can be created here

400
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:13,280
water source block can be created here
 

401
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,770
water source block can be created here
because we got one there and one here

402
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:14,780
because we got one there and one here
 

403
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,260
because we got one there and one here
and then one can be made here and it

404
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:17,270
and then one can be made here and it
 

405
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,210
and then one can be made here and it
makes a chain reaction chain reactions

406
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:19,220
makes a chain reaction chain reactions
 

407
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,310
makes a chain reaction chain reactions
do occur within water long blocks so

408
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
do occur within water long blocks so
 

409
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,760
do occur within water long blocks so
that's kind of key as well before in the

410
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:27,770
that's kind of key as well before in the
 

411
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,440
that's kind of key as well before in the
snapshots you could you could actually

412
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:29,450
snapshots you could you could actually
 

413
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,170
snapshots you could you could actually
move water in waterlogged blocks like if

414
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:32,180
move water in waterlogged blocks like if
 

415
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,050
move water in waterlogged blocks like if
you had water and a slab like this and

416
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,060
you had water and a slab like this and
 

417
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,290
you had water and a slab like this and
he moved it upwards then it would it

418
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:38,300
he moved it upwards then it would it
 

419
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,790
he moved it upwards then it would it
would spread out on the ground here

420
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:39,800
would spread out on the ground here
 

421
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,570
would spread out on the ground here
right but I guess they changed it so it

422
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:43,580
right but I guess they changed it so it
 

423
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,240
right but I guess they changed it so it
just gets deleted the water same was

424
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,250
just gets deleted the water same was
 

425
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,910
just gets deleted the water same was
over here you can hide water like behind

426
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:48,920
over here you can hide water like behind
 

427
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,470
over here you can hide water like behind
a wall before and then move it

428
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
a wall before and then move it
 

429
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,670
a wall before and then move it
but now the water just disappears one

430
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:54,680
but now the water just disappears one
 

431
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,080
but now the water just disappears one
thing that's really nice is no matter

432
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,090
thing that's really nice is no matter
 

433
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,800
thing that's really nice is no matter
how high above the hopper and entity is

434
00:09:59,800 --> 00:09:59,810
how high above the hopper and entity is
 

435
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,200
how high above the hopper and entity is
it always gets picked up by the hopper

436
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,210
it always gets picked up by the hopper
 

437
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,360
it always gets picked up by the hopper
below here which is really cool so you

438
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,370
below here which is really cool so you
 

439
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,950
below here which is really cool so you
don't have to worry about items flowing

440
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:05,960
don't have to worry about items flowing
 

441
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,910
don't have to worry about items flowing
over hoppers in in water streams and

442
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:08,920
over hoppers in in water streams and
 

443
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,200
over hoppers in in water streams and
another thing I noticed here this is

444
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,210
another thing I noticed here this is
 

445
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,450
another thing I noticed here this is
something I would like to change is if

446
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:13,460
something I would like to change is if
 

447
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,670
something I would like to change is if
you try to place a water bucket in a

448
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
you try to place a water bucket in a
 

449
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,270
you try to place a water bucket in a
waterlogged block oh it worked

450
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:21,280

 

451
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,770

doesn't work with all of them that's

452
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:23,780
doesn't work with all of them that's
 

453
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,630
doesn't work with all of them that's
interesting wait a minute what so I

454
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
interesting wait a minute what so I
 

455
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,610
interesting wait a minute what so I
didn't work with trapdoors right no I

456
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:30,620
didn't work with trapdoors right no I
 

457
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,520
didn't work with trapdoors right no I
can't place this down here my you here

458
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:33,530
can't place this down here my you here
 

459
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,200
can't place this down here my you here
my right mouse button clicking like

460
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,210
my right mouse button clicking like
 

461
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,100
my right mouse button clicking like
crazy there can't place it there can't

462
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,110
crazy there can't place it there can't
 

463

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:41,420
place it there do you place it in in
 

465
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,500
place it there do you place it in in
ladders for some reason though huh oh

466
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,510
ladders for some reason though huh oh
 

467
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,690
ladders for some reason though huh oh
man I am so crushed right now I thought

468
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:46,700
man I am so crushed right now I thought
 

469
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,920
man I am so crushed right now I thought
I thought for sure this is a feature I

470
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:49,930
I thought for sure this is a feature I
 

471
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,300
I thought for sure this is a feature I
saw on the red that people were placing

472
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,310
saw on the red that people were placing
 

473
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,980
saw on the red that people were placing
rails underwater and like making

474
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:53,990
rails underwater and like making
 

475
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,520
rails underwater and like making
underwater minecart systems but I don't

476
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:57,530
underwater minecart systems but I don't
 

477
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,260
underwater minecart systems but I don't
know if it was in the snapshots I saw on

478
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,270
know if it was in the snapshots I saw on
 

479
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,720
know if it was in the snapshots I saw on
the wiki page just now that's it's a

480
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:01,730
the wiki page just now that's it's a
 

481
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,970
the wiki page just now that's it's a
feature in the bedrock edition of the

482
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:03,980
feature in the bedrock edition of the
 

483
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,480
feature in the bedrock edition of the
game so hopefully it comes out in the

484
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:07,490
game so hopefully it comes out in the
 

485
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,260
game so hopefully it comes out in the
Java version

486
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:08,270
Java version
 

487
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,760
Java version
cuz I think that would be really cool I

488
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:09,770
cuz I think that would be really cool I
 

489
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,680
cuz I think that would be really cool I
wanted to use that at our underwater

490
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:11,690
wanted to use that at our underwater
 

491
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,450
wanted to use that at our underwater
base but guess it's not a thing you know

492
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:16,460
base but guess it's not a thing you know
 

493
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,280
base but guess it's not a thing you know
it might be okay actually we're gonna

494
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,290
it might be okay actually we're gonna
 

495
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,770
it might be okay actually we're gonna
we're gonna try it out your underwater

496
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:19,780
we're gonna try it out your underwater
 

497
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,570
we're gonna try it out your underwater
but also notice this I guess because my

498
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:22,580
but also notice this I guess because my
 

499
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,050
but also notice this I guess because my
world was made before 1.13 none of the

500
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,060
world was made before 1.13 none of the
 

501
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,940
world was made before 1.13 none of the
water got updated to the new light

502
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:27,950
water got updated to the new light
 

503
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,520
water got updated to the new light
levels so anytime I place like a block

504
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:30,530
levels so anytime I place like a block
 

505
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:36,370
levels so anytime I place like a block
underwater it updates and I hate it when

506
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:36,380
underwater it updates and I hate it when
 

507
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,600
underwater it updates and I hate it when
I say things and then they don't come

508
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:37,610
I say things and then they don't come
 

509
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,880
I say things and then they don't come
true maybe I gotta have a block with

510
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:39,890
true maybe I gotta have a block with
 

511
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,240
true maybe I gotta have a block with
light lighting in actually how does that

512
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,250
light lighting in actually how does that
 

513
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:43,810
light lighting in actually how does that
work

514
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:43,820
work
 

515
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,970
work
oh that now it did so if there's

516
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:45,980
oh that now it did so if there's
 

517
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,740
oh that now it did so if there's
lighting nearby and then I place a block

518
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:47,750
lighting nearby and then I place a block
 

519
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:53,290
lighting nearby and then I place a block
it updates interesting okay so we're

520
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,300
it updates interesting okay so we're
 

521
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,000
it updates interesting okay so we're
gonna try to get the minecarts working

522
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,010
gonna try to get the minecarts working
 

523
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,160
gonna try to get the minecarts working
on the water here still it should be

524
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,170
on the water here still it should be
 

525
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:57,730
on the water here still it should be
pretty good

526
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:57,740
pretty good
 

527
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,980
pretty good
as long as our heads above or in the

528
00:11:59,980 --> 00:11:59,990
as long as our heads above or in the
 

529
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,950
as long as our heads above or in the
water it'll be cool alright so I think

530
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:02,960
water it'll be cool alright so I think
 

531
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,330
water it'll be cool alright so I think
what we got to do is this that like a

532
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:04,340
what we got to do is this that like a
 

533
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,360
what we got to do is this that like a
row of of trapdoors or something which

534
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,370
row of of trapdoors or something which
 

535
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,360
row of of trapdoors or something which
by the way we have new trapdoors all six

536
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,370
by the way we have new trapdoors all six
 

537
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,230
by the way we have new trapdoors all six
wood colors I really like that spruce

538
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
wood colors I really like that spruce
 

539
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,770
wood colors I really like that spruce
ones I think are everybody's favorites

540
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:16,780
ones I think are everybody's favorites
 

541
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,260
ones I think are everybody's favorites
very good for building so now that we

542
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,270
very good for building so now that we
 

543
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,870
very good for building so now that we
did that these are these trapdoors are

544
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
did that these are these trapdoors are
 

545
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,920
did that these are these trapdoors are
waterlogged rights

546
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:23,930
waterlogged rights
 

547
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:29,410
waterlogged rights
oh yeah the blocks aren't floating so

548
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:29,420
oh yeah the blocks aren't floating so
 

549
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,270
oh yeah the blocks aren't floating so
where we're standing in air right now

550
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,280
where we're standing in air right now
 

551
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,240
where we're standing in air right now
it's good that's what I want and then I

552
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,250
it's good that's what I want and then I
 

553
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,620
it's good that's what I want and then I
think you just got to put the rails down

554
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:35,630
think you just got to put the rails down
 

555
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:43,620
think you just got to put the rails down
here why did that work

556
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:43,630
here why did that work
 

557
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,730
here why did that work
shouldn't it be air underneath here

558
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:45,740
shouldn't it be air underneath here
 

559
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,530
shouldn't it be air underneath here
because I place the trapdoors first and

560
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:47,540
because I place the trapdoors first and
 

561
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,990
because I place the trapdoors first and
then I mind it out mm-hmm you know I

562
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,000
then I mind it out mm-hmm you know I
 

563
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,310
then I mind it out mm-hmm you know I
thought I tried this and it didn't work

564
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
thought I tried this and it didn't work
 

565
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,840
thought I tried this and it didn't work
so I guess this is another really

566
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:55,850
so I guess this is another really
 

567
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,280
so I guess this is another really
important thing if you have a

568
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,290
important thing if you have a
 

569
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,670
important thing if you have a
waterlogged block it will spread the

570
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:00,680
waterlogged block it will spread the
 

571
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,280
waterlogged block it will spread the
flowing water out of it

572
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,290
flowing water out of it
 

573
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,720
flowing water out of it
for some reason I thought that wasn't

574
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:04,730
for some reason I thought that wasn't
 

575
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,950
for some reason I thought that wasn't
true here let's so that's what's

576
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:08,960
true here let's so that's what's
 

577
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,010
true here let's so that's what's
happening because it's flowing downwards

578
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,020
happening because it's flowing downwards
 

579
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,670
happening because it's flowing downwards
pretty sure there's water down here

580
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
pretty sure there's water down here
 

581
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,780
pretty sure there's water down here
right yeah so it flows underneath it too

582
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:19,790
right yeah so it flows underneath it too
 

583
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,000
right yeah so it flows underneath it too
so those items weren't floating because

584
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,010
so those items weren't floating because
 

585
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,800
so those items weren't floating because
there was a downward current I think

586
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:24,810
there was a downward current I think
 

587
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,900
there was a downward current I think
this is worth worth noting as well so if

588
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:26,910
this is worth worth noting as well so if
 

589
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,250
this is worth worth noting as well so if
we throw an item in the water of course

590
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:28,260
we throw an item in the water of course
 

591
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,890
we throw an item in the water of course
it floats right if we have a downward

592
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:30,900
it floats right if we have a downward
 

593
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,690
it floats right if we have a downward
currents it sinks it doesn't try to

594
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:35,700
currents it sinks it doesn't try to
 

595
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,270
currents it sinks it doesn't try to
float and even if we just like gradually

596
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:38,280
float and even if we just like gradually
 

597
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,640
float and even if we just like gradually
very slightly toss it in the water like

598
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:40,650
very slightly toss it in the water like
 

599
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:45,830
very slightly toss it in the water like
that it'll go down always right but if

600
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:45,840
that it'll go down always right but if
 

601
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,900
that it'll go down always right but if
we slide it in like this then it'll

602
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:47,910
we slide it in like this then it'll
 

603
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,990
we slide it in like this then it'll
float so just that little that little

604
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,000
float so just that little that little
 

605
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,480
float so just that little that little
oomph of entering the water is enough to

606
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:53,490
oomph of entering the water is enough to
 

607
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:58,060
oomph of entering the water is enough to
drag it under one source block here aha

608
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,070
drag it under one source block here aha
 

609
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,560
drag it under one source block here aha
anyways I want I want underwater

610
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:00,570
anyways I want I want underwater
 

611
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,710
anyways I want I want underwater
minecarts guys I don't know if we're

612
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:03,720
minecarts guys I don't know if we're
 

613
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,690
minecarts guys I don't know if we're
gonna get them I'm trying with ice now

614
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:05,700
gonna get them I'm trying with ice now
 

615
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,150
gonna get them I'm trying with ice now
just to see if we can choose the effect

616
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
just to see if we can choose the effect
 

617
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,600
just to see if we can choose the effect
right of course this is really cool too

618
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:11,610
right of course this is really cool too
 

619
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,820
right of course this is really cool too
we can sprint underwater and if we do we

620
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:13,830
we can sprint underwater and if we do we
 

621
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:19,100
we can sprint underwater and if we do we
start swimming alright I look pretty

622
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,110
start swimming alright I look pretty
 

623
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,780
start swimming alright I look pretty
cool zoom oh here's oh you can't catch

624
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:23,790
cool zoom oh here's oh you can't catch
 

625
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,450
cool zoom oh here's oh you can't catch
me I'm too fast

626
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:25,460
me I'm too fast
 

627
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,970
me I'm too fast
uh-huh anyways I'm using a shovel

628
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:30,980
uh-huh anyways I'm using a shovel
 

629
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,620
uh-huh anyways I'm using a shovel
knock-back works underwater too that's

630
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:33,630
knock-back works underwater too that's
 

631
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,990
knock-back works underwater too that's
that's cool so we didn't swim into like

632
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
that's cool so we didn't swim into like
 

633
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,760
that's cool so we didn't swim into like
one one called spaces here like we do

634
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:37,770
one one called spaces here like we do
 

635
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,150
one one called spaces here like we do
with the lighter wings right can we do

636
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,160

spaces anymore and then one once we're

648
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:00,780
spaces anymore and then one once we're
 

649
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,310
spaces anymore and then one once we're
in that one tall space we stay in it

650
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:03,320
in that one tall space we stay in it
 

651
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,450
in that one tall space we stay in it
uh-huh so what I want to try this block

652

then if I remove this yeah they do burn

702
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:54,600
then if I remove this yeah they do burn
 

703
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,329
then if I remove this yeah they do burn
in the they do burn in daylight and they

704
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:56,339
in the they do burn in daylight and they
 

705
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:01,040
in the they do burn in daylight and they
go right for the water huh so even if

706
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,050
go right for the water huh so even if
 

707
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,269
go right for the water huh so even if
he's in the shade

708
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:02,279
he's in the shade
 

709
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,980
he's in the shade
he'll prioritize going to the water

710
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:03,990
he'll prioritize going to the water
 

711
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:09,260
he'll prioritize going to the water
first even if he burns oh yeah so it's a

712
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,270
first even if he burns oh yeah so it's a
 

713
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,900
first even if he burns oh yeah so it's a
little bit strange to get it set up but

714
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:11,910
little bit strange to get it set up but
 

715
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,150
little bit strange to get it set up but
I did get it working here so we got

716
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
I did get it working here so we got
 

717
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,179
I did get it working here so we got
waterlogged trapdoors above us you see

718
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:17,189
waterlogged trapdoors above us you see
 

719
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:19,790
waterlogged trapdoors above us you see
they're dripping down and stuff for the

720
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:19,800
they're dripping down and stuff for the
 

721
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,669
they're dripping down and stuff for the
very first time in survival minecraft we

722
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:22,679
very first time in survival minecraft we
 

723
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,809
very first time in survival minecraft we
can have kind of underwater rails where

724
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:26,819
can have kind of underwater rails where
 

725
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:30,260
can have kind of underwater rails where
our heads actually in the water so this

726
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,270
our heads actually in the water so this
 

727
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,350
our heads actually in the water so this
is the view it's a little close to the

728
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
is the view it's a little close to the
 

729
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,970
is the view it's a little close to the
ground it would be nice if we were up a

730
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:34,980
ground it would be nice if we were up a
 

731
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,340
ground it would be nice if we were up a
block higher yes yes but this is as good

732
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:37,350
block higher yes yes but this is as good
 

733
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,820
block higher yes yes but this is as good
as we're gonna get it I think

734
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:39,830
as we're gonna get it I think
 

735
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,390
as we're gonna get it I think
uh-huh it's kind of cool right think I

736
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
uh-huh it's kind of cool right think I
 

737
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,620
uh-huh it's kind of cool right think I
might I might use it the base still

738
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:47,630
might I might use it the base still
 

739
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,930
might I might use it the base still
uh-huh so let's go let's go over here

740
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:50,940
uh-huh so let's go let's go over here
 

741
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,720
uh-huh so let's go let's go over here
and try some things out so trapdoors

742
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:53,730
and try some things out so trapdoors
 

743
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,040
and try some things out so trapdoors
they have a special ability I believe

744
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,050
they have a special ability I believe
 

745
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:02,090
they have a special ability I believe
where the water will flow down when it's

746
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:02,100
where the water will flow down when it's
 

747
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,730
where the water will flow down when it's
open and then it stops when it's closed

748
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:04,740
open and then it stops when it's closed
 

749
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,240
open and then it stops when it's closed
right I tried some stuff with sponges

750
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,250
right I tried some stuff with sponges
 

751
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,760
right I tried some stuff with sponges
too just to see if we could like break

752
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:10,770
too just to see if we could like break
 

753
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,560
too just to see if we could like break
the system or something so if we place a

754
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:12,570
the system or something so if we place a
 

755
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,130
the system or something so if we place a
sponge here it doesn't quite reach all

756
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:16,140
sponge here it doesn't quite reach all
 

757
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,630
sponge here it doesn't quite reach all
the way to the top if we place it one

758
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:17,640
the way to the top if we place it one
 

759
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,150
the way to the top if we place it one
block higher and it absorbs the whole

760
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
block higher and it absorbs the whole
 

761
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,460
block higher and it absorbs the whole
thing so sponges will pull the water out

762
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:22,470
thing so sponges will pull the water out
 

763
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,110
thing so sponges will pull the water out
of waterlogged blocks too so we get

764
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
of waterlogged blocks too so we get
 

765
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,330
of waterlogged blocks too so we get
ourselves a trap door with water in it

766
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:29,340
ourselves a trap door with water in it
 

767
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,430
ourselves a trap door with water in it
right then we put the lily pad on top

768
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
right then we put the lily pad on top
 

769
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,250
right then we put the lily pad on top
and a piece of sand on top of that and

770
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,260
and a piece of sand on top of that and
 

771
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,040
and a piece of sand on top of that and
we're gonna absorb the water with a

772
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,050
we're gonna absorb the water with a
 

773
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,110
we're gonna absorb the water with a
sponge what's gonna happen to a lily pad

774
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
sponge what's gonna happen to a lily pad
 

775
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,450
sponge what's gonna happen to a lily pad
what's gonna happen to the sand you guys

776
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:41,460
what's gonna happen to the sand you guys
 

777
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:50,180
what's gonna happen to the sand you guys
know here we go huh so lily pad pops off

778
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,190
know here we go huh so lily pad pops off
 

779
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,770

796
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:21,259
what a bully man he pushed me into the
 

797
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:22,049
what a bully man he pushed me into the
water

798
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:22,059
water
 

799
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:25,090
water
uh-huh so I think guys for the next

800
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:25,100
uh-huh so I think guys for the next
 

801
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,430
uh-huh so I think guys for the next
episode the plan is we're gonna go look

802
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,440
episode the plan is we're gonna go look
 

803
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,289
episode the plan is we're gonna go look
for the new ocean biomes and try figure

804
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:29,299
for the new ocean biomes and try figure
 

805
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:30,340
for the new ocean biomes and try figure
out where we're gonna set up our base

806
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,350
out where we're gonna set up our base
 

807
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,629
out where we're gonna set up our base
right and look for the the nice corals

808
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:34,639
right and look for the the nice corals
 

809
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:37,060
right and look for the the nice corals
and the nice water right now we're in

810
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,070
and the nice water right now we're in
 

811
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,749
and the nice water right now we're in
the swamp here I'll tell you kind of my

812
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:40,759
the swamp here I'll tell you kind of my
 

813
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:43,240
the swamp here I'll tell you kind of my
rough idea for the base though like what

814
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,250
rough idea for the base though like what
 

815
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,310
rough idea for the base though like what
I plan on doing so I don't want to just

816
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:45,320
I plan on doing so I don't want to just
 

817
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,669
I plan on doing so I don't want to just
build a room underwater what I actually

818
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:48,679
build a room underwater what I actually
 

819
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:50,799
build a room underwater what I actually
want to do is live under the water right

820
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:50,809
want to do is live under the water right
 

821
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:54,460
want to do is live under the water right
so and we'll probably have some some

822
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:54,470
so and we'll probably have some some
 

823
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,519
so and we'll probably have some some
rooms underwater with airs air spaces in

824
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:57,529
rooms underwater with airs air spaces in
 

825
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,659
rooms underwater with airs air spaces in
and that kind of stuff too because we

826
00:19:58,659 --> 00:19:58,669
and that kind of stuff too because we
 

827
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:00,730
and that kind of stuff too because we
can't grow like wheat under water for

828
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:00,740
can't grow like wheat under water for
 

829
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,860
can't grow like wheat under water for
example we'll need to build rooms for

830
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:02,870
example we'll need to build rooms for
 

831
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,499
example we'll need to build rooms for
certain things but as much as possible

832
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:05,509
certain things but as much as possible
 

833
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:08,230
certain things but as much as possible
we're gonna try actually live where

834
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
we're gonna try actually live where
 

835
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,159
we're gonna try actually live where
we're drowning right so of course we got

836
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,169
we're drowning right so of course we got
 

837
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,779
we're drowning right so of course we got
to contend with the the air bubble

838
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:13,789
to contend with the the air bubble
 

839
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:15,820
to contend with the the air bubble
situation I'm sure there's lots of ways

840
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:15,830
situation I'm sure there's lots of ways
 

841
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,659
situation I'm sure there's lots of ways
around that though I think sugarcane is

842
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:19,669
around that though I think sugarcane is
 

843
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:21,759
around that though I think sugarcane is
not water luggable right now so you can

844
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:21,769
not water luggable right now so you can
 

845
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:26,499
not water luggable right now so you can
still do this trick right I think also I

846
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:26,509
still do this trick right I think also I
 

847
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:28,240
still do this trick right I think also I
would like to play with the air bubble

848
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,250
would like to play with the air bubble
 

849
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,389
would like to play with the air bubble
stuff a bit too today if we have time

850
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:30,399
stuff a bit too today if we have time
 

851
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:32,980
stuff a bit too today if we have time
we're running a little bit long time but

852
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:32,990
we're running a little bit long time but
 

853
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,639
we're running a little bit long time but
I think these refill your air bubbles -

854
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:36,649
I think these refill your air bubbles -
 

855
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:40,629
I think these refill your air bubbles -
all right yeah they do they do okay so

856
00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:40,639
all right yeah they do they do okay so
 

857
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,930
all right yeah they do they do okay so
you could have they're really cool too

858
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:43,940
you could have they're really cool too
 

859
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,159
you could have they're really cool too
by the way I think this is the coolest

860
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:45,169
by the way I think this is the coolest
 

861
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:48,279
by the way I think this is the coolest
thing added in the patch because

862
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:48,289
thing added in the patch because
 

863
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,320
thing added in the patch because
obviously you make elevators and all

864
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,330
obviously you make elevators and all
 

865
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,080
obviously you make elevators and all
kinds of cool stuff with them you can

866
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,090
kinds of cool stuff with them you can
 

867
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,669
kinds of cool stuff with them you can
have stations like this where you refill

868
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:54,679
have stations like this where you refill
 

869
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:59,470
have stations like this where you refill
- all right that works out or we could

870
00:20:59,470 --> 00:20:59,480
- all right that works out or we could
 

871
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,909
- all right that works out or we could
just have a downward current probably

872
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:00,919
just have a downward current probably
 

873
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:07,570
just have a downward current probably
right I guess it hurts you know uh-huh

874
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:07,580
right I guess it hurts you know uh-huh
 

875
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,810
right I guess it hurts you know uh-huh
so soul sand makes you go up and the

876
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:10,820
so soul sand makes you go up and the
 

877
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,029
so soul sand makes you go up and the
magma makes you go down this way this

878
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
magma makes you go down this way this
 

879
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,890
magma makes you go down this way this
work is so cool

880
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:18,900
work is so cool
 

881
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,150
work is so cool
and it shoots see with a lot of force

882
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:21,160
and it shoots see with a lot of force
 

883
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,060
and it shoots see with a lot of force
like you actually hop out of the water

884
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,070
like you actually hop out of the water
 

885
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,180
like you actually hop out of the water
when it when it shoots you out so like

886
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,190
when it when it shoots you out so like
 

887
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,890
when it when it shoots you out so like
if we're gonna live underwater we're

888
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:31,900
if we're gonna live underwater we're
 

889
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,930
if we're gonna live underwater we're
gonna try to adapt to living underwater

890
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:33,940
gonna try to adapt to living underwater
 

891
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,450
gonna try to adapt to living underwater
as much as possible right and that

892
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:36,460
as much as possible right and that
 

893
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,710
as much as possible right and that
includes things like our animal farms if

894
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
includes things like our animal farms if
 

895
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,300
includes things like our animal farms if
we're living underwater the sheep have

896
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,310
we're living underwater the sheep have
 

897
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,760
we're living underwater the sheep have
to live underwater - all right so I want

898
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,770
to live underwater - all right so I want
 

899
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:51,690
to live underwater - all right so I want
to try something here I'm gonna drown

900
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:51,700
to try something here I'm gonna drown
 

901
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,160
to try something here I'm gonna drown
this guy but I want to try to keep him

902
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,170
this guy but I want to try to keep him
 

903
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:58,560
this guy but I want to try to keep him
alive so I think oh there's a dolphin

904
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:58,570
alive so I think oh there's a dolphin
 

905
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,790
alive so I think oh there's a dolphin
here I think if we do something like

906
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:02,800
here I think if we do something like
 

907
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,920
here I think if we do something like
this hopefully he gets air from the

908
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:04,930
this hopefully he gets air from the
 

909
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:12,050
this hopefully he gets air from the
bubble stream oh maybe not I don't know

910
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:12,060

 

911
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,790

well let's attach a fence to this is

912
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:14,800
well let's attach a fence to this is
 

913
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,850
well let's attach a fence to this is
that gonna kill the bubble screen but

914
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:17,860
that gonna kill the bubble screen but
 

915
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,680
that gonna kill the bubble screen but
let's make sure you get some air before

916
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:19,690
let's make sure you get some air before
 

917
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,160
let's make sure you get some air before
we chill I kind of want to like hold the

918
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,170
we chill I kind of want to like hold the
 

919
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:29,760
we chill I kind of want to like hold the
guys down maybe like that and try try to

920
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:29,770
guys down maybe like that and try try to
 

921
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,900
guys down maybe like that and try try to
give them air but it's probably

922
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:33,910
give them air but it's probably
 

923
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,180
give them air but it's probably
something I'm enough to play around with

924
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,190
something I'm enough to play around with
 

925
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,410
something I'm enough to play around with
let's see how long he'll stay like that

926
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:37,420
let's see how long he'll stay like that
 

927
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,360
let's see how long he'll stay like that
without dying and maybe we have like

928
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,370
without dying and maybe we have like
 

929
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,490
without dying and maybe we have like
like redstone controls for turning the

930
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:44,500
like redstone controls for turning the
 

931
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,140
like redstone controls for turning the
air on and off every so often so they

932
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,150
air on and off every so often so they
 

933
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:51,390
air on and off every so often so they
don't drown but I'm not sure I think

934
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:51,400
don't drown but I'm not sure I think
 

935
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,460
don't drown but I'm not sure I think
Leeds might still break off right like

936
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:53,470
Leeds might still break off right like
 

937
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,870
Leeds might still break off right like
when you leave the chunks he seems okay

938
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:57,880
when you leave the chunks he seems okay
 

939
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,800
when you leave the chunks he seems okay
though like that this might work I think

940
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:01,810
though like that this might work I think
 

941
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,780
though like that this might work I think
you should be dead by now if you didn't

942
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:03,790
you should be dead by now if you didn't
 

943
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,460
you should be dead by now if you didn't
have the bubble streams I don't know

944
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:08,470
have the bubble streams I don't know
 

945
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,450
have the bubble streams I don't know
what we're gonna have to play around

946
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:09,460
what we're gonna have to play around
 

947
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,740
what we're gonna have to play around
with it I think it could be a lot of fun

948
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:10,750
with it I think it could be a lot of fun
 

949
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,060
with it I think it could be a lot of fun
though yeah he's hanging in there I

950
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,070
though yeah he's hanging in there I
 

951
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,900
though yeah he's hanging in there I
think it's good it's a good idea so

952
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:18,910
