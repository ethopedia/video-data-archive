00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,330

 

319
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,079

323
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,260

this is about the limit I would say

324
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:20,270
this is about the limit I would say
 

325
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,519
this is about the limit I would say
let's not go over this 800 it's pretty

326
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:25,529
let's not go over this 800 it's pretty
 

327
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,670
let's not go over this 800 it's pretty
tolerable if I'm looking away I did 30

329
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,710
tolerable if I'm looking away I did 30
frames per second if I look at them it's

330
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
frames per second if I look at them it's
 

331
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,930
frames per second if I look at them it's
more like 8 just too bad as long as I'm

your your like control panel for the

794

your your like control panel for the
 

795
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,040
your your like control panel for the
graphics card so that allows you to

796
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,050
graphics card so that allows you to
 

797
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,810
graphics card so that allows you to
overclock the GPU and change a fan speed

798
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:17,820
overclock the GPU and change a fan speed
 

799
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,340
overclock the GPU and change a fan speed
through that and set up all these cool

not even that the Nvidia stuff something

not even that the Nvidia stuff something

with the higher priority was overriding

810
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:35,100
with the higher priority was overriding
 

811
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,930
with the higher priority was overriding
the fan speed to 100% so that is not the

812
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:38,940
the fan speed to 100% so that is not the
 

813
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:46,520
the fan speed to 100% so that is not the
solution to my problem yeah so it's been

814
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:46,530
solution to my problem yeah so it's been
 

815
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,500
solution to my problem yeah so it's been
very frustrating but at least I didn't

816
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:48,510
very frustrating but at least I didn't
 

817
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,600
very frustrating but at least I didn't
use it now so I'm happy about that and

818
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:52,610
use it now so I'm happy about that and
 

819
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,830
use it now so I'm happy about that and
let's see what else

820
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:54,840
let's see what else
 

821
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,340
let's see what else
so minecraft specifically let's talk

822
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:58,350
so minecraft specifically let's talk
 

823
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,890
so minecraft specifically let's talk
about that the man cave my old computer

824
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:00,900
about that the man cave my old computer
 

825
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,110
about that the man cave my old computer
I would get about 40 50 frames per

826
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
I would get about 40 50 frames per
 

827
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,880
I would get about 40 50 frames per
second in here when I wasn't recording I

828
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:04,890
second in here when I wasn't recording I
 

829
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,830
second in here when I wasn't recording I
locked my framerate by the way that's

830
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:06,840
locked my framerate by the way that's
 

831
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,910
locked my framerate by the way that's
why you always see where is it in f3 30

832
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:10,920
why you always see where is it in f3 30
 

833
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,730
why you always see where is it in f3 30
frame fps up here it always says 30fps

834
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:13,740
frame fps up here it always says 30fps
 

835
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,190
frame fps up here it always says 30fps
cuz I locked my frame right at 30 when

836
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,200
cuz I locked my frame right at 30 when
 

837
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,160
cuz I locked my frame right at 30 when
I'm recording it just makes video

838
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,170
I'm recording it just makes video
 

839
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,930
I'm recording it just makes video
editing a lot easier but when I'm not

840
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:23,940
editing a lot easier but when I'm not
 

841
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,850
editing a lot easier but when I'm not
recording in the man cave here I did

842
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:25,860
recording in the man cave here I did
 

843
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,960
recording in the man cave here I did
like I can get up to like 220 frames per

844
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:29,970
like I can get up to like 220 frames per
 

845
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,570
like I can get up to like 220 frames per
second now which is just awesome

846
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:32,580
second now which is just awesome
 

847
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:38,150
second now which is just awesome
I can also now I can go up to 16 chunks

848
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:38,160
I can also now I can go up to 16 chunks
 

849

what this does here's a good example
 

865
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,260
what this does here's a good example
that actually you see the the lines in

00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,590
the stone brick as you look off into the

turn on anise tropic I'm probably saying

876
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,370
turn on anise tropic I'm probably saying

that wrong anise tropic filtering it

that wrong anise tropic filtering it
 

879
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,140
that wrong anise tropic filtering it
renders the stuff in the distance a lot

renders the stuff in the distance a lot
 

881
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,940
renders the stuff in the distance a lot
better now we have these nice crisp

882
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:25,950
better now we have these nice crisp
 

883
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,000
better now we have these nice crisp
lines even as we look far off into the

884
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,010
lines even as we look far off into the
 

885
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,250
lines even as we look far off into the
distance it it still keeps that that

00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:31,260
distance it it still keeps that that
 

887
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,470
distance it it still keeps that that
look so it's much better and tried

888
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
look so it's much better and tried
 

889
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,420
look so it's much better and tried
flying around in an amplified world for

890
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:38,430
flying around in an amplified world for
 

891
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,080
flying around in an amplified world for
bits at sixteen chunks like with this at

892
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,090
bits at sixteen chunks like with this at
 

893
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,570
bits at sixteen chunks like with this at
sixteen chunks and I was able to get

894
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:44,580
sixteen chunks and I was able to get
 

895
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,550
sixteen chunks and I was able to get
like 120 frames per second while flying

896
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:46,560
like 120 frames per second while flying
 

897
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,830
like 120 frames per second while flying
around in an amplified world which is

898
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
around in an amplified world which is
 

899
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,500
around in an amplified world which is
really promising especially now that we

900
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:51,510
really promising especially now that we
 

901
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:57,170
really promising especially now that we
have areas in an amplified world's yeah

902
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:57,180
have areas in an amplified world's yeah
 

903
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,760
have areas in an amplified world's yeah
but unfortunately guys I think I'm gonna
