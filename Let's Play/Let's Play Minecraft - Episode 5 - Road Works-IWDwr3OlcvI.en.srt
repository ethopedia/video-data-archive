you can put water in here to kill them
 

35
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:16,969
you can put water in here to kill them
too I'm not sure if it actually works he

36
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:16,979
too I'm not sure if it actually works he

00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:31,729

 

41
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:34,640

so I guess it does work but laughs it

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:34,650
so I guess it does work but laughs it
 

43
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,790

so this episode I think we're going to

46
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:42,300
so this episode I think we're going to
 

47
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,410
so this episode I think we're going to
be working on the road again and the

48
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:45,420
be working on the road again and the
 

49
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,550
be working on the road again and the
dispenser and everything first say I'm

50
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:49,560
dispenser and everything first say I'm
 

51
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,710
dispenser and everything first say I'm
going to do I am going to move this ez

52
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:51,720
going to do I am going to move this ez
 

53
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,530
going to do I am going to move this ez
loader as now when we work down the road

54
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:57,540
loader as now when we work down the road
 

55
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,130
loader as now when we work down the road
there I'm going to put the ez loader

56
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,140
there I'm going to put the ez loader
 

57
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:19,280
there I'm going to put the ez loader
over here that way I can work on the

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,290
over here that way I can work on the
 

59
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:31,960
over here that way I can work on the
return area here so it's the gold here

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:31,970

 

61
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:40,430

some water down and the sign how you

62
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:40,440
some water down and the sign how you
 

63
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,320
some water down and the sign how you
need to use a sign you can't use a

64
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,330
need to use a sign you can't use a
 

65
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,000
need to use a sign you can't use a
ladder for this because signs have no

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,010
ladder for this because signs have no
 

67
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,900
ladder for this because signs have no
collision mask while ladders do if you

68
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:50,910
collision mask while ladders do if you
 

69
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,490
collision mask while ladders do if you
use a ladder the boats going to run into

70
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:52,500
use a ladder the boats going to run into
 

71
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:08,050
use a ladder the boats going to run into
it and then stop this up again

72
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:08,060

 

73
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:22,449

okay all right

74
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:22,459
okay all right
 

75
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:25,100
okay all right
so this ez loader will still work here

76
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,110
so this ez loader will still work here
 

77
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,610
so this ez loader will still work here
because you don't make the bull the boat

78
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:28,620
because you don't make the bull the boat
 

79
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,900
because you don't make the bull the boat
to hit this wall here which is what we

80
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:32,910
to hit this wall here which is what we
 

81
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,570
to hit this wall here which is what we
need we need the boat snug against this

82
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:35,580
need we need the boat snug against this
 

83
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,680
need we need the boat snug against this
wall so that when it enters elevator

84
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:39,690
wall so that when it enters elevator
 

85
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:50,170
wall so that when it enters elevator
here it's gonna hit this wall here and

86
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:50,180
here it's gonna hit this wall here and
 

87
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,280
here it's gonna hit this wall here and
that's going to be snug against this

88
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,290
that's going to be snug against this
 

89
00:03:52,290 --> 00:04:00,860
that's going to be snug against this
wall which is important this area here

90
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:00,870
wall which is important this area here
 

91
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,630
wall which is important this area here
has a problem still I'm gonna have to

92
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
has a problem still I'm gonna have to
 

93
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,410
has a problem still I'm gonna have to
probably change it

94
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:08,420

 

95
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,710

so in my road system the boat is always

96
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:11,720
so in my road system the boat is always
 

97
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:18,290
so in my road system the boat is always
snug against the right side and same for

98
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:18,300
snug against the right side and same for
 

99
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:24,710
snug against the right side and same for
on the other Lane which means doors need

100
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
on the other Lane which means doors need
 

101
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,510
on the other Lane which means doors need
to be placed on the left side like that

102
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:26,520
to be placed on the left side like that
 

103
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,480
to be placed on the left side like that
the hinge here needs to be on the left

104
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:28,490
the hinge here needs to be on the left
 

105
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,540
the hinge here needs to be on the left
so that boats and still pass through if

106
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:32,550
so that boats and still pass through if
 

107
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:43,970
so that boats and still pass through if
this door was over like that the boat

108
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:43,980
this door was over like that the boat
 

109
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,080
this door was over like that the boat
would run into it and then stop

110
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,090
would run into it and then stop
 

111
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:53,900
would run into it and then stop
there's the door hinge is over here with

112
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:53,910
there's the door hinge is over here with
 

113
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,610
there's the door hinge is over here with
the doors you don't need to place them

114
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:55,620
the doors you don't need to place them
 

115
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,340
the doors you don't need to place them
too high if you don't want I kind of

116
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:58,350

pressure plate here so by two by default
 

155
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:56,230
pressure plate here so by two by default
we're going to have this door open then

156

when a boat comes down here it's going

158
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,310
when a boat comes down here it's going
 

159
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,040
when a boat comes down here it's going
to hit this pressure plate and this is

160
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,050
to hit this pressure plate and this is
 

161
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,980
to hit this pressure plate and this is
quickly going to close and stop the boat

162
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:02,990
quickly going to close and stop the boat
 

163
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,950
quickly going to close and stop the boat
and then the player is going to get off

164
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
and then the player is going to get off
 

165
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,850
and then the player is going to get off
the boat either here or I'll make a

166
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:12,860
the boat either here or I'll make a
 

167
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,620
the boat either here or I'll make a
doorway here and when they get off the

168
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:17,630
doorway here and when they get off the
 

169
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,930
doorway here and when they get off the
boat they'll open and they'll go down

170
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:19,940
boat they'll open and they'll go down
 

171
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:28,029
boat they'll open and they'll go down
here and back into the dispenser and I'm

172
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:28,039
here and back into the dispenser and I'm
 

173
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,399
here and back into the dispenser and I'm
going to add another door I think over

174
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:33,409
going to add another door I think over
 

175
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:41,200
going to add another door I think over
here so those pressure plates going to

176
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,210
here so those pressure plates going to
 

177
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,260
here so those pressure plates going to
close open and close both doors it's

178
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,270
close open and close both doors it's
 

179
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,670
close open and close both doors it's
going to be hooked up to both of them so

180
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:48,680
going to be hooked up to both of them so
 

181
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,860
going to be hooked up to both of them so
if a guy is waiting here another guy can

182
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:50,870
if a guy is waiting here another guy can
 

183
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,620
if a guy is waiting here another guy can
come down the system and safely wait

184
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:53,630
come down the system and safely wait
 

185
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,240
come down the system and safely wait
here with the crashing into the other

186
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,250
here with the crashing into the other
 

187
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:04,820
here with the crashing into the other
boat until he gets out hopefully

188
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:04,830

 

189
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:21,230

I'm gonna lower this to so if you're

190
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,240
I'm gonna lower this to so if you're
 

191
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,680
I'm gonna lower this to so if you're
having that problem you'll have to

192
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:23,690
having that problem you'll have to
 

193
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,409
having that problem you'll have to
destroy this block but there's nothing

194
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:27,419
destroy this block but there's nothing
 

195
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:31,240
destroy this block but there's nothing
next to the left side of the door and

196
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,250
next to the left side of the door and
 

197
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,360
next to the left side of the door and
then replace the block with something

198
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,370
then replace the block with something
 

199
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:55,970
then replace the block with something
else that and I think there's going to

200
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:55,980
else that and I think there's going to
 

201
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:03,500
else that and I think there's going to
be a water stream here I'm gonna have to

202
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:03,510
be a water stream here I'm gonna have to
 

203
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:17,240
be a water stream here I'm gonna have to
play around with this a bit I'm going to

204
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,250
play around with this a bit I'm going to
 

205
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,650
play around with this a bit I'm going to
replace this with a normal block oh wait

206
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:21,660
replace this with a normal block oh wait
 

207
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,160
replace this with a normal block oh wait
no I can't

208
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,170
no I can't
 

209
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:32,110
no I can't
hmm

210
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,120

 

211
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,290

all right well it's only that for a

212
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:36,300
all right well it's only that for a
 

213
00:09:36,300 --> 00:10:06,740
all right well it's only that for a
moment so how to do this um I'm gonna

214
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:06,750
moment so how to do this um I'm gonna
 

215
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,390
moment so how to do this um I'm gonna
play around with this a bit off-camera

216
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:08,400
play around with this a bit off-camera
 

217
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:15,490
play around with this a bit off-camera
and then I'll show you what I figure out

218
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:15,500

 

219
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,470

so I ended up moving this ez loader one

220
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
so I ended up moving this ez loader one
 

221
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,830
so I ended up moving this ez loader one
block up and the only reason I have this

222
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:21,840
block up and the only reason I have this
 

223
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,230
block up and the only reason I have this
in my system right now is to make

224
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
in my system right now is to make
 

225
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,470
in my system right now is to make
testing easier I'll be getting rid of it

226
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:27,480
testing easier I'll be getting rid of it
 

227
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,300
testing easier I'll be getting rid of it
eventually

228
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,310

 

229
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,420

so this return system I'm going to try

230
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:35,430
so this return system I'm going to try
 

231
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,690
so this return system I'm going to try
make it eight blocks long which is one

232
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:38,700
make it eight blocks long which is one
 

233
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,510
make it eight blocks long which is one
two three four five six seven eight and

234
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:43,520
two three four five six seven eight and
 

235
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,829
two three four five six seven eight and
then the road section is going to start

236
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
then the road section is going to start
 

237
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:55,750
then the road section is going to start
here and I'll place a stream here and

238
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760

 

239
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:05,520

don't make a sign

240
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:05,530

 

241
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:10,010

it's more water and we're gonna place

242
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,020
it's more water and we're gonna place
 

243
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,300
it's more water and we're gonna place
this street here

244
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,310

 

245
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:37,650

other side take another side there all

246
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:37,660
other side take another side there all
 

247
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:47,610
other side take another side there all
right I'm hoping that will work I am

248
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:47,620
right I'm hoping that will work I am
 

249
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,990
right I'm hoping that will work I am
going to put some ladders and then I'm

250
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
going to put some ladders and then I'm
 

251
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
going to put some ladders and then I'm
going to test this out not quite sure

252
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,010
going to test this out not quite sure
 

253
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:06,900
going to test this out not quite sure
where we'll still put them but we'll try

254
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:06,910
where we'll still put them but we'll try
 

255
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:13,860
where we'll still put them but we'll try
that for now and we're going to make

256
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:13,870
that for now and we're going to make
 

257
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:19,920
that for now and we're going to make
some more pressure plates

258
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:19,930

 

259
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,000

I'm going to be using pressure plates

260
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,010
I'm going to be using pressure plates
 

261
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,220
I'm going to be using pressure plates
instead of signs just for convenience

262
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,230
instead of signs just for convenience
 

263
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:38,620
instead of signs just for convenience
but you can use whatever you want and we

264
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:38,630
but you can use whatever you want and we
 

265
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:44,500
but you can use whatever you want and we
make our road sections the water three

266
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:44,510
make our road sections the water three
 

267
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,490
make our road sections the water three
blocks long if you want a better example

268
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:48,500
blocks long if you want a better example
 

269
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,880
blocks long if you want a better example
of how to build these roads check out

270
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:51,890
of how to build these roads check out
 

271
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,900
of how to build these roads check out
this link here and we'll show it

272
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:55,910
this link here and we'll show it
 

273
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:01,960
this link here and we'll show it
tutorial of it and then do one more

274
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:01,970
tutorial of it and then do one more
 

275
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:16,390
tutorial of it and then do one more
section and then I am going to build an

276
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:16,400
section and then I am going to build an
 

277
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:35,260
section and then I am going to build an
easy loader for testing yep and what I

278
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,270
easy loader for testing yep and what I
 

279
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,450
easy loader for testing yep and what I
want to see mainly is that the pressure

280
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:37,460
want to see mainly is that the pressure
 

281
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,300
want to see mainly is that the pressure
plate gets pressed when I'm on the boat

282
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,310
plate gets pressed when I'm on the boat
 

283
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:54,439
plate gets pressed when I'm on the boat
as if it doesn't I gotta redo this off

284
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:54,449

 

285
00:13:54,449 --> 00:14:02,220

need some glass make a boat I'll

286
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,230
need some glass make a boat I'll
 

287
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:13,489
need some glass make a boat I'll
probably have to need some more wood

288
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:13,499

 

289
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:16,650

and we here see sandwich this ez loader

290
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:16,660
and we here see sandwich this ez loader
 

291
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:26,119
and we here see sandwich this ez loader
down that should work

292
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:26,129

 

293
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:28,109

I'm going to place the boat in the

294
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:28,119
I'm going to place the boat in the
 

295
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:30,079
I'm going to place the boat in the
middle

296
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:30,089
middle
 

297
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:34,939
middle
hop on we're going to open this door

298
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:34,949
hop on we're going to open this door
 

299
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:49,829
hop on we're going to open this door
and I wanna see if this gets pressed yep

300
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
and I wanna see if this gets pressed yep
 

301
00:14:49,839 --> 00:15:01,819
and I wanna see if this gets pressed yep
that's just perfect so this will work so

302
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:01,829
that's just perfect so this will work so
 

303
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:05,639
that's just perfect so this will work so
now that we know that we know we can

304
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:05,649
now that we know that we know we can
 

305
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:11,489
now that we know that we know we can
start the boat here and keep things

306
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:11,499
start the boat here and keep things
 

307
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:24,809
start the boat here and keep things
consistent place that there oh well

308
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:24,819
consistent place that there oh well
 

309
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:27,060
consistent place that there oh well
that's wrong

310
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,070
that's wrong
 

311
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:47,740
that's wrong
wanting it's the other way I think that

312
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:47,750
wanting it's the other way I think that
 

313
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:53,880
wanting it's the other way I think that
will work

314
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:53,890

 

315
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:59,020

the ladders should go now we'll probably

316
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,030
the ladders should go now we'll probably
 

317
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:31,930
the ladders should go now we'll probably
start interesting please okay so I think

318
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:31,940
start interesting please okay so I think
 

319
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:50,270
start interesting please okay so I think
we got this working pretty good now

320
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:50,280

 

321
00:16:50,280 --> 00:17:03,170

yep that looks good

322
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:03,180

 

323
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:11,819

beautiful so I think I'm going to work

324
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:11,829
beautiful so I think I'm going to work
 

325
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,189
beautiful so I think I'm going to work
on extending this I'll see you back in a

326

on extending this I'll see you back in a
bit okay we're back as you can see I

check out my other eats tutorials on how

336
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:36,730
check out my other eats tutorials on how
 

337
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,430
check out my other eats tutorials on how
to build these road sections if you need

338
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:38,440
to build these road sections if you need
 

339
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,780
to build these road sections if you need
to know and I just put a bend in the end

340
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:42,790
to know and I just put a bend in the end
 

341
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,270
to know and I just put a bend in the end
here because we're just going to be

342
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
here because we're just going to be
 

343
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,350
here because we're just going to be
testing this and later I'll get rid of

344
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,360
testing this and later I'll get rid of
 

345
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,300
testing this and later I'll get rid of
that and make it go all the way to the

346
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,310
that and make it go all the way to the
 

347
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:56,520
that and make it go all the way to the
island so we're just going to finish up

348
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:56,530
island so we're just going to finish up
 

349
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,240
island so we're just going to finish up
the last few touches here and then we're

350
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,250
the last few touches here and then we're
 

351
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,600
the last few touches here and then we're
going to take it for a test drive

352
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:03,610

 

353
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:10,080

I haven't tested it yet so you'll see

354
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,090
I haven't tested it yet so you'll see
 

355
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:21,140
I haven't tested it yet so you'll see
with me if it works or not

356
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,150

 

357
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:30,049

okay so we're gonna make a few boats I

358
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:30,059

 

359
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:37,880

go through a lot of wood making boats

360
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:37,890

 

361
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,260

okay now we're going to put them in the

362
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:40,270
okay now we're going to put them in the
 

363
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:46,480
okay now we're going to put them in the
easy loader

364
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:46,490

 

365
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:51,670

it works good

366
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:51,680

 

367
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:59,610

comes up in the corner there door open I

368
00:18:59,610 --> 00:18:59,620

 

369
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:10,160

hope that Ben works yeah it did it

370
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,170

 

371
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,720

and then the player would get off the

372
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:12,730
and then the player would get off the
 

373
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,960
and then the player would get off the
boats throw it open

374
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:14,970
boats throw it open
 

375
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:32,290
boats throw it open
let's back down and all is good again

376
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:32,300

 

377
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,880

we're gonna close this and we're gonna

378
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:34,890
we're gonna close this and we're gonna
 

379
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:40,310
we're gonna close this and we're gonna
go for a first test drive you ready here

380
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
go for a first test drive you ready here
 

381
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:47,540
go for a first test drive you ready here
we go oh yeah I won't be doing that the

382
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:47,550
we go oh yeah I won't be doing that the
 

383
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,360
we go oh yeah I won't be doing that the
Redstone yet I'll do it later when I get

384
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:50,370
Redstone yet I'll do it later when I get
 

385
00:19:50,370 --> 00:20:16,150
Redstone yet I'll do it later when I get
some other boats following us awesome

386
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,160

 

387
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,320

so that's how it would work player would

388
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,330
so that's how it would work player would
 

389
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:26,120
so that's how it would work player would
get off both doors would open and then

390
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,130
get off both doors would open and then
 

391
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,260
get off both doors would open and then
close again if there's a player on it

392
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:29,270
close again if there's a player on it
 

393
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,610
close again if there's a player on it
they get it the next player would get

394
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:31,620
they get it the next player would get
 

395
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:37,070
they get it the next player would get
off it open and around and round she

396
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,080
off it open and around and round she
 

397
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,540
off it open and around and round she
goes so at the end of this road I'm

398
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:41,550
goes so at the end of this road I'm
 

399
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,820
goes so at the end of this road I'm
going to build another section like this

400
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:43,830
going to build another section like this
 

401
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:50,060
going to build another section like this
and it will form a loop and it should be

402
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,070
and it will form a loop and it should be
 

403
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,360
and it will form a loop and it should be
good so I'm going to end that episode

404
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,370
good so I'm going to end that episode
 

405
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,290
good so I'm going to end that episode
here and next episode we'll probably go

406
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:57,300
here and next episode we'll probably go
 

407
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,570
here and next episode we'll probably go
look for some redstone or something like

408
00:20:59,570 --> 00:20:59,580
look for some redstone or something like
 

409
00:20:59,580 --> 00:20:59,990
look for some redstone or something like
that

410
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
that
 

411
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,430
that
