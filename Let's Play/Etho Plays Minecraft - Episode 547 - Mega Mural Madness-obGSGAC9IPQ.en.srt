00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
let's check it out here the pyramid
 

37
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,910
let's check it out here the pyramid
for the longest time we've had we've had

38
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:45,920
for the longest time we've had we've had
 

39
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,590
for the longest time we've had we've had
this project and this has been sitting

40
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
this project and this has been sitting
 

41
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,270
this project and this has been sitting
unfinished you know we see it almost

42
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
unfinished you know we see it almost
 

43
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,630
unfinished you know we see it almost
every episode and uh we had this side of

44
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
every episode and uh we had this side of
 

45
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,790
every episode and uh we had this side of
pretty much done so it wasn't really

46
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
pretty much done so it wasn't really
 

47
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,430
pretty much done so it wasn't really
bothering me too much but with the

48
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
bothering me too much but with the
 

49
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,349
bothering me too much but with the
world tour and download coming up soon i

50
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
world tour and download coming up soon i
 

51
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,630
world tour and download coming up soon i
figured we'd better

52
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640
figured we'd better
 

53
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,470
figured we'd better
finish the other three sides on this

54
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
finish the other three sides on this
 

55
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,549
finish the other three sides on this
thing but as most of you guys know

56
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
thing but as most of you guys know
 

57
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,550
thing but as most of you guys know
finished is a word i use kind of loosely

58
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:06,560
finished is a word i use kind of loosely
 

59
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,630
finished is a word i use kind of loosely
it's finished in a way but we might come

60
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
it's finished in a way but we might come
 

61
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,630
it's finished in a way but we might come
back to it later if i feel more inspired

62
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
back to it later if i feel more inspired
 

63
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,750
back to it later if i feel more inspired
to add some

64
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
to add some
 

65
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,590
to add some
more color to it like maybe a line of

66
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
more color to it like maybe a line of
 

67
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,429
more color to it like maybe a line of
orange sandstone around the bottom or

68
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
orange sandstone around the bottom or
 

69
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,230
orange sandstone around the bottom or
something

70
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
something
 

71
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,510
something
or uh lower the detail i'm not sure yet

72
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
or uh lower the detail i'm not sure yet
 

73
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,190
or uh lower the detail i'm not sure yet
we'll live with it for a bit and might

74
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
we'll live with it for a bit and might
 

75
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,510
we'll live with it for a bit and might
change it later this is technically the

76
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
change it later this is technically the
 

77
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,749
change it later this is technically the
entrance to it on this side

78
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
entrance to it on this side
 

79
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,710
entrance to it on this side
the side we never see made some odd

80
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
the side we never see made some odd
 

81
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,950
the side we never see made some odd
choices while building this thing

82
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
choices while building this thing
 

83
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,190
choices while building this thing
and would like to add some kind of

84
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
and would like to add some kind of
 

85
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:41,270
and would like to add some kind of
interior to it eventually too

86
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280

 

87
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,109

aha so we're just trying something that

88
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
aha so we're just trying something that
 

89
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,910
aha so we're just trying something that
was suggested a long time ago to add a

90
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
was suggested a long time ago to add a
 

91
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,830
was suggested a long time ago to add a
gold beacon on the very top of the

92
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
gold beacon on the very top of the
 

93
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,429
gold beacon on the very top of the
pyramid because we had that like big

94
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
pyramid because we had that like big
 

95
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,550
pyramid because we had that like big
flat spot

96
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
flat spot
 

97
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,670
flat spot
and i don't really want to build the

98
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
and i don't really want to build the
 

99
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,310
and i don't really want to build the
sandstone any higher so it would be nice

100
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
sandstone any higher so it would be nice
 

101
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,870
sandstone any higher so it would be nice
to put something up there and uh

102
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
to put something up there and uh
 

103
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,190
to put something up there and uh
gold beacon might be a cool idea only

104
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
gold beacon might be a cool idea only
 

105
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,350
gold beacon might be a cool idea only
thing is i don't like it from this angle

106
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
thing is i don't like it from this angle
 

107
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,590
thing is i don't like it from this angle
i feel like it really stands out maybe

108
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
i feel like it really stands out maybe
 

109
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,429
i feel like it really stands out maybe
we got to mix some sandstone in with it

110
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
we got to mix some sandstone in with it
 

111
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,990
we got to mix some sandstone in with it
so it doesn't stand out as much

112
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000

 

113
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,190

building the pyramid ever again etho you
 

127
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,470

got it you nailed it today

128

um i do think the sandstone helps it
 

135
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,430
um i do think the sandstone helps it
not stand out as much but it's a little

but anyways let's get to checking out
some other stuff here before we get to

144
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
some other stuff here before we get to
 

145
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,509
some other stuff here before we get to
our projects for today

146
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
our projects for today
 

147
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,350
our projects for today
so i fixed the slime thing a couple

148
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
so i fixed the slime thing a couple
 

149
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,949
so i fixed the slime thing a couple
episodes ago and

150
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
episodes ago and
 

151
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,229
episodes ago and
uh something has changed with it for

152
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
uh something has changed with it for
 

153
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:50,790
uh something has changed with it for
sure like

154
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
sure like
 

155
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,309
sure like
at most we used to get two or three

156
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
at most we used to get two or three
 

157
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,550
at most we used to get two or three
slimes going around this thing

158
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
slimes going around this thing
 

159
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,350
slimes going around this thing
uh but now it's like there's always like

160
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
uh but now it's like there's always like
 

161
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,149
uh but now it's like there's always like
ten or

162
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159
ten or
 

163
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,229
ten or
more and it's out of mine carts i think

164
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
more and it's out of mine carts i think
 

165
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,509
more and it's out of mine carts i think
if we had more mine carts it would

166
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
if we had more mine carts it would
 

167
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,830
if we had more mine carts it would

major bonus points because i was

228
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
major bonus points because i was
 

229
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,309
major bonus points because i was
thinking about it as like i don't know

230
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
thinking about it as like i don't know
 

231
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,589
thinking about it as like i don't know
if i've ever seen one of these built

232
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
if i've ever seen one of these built
 

233
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,470
if i've ever seen one of these built
before

234
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
before
 

235
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,229
before
and i was really struggling with how

236
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
and i was really struggling with how
 

237
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,990
and i was really struggling with how
should i design it you know

238
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
should i design it you know
 

239
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,030
should i design it you know
um so if you don't know you can actually

240
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
um so if you don't know you can actually
 

241
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,110
um so if you don't know you can actually
farm ferns in this game like if you grow

242
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
farm ferns in this game like if you grow
 

243

get two
so you get one bonus right and then you

248
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
so you get one bonus right and then you
 

249
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,469
so you get one bonus right and then you
can just bow meal it to get another one

250
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
can just bow meal it to get another one
 

251
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,069
can just bow meal it to get another one
the other day i realized i don't have

them all up
 

257
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,510
them all up
and a lot of my world was generated

258
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
and a lot of my world was generated
 

259
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,990
and a lot of my world was generated
before

260
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
before
 

261
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,590
before
ferns were in the game so if i want them

262
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
ferns were in the game so if i want them

264
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
i gotta go pretty far away
 

265
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,510
i gotta go pretty far away

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
to collect them so i thought why don't
 

267
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,870
to collect them so i thought why don't
we make a fern farm

268
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880

the way this works is we have our shears
 

271
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,230
the way this works is we have our shears
in one hand we might be able to use a

272
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
in one hand we might be able to use a
 

273
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,670
in one hand we might be able to use a
silk dutch hotel i haven't tried that

274
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680

yet
and then uh burns in the offhand hold

278
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
and then uh burns in the offhand hold
 

279
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,110
and then uh burns in the offhand hold
right click

280
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
right click
 

281
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,030
right click
and it does that and every now and again

282
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
and it does that and every now and again
 

283
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,710

285
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,990

and we get burns so it's pretty simple

286
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
and we get burns so it's pretty simple
 

287
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,990
and we get burns so it's pretty simple
goes through durability very fast on

288
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
goes through durability very fast on
 

289
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,110
goes through durability very fast on
shears though so

290
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
shears though so
 

291
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,749
shears though so
probably got a switch or adam breaking

292
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
probably got a switch or adam breaking
 

293
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,029
probably got a switch or adam breaking
or something to it

294
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
or something to it
 

295
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,270
or something to it
but yeah the way this works is first one

296
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
but yeah the way this works is first one
 

297
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,790
but yeah the way this works is first one
nothing happens second one nothing

298
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
nothing happens second one nothing
 

299
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,150
nothing happens second one nothing
happens third one it goes to the

300
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
happens third one it goes to the
 

301
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,749
happens third one it goes to the
observer

302
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
observer
 

303
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,070
observer
that triggers all the bone meal to go on

304
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
that triggers all the bone meal to go on
 

305
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,830
that triggers all the bone meal to go on
the three dispensers

306
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
the three dispensers
 

307
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,670
the three dispensers
and then oh

308
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
and then oh
 

309
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,710
and then oh
day time's on

310
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720

 

311
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,029

so you'll notice that if i right click

312
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
so you'll notice that if i right click
 

313
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,029
so you'll notice that if i right click
on a tall fern with the regular firm

314
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
on a tall fern with the regular firm
 

315
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,070
on a tall fern with the regular firm
it replaces it

316
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
it replaces it
 

317
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,150
it replaces it
that's a big problem so that's why we

318
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
that's a big problem so that's why we
 

319
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,870
that's a big problem so that's why we
have this extra one at the end

320
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
have this extra one at the end
 

321
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,029
have this extra one at the end
because that way we don't waste any

322
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
because that way we don't waste any
 

323
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,390
because that way we don't waste any
ferns because when you

324
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
ferns because when you
 

325
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,710
ferns because when you
when you do this it destroys it so the

326
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
when you do this it destroys it so the
 

327
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,870
when you do this it destroys it so the
way the game works if you have a fern on

328
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
way the game works if you have a fern on
 

329
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,310
way the game works if you have a fern on
the end here and you try to place

330
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
the end here and you try to place
 

331
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,310
the end here and you try to place
another fern it's not going to replace

332
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
another fern it's not going to replace
 

333
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,550
another fern it's not going to replace
that existing one it sees oh it's the

334
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
that existing one it sees oh it's the
 

335
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,510
that existing one it sees oh it's the
same block

336
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
same block
 

337
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,590
same block
don't need to replace it but the tall

338
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
don't need to replace it but the tall
 

339
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,629
don't need to replace it but the tall
ferns

340
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
ferns
 

341
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,710
ferns
are considered to be a different block

342
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
are considered to be a different block
 

343
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,150
are considered to be a different block
so that's why it will replace it and

344
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
so that's why it will replace it and
 

345
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,990
so that's why it will replace it and
destroy it and then you lose

346
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
destroy it and then you lose
 

347
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,150
destroy it and then you lose
ferns doing that this is like a cap to

348
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
ferns doing that this is like a cap to
 

349
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,070
ferns doing that this is like a cap to
stop things so we can just hold right

350
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
stop things so we can just hold right
 

351
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,230
stop things so we can just hold right
click right click the whole time

352
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
click right click the whole time
 

353
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,430
click right click the whole time
and then you can see we got tilled

354
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
and then you can see we got tilled
 

355
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,510
and then you can see we got tilled
farmland over here which is a little bit

356
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
farmland over here which is a little bit
 

357
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,950
farmland over here which is a little bit
smaller than a block so

358
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
smaller than a block so
 

359
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,070
smaller than a block so
we can put hoppers underneath

360
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
we can put hoppers underneath
 

361
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,950
we can put hoppers underneath
and can we see things here or do i get

362
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
and can we see things here or do i get
 

363
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,550
and can we see things here or do i get
it all closed up it's kind of all closed

364
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
it all closed up it's kind of all closed
 

365
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:14,870
it all closed up it's kind of all closed
up

366
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
up
 

367
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,150
up
but yeah there's hoppers running

368
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
but yeah there's hoppers running
 

369
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,550
but yeah there's hoppers running
underneath the tilled farmland and it

370
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
underneath the tilled farmland and it
 

371
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,230
underneath the tilled farmland and it
delivers it to a barrel

372
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
delivers it to a barrel
 

373
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,990
delivers it to a barrel
so that that keeps going and then we

374
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
so that that keeps going and then we
 

375
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,150
so that that keeps going and then we
also have hoppers under the barrel

376
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
also have hoppers under the barrel
 

377
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,189
also have hoppers under the barrel
to go into a

378
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
to go into a
 

379
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,629
to go into a

i know you like your pixel arts so i

558
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
i know you like your pixel arts so i
 

559
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,829
i know you like your pixel arts so i
think that's a pretty cool suggestion

and now that story is lost to time
unless we can tell it again somehow

570

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
aha so what is our plan here how are we
 

573
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,470
aha so what is our plan here how are we

i got an idea in mind here but i guess
 

577
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,550
i got an idea in mind here but i guess
let's start off with the story

578
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
let's start off with the story
 

579
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,350
let's start off with the story
that we're trying to tell so the way it

580
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
that we're trying to tell so the way it
 

581
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,350
that we're trying to tell so the way it
happened is i conquered a guardian

582
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
happened is i conquered a guardian
 

583
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,230
happened is i conquered a guardian
temple

584
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
temple
 

585
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,230
temple
and then we transported the elder

586
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
and then we transported the elder
 

587
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,269
and then we transported the elder
guardian through

588
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
guardian through
 

589
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,590
guardian through
a nether portal through the nether on a

590
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
a nether portal through the nether on a
 

591
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,870
a nether portal through the nether on a
minecart

592
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
minecart
 

593
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,710
minecart
to the top of the windmill and that's

594
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
to the top of the windmill and that's
 

595
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,910
to the top of the windmill and that's
how it happened

596
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
how it happened
 

597
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,509
how it happened
so i think our plan here is to divide

598
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
so i think our plan here is to divide
 

599
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,949
so i think our plan here is to divide
the mural into three

600
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
the mural into three
 

601
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,150
the mural into three
main sections we're gonna have the

602
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
main sections we're gonna have the
 

603
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,310
main sections we're gonna have the
guardian temple that we conquered we're

604
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
guardian temple that we conquered we're
 

605
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,750
guardian temple that we conquered we're
gonna have the nether

606
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
gonna have the nether
 

607
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,030
gonna have the nether
and then we're gonna have the windmill

608
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
and then we're gonna have the windmill
 

609
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,949
and then we're gonna have the windmill
and we're gonna go left to right

610
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
and we're gonna go left to right
 

611
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,790
and we're gonna go left to right
because we read left to right so our

612
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
because we read left to right so our
 

613
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,230
because we read left to right so our
pictures should go

614
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
pictures should go
 

615
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,710
pictures should go
left to right as well all right so let's

616
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
left to right as well all right so let's
 

617
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,069
left to right as well all right so let's
get to it here this should be pretty

618
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
get to it here this should be pretty
 

619
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,470
get to it here this should be pretty
fun i especially like doing pixel art

620
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
fun i especially like doing pixel art
 

621
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,470
fun i especially like doing pixel art
where you have to take a bigger object

622
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
where you have to take a bigger object
 

623
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,389
where you have to take a bigger object
and compress it down it's like doing

624
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
and compress it down it's like doing
 

625
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,350
and compress it down it's like doing
visual compression um and you got to

626
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
visual compression um and you got to
 

627
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,110
visual compression um and you got to
decide what key features you want to

628
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
decide what key features you want to
 

629
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,550
decide what key features you want to
keep and what's the unimportant

630
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
keep and what's the unimportant
 

631
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,790
keep and what's the unimportant
information you can get rid of

632
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
information you can get rid of
 

633
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,030
information you can get rid of
so with a water temple we're gonna be

634
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
so with a water temple we're gonna be
 

635
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,470
so with a water temple we're gonna be
building a tiny one here

636
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
building a tiny one here
 

637
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,829
building a tiny one here
and if you look at the front of it i

638
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
and if you look at the front of it i
 

639
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,590
and if you look at the front of it i
think the thing that stands out to me is

640
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
think the thing that stands out to me is
 

641
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,790
think the thing that stands out to me is
the three

642
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
the three
 

643
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,430
the three
pillars at the bottom holding it up and

644
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
pillars at the bottom holding it up and
 

645
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,590
pillars at the bottom holding it up and
you'll also notice it's built on gravel

646
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
you'll also notice it's built on gravel
 

647
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,150
you'll also notice it's built on gravel
like the ocean floor so we got a layer

648
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
like the ocean floor so we got a layer
 

649
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,910
like the ocean floor so we got a layer
of gravel here and we're gonna leave

650
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:49,920
of gravel here and we're gonna leave
 

651
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,230
of gravel here and we're gonna leave
like maybe a five block space

652
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
like maybe a five block space
 

653
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,870
like maybe a five block space
between the two sides and then three

654
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
between the two sides and then three
 

655
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,509
between the two sides and then three
more pillars on this side

656
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
more pillars on this side
 

657
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,350
more pillars on this side
this will be the center of our our

658
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
this will be the center of our our
 

659
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,990
this will be the center of our our
temple and that kind of

660
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
temple and that kind of
 

661
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,430
temple and that kind of
gets close to another rack i think that

662
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
gets close to another rack i think that
 

663
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,870
gets close to another rack i think that
should be good though we'll just bump

664
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
should be good though we'll just bump
 

665
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,790
should be good though we'll just bump
this over a bit more

666
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
this over a bit more
 

667
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,389
this over a bit more
the nether is like the part where we

668
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
the nether is like the part where we
 

669
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,990
the nether is like the part where we
have the freedom with because there's no

670
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
have the freedom with because there's no
 

671
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,750
have the freedom with because there's no
specific structure we got to build here

672
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
specific structure we got to build here
 

673
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,750
specific structure we got to build here
now guardian temples also have way more

674
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:13,760
now guardian temples also have way more
 

675
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:13,990
now guardian temples also have way more
than

676
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
than
 

677
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,670
than
just three of these pillars they have

678
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
just three of these pillars they have
 

679
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,590
just three of these pillars they have
several rows of three like i think at

680
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
several rows of three like i think at
 

681
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,710
several rows of three like i think at
least five

682
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
least five
 

683
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,430
least five
rows of these three but we can represent

684
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
rows of these three but we can represent
 

685
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,590
rows of these three but we can represent
that depth just by adding one more row

686
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
that depth just by adding one more row
 

687
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,630
that depth just by adding one more row
probably

688
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
probably
 

689
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,710
probably
uh we're not trying to do a perfect

690
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
uh we're not trying to do a perfect
 

691
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,310
uh we're not trying to do a perfect
scaled-down model we're just

692
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320
scaled-down model we're just
 

693
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,870
scaled-down model we're just
trying to compress the information so

694
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
trying to compress the information so
 

695
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,509
trying to compress the information so
this gives the illusion of depth in many

696
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
this gives the illusion of depth in many
 

697
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,750
this gives the illusion of depth in many
many sets of them right that's probably

698
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
many sets of them right that's probably
 

699
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,110
many sets of them right that's probably
good enough

700
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
good enough
 

701
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,509
good enough
now there's also a bit about overhang we

702
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
now there's also a bit about overhang we
 

703
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,870
now there's also a bit about overhang we
need to represent

704
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
need to represent
 

705
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,350
need to represent
with some stairs here just again we'll

706
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
with some stairs here just again we'll
 

707
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,710
with some stairs here just again we'll
compress it down there's probably like

708
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
compress it down there's probably like
 

709
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,670
compress it down there's probably like
five or

710
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
five or
 

711
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,990
five or
six arches of these sea lanterns we can

712
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
six arches of these sea lanterns we can
 

713
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,750
six arches of these sea lanterns we can
represent just by building like two of

714
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
represent just by building like two of
 

715
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,110
represent just by building like two of
them

716
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
them
 

717
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,389
them
so let's just do it like this i think

718
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
so let's just do it like this i think
 

719
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,910
so let's just do it like this i think
sea lanterns and then bridge the gap

720
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
sea lanterns and then bridge the gap
 

721
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,629
sea lanterns and then bridge the gap
between them

722
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:58,639
between them
 

723
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,710
between them
maybe with a wall whoa so i loaded up

724
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
maybe with a wall whoa so i loaded up
 

725
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,030
maybe with a wall whoa so i loaded up
a guardian temple in uh creative and i

726
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040
a guardian temple in uh creative and i
 

727
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,710
a guardian temple in uh creative and i
noticed i might not be getting all the

728
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
noticed i might not be getting all the
 

729
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,069
noticed i might not be getting all the
details 100

730
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
details 100
 

731
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,829
details 100
correct i thought it was like several

732
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839
correct i thought it was like several
 

733
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,269
correct i thought it was like several
sets of three for the

734
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
sets of three for the
 

735
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,509
sets of three for the
the pillars here but no there's actually

736
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
the pillars here but no there's actually
 

737
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,110
the pillars here but no there's actually
none in the center so we might want to

738
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
none in the center so we might want to
 

739
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,829
none in the center so we might want to
bump

740
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
bump
 

741
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,710
bump
these out and probably got a couple

742
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
these out and probably got a couple
 

743
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,310
these out and probably got a couple
other things wrong but as long as we get

744
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
other things wrong but as long as we get
 

745
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,430
other things wrong but as long as we get
the general

746
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
the general
 

747
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,190
the general
gist of it corrected i think will be

748
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,200
gist of it corrected i think will be
 

749
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,350
gist of it corrected i think will be
good i think this is a general shape of

750
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,360
good i think this is a general shape of
 

751
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,350
good i think this is a general shape of
it we got to mix in some dark prismarine

752
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
it we got to mix in some dark prismarine
 

753
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,230
it we got to mix in some dark prismarine
there though

754
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
there though
 

755
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,230
there though
and also we got to add that thing on the

756
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
and also we got to add that thing on the
 

757
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,350
and also we got to add that thing on the
top

758
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
top
 

759
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,430
top
that you know when you when you float

760
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
that you know when you when you float
 

761
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,269
that you know when you when you float
over it with a boat and you see that

762
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:35,279
over it with a boat and you see that
 

763
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,790
over it with a boat and you see that
those sea lanterns you know it's a

764
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
those sea lanterns you know it's a
 

765
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,269
those sea lanterns you know it's a
guardian temple below you

766
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
guardian temple below you
 

767
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,470
guardian temple below you
i don't know what this thing is actually

768
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
i don't know what this thing is actually
 

769
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,550
i don't know what this thing is actually
called but uh you know what i'm talking

770
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
called but uh you know what i'm talking
 

771
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,310
called but uh you know what i'm talking
about hopefully

772
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
about hopefully
 

773
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,190
about hopefully
this thing over here

774
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200

 

775
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,509

all right so i'm thinking we might just

776
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
all right so i'm thinking we might just
 

777
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,230
all right so i'm thinking we might just
put the

778
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
put the
 

779
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,110
put the
portal over here as well because again

780
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
portal over here as well because again
 

781
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,030
portal over here as well because again
we gotta represent a portal to the

782
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
we gotta represent a portal to the
 

783
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,710
we gotta represent a portal to the
nether somehow and i think this might be

784
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
nether somehow and i think this might be
 

785
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,910
nether somehow and i think this might be
the spot we don't want to build a

786
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
the spot we don't want to build a
 

787
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,670
the spot we don't want to build a
full-size portal

788
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
full-size portal
 

789
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,710
full-size portal
we want like a mini one and i guess

790
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
we want like a mini one and i guess
 

791
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,990
we want like a mini one and i guess
we'll just fill in the sides here with

792
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
we'll just fill in the sides here with
 

793
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,910
we'll just fill in the sides here with
something and then we'll build an actual

794
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
something and then we'll build an actual
 

795
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,590
something and then we'll build an actual
portal behind it

796
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
portal behind it
 

797
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,350
portal behind it
let's maybe put some prismarine in the

798
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
let's maybe put some prismarine in the
 

799
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,949
let's maybe put some prismarine in the
back here as well just in case we can

800
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
back here as well just in case we can
 

801
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,230
back here as well just in case we can
see through

802
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
see through
 

803
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,509
see through
we'll light it up and we got our three

804
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
we'll light it up and we got our three
 

805
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:19,990
we'll light it up and we got our three
by four

806
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
by four
 

807
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,790
by four
portal oh yeah i guess we can see

808
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
portal oh yeah i guess we can see
 

809
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,750
portal oh yeah i guess we can see
through here too

810
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
through here too
 

811
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,670
through here too
let's change that out uh-huh uh-huh

812
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
let's change that out uh-huh uh-huh
 

813
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,790
let's change that out uh-huh uh-huh
all right so we're back in the creative

814
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
all right so we're back in the creative
 

815
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,710
all right so we're back in the creative
world again to check things out so we

816
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
world again to check things out so we
 

817
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,990
world again to check things out so we
just built this

818
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
just built this
 

819
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,990
just built this
i guess it's prismarine at the top not

820
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
i guess it's prismarine at the top not
 

821
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,230
i guess it's prismarine at the top not
not the bricks so i'll change that

822
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
not the bricks so i'll change that
 

823
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,829
not the bricks so i'll change that
um and then if we look at the front of

824
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
um and then if we look at the front of
 

825
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,590
um and then if we look at the front of
this thing

826
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
this thing
 

827
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,350
this thing
we have all this dark prismarine so it

828
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
we have all this dark prismarine so it
 

829
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,870
we have all this dark prismarine so it
does like a double v thing

830
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
does like a double v thing
 

831
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,389
does like a double v thing
and then we got some lines alright so

832
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
and then we got some lines alright so
 

833
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,750
and then we got some lines alright so
check it out everybody

834
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
check it out everybody
 

835
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,189
check it out everybody
i think it's about done here actually

836
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:49,199
i think it's about done here actually
 

837
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,590
i think it's about done here actually
it's a bit derpy but i like it

838
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
it's a bit derpy but i like it
 

839
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,310
it's a bit derpy but i like it
we got our dark prismarine so instead of

840
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
we got our dark prismarine so instead of
 

841
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,069
we got our dark prismarine so instead of
doing like a double v

842
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:56,079
doing like a double v
 

843
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,389
doing like a double v
like the original in like three lines we

844
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
like the original in like three lines we
 

845
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,790
like the original in like three lines we
just do a single and a double

846
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
just do a single and a double
 

847
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,629
just do a single and a double
and it sort of represents the same thing

848
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
and it sort of represents the same thing
 

849
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,389
and it sort of represents the same thing
it's just more compressed

850
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
it's just more compressed
 

851
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,629
it's just more compressed
and i don't know if it's just me but i

852
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639
and i don't know if it's just me but i
 

853
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,030
and i don't know if it's just me but i
keep seeing like a crab when i look at

854
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
keep seeing like a crab when i look at
 

855
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,949
keep seeing like a crab when i look at
this thing like it's got the big shell

856
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
this thing like it's got the big shell
 

857
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,590
this thing like it's got the big shell
in the back

858
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
in the back
 

859
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,310
in the back
the beady eyes maybe the claws in the

860
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
the beady eyes maybe the claws in the
 

861
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,150
the beady eyes maybe the claws in the
front there

862
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
front there
 

863
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,670
front there
this is what i've been seeing when i

864
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
this is what i've been seeing when i
 

865
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,670
this is what i've been seeing when i
when i look at it all right we're gonna

866
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
when i look at it all right we're gonna
 

867
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,189
when i look at it all right we're gonna
move on here

868
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
move on here
 

869
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,590
move on here
uh check this out oh snappers we got the

870
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
uh check this out oh snappers we got the
 

871
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,629
uh check this out oh snappers we got the
windmill done

872
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639
windmill done
 

873
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,269
windmill done
already i just worked on it off camera

874
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
already i just worked on it off camera
 

875
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,150
already i just worked on it off camera
because it was so

876
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
because it was so
 

877
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,790
because it was so
finicky and i had i really struggled

878
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800
finicky and i had i really struggled
 

879
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,990
finicky and i had i really struggled
trying to record this

880
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
trying to record this
 

881
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,310
trying to record this
so we got the planes with the wheat

882
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
so we got the planes with the wheat
 

883
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,470
so we got the planes with the wheat
field couple hay bales mixed in there we

884
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
field couple hay bales mixed in there we
 

885
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,509
field couple hay bales mixed in there we
got a couple

886
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:39,519
got a couple
 

887
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,990
got a couple
random trees and then the windmill

888
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
random trees and then the windmill
 

889
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,590
random trees and then the windmill
itself

890
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
itself
 

891
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,509
itself
so i would say this is about two-thirds

892
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
so i would say this is about two-thirds
 

893
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,110
so i would say this is about two-thirds
the size of the original so it is

894
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
the size of the original so it is
 

895
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,430
the size of the original so it is
compressed down a little bit

896
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,440
compressed down a little bit
 

897
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,430
compressed down a little bit
but a lot of it looks the same and then

898
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
but a lot of it looks the same and then
 

899
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,750
but a lot of it looks the same and then
at the very top

900
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:53,760
at the very top
 

901
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,670
at the very top
had to build an elder guardian and that

902
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
had to build an elder guardian and that
 

903
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,710
had to build an elder guardian and that
was really tricky uh i had a hard time

904
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
was really tricky uh i had a hard time
 

905
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,389
was really tricky uh i had a hard time
matching the colors

906
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
matching the colors
 

907
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,150
matching the colors
so i ended up going with just stone

908
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160
so i ended up going with just stone
 

909
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,310
so i ended up going with just stone
brick for for the main color

910
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
brick for for the main color
 

911
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,870
brick for for the main color
we got a beacon with an orange pane in

912
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
we got a beacon with an orange pane in
 

913
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,509
we got a beacon with an orange pane in
front

914
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
front
 

915
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,790
front
for the eye and then warped trap doors

916
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
for the eye and then warped trap doors
 

917
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,269
for the eye and then warped trap doors
for his spikes and he's bouncing around

918
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
for his spikes and he's bouncing around
 

919
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,550
for his spikes and he's bouncing around
on the top there

920
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
on the top there
 

921
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,949
on the top there
all uh all captured and stuff

922
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
all uh all captured and stuff
 

923
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,949
all uh all captured and stuff
aha so we got quite a bit done on this

924
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
aha so we got quite a bit done on this
 

925
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,150
aha so we got quite a bit done on this
but i realized there's

926
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
but i realized there's
 

927
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,629
but i realized there's
actually a ton left to do here yeah so

928
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
actually a ton left to do here yeah so
 

929
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,150
actually a ton left to do here yeah so
not only do we still have to build

930
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
not only do we still have to build
 

931
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,590
not only do we still have to build
another section which

932
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
another section which
 

933
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,030
another section which
by the way i think we'll try to build

934
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
by the way i think we'll try to build
 

935
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,189
by the way i think we'll try to build
like another fortress as a structure in

936
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
like another fortress as a structure in
 

937
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:31,670
like another fortress as a structure in
it

938
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
it
 

939
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,150
it
make it a bit more interesting but we

940
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
make it a bit more interesting but we
 

941
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,990
make it a bit more interesting but we
also gotta probably build some kind of

942
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
also gotta probably build some kind of
 

943
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,629
also gotta probably build some kind of
frame around the edges

944
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
frame around the edges
 

945
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,230
frame around the edges
and looking at the sand up there i

946
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
and looking at the sand up there i
 

947
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,590
and looking at the sand up there i
really like that with the warped wood

948
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:41,600
really like that with the warped wood
 

949
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,030
really like that with the warped wood
right i think that's gonna be our other

950
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
right i think that's gonna be our other
 

951
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,150
right i think that's gonna be our other
color

952
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
color
 

953
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,150
color
maybe smooth sandstone going all around

954
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
maybe smooth sandstone going all around
 

955
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,230
maybe smooth sandstone going all around
the edges would look cool

956
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
the edges would look cool
 

957
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,150
the edges would look cool
um and then we still got stone here

958
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
um and then we still got stone here
 

959
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,829
um and then we still got stone here
so we got rid of a lot of the stone but

960
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:53,839
so we got rid of a lot of the stone but
 

961
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,829
so we got rid of a lot of the stone but
there's still a lot left

962
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
there's still a lot left
 

963
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,670
there's still a lot left
for the backdrop we should replace with

964
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
for the backdrop we should replace with
 

965
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,430
for the backdrop we should replace with
something else and i i was thinking we

966
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
something else and i i was thinking we
 

967
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,230
something else and i i was thinking we
should try to make an artificial sky

968
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
should try to make an artificial sky
 

969
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,389
should try to make an artificial sky
now light blue wool is like the

970
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
now light blue wool is like the
 

971
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,629
now light blue wool is like the
traditional sky color people always use

972
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:06,639
traditional sky color people always use
 

973
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,590
traditional sky color people always use
but i don't think we can use it anymore

974
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
but i don't think we can use it anymore
 

975
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,350
but i don't think we can use it anymore
because the color kind of changed now

976
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
because the color kind of changed now
 

977
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,310
because the color kind of changed now
right it's a little bit deeper blue

978
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,320
right it's a little bit deeper blue
 

979
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,870
right it's a little bit deeper blue
so instead i think what we'll go for is

980
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
so instead i think what we'll go for is
 

981
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,030
so instead i think what we'll go for is
packed ice i like packed ice a lot more

982
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040
packed ice i like packed ice a lot more
 

983
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,150
packed ice i like packed ice a lot more
now i think

984
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,160
now i think
 

985
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,629
now i think
let's try a little section here and then

986
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639
let's try a little section here and then
 

987
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,150
let's try a little section here and then
we'll build this like all the way up the

988
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
we'll build this like all the way up the
 

989
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,189
we'll build this like all the way up the
wall

990
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
wall
 

991
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,550
wall
this is like a lighter blue more natural

992
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
this is like a lighter blue more natural
 

993
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,350
this is like a lighter blue more natural
more sky-like with some whimsical white

994
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
more sky-like with some whimsical white
 

995
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,670
more sky-like with some whimsical white
cloud fluffiness in it

996
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:35,680
cloud fluffiness in it
 

997
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,710
cloud fluffiness in it
maybe i think it works a bit better

998
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
maybe i think it works a bit better
 

999
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,629
maybe i think it works a bit better
hmm yeah i don't think you're gonna get

1000
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
hmm yeah i don't think you're gonna get
 

1001
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,230
hmm yeah i don't think you're gonna get
out of that one that's a tough situation

1002
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
out of that one that's a tough situation
 

1003
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,230
out of that one that's a tough situation
all right we're gonna head over to our

1004
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
all right we're gonna head over to our
 

1005
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,910
all right we're gonna head over to our
packed ice farming area we gotta get a

1006
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
packed ice farming area we gotta get a
 

1007
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,189
packed ice farming area we gotta get a
bunch of materials

1008
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
bunch of materials
 

1009
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,430
bunch of materials
so i set this up a few weeks ago now i

1010
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
so i set this up a few weeks ago now i
 

1011
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,389
so i set this up a few weeks ago now i
think

1012
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
think
 

1013
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,670
think
basically it's very uh

1014
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
basically it's very uh
 

1015
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,310
basically it's very uh
very unprofessional at the moment i dug

1016
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
very unprofessional at the moment i dug
 

1017
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,949
very unprofessional at the moment i dug
a tunnel through the netherrack here

1018
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
a tunnel through the netherrack here
 

1019
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,069
a tunnel through the netherrack here
and then it keeps going for ways

1020
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079

 

1021
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,909

it's a bit of a distance i don't know if

1022
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:07,919
it's a bit of a distance i don't know if
 

1023
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,189
it's a bit of a distance i don't know if
we're ever going to build an official

1024
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199
we're ever going to build an official
 

1025
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,470
we're ever going to build an official
tunnel here or what

1026
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
tunnel here or what
 

1027
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,510
tunnel here or what
but for now i've just been flying it and

1028
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:13,520
but for now i've just been flying it and
 

1029
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,789
but for now i've just been flying it and
then we take a turn

1030
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
then we take a turn
 

1031
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,069
then we take a turn
we got another portal over here and

1032
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
we got another portal over here and
 

1033
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,390
we got another portal over here and
this my friends is where the packed ice

1034
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
this my friends is where the packed ice
 

1035
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,029
this my friends is where the packed ice
has been coming from lately

1036
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039

 

1037
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,189

so i've got a couple icebergs knocked

1038
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
so i've got a couple icebergs knocked
 

1039
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,309
so i've got a couple icebergs knocked
down already

1040
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
down already
 

1041
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:35,909
down already
let's take out a few more

1042
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919

 

1043
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,150

cool so we got a bunch of packed ice and

1044
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
cool so we got a bunch of packed ice and
 

1045
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,070
cool so we got a bunch of packed ice and
we repaired our tools now let's head

1046
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
we repaired our tools now let's head
 

1047
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,310
we repaired our tools now let's head
over to the super smelter we gotta smelt

1048
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,320
over to the super smelter we gotta smelt
 

1049
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,909
over to the super smelter we gotta smelt
up a bunch of sandstone

1050
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
up a bunch of sandstone
 

1051
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,430
up a bunch of sandstone
make smooth sandstone here

1052
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440

 

1053
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,190

yep yep i'm liking the packed ice there

1054
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
yep yep i'm liking the packed ice there
 

1055
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,430
yep yep i'm liking the packed ice there
i think that's looking pretty cool

1056
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
i think that's looking pretty cool
 

1057
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,950
i think that's looking pretty cool
so as far as the frame goes i think it's

1058
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:54,960
so as far as the frame goes i think it's
 

1059
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,630
so as far as the frame goes i think it's
going to go up and then kind of bend

1060
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
going to go up and then kind of bend
 

1061
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,350
going to go up and then kind of bend
over

1062
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
over
 

1063
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,830
over
and maybe we'll leave the three block

1064
00:17:59,830 --> 00:17:59,840
and maybe we'll leave the three block
 

1065
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,270
and maybe we'll leave the three block
spacing at the top there

1066
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
spacing at the top there
 

1067
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,990
spacing at the top there
all the way down which means we'll have

1068
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000
all the way down which means we'll have
 

1069
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,590
all the way down which means we'll have
to fill in that water over there and

1070
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
to fill in that water over there and
 

1071
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,669
to fill in that water over there and
then it'll come down on the other side

1072
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:07,679
then it'll come down on the other side
 

1073
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,549
then it'll come down on the other side
so let's try to map that out a bit i

1074
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
so let's try to map that out a bit i
 

1075
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,669
so let's try to map that out a bit i
think

1076
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
think
 

1077
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,070
think
yeah it's gonna be two blocks thick here

1078
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
yeah it's gonna be two blocks thick here
 

1079
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,750
yeah it's gonna be two blocks thick here
too

1080
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
too
 

1081
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,230
too
and i guess we'll replace over here too

1082
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
and i guess we'll replace over here too
 

1083
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,669
and i guess we'll replace over here too
with it

1084
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
with it
 

1085
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,310
with it
all the way up this is all gonna be

1086
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
all the way up this is all gonna be
 

1087
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,510
all the way up this is all gonna be
smooth sandstone here

1088
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
smooth sandstone here
 

1089
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,150
smooth sandstone here
i guess we don't need to i'm doing like

1090
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
i guess we don't need to i'm doing like
 

1091
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,430
i guess we don't need to i'm doing like
the whole thing here i guess this can

1092
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
the whole thing here i guess this can
 

1093
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,029
the whole thing here i guess this can
still stay

1094
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:28,039
still stay
 

1095
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,110
still stay
stone still stays stone that's hard to

1096
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120
stone still stays stone that's hard to
 

1097
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,430
stone still stays stone that's hard to
say

1098
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
say
 

1099
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,789
say
still stay stoned when we first started

1100
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
still stay stoned when we first started
 

1101
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,230
still stay stoned when we first started
working on this today i was really

1102
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,240
working on this today i was really
 

1103
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,830
working on this today i was really
debating if it was worth setting up the

1104
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:37,840
debating if it was worth setting up the
 

1105
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,630
debating if it was worth setting up the
haze beacon

1106
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
haze beacon
 

1107
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,750
haze beacon
and i am so glad we did that because

1108
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
and i am so glad we did that because
 

1109
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,590
and i am so glad we did that because
we're going to be doing a lot of digging

1110
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
we're going to be doing a lot of digging
 

1111
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,510
we're going to be doing a lot of digging
here i think

1112
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
here i think
 

1113
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,150
here i think
uh-huh all right so this is the general

1114
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
uh-huh all right so this is the general
 

1115
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,830
uh-huh all right so this is the general
shape we're going to go for on the sides

1116
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
shape we're going to go for on the sides
 

1117
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,190
shape we're going to go for on the sides
so it's going to curve up

1118
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
so it's going to curve up
 

1119
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,350
so it's going to curve up
and then go over and i tell you what the

1120
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,360
and then go over and i tell you what the
 

1121
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,789
and then go over and i tell you what the
sky's looking a little bit plain there

1122
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:54,799
sky's looking a little bit plain there
 

1123
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,190
sky's looking a little bit plain there
so maybe let's add something cool here

1124
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
so maybe let's add something cool here
 

1125
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,950
so maybe let's add something cool here
where it's diagonal yeah right over here

1126
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:58,960
where it's diagonal yeah right over here
 

1127
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,630
where it's diagonal yeah right over here
i want to put some gold

1128
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640

 

1129
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,190

and let's do a couple clouds here too

1130
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
and let's do a couple clouds here too
 

1131
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,789
and let's do a couple clouds here too
just above the trees should look cool

1132
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
just above the trees should look cool
 

1133
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,549
just above the trees should look cool
oh yeah i like that a lot more so we got

1134

bunch done
 

1141
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,590
bunch done
i decided to just build up the frame

1142
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,600
i decided to just build up the frame
 

1143
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,430
i decided to just build up the frame
right away we removed the water that was

1144
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,440
right away we removed the water that was
 

1145
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,230
right away we removed the water that was
there

1146
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
there
 

1147
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,789
there
and also cleared a whole bunch of land

1151
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,669
got that out of the way so we're free to
work on the netherrack section so i went

1152
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:35,679
work on the netherrack section so i went
 

1153

for a backdrop maybe go for glass
 

1169
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,789
for a backdrop maybe go for glass
and then we'll put water behind that

1170
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:54,799
and then we'll put water behind that
 

1171
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,830
and then we'll put water behind that
potentially

1172
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:55,840

so we're gonna get rid of the stairs if
 

1177
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,070
so we're gonna get rid of the stairs if
we run into them and just start building

1178
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,080
we run into them and just start building
 

1179
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,669
we run into them and just start building
the glass up here

1180
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
the glass up here
 

1181

1183
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,990
oh wow actually just the blue glass on
its own does a pretty good job of

1184
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
its own does a pretty good job of
 

1185
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,549
its own does a pretty good job of
mimicking the ocean doesn't it might not

1186
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:12,559
mimicking the ocean doesn't it might not
 

1187
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,230
mimicking the ocean doesn't it might not
even need to put water behind maybe just

1188
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
even need to put water behind maybe just
 

1189
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,350
even need to put water behind maybe just
blue terracotta

1190
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
blue terracotta
 

1191
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,390
blue terracotta
and then do like the bridge across

1192
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400
and then do like the bridge across
 

1193
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,750
and then do like the bridge across
so it'll be stair slab

1194
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:23,760

 

1195
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,590

and then i guess the next one would go

1196
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
and then i guess the next one would go
 

1197
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,950
and then i guess the next one would go
over

1198
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:26,960
over
 

1199
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,630
over
here three four

1200
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,640
here three four
 

1201
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,029
here three four
and then connect like that oh i just

1202
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,039
and then connect like that oh i just
 

1203
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,110

the windmill one actually
 

1293
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,350
the windmill one actually
followed by the nether and then this one

1294
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
followed by the nether and then this one
 

1295
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,190
followed by the nether and then this one
this one's a little bit plain i think we

1296
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
this one's a little bit plain i think we
 

1297

this one's a little bit plain i think we
should add the water behind and maybe

1298

should add the water behind and maybe
 

1299
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,830
should add the water behind and maybe
some fish

1300
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840
some fish
 

1301
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,990
some fish
and that'll liven it up or maybe we add

1302
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
and that'll liven it up or maybe we add
 

1303
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,149
and that'll liven it up or maybe we add
like an island

1304
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
like an island
 

1305
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,669
like an island
somehow at the top there i don't know

1422
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,440

1423
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,590

1425
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,070
called super dispensers and i would like
that

1426
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,080

for the block placement in in minecraft

1428
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:22,960
for the block placement in in minecraft
 

1429
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,549
for the block placement in in minecraft
i thought it was a cool idea

1430
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:24,559
i thought it was a cool idea
 

1431
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,149
i thought it was a cool idea
so instead of just placing the block

1432
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:26,159
so instead of just placing the block
 

1433
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,470
so instead of just placing the block
what it the super dispensers mod does

1434
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
what it the super dispensers mod does
 

1435
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,669
what it the super dispensers mod does
is it shoots the block in item form like

1436
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
is it shoots the block in item form like
 

1437
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,710
is it shoots the block in item form like
this

1438
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:32,720
this
 

1439
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,549
this
uh i think you can control how far you

1440
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
uh i think you can control how far you
 

1441
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,149
uh i think you can control how far you
want it to shoot so you can shoot like

1442
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
want it to shoot so you can shoot like
 

1443
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,149
want it to shoot so you can shoot like
10 or 20 blocks away

1444
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
10 or 20 blocks away
 

1445
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,950
10 or 20 blocks away
and then wherever it lands is when it

1446
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960
and then wherever it lands is when it
 

1447
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,070
and then wherever it lands is when it
then turns into

1448
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
then turns into
 

1449
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,950
then turns into
a solid block so that means if you shoot

1450
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:44,960
a solid block so that means if you shoot
 

1451
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,390
a solid block so that means if you shoot
another one it's going to end up over

1452
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:46,400
another one it's going to end up over
 

1453
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,470
another one it's going to end up over
here and then over here and over here

1454
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,480
here and then over here and over here
 

1455
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,990
here and then over here and over here
and i think that would be a cool way of

1457
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,669
