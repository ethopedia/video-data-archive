00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,050
with another let's play episode checking
out the 1.14 update some more just

10
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:18,060
out the 1.14 update some more just
 

11
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,670
out the 1.14 update some more just
barely scratched the surface on this

12
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
barely scratched the surface on this
 

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,800
barely scratched the surface on this
thing so far we got a lot to check out I

14
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:21,810
thing so far we got a lot to check out I
 

15
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,660
thing so far we got a lot to check out I
thought we would do one of the more

16
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:23,670
thought we would do one of the more
 

17
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,880
thought we would do one of the more
subtle features here and we would we

18
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:25,890
subtle features here and we would we
 

19
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,710
subtle features here and we would we
would take a look at it and give our

20
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:27,720
would take a look at it and give our
 

21
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,339
would take a look at it and give our
course fruit firm and a major update so

22
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:31,349
course fruit firm and a major update so
 

23
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,069
course fruit firm and a major update so
if you don't know the way we currently

24
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
if you don't know the way we currently
 

25
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,170
if you don't know the way we currently
harvest this thing it takes about 10

26
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:36,180
harvest this thing it takes about 10
 

27
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,060
harvest this thing it takes about 10
minutes or so it's actually quite

28
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,070
minutes or so it's actually quite
 

29
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,299
minutes or so it's actually quite
time-consuming basically I run along the

30
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:41,309
time-consuming basically I run along the
 

31
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,280
time-consuming basically I run along the
top of the wood here and try to knock

32
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,290
top of the wood here and try to knock
 

33
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,400
top of the wood here and try to knock
off the seeds and every plant usually

34
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,410
off the seeds and every plant usually
 

35
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,619
off the seeds and every plant usually
has like five seeds to it on average

36
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:48,629
has like five seeds to it on average
 

37
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,660
has like five seeds to it on average
right we gotta get at least one off of

38
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:50,670
right we gotta get at least one off of
 

39
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,600
right we gotta get at least one off of
each plant so that we can we'll have

40
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:53,610
each plant so that we can we'll have
 

41
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,670
each plant so that we can we'll have
enough to regrow um and I just kind of

42
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
enough to regrow um and I just kind of
 

43
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,340
enough to regrow um and I just kind of
run along here and get as many as I can

44
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,350
run along here and get as many as I can
 

45
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,229
run along here and get as many as I can
as quickly as I can to because I only

46
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
as quickly as I can to because I only
 

47
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,639
as quickly as I can to because I only
got 5 minutes before they start the

48
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:01,649
got 5 minutes before they start the
 

49
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,280
got 5 minutes before they start the
spawning so that's the way we used to do

50
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,290
spawning so that's the way we used to do
 

51
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,380
spawning so that's the way we used to do
it but now in 1.14 they made a very

52
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:06,390
it but now in 1.14 they made a very
 

53
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,840
it but now in 1.14 they made a very
subtle but very awesome change where you

54
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:08,850
subtle but very awesome change where you
 

55
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,920
subtle but very awesome change where you
can knock the seeds off of course roots

56
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:11,930
can knock the seeds off of course roots
 

57
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,020
can knock the seeds off of course roots
using a bow or even a trident it looks

58
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,030
using a bow or even a trident it looks
 

59
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,649
using a bow or even a trident it looks
like which is really cool I like that a

60
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:18,659
like which is really cool I like that a
 

61
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:19,160
like which is really cool I like that a
lot

62
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,170
lot
 

63
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,090
lot
I did try with like snow balls and eggs

64
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,100
I did try with like snow balls and eggs
 

65
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,170
I did try with like snow balls and eggs
and and what are they the the charges

66
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,180
and and what are they the the charges
 

67
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,480
and and what are they the the charges
the fire charges those don't work none

68
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:29,490
the fire charges those don't work none
 

69
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,100
the fire charges those don't work none
of these work it has to be I think you

70
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,110
of these work it has to be I think you
 

71
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,749
of these work it has to be I think you
lose the bow or a trident

72
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:32,759
lose the bow or a trident
 

73
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,319
lose the bow or a trident
or probably the crossbow and I it looks

74
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:36,329
or probably the crossbow and I it looks
 

75
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,929
or probably the crossbow and I it looks
like it even works if you do it from a

76
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:38,939
like it even works if you do it from a
 

77
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,830
like it even works if you do it from a
dispenser so if we plant this down shoot

78
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:42,840
dispenser so if we plant this down shoot
 

79
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,219
dispenser so if we plant this down shoot
it with an arrow it pops off so that's

80
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:46,229
it with an arrow it pops off so that's
 

81
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,460
it with an arrow it pops off so that's
cool so what we want to do is try to add

82
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:49,470
cool so what we want to do is try to add
 

83
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,710
cool so what we want to do is try to add
some way of automatically harvesting the

84
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:51,720
some way of automatically harvesting the
 

85
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,289
some way of automatically harvesting the
seeds off of our course fruits plants

86
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:54,299
seeds off of our course fruits plants
 

87
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,679
seeds off of our course fruits plants
here and also yeah there's one more

88
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:57,689
here and also yeah there's one more
 

89
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,380
here and also yeah there's one more
thing I wanted to check out you know

90
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:00,390
thing I wanted to check out you know
 

91
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,069
thing I wanted to check out you know
that trick where you can let's get our

92
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
that trick where you can let's get our
 

93
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,270
that trick where you can let's get our
tried and equipped you know that trick

94
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
tried and equipped you know that trick
 

95
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,889
tried and equipped you know that trick
where you're you're trying can kind of

96
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:06,899
where you're you're trying can kind of
 

97
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,190
where you're you're trying can kind of
hover around I wanted to try that out so

98
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,200
hover around I wanted to try that out so
 

99
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,490
hover around I wanted to try that out so
if we throw it

100
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:13,500
if we throw it
 

101
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,930
if we throw it
get our arrows there so it can't return

102
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:15,940
get our arrows there so it can't return
 

103
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,310
get our arrows there so it can't return
it in our inventory we don't have enough

104
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:17,320
it in our inventory we don't have enough
 

105
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,110
it in our inventory we don't have enough
space for it so it just kind of hovers

106
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
space for it so it just kind of hovers
 

107
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,960
space for it so it just kind of hovers
around us it's kind of curious what

108
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:21,970
around us it's kind of curious what
 

109
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,710
around us it's kind of curious what
happens if we run near our course fruit

110
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
happens if we run near our course fruit
 

111
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,410
happens if we run near our course fruit
see if it if it knocks anything off or

112
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:28,420
see if it if it knocks anything off or
 

113
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,000
see if it if it knocks anything off or
hits anything doesn't look like it

114
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,010
hits anything doesn't look like it
 

115
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,590
hits anything doesn't look like it
really does anything hmm

116
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:37,600
really does anything hmm
 

117
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,630
really does anything hmm
that could have been cool too if you

118
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:39,640
that could have been cool too if you
 

119
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,860
that could have been cool too if you
just like run through here and it would

120
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:40,870
just like run through here and it would
 

121
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,290
just like run through here and it would
with like ten tridents hovering around

122
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:43,300
with like ten tridents hovering around
 

123
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,250
with like ten tridents hovering around
you and you could harvest everything now

124
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:47,260
you and you could harvest everything now
 

125
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,449
you and you could harvest everything now
I don't think that's that's gonna work

126
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:48,459
I don't think that's that's gonna work
 

127
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:48,960
I don't think that's that's gonna work
okay

128
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:48,970
okay
 

129
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,070
okay
let's go with the redstone method then

130
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
let's go with the redstone method then
 

131
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,020
let's go with the redstone method then
okay I just thought of a stupid game you

132
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,030
okay I just thought of a stupid game you
 

133
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,000
okay I just thought of a stupid game you
can play with all at roie's here it's

134
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,010
can play with all at roie's here it's
 

135
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,380
can play with all at roie's here it's
kind of like golf where you try to get a

136
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:58,390
kind of like golf where you try to get a
 

137
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,750
kind of like golf where you try to get a
hole-in-one basically except you're the

138
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:00,760
hole-in-one basically except you're the
 

139
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,330
hole-in-one basically except you're the
ball and if you miss you'll probably die

140
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:05,340
ball and if you miss you'll probably die
 

141
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,729
ball and if you miss you'll probably die
all right so the idea is you try to go

142
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:08,739
all right so the idea is you try to go
 

143
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:12,180
all right so the idea is you try to go
headfirst oh I missed it you go like

144
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:12,190
headfirst oh I missed it you go like
 

145
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,190
headfirst oh I missed it you go like
headfirst down into a 2x2 hole or

146
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,200
headfirst down into a 2x2 hole or
 

147
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,930
headfirst down into a 2x2 hole or
something then see if you can make it

148
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:15,940
something then see if you can make it
 

149
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,930
something then see if you can make it
without hitting the ground let's try one

150
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:18,940
without hitting the ground let's try one
 

151
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,210
without hitting the ground let's try one
more time it's really hard to aim

152
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:21,220
more time it's really hard to aim
 

153
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,610
more time it's really hard to aim
actually

154
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:25,620

 

155
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,210

Oh nope so I think maybe gotta go more

156
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,220
Oh nope so I think maybe gotta go more
 

157
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:36,949
Oh nope so I think maybe gotta go more
like you gotta be higher up maybe I'll

158
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
like you gotta be higher up maybe I'll
 

159
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,600
like you gotta be higher up maybe I'll
get it don't you guys worry don't you

160
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:38,610
get it don't you guys worry don't you
 

161
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:46,699
get it don't you guys worry don't you
worry oh that was close there's got to

162
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:46,709
worry oh that was close there's got to
 

163
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,650
worry oh that was close there's got to
be a trick to this right

164
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:51,660

 

165
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,080

Oh oh that was so close like I can get

166
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,090
Oh oh that was so close like I can get
 

167
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,210
Oh oh that was so close like I can get
within two blocks of it almost every

168
00:03:59,210 --> 00:03:59,220
within two blocks of it almost every
 

169
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,970
within two blocks of it almost every
time it's a there's a 4x4 I think I

170
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:01,980
time it's a there's a 4x4 I think I
 

171
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,570
time it's a there's a 4x4 I think I
could do it

172
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:02,580
could do it
 

173
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,370
could do it
almost every time it's just two by two

174
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:04,380
almost every time it's just two by two
 

175
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,820
almost every time it's just two by two
though huh oh and it still killed me

176
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:07,830
though huh oh and it still killed me
 

177
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,650
though huh oh and it still killed me
what I hit the water oh I just I just

178
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:12,660
what I hit the water oh I just I just
 

179
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:19,699
what I hit the water oh I just I just
didn't slow me down enough all right you

180
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:19,709
didn't slow me down enough all right you
 

181
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,990
didn't slow me down enough all right you
guys might be wondering like what does

182
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,000
guys might be wondering like what does
 

183
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,250
guys might be wondering like what does
this have to do with the course fruit

184
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:22,260
this have to do with the course fruit
 

185
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,220
this have to do with the course fruit
farm we got to stop by here just to get

186
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,230
farm we got to stop by here just to get
 

187
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,350
farm we got to stop by here just to get
some sea lanterns this is our guardian

188
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
some sea lanterns this is our guardian
 

189
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,850
some sea lanterns this is our guardian
farm lots of lots of goodies here we're

190
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:31,860
farm lots of lots of goodies here we're
 

191
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,980
farm lots of lots of goodies here we're
gonna grab probably two stacks maybe

192
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:33,990
gonna grab probably two stacks maybe
 

193
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,170
gonna grab probably two stacks maybe
three okay so first step of our upgrade

194
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:39,180
three okay so first step of our upgrade
 

195
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,340
three okay so first step of our upgrade
here we're gonna replace all these

196
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,350
here we're gonna replace all these
 

197
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,440
here we're gonna replace all these
glowstone lamps we have along the wood

198
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:42,450
glowstone lamps we have along the wood
 

199
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,720
glowstone lamps we have along the wood
here with C lanterns so that we don't

200
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:44,730
here with C lanterns so that we don't
 

201
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,650
here with C lanterns so that we don't
have to have this leaver

202
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:45,660
have to have this leaver
 

203
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,830
have to have this leaver
sticking out all right good stuff so now

204
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
sticking out all right good stuff so now
 

205
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,390
sticking out all right good stuff so now
we're gonna add our mechanism to our

206
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:53,400
we're gonna add our mechanism to our
 

207
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,670
we're gonna add our mechanism to our
farm and I think we could do it pretty

208
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
farm and I think we could do it pretty
 

209
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,770
farm and I think we could do it pretty
simply actually the plan is just to have

210
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:57,780
simply actually the plan is just to have
 

211
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,600
simply actually the plan is just to have
some dispensers running along these wood

212
00:04:59,600 --> 00:04:59,610
some dispensers running along these wood
 

213
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,210
some dispensers running along these wood
beams and we'll fill them up with arrows

214
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:02,220
beams and we'll fill them up with arrows
 

215
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,070
beams and we'll fill them up with arrows
and just shoot them straight up and they

216
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
and just shoot them straight up and they
 

217
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,370
and just shoot them straight up and they
should land on the seeds down below it

218
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:07,380
should land on the seeds down below it
 

219
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,540
should land on the seeds down below it
and this will work pretty good with our

220
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:08,550
and this will work pretty good with our
 

221
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,520
and this will work pretty good with our
existing farm actually it just so

222
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:10,530
existing farm actually it just so
 

223
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,160
existing farm actually it just so
happens between each of these we have a

224
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,170
happens between each of these we have a
 

225
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,220
happens between each of these we have a
one two three four five block space and

226
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,230
one two three four five block space and
 

227
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,710
one two three four five block space and
I think when you shoot an arrow out of a

228
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
I think when you shoot an arrow out of a
 

229
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,860
I think when you shoot an arrow out of a
dispenser like this it will travel

230
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:20,870
dispenser like this it will travel
 

231
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,210
dispenser like this it will travel
horizontally like up to two or three

232
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:23,220
horizontally like up to two or three
 

233
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,760
horizontally like up to two or three
blocks so it kind of works out like it

234
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:25,770
blocks so it kind of works out like it
 

235
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,610
blocks so it kind of works out like it
should reach to about the middle from

236
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:28,620
should reach to about the middle from
 

237
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,860
should reach to about the middle from
here and then on this one will reach to

238
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:30,870
here and then on this one will reach to
 

239
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,720
here and then on this one will reach to
like the middle over here as well so

240
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:32,730
like the middle over here as well so
 

241
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,500
like the middle over here as well so
it'll cover most of the area pretty sure

242
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:36,510
it'll cover most of the area pretty sure
 

243
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,210
it'll cover most of the area pretty sure
cuz when it shoots out of this dispenser

244
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:38,220
cuz when it shoots out of this dispenser
 

245
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,900
cuz when it shoots out of this dispenser
it's gonna have a random angle to it

246
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:40,910
it's gonna have a random angle to it
 

247
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,460
it's gonna have a random angle to it
most of them are gonna land toward the

248
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:43,470
most of them are gonna land toward the
 

249
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,910
most of them are gonna land toward the
center but the odd one's gonna go off

250
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:46,920
center but the odd one's gonna go off
 

251
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,280
center but the odd one's gonna go off
and if it hits a seed that's gonna cause

252
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,290
and if it hits a seed that's gonna cause
 

253
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:53,210
and if it hits a seed that's gonna cause
it to break off aha so we'll probably

254
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:53,220
it to break off aha so we'll probably
 

255
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,950
it to break off aha so we'll probably
have to shoot quite a few arrows though

256
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
have to shoot quite a few arrows though
 

257
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,370
have to shoot quite a few arrows though
like you see how far that one traveled

258
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:57,380
like you see how far that one traveled
 

259
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,330
like you see how far that one traveled
probably have to have quite a few arrows

260
00:05:59,330 --> 00:05:59,340
probably have to have quite a few arrows
 

261
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,830
probably have to have quite a few arrows
flying here so the plan is we'll

262
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:00,840
flying here so the plan is we'll
 

263
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,190
flying here so the plan is we'll
probably put these every two blocks like

264
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:04,200
probably put these every two blocks like
 

265
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,510
probably put these every two blocks like
so we got to have some way

266
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
so we got to have some way
 

267
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,330
so we got to have some way
filling them with arrows and activating

268
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,340
filling them with arrows and activating
 

269
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,170
filling them with arrows and activating
them as well so the plan is have hoppers

270
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,180
them as well so the plan is have hoppers
 

271
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,409
them as well so the plan is have hoppers
running between each of these so that if

272
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:15,419
running between each of these so that if
 

273
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,540
running between each of these so that if
we put the arrows and hoppers they'll go

274
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:17,550
we put the arrows and hoppers they'll go
 

275
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,390
we put the arrows and hoppers they'll go
into the dispenser and then we'll just

276
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
into the dispenser and then we'll just
 

277
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,490
into the dispenser and then we'll just
run some rails over top and doesn't

278
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:25,500
run some rails over top and doesn't
 

279
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,540
run some rails over top and doesn't
matter where we put them yes we probably

280
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:29,550
matter where we put them yes we probably
 

281
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,570
matter where we put them yes we probably
want that it's the activator rail over

282
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:32,580
want that it's the activator rail over
 

283
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,719
want that it's the activator rail over
the dispenser I'm guessing the Spencer's

284
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:35,729
the dispenser I'm guessing the Spencer's
 

285
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,270
the dispenser I'm guessing the Spencer's
are able to shoot through rails and then

286
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,280
are able to shoot through rails and then
 

287
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,309
are able to shoot through rails and then
they'll power the power rails as well

288
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
they'll power the power rails as well
 

289
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,980
they'll power the power rails as well
when the cart goes over top okay

290
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:42,990
when the cart goes over top okay
 

291
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,360
when the cart goes over top okay
everybody so this is a little bit later

292
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,370
everybody so this is a little bit later
 

293
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,670
everybody so this is a little bit later
now I had to stop and and go do some

294
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:46,680
now I had to stop and and go do some
 

295
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,469
now I had to stop and and go do some
mining we were totally out of redstone

296
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
mining we were totally out of redstone
 

297
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,469
mining we were totally out of redstone
again what else is new rights so we got

298
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:51,479
again what else is new rights so we got
 

299
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,580
again what else is new rights so we got
some more redstone a little bit more

300
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:52,590
some more redstone a little bit more
 

301
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,790
some more redstone a little bit more
iron for hoppers and we got this pretty

302
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:55,800
iron for hoppers and we got this pretty
 

303
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,010
iron for hoppers and we got this pretty
much all set up now we're about to test

304
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,020
much all set up now we're about to test
 

305
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,320
much all set up now we're about to test
the doubts so I did it a little bit

306
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,330
the doubts so I did it a little bit
 

307
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,570
the doubts so I did it a little bit
different because the detector rails on

308
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:02,580
different because the detector rails on
 

309
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,300
different because the detector rails on
top where they were was either powering

310
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,310
top where they were was either powering
 

311
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,610
top where they were was either powering
the hopper or the dispenser and was

312
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:07,620
the hopper or the dispenser and was
 

313
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,290
the hopper or the dispenser and was
either not letting the arrows travel

314
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:09,300
either not letting the arrows travel
 

315
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,080
either not letting the arrows travel
through or the dispenser was being bud

316
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,090
through or the dispenser was being bud
 

317
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,860
through or the dispenser was being bud
powered or it just didn't work let's

318
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:15,870
powered or it just didn't work let's
 

319
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,120
powered or it just didn't work let's
leave it at that it didn't work so I

320
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,130
leave it at that it didn't work so I
 

321
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,879
leave it at that it didn't work so I
split the systems so we got the rails to

322
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:19,889
split the systems so we got the rails to
 

323
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,620
split the systems so we got the rails to
deliver the arrows and then we have

324
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:21,630
deliver the arrows and then we have
 

325
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,379
deliver the arrows and then we have
redstone running underneath to activate

326
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:24,389
redstone running underneath to activate
 

327
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:26,600
redstone running underneath to activate
the dispensers and we have full control

328
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:26,610
the dispensers and we have full control
 

329
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,809
the dispensers and we have full control
over both that way and then we're gonna

330
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:29,819
over both that way and then we're gonna
 

331
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,550
over both that way and then we're gonna
have a reservoir of arrows in these

332
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:31,560
have a reservoir of arrows in these
 

333
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,950
have a reservoir of arrows in these
chests and probably oh I am NOT as ready

334
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
chests and probably oh I am NOT as ready
 

335
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,899
chests and probably oh I am NOT as ready
as I thought I was I shouldn't have

336
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:38,909
as I thought I was I shouldn't have
 

337
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,269
as I thought I was I shouldn't have
started recording I thought I had the

338
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:41,279
started recording I thought I had the
 

339
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,839
started recording I thought I had the
Opera mic guards on me there there

340
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:43,849
Opera mic guards on me there there
 

341
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:46,820
Opera mic guards on me there there
uh-huh you know I try to I try to make

342
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:46,830
uh-huh you know I try to I try to make
 

343
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,649
uh-huh you know I try to I try to make
things run smoothly whenever I can but

344
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:48,659
things run smoothly whenever I can but
 

345
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,899
things run smoothly whenever I can but
it doesn't always work okay let's go

346
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:50,909
it doesn't always work okay let's go
 

347
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:54,529
it doesn't always work okay let's go
back up yeah so the plan is get these

348
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:54,539
back up yeah so the plan is get these
 

349
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,360
back up yeah so the plan is get these
going underneath they should fill up

350
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,370
going underneath they should fill up
 

351
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,159
going underneath they should fill up
pretty quick with the arrows yeah look

352
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:58,169
pretty quick with the arrows yeah look
 

353
00:07:58,169 --> 00:07:58,879
pretty quick with the arrows yeah look
at that

354
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:58,889
at that
 

355
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,689
at that
that's great they should also fill these

356
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:02,699
that's great they should also fill these
 

357
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,409
that's great they should also fill these
dispensers pretty quickly I believe so

358
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:06,419
dispensers pretty quickly I believe so
 

359
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,990
dispensers pretty quickly I believe so
we got to get five different lines going

360
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,000
we got to get five different lines going
 

361
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,240
we got to get five different lines going
all right and we'll have to let this run

362
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,250
all right and we'll have to let this run
 

363
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,829
all right and we'll have to let this run
every so often just to refill the

364
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:15,839
every so often just to refill the
 

365
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,439
every so often just to refill the
dispensers but it probably doesn't need

366
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:18,449
dispensers but it probably doesn't need
 

367
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:19,100
dispensers but it probably doesn't need
to happen

368
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,110
to happen
 

369
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,730
to happen
all the time okay so let's go over here

370
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:22,740
all the time okay so let's go over here
 

371
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,740
all the time okay so let's go over here
now slip that switch so let's see the

372
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:27,750
now slip that switch so let's see the
 

373
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,810
now slip that switch so let's see the
first pass how many arrows just one one

374
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:29,820
first pass how many arrows just one one
 

375
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,200
first pass how many arrows just one one
in there oh I was hoping for more should

376
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,210
in there oh I was hoping for more should
 

377
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,490
in there oh I was hoping for more should
be pretty good now I think we'll shut

378
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:34,500
be pretty good now I think we'll shut
 

379
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,530
be pretty good now I think we'll shut
this off so what are they ants we're at

380
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:36,540
this off so what are they ants we're at
 

381
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,440
this off so what are they ants we're at
40 okay so 40 arrows per dispenser I'm

382
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:39,450
40 okay so 40 arrows per dispenser I'm
 

383
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,840
40 okay so 40 arrows per dispenser I'm
guessing we only need like 15 maybe 20

384
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:41,850
guessing we only need like 15 maybe 20
 

385
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,630
guessing we only need like 15 maybe 20
to do a harvest but we'll see here cuz a

386
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
to do a harvest but we'll see here cuz a
 

387
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,550
to do a harvest but we'll see here cuz a
lot of the arrows are gonna miss like

388
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
lot of the arrows are gonna miss like
 

389
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,930
lot of the arrows are gonna miss like
they're not gonna hit the seeds every

390
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:47,940
they're not gonna hit the seeds every
 

391
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,650
they're not gonna hit the seeds every
time but they only need to hit one from

392
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:51,660
time but they only need to hit one from
 

393
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,530
time but they only need to hit one from
each plant really to be successful with

394
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:54,540
each plant really to be successful with
 

395
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,560
each plant really to be successful with
this so yeah we set up a pulsar down

396
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:57,570
this so yeah we set up a pulsar down
 

397
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,950
this so yeah we set up a pulsar down
here and let's just try to do like 10 at

398
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:00,960
here and let's just try to do like 10 at
 

399
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,480
here and let's just try to do like 10 at
first and kind of see how my seeds get

400
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,490
first and kind of see how my seeds get
 

401
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,660
first and kind of see how my seeds get
knocked off wow that happened quickly

402
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:05,670
knocked off wow that happened quickly
 

403
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,220
knocked off wow that happened quickly
all these smokes okay that was pretty

404
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,230
all these smokes okay that was pretty
 

405
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,550
all these smokes okay that was pretty
cool oh yeah that was only 10 Wow okay

406
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:13,560
cool oh yeah that was only 10 Wow okay
 

407
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,170
cool oh yeah that was only 10 Wow okay
there's a lot of arrows that just got

408
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:15,180
there's a lot of arrows that just got
 

409
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,540
there's a lot of arrows that just got
shot I'm seeing lots of seeds that are

410
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:20,550
shot I'm seeing lots of seeds that are
 

411
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,910
shot I'm seeing lots of seeds that are
that are on the ground a lot of them got

412
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:22,920
that are on the ground a lot of them got
 

413
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,870
that are on the ground a lot of them got
knocked off so yeah probably only 15 to

414
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
knocked off so yeah probably only 15 to
 

415
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,850
knocked off so yeah probably only 15 to
20 I'm guessing let's let it run a

416
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:28,860
20 I'm guessing let's let it run a
 

417
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,550
20 I'm guessing let's let it run a
little bit longer and then we'll do a

418
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:31,560
little bit longer and then we'll do a
 

419
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,040
little bit longer and then we'll do a
harvest I feel like that's about 50

420
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,050
harvest I feel like that's about 50
 

421
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,110
harvest I feel like that's about 50
night yeah so I was 15 exactly okay

422
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,120
night yeah so I was 15 exactly okay
 

423
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,390
night yeah so I was 15 exactly okay
so now we're gonna hit the button how

424
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:44,400
so now we're gonna hit the button how
 

425
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,290
so now we're gonna hit the button how
many we got in here

426
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:45,300
many we got in here
 

427
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,120
many we got in here
let's take these all out so it doesn't

428
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,130
let's take these all out so it doesn't
 

429
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,850
let's take these all out so it doesn't
mess up with our results we'll hit the

430
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:49,860
mess up with our results we'll hit the
 

431
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,640
mess up with our results we'll hit the
button it's gonna cause a lot of leg

432
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:52,650
button it's gonna cause a lot of leg
 

433
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,560
button it's gonna cause a lot of leg
because now we have so many entities on

434
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:54,570
because now we have so many entities on
 

435
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,960
because now we have so many entities on
the ground too and I think they get

436
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:56,970
the ground too and I think they get
 

437
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:03,740
the ground too and I think they get
washed by water so oh maybe they don't

438
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:03,750
washed by water so oh maybe they don't
 

439
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,640
washed by water so oh maybe they don't
no okay they all stayed in place just

440
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:07,650
no okay they all stayed in place just
 

441
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,960
no okay they all stayed in place just
the ones that were on the course fruit

442
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:08,970
the ones that were on the course fruit
 

443
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,340
the ones that were on the course fruit
plants you could hear them them dropping

444
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:12,350
plants you could hear them them dropping
 

445
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:19,580
plants you could hear them them dropping
uh-huh alright kill this fool and there

uh-huh alright kill this fool and there
 

447
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,120
uh-huh alright kill this fool and there
goes the water and the seeds should

448
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,130
goes the water and the seeds should
 

449
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,480
goes the water and the seeds should
start funneling up here are you able to

450
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,490
start funneling up here are you able to
 

451
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,000
start funneling up here are you able to
shoot whoa okay

here we're gonna check this thing out it
 

467
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,890
here we're gonna check this thing out it
looks like we need like two and a half

468
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:48,900
looks like we need like two and a half
 

469
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,070
looks like we need like two and a half
stacks to replant I'm just gonna replant

470
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,080
stacks to replant I'm just gonna replant
 

471
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,450
stacks to replant I'm just gonna replant
here and we got just about two and a

472
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:56,460
here and we got just about two and a
 

473
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,310
here and we got just about two and a
half stacks with those 15 arrows shot so

474
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
half stacks with those 15 arrows shot so
 

475
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,560
half stacks with those 15 arrows shot so
we probably want to go to 20 to 25 per

476
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:00,570
we probably want to go to 20 to 25 per
 

477
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,170
we probably want to go to 20 to 25 per
harvest actually arrows from each

478
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,180
harvest actually arrows from each
 

479
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,650
harvest actually arrows from each
dispenser also we got a couple problems

480
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:06,660
dispenser also we got a couple problems
 

481
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,060
dispenser also we got a couple problems
with this thing and this is filling up

482
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,070
with this thing and this is filling up
 

483
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,870
with this thing and this is filling up
with coarse fruits so I think our item

484
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:11,880
with coarse fruits so I think our item
 

485
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,630
with coarse fruits so I think our item
filters got messed up and probably got

486
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
filters got messed up and probably got
 

487
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,610
filters got messed up and probably got
to do with a couple repairs on this this

488
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:16,620
to do with a couple repairs on this this
 

489
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,480
to do with a couple repairs on this this
system can't so that's the coarse fruit

490
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,490
system can't so that's the coarse fruit
 

491
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,290
system can't so that's the coarse fruit
one oh yeah so this is supposed to be

492
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:24,300
one oh yeah so this is supposed to be
 

493
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,340
one oh yeah so this is supposed to be
for coarse flowers somehow the 18 we had

494
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:28,350
for coarse flowers somehow the 18 we had
 

495
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,460
for coarse flowers somehow the 18 we had
in here got removed so got a deal with

496
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:31,470
in here got removed so got a deal with
 

497
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,230
in here got removed so got a deal with
that and let's actually head over to our

498
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,240
that and let's actually head over to our
 

499
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,880
that and let's actually head over to our
smelting area to see if it's making

500
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:34,890
smelting area to see if it's making
 

501
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,420
smelting area to see if it's making
torpor or if that elevator is still

502
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:38,430
torpor or if that elevator is still
 

503
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,210
torpor or if that elevator is still
broken I can't remember so basically we

504
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,220
broken I can't remember so basically we
 

505
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,710
broken I can't remember so basically we
send all the course fruit over to this

506
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
send all the course fruit over to this
 

507
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,440
send all the course fruit over to this
building which is where it's supposed to

508
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:45,450
building which is where it's supposed to
 

509
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,950
building which is where it's supposed to
get smelted in the basement here oh

510
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:47,960
get smelted in the basement here oh
 

511
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,850
get smelted in the basement here oh
they're not running oh okay we have

512
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:52,860
they're not running oh okay we have
 

513
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,840
they're not running oh okay we have
problems all right

514
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:55,850
problems all right
 

515
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,880
problems all right
this farms kind of busted a little bit

516
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:58,890
this farms kind of busted a little bit
 

517
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:03,590
this farms kind of busted a little bit
it looks like I think it's the elevator

518
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
it looks like I think it's the elevator
 

519
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,240
it looks like I think it's the elevator
we put an elevator in this thing and I'm

520
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,250
we put an elevator in this thing and I'm
 

521
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,610
we put an elevator in this thing and I'm
guessing it doesn't work anymore all

522
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:07,620
guessing it doesn't work anymore all
 

523
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,470
guessing it doesn't work anymore all
right

524
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
right
 

525
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,430
right
what kind of elevator it's the old is it

526
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
what kind of elevator it's the old is it
 

527
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,200
what kind of elevator it's the old is it
a redstone this one oh no it's this

528
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,210
a redstone this one oh no it's this
 

529
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,470
a redstone this one oh no it's this
wonky one still I thought I ripped this

530
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:21,480
wonky one still I thought I ripped this
 

531
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,940
wonky one still I thought I ripped this
thing out and replaced it I guess not

532
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:22,950
thing out and replaced it I guess not
 

533
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,800
thing out and replaced it I guess not
okay so this is like a really weird

534
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:24,810
okay so this is like a really weird
 

535
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,400
okay so this is like a really weird
elevator that probably doesn't work at

536
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,410
elevator that probably doesn't work at
 

537
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,050
elevator that probably doesn't work at
all anymore so we can we just got to

538
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:30,060
all anymore so we can we just got to
 

539
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,030
all anymore so we can we just got to
replace this with a bubble stream yeah

540
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,040
replace this with a bubble stream yeah
 

541
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
replace this with a bubble stream yeah
so that old elevator it worked by

542
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,050
so that old elevator it worked by
 

543
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,290
so that old elevator it worked by
sending items through blocks which isn't

544
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:36,300
sending items through blocks which isn't
 

545
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,510
sending items through blocks which isn't
really a thing you can do anymore so we

546
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:38,520
really a thing you can do anymore so we
 

547
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,250
really a thing you can do anymore so we
ripped out all that redstone that you

548
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:40,260
ripped out all that redstone that you
 

549
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,280
ripped out all that redstone that you
saw there that huge contraption and it's

550
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,290
saw there that huge contraption and it's
 

551
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,630
saw there that huge contraption and it's
just been replaced with the bubble

552
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:44,640
just been replaced with the bubble
 

553
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,150
just been replaced with the bubble
stream

554
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,160
stream
 

555
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,930
stream
which is so much simpler let's test it

556
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:48,940
which is so much simpler let's test it
 

557
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,410
which is so much simpler let's test it
out

558
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:49,420
out
 

559
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,750
out
so of course fruits supposed to go in

560
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
so of course fruits supposed to go in
 

561
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,320
so of course fruits supposed to go in
and up yep looks good all right and I

562
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,330
and up yep looks good all right and I
 

563
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,790
and up yep looks good all right and I
think I know what happened with item

564
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
think I know what happened with item
 

565
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,230
think I know what happened with item
filters we're using one of these old

566
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
filters we're using one of these old
 

567
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,420
filters we're using one of these old
styles which I try not to do anymore I

568
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:00,430
styles which I try not to do anymore I
 

569
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,830
styles which I try not to do anymore I
don't know why I built one here

570
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:01,840
don't know why I built one here
 

571
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,500
don't know why I built one here
but the issue if you only have like 18

572
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:04,510
but the issue if you only have like 18
 

573
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,900
but the issue if you only have like 18
items in here and it fills up entirely

574
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:06,910
items in here and it fills up entirely
 

575
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,930
items in here and it fills up entirely
like if it goes to 64 this signal

576
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:09,940
like if it goes to 64 this signal
 

577
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,850
like if it goes to 64 this signal
travels three blocks so one two three

578
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:11,860
travels three blocks so one two three
 

579
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,070
travels three blocks so one two three
and it'll activate the one next to it so

580
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,080
and it'll activate the one next to it so
 

581
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,900
and it'll activate the one next to it so
this item filter caused this one to

582
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:18,910
this item filter caused this one to
 

583
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,790
this item filter caused this one to
shoot out all the items and I think

584
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
shoot out all the items and I think
 

585
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,820
shoot out all the items and I think
that's why it broke before so what we

586
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:23,830
that's why it broke before so what we
 

587
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,310
that's why it broke before so what we
want to do is just expand this to be one

588
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
want to do is just expand this to be one
 

589
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,310
want to do is just expand this to be one
block longer uh-huh yeah so this is a

590
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:29,320
block longer uh-huh yeah so this is a
 

591
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,840
block longer uh-huh yeah so this is a
pretty common trick I'm sure a lot of

592
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:30,850
pretty common trick I'm sure a lot of
 

593
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,310
pretty common trick I'm sure a lot of
you guys already know about it but just

594
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
you guys already know about it but just
 

595
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,720
you guys already know about it but just
in case you don't if you're a little bit

596
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:33,730
in case you don't if you're a little bit
 

597
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,840
in case you don't if you're a little bit
newer to redstone by expanding the item

598
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:36,850
newer to redstone by expanding the item
 

599
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,670
newer to redstone by expanding the item
filter here it makes it a bit bigger

600
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:38,680
filter here it makes it a bit bigger
 

601
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,680
filter here it makes it a bit bigger
which we don't like like this is a bit

602
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:40,690
which we don't like like this is a bit
 

603
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,260
which we don't like like this is a bit
of a trade off it gets a bit bigger and

604
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,270
of a trade off it gets a bit bigger and
 

605
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,270
of a trade off it gets a bit bigger and
we also have to keep 41 items in here

606
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:45,280
we also have to keep 41 items in here
 

607
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,370
we also have to keep 41 items in here
instead of just 18 so that costs a

608
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:47,380
instead of just 18 so that costs a
 

609
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,100
instead of just 18 so that costs a
little bit more as well but the benefit

610
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,110
little bit more as well but the benefit
 

611
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,090
little bit more as well but the benefit
is like if this fills up to a full stack

612
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,100
is like if this fills up to a full stack
 

613
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,710
is like if this fills up to a full stack
we never have to worry about it

614
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:55,720
we never have to worry about it
 

615
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,860
we never have to worry about it
affecting the item filter next to it

616
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:57,870
affecting the item filter next to it
 

617
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,890
affecting the item filter next to it
because it can't go beyond a full stack

618
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:00,900
because it can't go beyond a full stack
 

619
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,360
because it can't go beyond a full stack
and add a full stack it can only travel

620
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,370
and add a full stack it can only travel
 

621
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,740
and add a full stack it can only travel
through blocks that would need to travel

622
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:04,750
through blocks that would need to travel
 

623
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,410
through blocks that would need to travel
for to reach the one next to it which is

624
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:07,420
for to reach the one next to it which is
 

625
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,260
for to reach the one next to it which is
impossible but it's important to note we

626
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,270
impossible but it's important to note we
 

627
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,320
impossible but it's important to note we
have to get rid of these ones in our

628
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,330
have to get rid of these ones in our
 

629
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,730
have to get rid of these ones in our
filter because otherwise we could have

630
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:14,740
filter because otherwise we could have
 

631
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,800
filter because otherwise we could have
up to five stacks in here we need an

632
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:16,810
up to five stacks in here we need an
 

633
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,570
up to five stacks in here we need an
item in there a garbage item that will

634
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:18,580
item in there a garbage item that will
 

635
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,110
item in there a garbage item that will
never go into the hoppers so that it's

636
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,120
never go into the hoppers so that it's
 

637
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,080
never go into the hoppers so that it's
safe so now at most you can only have

638
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,090
safe so now at most you can only have
 

639
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,180
safe so now at most you can only have
one stack course fruit in here at a time

640
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,190
one stack course fruit in here at a time
 

641
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,250
one stack course fruit in here at a time
all right everybody good stuff good

642
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:29,260
all right everybody good stuff good
 

643
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,750
all right everybody good stuff good
stuff so we're about done with this

644
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:30,760
stuff so we're about done with this
 

645
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,730
stuff so we're about done with this
project I'd say we got it fixed up the

646
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:32,740
project I'd say we got it fixed up the
 

647
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,890
project I'd say we got it fixed up the
item filters the elevators are working

648
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:34,900
item filters the elevators are working
 

649
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,910
item filters the elevators are working
now from what I can tell

650
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
now from what I can tell
 

651
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,470
now from what I can tell
and we even upgraded it with the new

652
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:39,480
and we even upgraded it with the new
 

653
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,550
and we even upgraded it with the new
system for not gonna the seeds off

654
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:41,560
system for not gonna the seeds off
 

655
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,200
system for not gonna the seeds off
that's gonna save a lot of time in the

656
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,210
that's gonna save a lot of time in the
 

657
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,060
that's gonna save a lot of time in the
long run because we use quite a bit of

658
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,070
long run because we use quite a bit of
 

659
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,010
long run because we use quite a bit of
perper on our nether tunnels actually

660
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:47,020
perper on our nether tunnels actually
 

661
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,260
perper on our nether tunnels actually
and one thing I'm going to add

662
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:49,270
and one thing I'm going to add
 

663
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,420
and one thing I'm going to add
off-camera here before we're done with

664
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,430
off-camera here before we're done with
 

665
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,130
off-camera here before we're done with
it is just a long delay one of these

666
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:53,140
it is just a long delay one of these
 

667
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,970
it is just a long delay one of these
things to the start of the Pulsar there

668
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:55,980
things to the start of the Pulsar there
 

669
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,680
things to the start of the Pulsar there
so what this is going to do

670
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:58,690
so what this is going to do
 

671
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,990
so what this is going to do
is so I don't have to time how long to

672
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,000
is so I don't have to time how long to
 

673
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,730
is so I don't have to time how long to
pull the lever for I'll just have to

674
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:02,740
pull the lever for I'll just have to
 

675
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,580
pull the lever for I'll just have to
press a button and then it'll shoot

676
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:05,590
press a button and then it'll shoot
 

677
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:09,720
press a button and then it'll shoot
exactly 21 arrows so when we did 15

678
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:09,730
exactly 21 arrows so when we did 15
 

679
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,940
exactly 21 arrows so when we did 15
arrows there we almost got enough seeds

680
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:11,950
arrows there we almost got enough seeds
 

681
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,600
arrows there we almost got enough seeds
back

682
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:12,610
back
 

683
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,580
back
it's a replant it was just a little bit

684
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:14,590
it's a replant it was just a little bit
 

685
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,740
it's a replant it was just a little bit
shy so if we shoot an extra six I'm

686
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:16,750
shy so if we shoot an extra six I'm
 

687
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,110
shy so if we shoot an extra six I'm
pretty sure we'll get enough Plus

688
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
pretty sure we'll get enough Plus
 

689
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,310
pretty sure we'll get enough Plus
probably a little bit extra

690
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
probably a little bit extra
 

691
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,290
probably a little bit extra
all right everybody so we're gonna check

692
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:22,300
all right everybody so we're gonna check
 

693
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,150
all right everybody so we're gonna check
out another cool thing that's been added

694
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
out another cool thing that's been added
 

695
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,570
out another cool thing that's been added
in 1.14 again kind of a subtle change

696
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:27,580
in 1.14 again kind of a subtle change
 

697
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,690
in 1.14 again kind of a subtle change
but it's got big implications here tea

698
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:30,700
but it's got big implications here tea
 

699
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,560
but it's got big implications here tea
and tea now drops all the blocks when it

700
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:34,570
and tea now drops all the blocks when it
 

701
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,140
and tea now drops all the blocks when it
blows something up so I'm doing some

702
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,150
blows something up so I'm doing some
 

703
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,000
blows something up so I'm doing some
testing here like look how much sand we

704
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,010
testing here like look how much sand we
 

705
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,560
testing here like look how much sand we
got from that that's amazing that's

706
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:40,570
got from that that's amazing that's
 

707
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,280
got from that that's amazing that's
awesome

708
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,290
awesome
 

709
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,790
awesome
and of course in order to make TNT you

710
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
and of course in order to make TNT you
 

711
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,190
and of course in order to make TNT you
need sand and gunpowder so in the past

712
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,200
need sand and gunpowder so in the past
 

713
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,060
need sand and gunpowder so in the past
it wasn't really efficient or I don't

714
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,070
it wasn't really efficient or I don't
 

715
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,700
it wasn't really efficient or I don't
think it was at least to use TNT to mine

716
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:53,710
think it was at least to use TNT to mine
 

717
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,280
think it was at least to use TNT to mine
sand it was just a lot quicker to use a

718
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,290
sand it was just a lot quicker to use a
 

719
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,870
sand it was just a lot quicker to use a
shovel but now I've blown up five other

720
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
shovel but now I've blown up five other
 

721
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,120
shovel but now I've blown up five other
pieces besides this just to give an idea

722
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,130
pieces besides this just to give an idea
 

723
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,480
pieces besides this just to give an idea
of how much we're getting and I've been

724
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:06,490
of how much we're getting and I've been
 

725
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,740
of how much we're getting and I've been
trying to do it kind of on a flat area

726
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:07,750
trying to do it kind of on a flat area
 

727
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,690
trying to do it kind of on a flat area
of sand so the first time I did it we

728
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:09,700
of sand so the first time I did it we
 

729
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,900
of sand so the first time I did it we
got 20 sandstone 64 and 1820 sandstone

730
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:12,910
got 20 sandstone 64 and 1820 sandstone
 

731
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:18,030
got 20 sandstone 64 and 1820 sandstone
the second time 64 and 21 64 and 47 64

732
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,040
the second time 64 and 21 64 and 47 64
 

733
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,720
the second time 64 and 21 64 and 47 64
and 41 6447 6451 so we're kind of

734
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:21,730
and 41 6447 6451 so we're kind of
 

735
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,650
and 41 6447 6451 so we're kind of
getting pretty close to close averages

736
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:25,660
getting pretty close to close averages
 

737
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,480
getting pretty close to close averages
here now that's just been like laying

738
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:30,490
here now that's just been like laying
 

739
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,350
here now that's just been like laying
tnt down on a flat surface like so and

740
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:34,360
tnt down on a flat surface like so and
 

741
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,700
tnt down on a flat surface like so and
then lighting it that's kind of the

742
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:35,710
then lighting it that's kind of the
 

743
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,280
then lighting it that's kind of the
easiest way to place it there's another

744
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,290
easiest way to place it there's another
 

745
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,990
easiest way to place it there's another
way we can do it though which will

746
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
way we can do it though which will
 

747
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,470
way we can do it though which will
probably yield more sands but takes more

748
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:43,480
probably yield more sands but takes more
 

749
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:52,240
probably yield more sands but takes more
set-up time

750
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,250

 

751
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,949

yeah so the other method we can do this

752
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
yeah so the other method we can do this
 

753
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,690
yeah so the other method we can do this
is we can dig a little bit of a hole

754
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:56,700
is we can dig a little bit of a hole
 

755
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,840
is we can dig a little bit of a hole
before we place down the TNT and drop it

756
00:16:59,840 --> 00:16:59,850
before we place down the TNT and drop it
 

757
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,480
before we place down the TNT and drop it
down that way we can take advantage of

758
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:02,490
down that way we can take advantage of
 

759
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,579
down that way we can take advantage of
the top part of the explosion along with

760
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:04,589
the top part of the explosion along with
 

761
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,819
the top part of the explosion along with
the bottom will be more of a sphere that

762
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:07,829
the bottom will be more of a sphere that
 

763
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:11,449
the bottom will be more of a sphere that
gets blown up it seems like we do get

764
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:11,459
gets blown up it seems like we do get
 

765
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,490
gets blown up it seems like we do get
more blocks doing it this way but I

766
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:13,500
more blocks doing it this way but I
 

767
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,290
more blocks doing it this way but I
don't think it's worth the extra time it

768
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:15,300
don't think it's worth the extra time it
 

769
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,410
don't think it's worth the extra time it
takes to dig the hole we also get a lot

770
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:18,420
takes to dig the hole we also get a lot
 

771
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,329
takes to dig the hole we also get a lot
more sandstone and cobblestone in this

772
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:20,339
more sandstone and cobblestone in this
 

773
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,699
more sandstone and cobblestone in this
method which generally you don't want

774
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:22,709
method which generally you don't want
 

775
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,990
method which generally you don't want
you just kind of just want the sand

776
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,000
you just kind of just want the sand
 

777
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,189
you just kind of just want the sand
right I've done a couple explosions now

778
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:28,199
right I've done a couple explosions now
 

779
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,000
right I've done a couple explosions now
to kind of compare so this was our first

780
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,010
to kind of compare so this was our first
 

781
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,770
to kind of compare so this was our first
test we're roughly getting about a

782
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:33,780
test we're roughly getting about a
 

783
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,430
test we're roughly getting about a
hundred sand per explosion give or take

784
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
hundred sand per explosion give or take
 

785
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,820
hundred sand per explosion give or take
right this is the results from this new

786
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:40,830
right this is the results from this new
 

787
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,790
right this is the results from this new
method of digging hole we get pretty

788
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:43,800
method of digging hole we get pretty
 

789
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,590
method of digging hole we get pretty
much the same amount of sand sometimes

790
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
much the same amount of sand sometimes
 

791
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,100
much the same amount of sand sometimes
though we get quite a bit more like over

792
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,110
though we get quite a bit more like over
 

793
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,680
though we get quite a bit more like over
two stacks sandstone over here

794
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:51,690
two stacks sandstone over here
 

795
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,890
two stacks sandstone over here
sandstone over here the rest is sand so

796
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:54,900
sandstone over here the rest is sand so
 

797
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,200
sandstone over here the rest is sand so
we're getting pretty much 100 sand as

798
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,210
we're getting pretty much 100 sand as
 

799
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,040
we're getting pretty much 100 sand as
well but we're getting a lot more

800
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,050
well but we're getting a lot more
 

801
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,310
well but we're getting a lot more
sandstone about 140 blocks compared to

802
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:01,320
sandstone about 140 blocks compared to
 

803
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,080
sandstone about 140 blocks compared to
like 110 we get this way so is it worth

804
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,090
like 110 we get this way so is it worth
 

805
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,169
like 110 we get this way so is it worth
it probably not I think just placing on

806
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:09,179
it probably not I think just placing on
 

807
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,900
it probably not I think just placing on
the surface is a lot easier is it worth

808
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:11,910
the surface is a lot easier is it worth
 

809
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,210
the surface is a lot easier is it worth
it is it efficient way of getting sand

810
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,220
it is it efficient way of getting sand
 

811
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,700
it is it efficient way of getting sand
for making more TNT I think so I think

812
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:16,710
for making more TNT I think so I think
 

813
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,850
for making more TNT I think so I think
this is gonna be the new thing so how do

814
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:19,860
this is gonna be the new thing so how do
 

815
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,320
this is gonna be the new thing so how do
we do it quickly

816
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:21,330
we do it quickly
 

817
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,480
we do it quickly
I just just like this just keeping your

818
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,490
I just just like this just keeping your
 

819
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,810
I just just like this just keeping your
offhand and switch it maybe

820
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:29,820
offhand and switch it maybe
 

821
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,590
offhand and switch it maybe
Oh Oh try not to blow yourself up guy

822
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
Oh Oh try not to blow yourself up guy
 

823
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,889
Oh Oh try not to blow yourself up guy
get into a habit okay let's run through

824
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:36,899
get into a habit okay let's run through
 

825
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:40,009
get into a habit okay let's run through
here and kind of see what we got yeah so

826
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:40,019
here and kind of see what we got yeah so
 

827
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,419
here and kind of see what we got yeah so
the ones that we blow up on the surface

828
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:41,429
the ones that we blow up on the surface
 

829
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:42,769
the ones that we blow up on the surface
they only go like three or four blocks

830
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:42,779
they only go like three or four blocks
 

831
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,899
they only go like three or four blocks
deep in general which kind of makes it

832
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:44,909
deep in general which kind of makes it
 

833
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:46,489
deep in general which kind of makes it
easy as well because we can go from like

834
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:46,499
easy as well because we can go from like
 

835
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:48,710
easy as well because we can go from like
this hole to this one a lot easier it's

836
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
this hole to this one a lot easier it's
 

837
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,710
this hole to this one a lot easier it's
not much of a climb while that other

838
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:51,720
not much of a climb while that other
 

839
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,359
not much of a climb while that other
method was making holes that were like

840
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:53,369
method was making holes that were like
 

841
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:56,509
method was making holes that were like
six or seven blocks deep which are kind

842
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:56,519
six or seven blocks deep which are kind
 

843
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,999
six or seven blocks deep which are kind
of hard to traverse so we're getting

844
00:18:58,999 --> 00:18:59,009
of hard to traverse so we're getting
 

845
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:02,029
of hard to traverse so we're getting
like a hundred or more sand per TNT

846
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:02,039
like a hundred or more sand per TNT
 

847
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,330
like a hundred or more sand per TNT
that's enough to make 25 TNT per TNT

848
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:05,340
that's enough to make 25 TNT per TNT
 

849
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,960
that's enough to make 25 TNT per TNT
right so something that might be worth

850
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:07,970
right so something that might be worth
 

851
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,369
right so something that might be worth
checking out we can be a bit more

852
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:10,379
checking out we can be a bit more
 

853
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:13,249
checking out we can be a bit more
liberal with our TNT use and do like

854
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:13,259
liberal with our TNT use and do like
 

855
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:16,129
liberal with our TNT use and do like
chaos cannons that might actually be a

856
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:16,139
chaos cannons that might actually be a
 

857
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:19,609
chaos cannons that might actually be a
thing if we can get the TNT to spread

858
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:19,619
thing if we can get the TNT to spread
 

859
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:21,619
thing if we can get the TNT to spread
out enough it won't blow up the sand

860
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:21,629
out enough it won't blow up the sand
 

861
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:26,299
out enough it won't blow up the sand
that other TNT creates hopefully let's

862
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:26,309
that other TNT creates hopefully let's
 

863
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:31,070
that other TNT creates hopefully let's
get out of here I'm guessing you only

864
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,080
get out of here I'm guessing you only
 

865
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,169
get out of here I'm guessing you only
wanted like a few blocks above the

866
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:33,179
wanted like a few blocks above the
 

867
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,580
wanted like a few blocks above the
surface that looks like it's spread out

868
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:34,590
surface that looks like it's spread out
 

869
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,070
surface that looks like it's spread out
pretty good

870
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
pretty good
 

871
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,729
pretty good
yeah look at all the sand no good at all

872
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:39,739
yeah look at all the sand no good at all
 

873
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:42,589
yeah look at all the sand no good at all
so that might be a faster way of like

874
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:42,599
so that might be a faster way of like
 

875
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,060
so that might be a faster way of like
covering an area

876
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,070

 

877
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,619

either way though this is gonna be cool

878
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:48,629
either way though this is gonna be cool
 

879
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:50,960
either way though this is gonna be cool
I really like this change one of the

880
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:50,970
I really like this change one of the
 

881
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,180
I really like this change one of the
things I dreaded a lot before was like

882
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,190
things I dreaded a lot before was like
 

883
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,159
things I dreaded a lot before was like
collecting sand for glass and concrete

884
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:55,169
collecting sand for glass and concrete
 

885
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:58,969
collecting sand for glass and concrete
sand more TNT you know now there's a

886
00:19:58,969 --> 00:19:58,979
sand more TNT you know now there's a
 

887
00:19:58,979 --> 00:20:01,940
sand more TNT you know now there's a
method that seems to be quicker and is

888
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:01,950
method that seems to be quicker and is
 

889
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,739
method that seems to be quicker and is
actually fun because we can use TNT to

890
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:03,749
actually fun because we can use TNT to
 

891
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:05,869
actually fun because we can use TNT to
do it so I like that so that's a great

892
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:05,879
do it so I like that so that's a great
 

893
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:08,629
do it so I like that so that's a great
combo and let's check out one more thing

894
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:08,639
combo and let's check out one more thing
 

895
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,700
combo and let's check out one more thing
here this is something I've wanted to do

896
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:10,710
here this is something I've wanted to do
 

897
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,200
here this is something I've wanted to do
for a long time use TNT in the tree farm

898
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,210
for a long time use TNT in the tree farm
 

899
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,089
for a long time use TNT in the tree farm
last time I tried this though it could

900
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:17,099
last time I tried this though it could
 

901
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:18,739
last time I tried this though it could
almost blow up a five by five by five

902
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:18,749
almost blow up a five by five by five
 

903
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:22,609
almost blow up a five by five by five
area but we lost so many blocks that I

904
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:22,619
area but we lost so many blocks that I
 

905
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:24,830
area but we lost so many blocks that I
just never ended up doing it but now

906
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:24,840
just never ended up doing it but now
 

907
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,460
just never ended up doing it but now
this probably is a great way of doing a

908
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:28,470
this probably is a great way of doing a
 

909
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,200
this probably is a great way of doing a
tree farm actually so the idea is we'd

910
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,210
tree farm actually so the idea is we'd
 

911
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,509
tree farm actually so the idea is we'd
probably drop the TNT from a dispenser

912
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:32,519
probably drop the TNT from a dispenser
 

913
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:34,999
probably drop the TNT from a dispenser
above down into the middle use pistons

914
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:35,009
above down into the middle use pistons
 

915
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:37,369
above down into the middle use pistons
to get them all into this position I

916
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:37,379
to get them all into this position I
 

917
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:40,190
to get them all into this position I
should we set up some sand or some dirt

918
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,200
should we set up some sand or some dirt
 

919
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,520
should we set up some sand or some dirt
just to see if it blasts this

920
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:42,530
just to see if it blasts this
 

921
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,410
just to see if it blasts this
because ideally you'd like to have the

922
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:44,420
because ideally you'd like to have the
 

923
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,970
because ideally you'd like to have the
Pistons here that don't get destroyed

924
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:47,980
Pistons here that don't get destroyed
 

925
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,520
Pistons here that don't get destroyed
but that might not be possible it's

926
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:51,530
but that might not be possible it's
 

927
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:57,310
but that might not be possible it's
curious it'll go up the dirt okay we got

928
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,320
curious it'll go up the dirt okay we got
 

929
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,410
curious it'll go up the dirt okay we got
sand underneath so that'll give us an

930
00:20:59,410 --> 00:20:59,420
sand underneath so that'll give us an
 

931
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,560
sand underneath so that'll give us an
idea as well all right

932
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:02,570
idea as well all right
 

933
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,440
idea as well all right
so and that blows up okay so it doesn't

934
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,450
so and that blows up okay so it doesn't
 

935
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,210
so and that blows up okay so it doesn't
do the edges did it blow up any of the

936
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:10,220
do the edges did it blow up any of the
 

937
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,790
do the edges did it blow up any of the
dirts this is fine on the side fine on

938
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:12,800
dirts this is fine on the side fine on
 

939
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,030
dirts this is fine on the side fine on
this side fine on this side yeah so it's

940
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,040
this side fine on this side yeah so it's
 

941
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,680
this side fine on this side yeah so it's
pretty exact actually which is good

942
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:19,690
pretty exact actually which is good
 

943
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,900
pretty exact actually which is good
looks like it doesn't get this row here

944
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:22,910
looks like it doesn't get this row here
 

945
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,510
looks like it doesn't get this row here
though well it took one out one piece

946
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
though well it took one out one piece
 

947
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,020
though well it took one out one piece
out over here one piece out over there

948
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,030
out over here one piece out over there
 

949
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,670
out over here one piece out over there
yeah if I remember right I did this test

950
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:30,680
yeah if I remember right I did this test
 

951
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,890
yeah if I remember right I did this test
like at least 20 times in the past and

952
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:32,900
like at least 20 times in the past and
 

953
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,080
like at least 20 times in the past and
it never would blow up the dirt on the

954
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,090
it never would blow up the dirt on the
 

955
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,430
it never would blow up the dirt on the
edges but let's do it again now in 114

956
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
edges but let's do it again now in 114
 

957
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,470
edges but let's do it again now in 114
and make sure it's still consistent I

958
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:41,480
and make sure it's still consistent I
 

959
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,390
and make sure it's still consistent I
think it always leaves like a 3d cube

960
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:43,400
think it always leaves like a 3d cube
 

961
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,450
think it always leaves like a 3d cube
though after the explosion all the dirts

962
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:46,460
though after the explosion all the dirts
 

963
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,340
though after the explosion all the dirts
fine still that's great and very similar

964
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:51,350
fine still that's great and very similar
 

965
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,230
fine still that's great and very similar
results on this explosion so that's

966
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:53,240
results on this explosion so that's
 

967
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,890
results on this explosion so that's
mining about 70 blocks roughly per TNT

968
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:56,900
mining about 70 blocks roughly per TNT
 

969
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,130
mining about 70 blocks roughly per TNT
which is not bad like that is a lot of

970
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,140
which is not bad like that is a lot of
 

971
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,600
which is not bad like that is a lot of
wood that would take so long to mine

972
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:01,610
wood that would take so long to mine
 

973
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:07,870
wood that would take so long to mine
with your axe 70 blocks oh boy okay this

974
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:07,880
with your axe 70 blocks oh boy okay this
 

975
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,460
with your axe 70 blocks oh boy okay this
is actually a pretty big deal so long

976
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:09,470
is actually a pretty big deal so long
 

977
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,980
is actually a pretty big deal so long
and gone are the days of chopping wood

978
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:11,990
and gone are the days of chopping wood
 

979
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,780
and gone are the days of chopping wood
everybody new tree farms are gonna be

980
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:16,790
everybody new tree farms are gonna be
 

981
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,540
everybody new tree farms are gonna be
amazing in 114 so we're actually on the

982
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:19,550
amazing in 114 so we're actually on the
 

983
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,300
amazing in 114 so we're actually on the
build one right now I guess I went into

984
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,310
build one right now I guess I went into
 

985
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,010
build one right now I guess I went into
creative to play around with it for a

986
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,020
creative to play around with it for a
 

987
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,960
creative to play around with it for a
bit and came up with what I think is a

988
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:25,970
bit and came up with what I think is a
 

989
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,190
bit and came up with what I think is a
pretty awesome idea actually so I got to

990
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,200
pretty awesome idea actually so I got to
 

991
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,680
pretty awesome idea actually so I got to
thinking why bother

992
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:31,690
thinking why bother
 

993
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,670
thinking why bother
like making a whole bunch of piston

994
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:35,680
like making a whole bunch of piston
 

995
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,410
like making a whole bunch of piston
conveyor systems and whatnot to push the

996
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:38,420
conveyor systems and whatnot to push the
 

997
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,000
conveyor systems and whatnot to push the
logs around why don't we just make a

998
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,010
logs around why don't we just make a
 

999
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,930
logs around why don't we just make a
pattern like this and grow spruce trees

1000
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:43,940
pattern like this and grow spruce trees
 

1001
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,620
pattern like this and grow spruce trees
or jungle trees or something right for

1002
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:47,630
or jungle trees or something right for
 

1003
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,820
or jungle trees or something right for
2x2 trees and then leave the middle

1004
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:50,830
2x2 trees and then leave the middle
 

1005
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,400
2x2 trees and then leave the middle
hollow if possible and this is where we

1006
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,410
hollow if possible and this is where we
 

1007
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,260
hollow if possible and this is where we
drop the TNT down

1008
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:56,270
drop the TNT down
 

1009
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,710
drop the TNT down
so I played around with it for a bit and

1010
00:22:59,710 --> 00:22:59,720
so I played around with it for a bit and
 

1011
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,200
so I played around with it for a bit and
I figured out if we go up one two three

1012
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,210
I figured out if we go up one two three
 

1013
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,799
I figured out if we go up one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten

1014
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:05,809
four five six seven eight nine ten
 

1015
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:08,080
four five six seven eight nine ten
counting time with ease oh all right you

1016
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,090
counting time with ease oh all right you
 

1017
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:13,140
counting time with ease oh all right you
guys ready 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

1018
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,150
guys ready 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
 

1019
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:18,160
guys ready 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
21 22 23 24 25 26 guys okay so I'm going

1020
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,170
21 22 23 24 25 26 guys okay so I'm going
 

1021
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,600
21 22 23 24 25 26 guys okay so I'm going
to show you how to build this tree farm

1022
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:19,610
to show you how to build this tree farm
 

1023
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,630
to show you how to build this tree farm
you go up 26 blocks and then you start

1024
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,640
you go up 26 blocks and then you start
 

1025
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,900
you go up 26 blocks and then you start
making your platforms this is where

1026
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:25,910
making your platforms this is where
 

1027
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,490
making your platforms this is where
we're gonna be dropping the TNT down so

1028
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:27,500
we're gonna be dropping the TNT down so
 

1029
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,690
we're gonna be dropping the TNT down so
you want to keep that open yeah so keep

1030
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:31,700
you want to keep that open yeah so keep
 

1031
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,310
you want to keep that open yeah so keep
in mind the spacing matters quite a bit

1032
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:33,320
in mind the spacing matters quite a bit
 

1033
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,560
in mind the spacing matters quite a bit
with this so 26 dirt blocks below us and

1034
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:35,570
with this so 26 dirt blocks below us and
 

1035
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,430
with this so 26 dirt blocks below us and
then the clay here's our 27th and at 27

1036
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:39,440
then the clay here's our 27th and at 27
 

1037
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,560
then the clay here's our 27th and at 27
is where we start with our pistons so

1038
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:41,570
is where we start with our pistons so
 

1039
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,780
is where we start with our pistons so
all along this side all the way up we're

1040
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:43,790
all along this side all the way up we're
 

1041
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,850
all along this side all the way up we're
gonna have pistons and then on this side

1042
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:45,860
gonna have pistons and then on this side
 

1043
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,220
gonna have pistons and then on this side
we're gonna have dispensers with the TNT

1044
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,230
we're gonna have dispensers with the TNT
 

1045
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,610
we're gonna have dispensers with the TNT
in starting one block above the piston

1046
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:51,620
in starting one block above the piston
 

1047
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,530
in starting one block above the piston
all right and then there's just a simple

1048
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:53,540
all right and then there's just a simple
 

1049
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,419
all right and then there's just a simple
pattern we got to do all the repeaters

1050
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:55,429
pattern we got to do all the repeaters
 

1051
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:58,720
pattern we got to do all the repeaters
we place here we set to four all right

1052
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:58,730
we place here we set to four all right
 

1053
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,140
we place here we set to four all right
and then we snake our way up the tower

1054
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,150
and then we snake our way up the tower
 

1055
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:07,120
and then we snake our way up the tower
here so we go like this repeater into

1056
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,130
here so we go like this repeater into
 

1057
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,210
here so we go like this repeater into
redstone into another repeater set that

1058
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:10,220
redstone into another repeater set that
 

1059
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,370
redstone into another repeater set that
to four and then I guess we go up again

1060
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:14,380
to four and then I guess we go up again
 

1061
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:23,980
to four and then I guess we go up again
and then we go back so wire wire had

1062
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:23,990
and then we go back so wire wire had
 

1063
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,990
and then we go back so wire wire had
right place this yes we'll do this okay

1064
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
right place this yes we'll do this okay
 

1065
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,630
right place this yes we'll do this okay
no that's not right I know what I'm

1066
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:31,640
no that's not right I know what I'm
 

1067
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,430
no that's not right I know what I'm
doing everybody don't you worry don't

1068
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
doing everybody don't you worry don't
 

1069
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,030
doing everybody don't you worry don't
you worry double repeater four one two

1070
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:37,040
you worry double repeater four one two
 

1071
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,549
you worry double repeater four one two
three four all right so now we are at

1072
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:39,559
three four all right so now we are at
 

1073
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:42,610
three four all right so now we are at
our next dispenser and I just leave a

1074
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:42,620
our next dispenser and I just leave a
 

1075
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,150
our next dispenser and I just leave a
block there too

1076
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,160
block there too
 

1077
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,549
block there too
okay and then somehow I built this and

1078
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:48,559
okay and then somehow I built this and
 

1079
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,750
okay and then somehow I built this and
creative what like where I could fly

1080
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
creative what like where I could fly
 

1081
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,049
creative what like where I could fly
around so it's much different now try to

1082
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:53,059
around so it's much different now try to
 

1083
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,780
around so it's much different now try to
do it without being able to fly a little

1084
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:55,790
do it without being able to fly a little
 

1085
00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:00,430
do it without being able to fly a little
bit harder okay then that goes to here

1086
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:00,440
bit harder okay then that goes to here
 

1087
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:07,000
bit harder okay then that goes to here
and we do the same pattern for go up

1088
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,010
and we do the same pattern for go up
 

1089
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:12,649
and we do the same pattern for go up
and then redstone repeater and go back

1090
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:12,659
and then redstone repeater and go back
 

1091
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:15,080
and then redstone repeater and go back
and forth back and forth with this all

1092
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,090
and forth back and forth with this all
 

1093
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,690
and forth back and forth with this all
the way up we go up six dispensers and

1094
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:17,700
the way up we go up six dispensers and
 

1095
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,320
the way up we go up six dispensers and
six Pistons uh-huh so this is what it

1096
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,330
six Pistons uh-huh so this is what it
 

1097
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,880
six Pistons uh-huh so this is what it
looks like when one side is done which

1098
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:22,890
looks like when one side is done which
 

1099
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,549
looks like when one side is done which
is zig and zag zig and zag all are all

1100
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:25,559
is zig and zag zig and zag all are all
 

1101
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,500
is zig and zag zig and zag all are all
the way up here six dispenser is high

1102
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:27,510
the way up here six dispenser is high
 

1103
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,500
the way up here six dispenser is high
and then with the Pistons we do the

1104
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:30,510
and then with the Pistons we do the
 

1105
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,590
and then with the Pistons we do the
exact same thing except mirrored on the

1106
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
exact same thing except mirrored on the
 

1107
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,250
exact same thing except mirrored on the
other side so again we go like this

1108
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:37,260
other side so again we go like this
 

1109
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,930
other side so again we go like this
except where the dispenser is we put a

1110
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:38,940
except where the dispenser is we put a
 

1111
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,430
except where the dispenser is we put a
block and there should be the piston

1112
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:40,440
block and there should be the piston
 

1113
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,659
block and there should be the piston
below it okay and then we go over here

1114
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:43,669
below it okay and then we go over here
 

1115
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:47,330
below it okay and then we go over here
repeater we just copy what we have over

1116
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:47,340
repeater we just copy what we have over
 

1117
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:54,100
repeater we just copy what we have over
here basically go up and over all right

1118
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,110
here basically go up and over all right
 

1119
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,360
here basically go up and over all right
redstone dust and hopefully you get the

1120
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:56,370
redstone dust and hopefully you get the
 

1121
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,500
redstone dust and hopefully you get the
idea cuz we're not gonna build the whole

1122
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:57,510
idea cuz we're not gonna build the whole
 

1123
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,850
idea cuz we're not gonna build the whole
thing on camera here I'll take too long

1124
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:00,860
thing on camera here I'll take too long
 

1125
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,630
thing on camera here I'll take too long
and then our piston needs to go right

1126
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
and then our piston needs to go right
 

1127
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,950
and then our piston needs to go right
here I haven't quite figured out how to

1128
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:06,960
here I haven't quite figured out how to
 

1129
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,889
here I haven't quite figured out how to
place it I guess let's go over like this

1130
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:11,899
place it I guess let's go over like this
 

1131
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:14,960
place it I guess let's go over like this
no it's still faced up well if we place

1132
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:14,970
no it's still faced up well if we place
 

1133
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,730
no it's still faced up well if we place
it like right in the corner there we go

1134
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:16,740
it like right in the corner there we go
 

1135
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,490
it like right in the corner there we go
that we figured it out okay so the block

1136
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:19,500
that we figured it out okay so the block
 

1137
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,480
that we figured it out okay so the block
goes above rights done up here repeaters

1138
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:23,490
goes above rights done up here repeaters
 

1139
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,350
goes above rights done up here repeaters
all set to 4 all the way up okay so we

1140
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,360
all set to 4 all the way up okay so we
 

1141
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,330
all set to 4 all the way up okay so we
got both sides done now and they're

1142
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:29,340
got both sides done now and they're
 

1143
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,330
got both sides done now and they're
basically a mirrors of each other so now

1144
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:32,340
basically a mirrors of each other so now
 

1145
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,310
basically a mirrors of each other so now
the way this works the piston is gonna

1146
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,320
the way this works the piston is gonna
 

1147
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,889
the way this works the piston is gonna
be extended and then this shoots the TNT

1148
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:36,899
be extended and then this shoots the TNT
 

1149
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:39,980
be extended and then this shoots the TNT
on top of the piston head which holds it

1150
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:39,990
on top of the piston head which holds it
 

1151
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,419
on top of the piston head which holds it
for a short amount of time and then

1152
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:41,429
for a short amount of time and then
 

1153
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:44,360
for a short amount of time and then
releases it now we got to make sure the

1154
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:44,370
releases it now we got to make sure the
 

1155
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,539
releases it now we got to make sure the
TNT stays centered though so we need to

1156
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:47,549
TNT stays centered though so we need to
 

1157
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:49,580
TNT stays centered though so we need to
have blocks on the sides here as well

1158
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:49,590
have blocks on the sides here as well
 

1159
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,580
have blocks on the sides here as well
which can be anything I'm gonna use

1160
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:52,590
which can be anything I'm gonna use
 

1161
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,820
which can be anything I'm gonna use
glass for this I guess I'll stack all

1162
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:55,830
glass for this I guess I'll stack all
 

1163
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,330
glass for this I guess I'll stack all
the way up so that no TNT shoots

1164
00:26:59,330 --> 00:26:59,340
the way up so that no TNT shoots
 

1165
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,049
the way up so that no TNT shoots
sideways here mm-hmm

1166
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:03,059
sideways here mm-hmm
 

1167
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,820
sideways here mm-hmm
so we've pretty much got the the main

1168
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:04,830
so we've pretty much got the the main
 

1169
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,919
so we've pretty much got the the main
core of this tree farm working that's

1170
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:06,929
core of this tree farm working that's
 

1171
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,210
core of this tree farm working that's
all we're going to do today like there's

1172
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:08,220
all we're going to do today like there's
 

1173
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,130
all we're going to do today like there's
a lot of extra features we could add to

1174
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:10,140
a lot of extra features we could add to
 

1175
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,810
a lot of extra features we could add to
make this nicer but I'll just show you

1176
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:11,820
make this nicer but I'll just show you
 

1177
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,299
make this nicer but I'll just show you
the the basic idea to it today cuz we're

1178
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:14,309
the the basic idea to it today cuz we're
 

1179
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:17,690
the the basic idea to it today cuz we're
almost out of time so we want to invert

1180
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:17,700
almost out of time so we want to invert
 

1181
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,289
almost out of time so we want to invert
the signal here and we need five

1182
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:21,299
the signal here and we need five
 

1183
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,499
the signal here and we need five
Peters I think we can get rid of this

1184
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:23,509
Peters I think we can get rid of this
 

1185
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:26,659
Peters I think we can get rid of this
put redstone dust there instead set all

1186
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:26,669
put redstone dust there instead set all
 

1187
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:32,810
put redstone dust there instead set all
these to four oops redstone dust there

1188
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:32,820
these to four oops redstone dust there
 

1189
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,549
these to four oops redstone dust there
to connect them and then leave this one

1190
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:34,559
to connect them and then leave this one
 

1191
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,830
to connect them and then leave this one
at one I guess I think that's the right

1192
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:36,840
at one I guess I think that's the right
 

1193
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,009
at one I guess I think that's the right
timing will make sure here though and

1194
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:40,019
timing will make sure here though and
 

1195
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:42,769
timing will make sure here though and
that's all all the redstone stuff you

1196
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:42,779
that's all all the redstone stuff you
 

1197
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,539
that's all all the redstone stuff you
need for this really we'll throw a lever

1198
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:44,549
need for this really we'll throw a lever
 

1199
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:47,600
need for this really we'll throw a lever
here for controlling it so the idea is

1200
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:47,610
here for controlling it so the idea is
 

1201
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,009
here for controlling it so the idea is
when we pull this lever it's gonna

1202
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:49,019
when we pull this lever it's gonna
 

1203
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:52,639
when we pull this lever it's gonna
activate the TNT dispensers and then

1204
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:52,649
activate the TNT dispensers and then
 

1205
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:56,419
activate the TNT dispensers and then
like 20 ticks later the Pistons retract

1206
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:56,429
like 20 ticks later the Pistons retract
 

1207
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:58,519
like 20 ticks later the Pistons retract
and it drops the TNT down one after

1208
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:58,529
and it drops the TNT down one after
 

1209
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:00,229
and it drops the TNT down one after
another starting from the bottom to the

1210
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:00,239
another starting from the bottom to the
 

1211
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:03,470
another starting from the bottom to the
top and now that that's done I think

1212
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:03,480
top and now that that's done I think
 

1213
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,419
top and now that that's done I think
we're about ready to try it out here so

1214
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:05,429
we're about ready to try it out here so
 

1215
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:07,099
we're about ready to try it out here so
let's let's do that we gotta grow some

1216
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:07,109
let's let's do that we gotta grow some
 

1217
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:09,379
let's let's do that we gotta grow some
trees so we'll go with spruce saplings

1218
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:09,389
trees so we'll go with spruce saplings
 

1219
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:12,470
trees so we'll go with spruce saplings
for this test so we do something like

1220
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:12,480
for this test so we do something like
 

1221
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,930
for this test so we do something like
this and the nice thing is the way these

1222
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:14,940
this and the nice thing is the way these
 

1223
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,299
this and the nice thing is the way these
trees are positioned we never have to

1224
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:17,309
trees are positioned we never have to
 

1225
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:20,269
trees are positioned we never have to
worry about like this tree merging with

1226
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:20,279
worry about like this tree merging with
 

1227
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:20,869
worry about like this tree merging with
this one

1228
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:20,879
this one
 

1229
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:22,399
this one
like sometimes that happens when you do

1230
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:22,409
like sometimes that happens when you do
 

1231
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:27,080
like sometimes that happens when you do
a four by four tree area but should be

1232
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,090
a four by four tree area but should be
 

1233
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,539
a four by four tree area but should be
perfectly fine with this so you grow

1234
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:29,549
perfectly fine with this so you grow
 

1235
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:33,080
perfectly fine with this so you grow
that this one and again like there's

1236
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,090
that this one and again like there's
 

1237
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,460
that this one and again like there's
lots of cool things you'd add for this

1238
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:34,470
lots of cool things you'd add for this
 

1239
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,200
lots of cool things you'd add for this
dispensers with bonemeal in to

1240
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,210
dispensers with bonemeal in to
 

1241
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,399
dispensers with bonemeal in to
automatically grow them one big thing

1242
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:40,409
automatically grow them one big thing
 

1243
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:42,649
automatically grow them one big thing
with this that's gonna be really

1244
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:42,659
with this that's gonna be really
 

1245
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:44,659
with this that's gonna be really
important though we have to fly to the

1246
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:44,669
important though we have to fly to the
 

1247
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:47,259
important though we have to fly to the
top of it or go to the top of it and

1248
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:47,269
top of it or go to the top of it and
 

1249
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:49,729
top of it or go to the top of it and
shear out the middle we got to remove

1250
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:49,739
shear out the middle we got to remove
 

1251
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:53,479
shear out the middle we got to remove
the core so that the TNT is free to drop

1252
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:53,489
the core so that the TNT is free to drop
 

1253
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:54,649
the core so that the TNT is free to drop
down because it's gonna be full of

1254
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:54,659
down because it's gonna be full of
 

1255
00:28:54,659 --> 00:29:00,200
down because it's gonna be full of
leaves all the way so probably set up

1256
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,210
leaves all the way so probably set up
 

1257
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,960
leaves all the way so probably set up
like a bubble stream elevator next to

1258
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:02,970
like a bubble stream elevator next to
 

1259
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,080
like a bubble stream elevator next to
this that brings us to the top we share

1260
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,090
this that brings us to the top we share
 

1261
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,700
this that brings us to the top we share
our way down and then put like a button

1262
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:07,710
our way down and then put like a button
 

1263
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,690
our way down and then put like a button
down here to activate it ideally but we

1264
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:11,700
down here to activate it ideally but we
 

1265
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,489
down here to activate it ideally but we
don't have that setup nut right now this

1266
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:13,499
don't have that setup nut right now this
 

1267
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,320
don't have that setup nut right now this
is just the rough thing so we got to fly

1268
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,330
is just the rough thing so we got to fly
 

1269
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,470
is just the rough thing so we got to fly
up there to pull that lever so it's not

1270
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
up there to pull that lever so it's not
 

1271
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,320
up there to pull that lever so it's not
fancy at all but it should work I think

1272
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,330
fancy at all but it should work I think
 

1273
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,149
fancy at all but it should work I think
I put TNT in all of these and it's gonna

1274
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:26,159
I put TNT in all of these and it's gonna
 

1275
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,639
I put TNT in all of these and it's gonna
use 60 per harvest so hopefully I do

1276
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:31,649
use 60 per harvest so hopefully I do
 

1277
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:33,109
use 60 per harvest so hopefully I do
anything wrong hopefully we don't blow

1278
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:33,119
anything wrong hopefully we don't blow
 

1279
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,640
anything wrong hopefully we don't blow
it up

1280
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:34,650
it up
 

1281
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,220
it up
that go from a distance to check it out

1282
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,230
that go from a distance to check it out
 

1283
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,500
that go from a distance to check it out
so it starts from the bottom and works

1284
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:42,510
so it starts from the bottom and works
 

1285
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,110
so it starts from the bottom and works
its way up and you see that a little

1286
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,120
its way up and you see that a little
 

1287
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,010
its way up and you see that a little
timing between its to allow all the

1288
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:49,020
timing between its to allow all the
 

1289
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,040
timing between its to allow all the
drops to fall down without getting blown

1290
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,050
drops to fall down without getting blown
 

1291
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,890
drops to fall down without getting blown
up by the TNT because if you it went

1292
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:54,900
up by the TNT because if you it went
 

1293
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,360
up by the TNT because if you it went
boom boom boom boom boom

1294
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:56,370
boom boom boom boom boom
 

1295
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,520
boom boom boom boom boom
most of the drops would get exploded but

1296
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:58,530
most of the drops would get exploded but
 

1297
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,080
most of the drops would get exploded but
this gives it time to fall with the

1298
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,090
this gives it time to fall with the
 

1299
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,590
this gives it time to fall with the
gravity and I guess let's see what we

1300
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:03,600
gravity and I guess let's see what we
 

1301
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,920
gravity and I guess let's see what we
get here now it doesn't do a perfect job

1302
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:06,930
get here now it doesn't do a perfect job
 

1303
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,640
get here now it doesn't do a perfect job
either but it's pretty close

1304
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:10,650
either but it's pretty close
 

1305
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,260
either but it's pretty close
let's throw away our saplings too

1306
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:12,270
let's throw away our saplings too
 

1307
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,360
let's throw away our saplings too
because I'm curious about that we need

1308
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:14,370
because I'm curious about that we need
 

1309
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:27,670
because I'm curious about that we need
at least 16 we're pretty good here a

1310
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:27,680
at least 16 we're pretty good here a
 

1311
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,430
at least 16 we're pretty good here a
little bit more up there some fell in

1312
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
little bit more up there some fell in
 

1313
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,260
little bit more up there some fell in
the middle we could set up a system for

1314
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,270
the middle we could set up a system for
 

1315
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,910
the middle we could set up a system for
automatically picking up the stuff like

1316
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:34,920
automatically picking up the stuff like
 

1317
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,560
automatically picking up the stuff like
maybe the hopper minecart or something

1318
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:36,570
maybe the hopper minecart or something
 

1319
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,750
maybe the hopper minecart or something
underneath running there's a few leaves

1320
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:38,760
underneath running there's a few leaves
 

1321
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,700
underneath running there's a few leaves
left over that will despawn over time if

1322
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:40,710
left over that will despawn over time if
 

1323
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,700
left over that will despawn over time if
we leave them and you'll have a few

1324
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:43,710
we leave them and you'll have a few
 

1325
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,470
we leave them and you'll have a few
pieces of wood left over and midair

1326
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:45,480
pieces of wood left over and midair
 

1327
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,420
pieces of wood left over and midair
that's perfectly fine as well we'll

1328
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:47,430
that's perfectly fine as well we'll
 

1329
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,800
that's perfectly fine as well we'll
still be able to grow the next set of

1330
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:48,810
still be able to grow the next set of
 

1331
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,060
still be able to grow the next set of
trees and they'll just grow through

1332
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,070
trees and they'll just grow through
 

1333
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,070
trees and they'll just grow through
whatever's left that didn't get cleared

1334
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,080
whatever's left that didn't get cleared
 

1335
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,010
whatever's left that didn't get cleared
out so we got just about four stacks of

1336
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,020
out so we got just about four stacks of
 

1337
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,020
out so we got just about four stacks of
wood there and 18 saplings so that's

1338
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,030
wood there and 18 saplings so that's
 

1339
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,760
wood there and 18 saplings so that's
that's good to go probably set up some

1340
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:00,770
that's good to go probably set up some
 

1341
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,760
that's good to go probably set up some
Pistons to move these last couple pieces

1342
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:04,770
Pistons to move these last couple pieces
 

1343
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,090
Pistons to move these last couple pieces
of logs that don't get moved right but

1344
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:08,100
of logs that don't get moved right but
 

1345
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,920
of logs that don't get moved right but
we can just chop them away - it's fine

1346
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:09,930
we can just chop them away - it's fine
 

1347
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:14,000
we can just chop them away - it's fine
and get started on the next batch and

1348
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,010
and get started on the next batch and
 

1349
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,620
and get started on the next batch and
yeah that's kind of the idea behind it I

1350
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:15,630
yeah that's kind of the idea behind it I
 

1351
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,830
yeah that's kind of the idea behind it I
think it's gonna be really cool

1352
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:18,840
think it's gonna be really cool
 

1353
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,710
think it's gonna be really cool
really convenient really quick and like

1354
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:21,720
really convenient really quick and like
 

1355
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,090
really convenient really quick and like
the great thing about this is you could

1356
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:23,100
the great thing about this is you could
 

1357
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,520
the great thing about this is you could
set this up pretty quickly in a new

1358
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:25,530
set this up pretty quickly in a new
 

1359
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,400
set this up pretty quickly in a new
world like it only costs a few stacks of

1360
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:28,410
world like it only costs a few stacks of
 

1361
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:32,270
world like it only costs a few stacks of
redstone right there's hardly any

1362
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:32,280
redstone right there's hardly any
 

1363
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,640
redstone right there's hardly any
Pistons in it so it's not gonna use a

1364
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:34,650
Pistons in it so it's not gonna use a
 

1365
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,190
Pistons in it so it's not gonna use a
whole bunch of iron you just need a

1366
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,200
whole bunch of iron you just need a
 

1367
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,780
whole bunch of iron you just need a
source of TNT though it's kind of the

1368
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:38,790
source of TNT though it's kind of the
 

1369
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:43,820
source of TNT though it's kind of the
problem

1370
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,830

 

1371
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,880

all right and we go for the next round

1372
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:46,890
all right and we go for the next round
 

1373
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,690
all right and we go for the next round
sometimes the trees are taller than

1374
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:48,700
sometimes the trees are taller than
 

1375
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,140
sometimes the trees are taller than
other times as well this time if they

1376
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,150
other times as well this time if they
 

1377
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,490
other times as well this time if they
weren't quite as tall so we didn't get

1378
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:53,500
weren't quite as tall so we didn't get
 

1379
00:31:53,500 --> 00:32:00,120
weren't quite as tall so we didn't get
as much wood oh we're fine and you'll

1380
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,130
as much wood oh we're fine and you'll
 

1381
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:04,320
as much wood oh we're fine and you'll
notice none of the dirt got blown off

1382
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:04,330
notice none of the dirt got blown off
 

1383
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,940
notice none of the dirt got blown off
that's really important so all this

1384
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:05,950
that's really important so all this
 

1385
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,250
that's really important so all this
puzzles still here

1386
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:07,260
puzzles still here
 

1387
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,360
puzzles still here
all right everybody well I think we'll

1388
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,370
all right everybody well I think we'll
 

1389
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,460
all right everybody well I think we'll
have to wrap up for today's episode I'll

1390
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:11,470
have to wrap up for today's episode I'll
 

1391
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,960
have to wrap up for today's episode I'll
try getting the more done on that tree

1392
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:12,970
try getting the more done on that tree
 

1393
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,550
try getting the more done on that tree
farm for next time though we'll check

1394
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:14,560
farm for next time though we'll check
 

1395
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,100
farm for next time though we'll check
out some extra features try to make it a

1396
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,110
out some extra features try to make it a
 

1397
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,620
out some extra features try to make it a
little nicer to use but for now we're

1398
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:19,630
little nicer to use but for now we're
 

1399
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,060
little nicer to use but for now we're
gonna read the comment of the day in the

1400
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,070
gonna read the comment of the day in the
 

1401
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,670
gonna read the comment of the day in the
finish up here it says hey etho are you

1402
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:23,680
finish up here it says hey etho are you
 

1403
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,700
finish up here it says hey etho are you
doing okay for some reason your voice

1404
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:26,710
doing okay for some reason your voice
 

1405
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,260
doing okay for some reason your voice
