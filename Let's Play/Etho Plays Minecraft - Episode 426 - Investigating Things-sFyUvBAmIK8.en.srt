this giant island in the way I could
 

59
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,109
this giant island in the way I could
just light it up and that will stop mobs

60
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
just light it up and that will stop mobs
 

61
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,270
just light it up and that will stop mobs
from spawning on it but I think I want

62
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
from spawning on it but I think I want
 

63
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,770
from spawning on it but I think I want
to blow it up so we might do that today

64
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:24,780
to blow it up so we might do that today

installed right here
okay look how convenient that is it's

82
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:56,189
okay look how convenient that is it's

85
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,149
amazing okay so I just want to show you
how I ended up doing this after we

86
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
how I ended up doing this after we
 

87
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,350
how I ended up doing this after we
played around with it a bunch last

88
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
played around with it a bunch last
 

89
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,130
played around with it a bunch last
episode so I decided to fill it in on

90
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:07,140
episode so I decided to fill it in on
 

91
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,360
episode so I decided to fill it in on
the sides and then these dispensers

92
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,370
the sides and then these dispensers
 

93
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,090
the sides and then these dispensers
shoot the arrows that push the

94
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:13,100
shoot the arrows that push the
 

95
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,340
shoot the arrows that push the
which is off the edges here and they

96
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:15,350
which is off the edges here and they
 

97
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,660
which is off the edges here and they
fall down and you can see I got some

98
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:16,670
fall down and you can see I got some
 

99
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,460
fall down and you can see I got some
hoppers right at the bottom down there

100
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:18,470
hoppers right at the bottom down there
 

101
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,320
hoppers right at the bottom down there
so they should die from fall damage

102
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,330
so they should die from fall damage
 

103
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,310
so they should die from fall damage
would collect the drops and that'll work

104
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:23,320
would collect the drops and that'll work
 

105
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,200
would collect the drops and that'll work
as a very basic mob form right now we

106
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,210
as a very basic mob form right now we
 

107
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,830
as a very basic mob form right now we
can add more on to it though later but I

108
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
can add more on to it though later but I
 

109
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,530
can add more on to it though later but I
was worried about filling in the sides

110
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:32,540
was worried about filling in the sides
 

111
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,490
was worried about filling in the sides
before because if you do that I thought

112
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:36,500
before because if you do that I thought
 

113
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,320
before because if you do that I thought
it would be crease mob spawn rates oh

114
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,330
it would be crease mob spawn rates oh
 

115
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,060
it would be crease mob spawn rates oh
hello

116
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,070

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,150
now okay yeah so I decided to fill in
 

123
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,340

the sides there I was worried about

124
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:48,350
the sides there I was worried about
 

125
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,080
the sides there I was worried about
doing that last episode but then I saw

126
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,090
doing that last episode but then I saw
 

127
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,090
doing that last episode but then I saw
in the comments a lot of you guys said

128
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,100
in the comments a lot of you guys said
 

129
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,330
in the comments a lot of you guys said
that's the whole checking 20 blocks away

130
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:55,340
that's the whole checking 20 blocks away
 

131
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,600
that's the whole checking 20 blocks away
from a spawn location no longer was a

132
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:58,610
from a spawn location no longer was a
 

133
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,810
from a spawn location no longer was a
thing in Minecraft 1.9 so basically like

134
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:01,820
thing in Minecraft 1.9 so basically like
 

135
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,250
thing in Minecraft 1.9 so basically like
if you're trying to spawn a mob on a

136
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,260
if you're trying to spawn a mob on a
 

137
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,890
if you're trying to spawn a mob on a
dirt block over here it's gonna check at

138
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:05,900
dirt block over here it's gonna check at
 

139
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,120
dirt block over here it's gonna check at
this height up to 20 blocks all around

140
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,130
this height up to 20 blocks all around
 

141
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:14,710
this height up to 20 blocks all around
it for air spaces and if those are

142
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
it for air spaces and if those are
 

143
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,660
it for air spaces and if those are
blocked with blocks then there's a

144
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:16,670
blocked with blocks then there's a
 

145
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,040
blocked with blocks then there's a
chance it's not going to spawn the mob

146
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,050
chance it's not going to spawn the mob
 

147
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,500
chance it's not going to spawn the mob
in from what I understood before anyway

148
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:20,510
in from what I understood before anyway
 

149
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,050
in from what I understood before anyway
I never actually looked into the game

150
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,060
I never actually looked into the game
 

151
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,930
I never actually looked into the game
code but that's what a few people said

152
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:24,940
code but that's what a few people said
 

153
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,320
code but that's what a few people said
um so yeah they changed that at 1.9 a

154
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,330
um so yeah they changed that at 1.9 a

rumors
 

163
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,720
rumors
so I created a little testing in a

164
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:37,730
so I created a little testing in a
 

165
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,920
so I created a little testing in a
creative world here and we'll go check

166
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:38,930
creative world here and we'll go check
 

167
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,160
creative world here and we'll go check
that out now here let's do our fancy

168
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,170
that out now here let's do our fancy
 

169
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,450
that out now here let's do our fancy
teleports to the creative world okay

170
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:46,460
teleports to the creative world okay
 

171
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,030
teleports to the creative world okay
guys so here we are in a creative world

172
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
guys so here we are in a creative world
 

173
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,470
guys so here we are in a creative world
where I'm doing an experiment that's

174
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
where I'm doing an experiment that's
 

175
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,630
where I'm doing an experiment that's
been running for probably an hour to

176
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
been running for probably an hour to
 

177
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,020
been running for probably an hour to
actually um so I got to spawning

178
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,030
actually um so I got to spawning
 

179
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,170
actually um so I got to spawning
platforms set up down there that one has

180
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,180
platforms set up down there that one has
 

181
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,630
platforms set up down there that one has
no block surrounding it that one has

182
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:01,640
no block surrounding it that one has
 

183
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,730
no block surrounding it that one has
three layers of blocks surrounding the

184
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:03,740
three layers of blocks surrounding the
 

185
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,430
three layers of blocks surrounding the
platform they're the same size as the

186
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:06,440
platform they're the same size as the
 

187
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,870
platform they're the same size as the
witch farm as well there are seven by

188
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:07,880
witch farm as well there are seven by
 

189
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,590
witch farm as well there are seven by
nine so previously this one should spawn

190
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:11,600
nine so previously this one should spawn
 

191
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,660
nine so previously this one should spawn
less mobs because there's less air

192
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:13,670
less mobs because there's less air
 

193
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,110
less mobs because there's less air
surrounding it and I was just testing to

194
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
surrounding it and I was just testing to
 

195
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,930
surrounding it and I was just testing to
see if that's still true and you can see

196
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:19,940
see if that's still true and you can see
 

197
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,670
see if that's still true and you can see
on our scoreboard here this is kind of

198
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
on our scoreboard here this is kind of
 

199
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,000
on our scoreboard here this is kind of
the important thing the less air one is

200
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,010
the important thing the less air one is
 

201
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,650
the important thing the less air one is
that one and the

202
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:26,660
that one and the
 

203
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,640
that one and the
are one is that one and this one

204
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:29,650
are one is that one and this one
 

205
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,660
are one is that one and this one
currently in the lead but I suspect

206
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:31,670
currently in the lead but I suspect
 

207
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,770
currently in the lead but I suspect
that's just due to inconsistencies and

208
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:35,780
that's just due to inconsistencies and
 

209
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,840
that's just due to inconsistencies and
probability around a hundred they were

210
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:37,850
probability around a hundred they were
 

211
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,360
probability around a hundred they were
both equal and then less air kind of

212
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,370
both equal and then less air kind of
 

213
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,200
both equal and then less air kind of
pulled ahead but in the past like in one

214
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,210
pulled ahead but in the past like in one
 

215
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,550
pulled ahead but in the past like in one
point eight and before you would have

216
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:45,560
point eight and before you would have
 

217
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,720
point eight and before you would have
expected this one to spawn way more mobs

218
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:48,730
expected this one to spawn way more mobs
 

219
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,400
expected this one to spawn way more mobs
which isn't happening anymore so it

220
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,410
which isn't happening anymore so it
 

221
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,460
which isn't happening anymore so it
seems to be true let's just go down and

222
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,470
seems to be true let's just go down and
 

223
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,060
seems to be true let's just go down and
look at it closer to - no not game-mode

224
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,070
look at it closer to - no not game-mode
 

225
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,630
look at it closer to - no not game-mode
0 that's how you kill yourself I want to

226
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:01,640
0 that's how you kill yourself I want to
 

227
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,590
0 that's how you kill yourself I want to
change the time time set zero there we

228
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
change the time time set zero there we
 

229
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,280
change the time time set zero there we
go okay yeah so exact same number of

230
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,290
go okay yeah so exact same number of
 

231
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,350
go okay yeah so exact same number of
spawning spaces inside this one just has

232
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
spawning spaces inside this one just has
 

233
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,780
spawning spaces inside this one just has
three blocks surrounding it which would

234
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:13,790
three blocks surrounding it which would
 

235
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,390
three blocks surrounding it which would
made a big difference before this is the

236
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
made a big difference before this is the
 

237
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,280
made a big difference before this is the
command blocks I have I have running to

238
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,290
command blocks I have I have running to
 

239
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,010
command blocks I have I have running to
to make this work so it checks if

240
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,020
to make this work so it checks if
 

241
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,290
to make this work so it checks if
there's a mob on the platform if there

242
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:23,300
there's a mob on the platform if there
 

243
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,210
there's a mob on the platform if there
is it increases the score by one and

244
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,220
is it increases the score by one and
 

245
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,670
is it increases the score by one and
then teleports it into the void to kill

246
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
then teleports it into the void to kill
 

247
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,290
then teleports it into the void to kill
it okay well anyways guys hopefully that

248
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:32,300
it okay well anyways guys hopefully that
 

249
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,090
it okay well anyways guys hopefully that
was clear enough and I didn't ramble too

250
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,100
was clear enough and I didn't ramble too
 

251
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,190
was clear enough and I didn't ramble too
much basically it doesn't seem to matter

252
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:36,200
much basically it doesn't seem to matter
 

253
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,560
much basically it doesn't seem to matter
if you build next year spawning

254
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:38,570
if you build next year spawning
 

255
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,930
if you build next year spawning
platforms in 1.9 so that's why I filled

256
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:40,940
platforms in 1.9 so that's why I filled
 

257
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,080
platforms in 1.9 so that's why I filled
it all in oh there goes and we're doing

258
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,090
it all in oh there goes and we're doing
 

259
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,960
it all in oh there goes and we're doing
our first test guys oh that's so cool so

260
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:49,970
our first test guys oh that's so cool so
 

261
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,600
our first test guys oh that's so cool so
I put only like 16 spectral arrows in

262
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:52,610
I put only like 16 spectral arrows in
 

263
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,850
I put only like 16 spectral arrows in
each of the dispensers and every time at

264
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:54,860
each of the dispensers and every time at
 

265
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,100
each of the dispensers and every time at
which spawns we can clearly see it which

266
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,110
which spawns we can clearly see it which
 

267
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,130
which spawns we can clearly see it which
is really cool although it looks like

268
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,140
is really cool although it looks like
 

269
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,500
is really cool although it looks like
they're despawning quickly I just read a

270
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:02,510
they're despawning quickly I just read a
 

271
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:10,300
they're despawning quickly I just read a
range yeah they're not actually falling

272
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,310
range yeah they're not actually falling
 

273
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,590
range yeah they're not actually falling
down and hitting the hoppers I don't

274
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
down and hitting the hoppers I don't
 

275
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,300
down and hitting the hoppers I don't
think I think they'd the spawn despawn

276
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:13,310
think I think they'd the spawn despawn
 

277
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,440
think I think they'd the spawn despawn
before that happens

278
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:16,450

 

279
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,240

uh-huh so basically I'm gonna have to

280
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,250
uh-huh so basically I'm gonna have to
 

281
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,950
uh-huh so basically I'm gonna have to
light up the caves for us to use this

282
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
light up the caves for us to use this
 

283
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,690
light up the caves for us to use this
mob farm I can't just like go up in the

284
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:22,700
mob farm I can't just like go up in the
 

285
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,220
mob farm I can't just like go up in the
sky and have it work because when they

286
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,230
sky and have it work because when they
 

287
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,350
sky and have it work because when they
fall down they get out of range and then

288
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,360
fall down they get out of range and then
 

289
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,720
fall down they get out of range and then
they just instantly despawn before they

290
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:28,730
they just instantly despawn before they
 

291
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:34,409
they just instantly despawn before they
hit the ground oh oh here comes one

292
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:34,419
hit the ground oh oh here comes one
 

293
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:39,970
hit the ground oh oh here comes one
woohoo alright

294
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:39,980
woohoo alright
 

295
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,490
woohoo alright
so yeah there we saw the which hit the

296
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:42,500
so yeah there we saw the which hit the
 

297
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,410
so yeah there we saw the which hit the
hopper and died so if we're close to the

298
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:44,420
hopper and died so if we're close to the
 

299
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,970
hopper and died so if we're close to the
ground they can make it all the way in

300
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:45,980
ground they can make it all the way in
 

301
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,370
ground they can make it all the way in
splats and then we get the drops but I

302
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:48,380
splats and then we get the drops but I
 

303
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,410
splats and then we get the drops but I
got to light up all the caves which I'm

304
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:50,420
got to light up all the caves which I'm
 

305
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,320
got to light up all the caves which I'm
starting to do it'll probably take many

306
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,330
starting to do it'll probably take many
 

307
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,420
starting to do it'll probably take many
hours to finish it all so we'll just

308
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:55,430
hours to finish it all so we'll just
 

309
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,580
hours to finish it all so we'll just
have to do a little bit every every

310
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:57,590
have to do a little bit every every
 

311
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,140
have to do a little bit every every
episode probably or I'll do it off

312
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,150
episode probably or I'll do it off
 

313
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,950
episode probably or I'll do it off
camera woohoo but once I get them all

314
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
camera woohoo but once I get them all
 

315
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,440
camera woohoo but once I get them all
lit up then the witch farm should work

316
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,450
lit up then the witch farm should work
 

317
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,760
lit up then the witch farm should work
great okay this is gonna be fun though I

318
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:09,770
great okay this is gonna be fun though I
 

319
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,880
great okay this is gonna be fun though I
haven't done any caving in a long time

320
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:12,890

time just from the set-up cost of it but
 

419
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,510

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,000
they did an a they picked a pretty
clever idea for one too so it's blaze

480
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,010
clever idea for one too so it's blaze
 

481
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,150
clever idea for one too so it's blaze
rods and course fruit and I just had

482
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
rods and course fruit and I just had
 

483
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,360
rods and course fruit and I just had
four for that I wasn't expecting that

484
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,370
four for that I wasn't expecting that
 

485
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,880
four for that I wasn't expecting that
okay that's cool so that's the recipe

486
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:25,890
okay that's cool so that's the recipe
 

487
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,800
okay that's cool so that's the recipe
for the n rods these things are are

488
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:27,810
for the n rods these things are are
 

489
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,910
for the n rods these things are are
really nice actually so they have a

490
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
really nice actually so they have a
 

491
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,040
really nice actually so they have a
light level of 14 it's the same as a

492
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,050
light level of 14 it's the same as a
 

493
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,680
light level of 14 it's the same as a
torch it's not as high as glowstone but

494
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:36,690
torch it's not as high as glowstone but
 

495
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,110
torch it's not as high as glowstone but
you can do a couple weird things with it

496
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
you can do a couple weird things with it
 

497
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,520
you can do a couple weird things with it
that you can't do with torches like you

498
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:40,530
that you can't do with torches like you
 

499
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,910
that you can't do with torches like you
can put them on stairs like that which

500
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
can put them on stairs like that which
 

501
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,420
can put them on stairs like that which
is kind of cool and put them upside down

502
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:46,430
is kind of cool and put them upside down
 

503
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,310
is kind of cool and put them upside down
so it's like a it's like a block that

504
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,320
so it's like a it's like a block that
 

505
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,580
so it's like a it's like a block that
you can place basically anywhere weapons

506
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:52,590
you can place basically anywhere weapons
 

507
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,840
you can place basically anywhere weapons
if oh I can't put it there

508
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:53,850
if oh I can't put it there
 

509
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,400
if oh I can't put it there
can't put there oh yeah uh-huh team put

510

can't put there oh yeah uh-huh team put
 

511
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,970
can't put there oh yeah uh-huh team put
them on fences oh you can yeah so you

512
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:01,980
them on fences oh you can yeah so you
 

513
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,190
them on fences oh you can yeah so you
basically put them anywhere then what do

514
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,200
basically put them anywhere then what do
 

515
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,480
basically put them anywhere then what do
they look like on fences that's cool

516
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,490
they look like on fences that's cool
 

517
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,340
they look like on fences that's cool
so the base is the same size as the

518
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:10,350
so the base is the same size as the
 

519
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,140
so the base is the same size as the
fence and check this out too another

520
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,150
fence and check this out too another
 

521
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,060
fence and check this out too another
cool thing about these end rods is they

522

cool thing about these end rods is they
 

523
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,700
cool thing about these end rods is they
actually have a collision box which

I've tried picking this up with a boat
 

635
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,020
I've tried picking this up with a boat
that didn't work I've tried pushing it

636
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,030
that didn't work I've tried pushing it
 

637
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,750
that didn't work I've tried pushing it
with water that doesn't work but you can

638
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
with water that doesn't work but you can
 

639
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,490
with water that doesn't work but you can
move it with a piston I believe they

640
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:10,500
move it with a piston I believe they
 

641
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,560
move it with a piston I believe they
have a huge collision box though so I

642
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:12,570
have a huge collision box though so I
 

643
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,270
have a huge collision box though so I
wasn't able to place another block in

644
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:14,280
wasn't able to place another block in
 

645
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,370
wasn't able to place another block in
between there but if we move it a little

646
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:16,380
between there but if we move it a little
 

647
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,610
between there but if we move it a little
further away now we can yeah so let's do

648
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:19,620
further away now we can yeah so let's do
 

649
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,380
further away now we can yeah so let's do
this a little bit a little closer

650
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:23,390
this a little bit a little closer
 

651
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,120
this a little bit a little closer
alright now this should move it

652
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,130
alright now this should move it
 

653
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,999
alright now this should move it
yeah so you can move them around with

654
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:29,009
yeah so you can move them around with
 

655
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:33,499
yeah so you can move them around with
pistons and I think you can stack them

656
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:33,509
pistons and I think you can stack them
 

657
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:40,840
pistons and I think you can stack them
to this way let's put another one down

658
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:40,850

 

659
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,590

yeah and yeah so now you got two

660
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
yeah and yeah so now you got two
 

661
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,519
yeah and yeah so now you got two
together that is 2 right it looks like

662
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:49,529
together that is 2 right it looks like
 

663
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:50,509
together that is 2 right it looks like
3/4 a second

664
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:50,519
3/4 a second
 

665
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:58,040
3/4 a second
and also they explode uh-huh

666
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,050
and also they explode uh-huh
 

667
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,930
and also they explode uh-huh
so as you can see here it left a pretty

668
00:15:59,930 --> 00:15:59,940
so as you can see here it left a pretty
 

669
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,579
so as you can see here it left a pretty
big crater as well it's a bigger

670
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:01,589
big crater as well it's a bigger
 

671
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:05,300
big crater as well it's a bigger
explosion than TNT does more damage um

672
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,310
explosion than TNT does more damage um
 

673
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,910
explosion than TNT does more damage um
the big difference about that those

674
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
the big difference about that those
 

675
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,019
the big difference about that those
crystals though compared to TNT if you

676
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:11,029
crystals though compared to TNT if you
 

677
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:14,300
crystals though compared to TNT if you
set off to TNT for example the first one

678
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,310
set off to TNT for example the first one
 

679
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,370
set off to TNT for example the first one
kills you the second one destroys your

680
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:16,380
kills you the second one destroys your
 

681
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,980
kills you the second one destroys your
items you can see even though we had 2

682
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:18,990
items you can see even though we had 2
 

683
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,900
items you can see even though we had 2
crystals there I got all my items back

684
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:20,910
crystals there I got all my items back
 

685
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,110
crystals there I got all my items back
even though it killed me the thing about

686
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,120
even though it killed me the thing about
 

687
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,410
even though it killed me the thing about
that as well like if you have a big pile

688
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:27,420
that as well like if you have a big pile
 

689
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,590
that as well like if you have a big pile
of tnt somewhere it makes a big area of

690
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:30,600
of tnt somewhere it makes a big area of
 

691
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,290
of tnt somewhere it makes a big area of
an explosion like we did earlier today

692
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:32,300
an explosion like we did earlier today
 

693
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,800
an explosion like we did earlier today
those crystals it seems like only one of

694
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:36,810
those crystals it seems like only one of
 

695
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,650
those crystals it seems like only one of
them will cause damage to land and all

696
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:39,660
them will cause damage to land and all
 

697
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,660
them will cause damage to land and all
the other ones go to waste if I'm not

698
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:41,670
the other ones go to waste if I'm not
 

699
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,960
the other ones go to waste if I'm not
mistaken maybe we should go and create

700
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:44,970
mistaken maybe we should go and create
 

701
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,040
mistaken maybe we should go and create
them and just test that alright so this

702
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,050
them and just test that alright so this
 

703
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,309
them and just test that alright so this
side we have a 3x3 2 tall room here with

704
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:52,319
side we have a 3x3 2 tall room here with
 

705
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:56,840
side we have a 3x3 2 tall room here with
a single crystal this is the kind of

706
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:56,850
a single crystal this is the kind of
 

707
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,929
a single crystal this is the kind of
damage it does so it basically shaved

708
00:16:59,929 --> 00:16:59,939
damage it does so it basically shaved
 

709
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:01,999
damage it does so it basically shaved
off one or two layers on the outside of

710
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:02,009
off one or two layers on the outside of
 

711
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:04,130
off one or two layers on the outside of
that this side again the same thing

712
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,140
that this side again the same thing
 

713
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,279
that this side again the same thing
three by three by two tall room but we

714
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:07,289
three by three by two tall room but we
 

715
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:13,429
three by three by two tall room but we
have about 20 crystals here and about

716
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
have about 20 crystals here and about
 

717
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,169
have about 20 crystals here and about
the same sized room so they all go off

718
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:15,179
the same sized room so they all go off
 

719
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,740
the same sized room so they all go off
at the same instant

720
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:17,750
at the same instant
 

721
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,429
at the same instant
unlike TNT so next up guys there's

722
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:22,439
unlike TNT so next up guys there's
 

723
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,380
unlike TNT so next up guys there's
something we need to investigate here

724
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:24,390
something we need to investigate here
 

725
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,449
something we need to investigate here
this just blew my mind when I saw it

726
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:26,459
this just blew my mind when I saw it
 

727
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,200
this just blew my mind when I saw it
earlier you might remember like several

728
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,210
earlier you might remember like several
 

729
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,690
earlier you might remember like several
times now I've gone looking for donkeys

730
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:32,700
times now I've gone looking for donkeys
 

731
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,970
times now I've gone looking for donkeys
we had one donkey in our world here and

732
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:34,980
we had one donkey in our world here and
 

733
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,960
we had one donkey in our world here and
then he he drowned in this water

734
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:38,970
then he he drowned in this water
 

735
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,430
then he he drowned in this water
um and I haven't been able to get

736
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:40,440
um and I haven't been able to get
 

737
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,780
um and I haven't been able to get
another one since I've gone looking for

738
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:41,790
another one since I've gone looking for
 

739
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,200
another one since I've gone looking for
donkeys never found one like because one

740
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,210
donkeys never found one like because one
 

741
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,640
donkeys never found one like because one
that's worked when I started this world

742
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:46,650
that's worked when I started this world
 

743
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,620
that's worked when I started this world
donkeys and horses weren't a thing so a

744
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:48,630
donkeys and horses weren't a thing so a
 

745
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,170
donkeys and horses weren't a thing so a
lot of the land I've explored didn't

746
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:51,180
lot of the land I've explored didn't
 

747
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,930
lot of the land I've explored didn't
have horses on and of the land I have

748
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:53,940
have horses on and of the land I have
 

749
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,790
have horses on and of the land I have
explored I have had a hard time finding

750
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:57,800
explored I have had a hard time finding
 

751
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,440
explored I have had a hard time finding
donkeys since they came out but look at

752
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:00,450
donkeys since they came out but look at
 

753
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,590
donkeys since they came out but look at
this I turn over here today and I see

754
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
this I turn over here today and I see
 

755
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,140
this I turn over here today and I see
this and I'm like what we have a donkey

756
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,150
this and I'm like what we have a donkey
 

757
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,370
this and I'm like what we have a donkey
unbelievable so here's a story behind

758
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:10,380
unbelievable so here's a story behind
 

759
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,510
unbelievable so here's a story behind
this I had two mules in here before one

760
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:14,520
this I had two mules in here before one
 

761
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,570
this I had two mules in here before one
over here one over here recently I think

762
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:17,580
over here one over here recently I think
 

763
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,020
over here one over here recently I think
a sly must have got inside this pen like

764
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,030
a sly must have got inside this pen like
 

765
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,990
a sly must have got inside this pen like
a baby slime fit inside and he jumped up

766
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
a baby slime fit inside and he jumped up
 

767
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,930
a baby slime fit inside and he jumped up
activated the tripwire and then my one

768
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:26,940
activated the tripwire and then my one
 

769
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,060
activated the tripwire and then my one
mule got out and drowned over here is

770
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,070
mule got out and drowned over here is
 

771
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,190
mule got out and drowned over here is
what I'm guessing happened so we were

772
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
what I'm guessing happened so we were
 

773
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,490
what I'm guessing happened so we were
down to one mule our last one with with

774
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:34,500
down to one mule our last one with with
 

775
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,300
down to one mule our last one with with
no donkeys to make more and it seems to

776
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,310
no donkeys to make more and it seems to
 

777
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,370
no donkeys to make more and it seems to
have converted into a donkey I think

778
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,380
have converted into a donkey I think
 

779
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,710
have converted into a donkey I think
because of one of the patches like an

780
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
because of one of the patches like an
 

781
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,350
because of one of the patches like an
egg with glitterbug of some sorts and

782
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
egg with glitterbug of some sorts and
 

783
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,260
egg with glitterbug of some sorts and
this might be a super donkey it seems

784
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,270
this might be a super donkey it seems
 

785
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,980
this might be a super donkey it seems
pretty fast right because like donkeys

786
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:54,990
pretty fast right because like donkeys
 

787
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,740
pretty fast right because like donkeys
you find out in the wild in this game

788
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:57,750
you find out in the wild in this game
 

789
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,050
you find out in the wild in this game
they all have the exact same speed and

790
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:00,060
they all have the exact same speed and
 

791
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,540
they all have the exact same speed and
jumping height as each other this the

792
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:02,550
jumping height as each other this the
 

793
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,670
jumping height as each other this the
mule I had there was bread so I think it

794
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:04,680
mule I had there was bread so I think it
 

795
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:10,430
mule I had there was bread so I think it
might have better stats jump seems

796
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:10,440
might have better stats jump seems
 

797
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,230
might have better stats jump seems
pretty average I think the speed might

798
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
pretty average I think the speed might
 

799
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,940
pretty average I think the speed might
be a little bit quicker though than a

800
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:13,950
be a little bit quicker though than a
 

801
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:19,840
be a little bit quicker though than a
normal donkey now maybe not maybe not

802
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:19,850
normal donkey now maybe not maybe not
 

803
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,220
normal donkey now maybe not maybe not
it's hard to tell I would need a donkey

804
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:22,230
it's hard to tell I would need a donkey
 

805
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,040
it's hard to tell I would need a donkey
to compare the two but anyways let's see

806
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,050
to compare the two but anyways let's see
 

807
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:29,060
to compare the two but anyways let's see
if we can breed the donkey here with my

808
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,070
if we can breed the donkey here with my
 

809
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,830
if we can breed the donkey here with my
fastest horse and I'm going to give this

810
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:30,840
fastest horse and I'm going to give this
 

811
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,510
fastest horse and I'm going to give this
guy my diamond armor too that we found

812
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:32,520
guy my diamond armor too that we found
 

813
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,670
guy my diamond armor too that we found
earlier

814
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:33,680
earlier
 

815
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,100
earlier
alright so horse breeding has been a

816
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,110
alright so horse breeding has been a
 

817
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,290
alright so horse breeding has been a
little bit buggy I don't know if this is

818
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:39,300
little bit buggy I don't know if this is
 

819
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:47,150
little bit buggy I don't know if this is
gonna work yeah come on guys give me

820
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:47,160
gonna work yeah come on guys give me
 

821
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,779
gonna work yeah come on guys give me
some hearts give me some hearts

822
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:50,789
some hearts give me some hearts
 

823
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,089
some hearts give me some hearts
okay just right-click okay got some

824
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:53,099
okay just right-click okay got some
 

825
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:59,629
okay just right-click okay got some
hearts yep yeah now it's not looking

826
00:19:59,629 --> 00:19:59,639
hearts yep yeah now it's not looking
 

827
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:02,329
hearts yep yeah now it's not looking
like it's working unless this is still a

828
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:02,339
like it's working unless this is still a
 

829
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:05,409
like it's working unless this is still a
mule it might just be like a skin

830
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:05,419
mule it might just be like a skin
 

831
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,589
mule it might just be like a skin
let's try breed the two horses together

832
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:08,599
let's try breed the two horses together
 

833
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:11,180
let's try breed the two horses together
that might actually still be a mule it

834
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,190
that might actually still be a mule it
 

835
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,669
that might actually still be a mule it
just looks like a donkey

836
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679

 

837
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,310

now horse breeding is broken okay we'll

838
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:19,320
now horse breeding is broken okay we'll
 

839
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,779
now horse breeding is broken okay we'll
have to try this later but we might have

840
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:20,789
have to try this later but we might have
 

841
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:23,629
have to try this later but we might have
a donkey here now which is awesome if

842
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:23,639
a donkey here now which is awesome if
 

843
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,769
a donkey here now which is awesome if
it's true alright so well you know what

844
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:27,779
it's true alright so well you know what
 

845
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:29,839
it's true alright so well you know what
guys it's been a while since we last did

846
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:29,849
guys it's been a while since we last did
 

847
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:31,699
guys it's been a while since we last did
anything on the Nexus here I thought

848
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:31,709
anything on the Nexus here I thought
 

849
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:33,379
anything on the Nexus here I thought
maybe we'll try solve the next problem

850
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:33,389
maybe we'll try solve the next problem
 

851
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:34,909
maybe we'll try solve the next problem
today

852
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:34,919
today
 

853
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,189
today
the next thing I want to add is buttons

854
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:37,199
the next thing I want to add is buttons
 

855
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:39,169
the next thing I want to add is buttons
for requesting items so right now we

856
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:39,179
for requesting items so right now we
 

857
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,180
for requesting items so right now we
just have this lever the longer I pull

858
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,190
just have this lever the longer I pull
 

859
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,249
just have this lever the longer I pull
this lever the more items we get out of

860
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:43,259
this lever the more items we get out of
 

861
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:45,379
this lever the more items we get out of
the system but I want to set up buttons

862
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:45,389
the system but I want to set up buttons
 

863
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:48,379
the system but I want to set up buttons
so that like I don't know how many we

864
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:48,389
so that like I don't know how many we
 

865
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:50,479
so that like I don't know how many we
would want but maybe we'll have one that

866
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:50,489
would want but maybe we'll have one that
 

867
00:20:50,489 --> 00:20:53,209
would want but maybe we'll have one that
requests eight items when we push it one

868
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:53,219
requests eight items when we push it one
 

869
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:57,199
requests eight items when we push it one
that requests 16 one that requests you

870
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:57,209
that requests 16 one that requests you
 

871
00:20:57,209 --> 00:21:01,009
that requests 16 one that requests you
know 32 64 so when we press the button

872
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:01,019
know 32 64 so when we press the button
 

873
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,689
know 32 64 so when we press the button
what we're going to want to do is

874
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:02,699
what we're going to want to do is
 

875
00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:04,819
what we're going to want to do is
activate a hopper clock probably some

876
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:04,829
activate a hopper clock probably some
 

877
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:08,149
activate a hopper clock probably some
long delay timer thing so when we press

878
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159
long delay timer thing so when we press
 

879
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,119
long delay timer thing so when we press
it then the wire activates for a certain

880
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:11,129
it then the wire activates for a certain
 

881
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:13,279
it then the wire activates for a certain
amount of time while this is being

882
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:13,289
amount of time while this is being
 

883
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:17,019
amount of time while this is being
powered its releasing items in the Nexus

884
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:17,029
powered its releasing items in the Nexus
 

885
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:19,249
powered its releasing items in the Nexus
but we can't just use this straight up

886
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:19,259
but we can't just use this straight up
 

887
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:22,099
but we can't just use this straight up
hopper clock I love hopper clocks I use

888
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:22,109
hopper clock I love hopper clocks I use
 

889
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:23,419
hopper clock I love hopper clocks I use
them all the time but there's one

890
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:23,429
them all the time but there's one
 

891
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:28,909
them all the time but there's one
built-in problem with them that's okay

892
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:28,919
built-in problem with them that's okay
 

893
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,969
built-in problem with them that's okay
so like when we press the button here

894
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:30,979
so like when we press the button here
 

895
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:33,709
so like when we press the button here
it's active right now it's active it's

896
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:33,719
it's active right now it's active it's
 

897
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:36,199
it's active right now it's active it's
active it's good now like if we try to

898
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:36,209
active it's good now like if we try to
 

899
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:38,149
active it's good now like if we try to
use it again we have to wait a certain

900
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
use it again we have to wait a certain
 

901
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,589
use it again we have to wait a certain
amount of time before it finishes

902
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:39,599
amount of time before it finishes
 

903
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,909
amount of time before it finishes
resetting and that's what I want to try

904
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
resetting and that's what I want to try
 

905
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,249
resetting and that's what I want to try
get rid of that little delay aha so I

906
00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:49,259
get rid of that little delay aha so I
 

907
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:51,049
get rid of that little delay aha so I
was totally expecting I have to do

908
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:51,059
was totally expecting I have to do
 

909
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,059
was totally expecting I have to do
something complicated here you know and

910
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:53,069
something complicated here you know and
 

911
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:54,469
something complicated here you know and
gates or something

912
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:54,479
gates or something
 

913
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,659
gates or something
turns out hopper clocks are even cooler

914
00:21:56,659 --> 00:21:56,669
turns out hopper clocks are even cooler
 

915
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:58,339
turns out hopper clocks are even cooler
than I thought I just learnt a new trick

916
00:21:58,339 --> 00:21:58,349
than I thought I just learnt a new trick
 

917
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:00,919
than I thought I just learnt a new trick
with them and it's built into the hopper

918
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:00,929
with them and it's built into the hopper
 

919
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:02,599
with them and it's built into the hopper
clock look at this look at that light

920
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:02,609
clock look at this look at that light
 

921
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:04,220
clock look at this look at that light
over there

922
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,230
over there
 

923
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,379
over there
normally when I would want power out of

924
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:06,389
normally when I would want power out of
 

925
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:08,360
normally when I would want power out of
a hopper clock I would take it from the

926
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,370
a hopper clock I would take it from the
 

927
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,909
a hopper clock I would take it from the
redstone block here so this this

928
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:10,919
redstone block here so this this
 

929
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,860
redstone block here so this this
satellites here but you'll notice that

930
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:12,870
satellites here but you'll notice that
 

931
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,169
satellites here but you'll notice that
didn't shut off until the very end of

932
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:15,179
didn't shut off until the very end of
 

933
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:20,720
didn't shut off until the very end of
the cycle which is just awesome so as

934
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:20,730
the cycle which is just awesome so as
 

935
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:25,190
the cycle which is just awesome so as
soon as it's done compress it again as

936
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:25,200
soon as it's done compress it again as
 

937
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,649
soon as it's done compress it again as
soon as the hopper clock finishes so all

938
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:27,659
soon as the hopper clock finishes so all
 

939
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,600
soon as the hopper clock finishes so all
that is it's the comparator reading off

940
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:29,610
that is it's the comparator reading off
 

941
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,350
that is it's the comparator reading off
of this hopper once this all finishes

942
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
of this hopper once this all finishes
 

943
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,330
of this hopper once this all finishes
all the items end up in this hopper so

944
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:35,340
all the items end up in this hopper so
 

945
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,539
all the items end up in this hopper so
it's really simple I just never realized

946
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:37,549
it's really simple I just never realized
 

947
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:40,669
it's really simple I just never realized
you could do that and effectively that

948
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:40,679
you could do that and effectively that
 

949
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,129
you could do that and effectively that
doubles the length of time that the

950
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:43,139
doubles the length of time that the
 

951
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:44,779
doubles the length of time that the
hopper clock can run here if you do it
