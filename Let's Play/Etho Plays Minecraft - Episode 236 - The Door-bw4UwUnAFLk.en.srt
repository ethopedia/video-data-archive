that's where the entrance to the portal
 

69
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,850
that's where the entrance to the portal
room is going to be let's do that for

70
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:01,860
room is going to be let's do that for
 

71
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,929
room is going to be let's do that for
now I'm going to get some more fences

72
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:02,939
now I'm going to get some more fences
 

73
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,270

once set in while I finish repairing

74
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
once set in while I finish repairing
 

75
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,229
once set in while I finish repairing
that alrighty then let's make this a

76
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:09,239
that alrighty then let's make this a
 

77
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,490
that alrighty then let's make this a
take - so I wanted to make a portal room

78
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:13,500
take - so I wanted to make a portal room
 

79
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:13,850
take - so I wanted to make a portal room
for the

80
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:13,860
for the
 

81
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,250
for the
village move that out of there into it

82
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:16,260
village move that out of there into it
 

83
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,600
village move that out of there into it
and I figured I'd build a date for it as

84
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:20,610
and I figured I'd build a date for it as
 

85
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,120
and I figured I'd build a date for it as
well kind of get for the village and

86

well kind of get for the village and
we'll put that here I was going to do a

88
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:24,780
we'll put that here I was going to do a
 

89
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,630
we'll put that here I was going to do a
three by three piston door

90
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
three by three piston door
 

91
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,460
three by three piston door
I made one another day that I really

92
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:28,470
I made one another day that I really
 

93
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,030
I made one another day that I really
liked so I'll I'll try that out I when I

94
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,040
liked so I'll I'll try that out I when I
 

95
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,070
liked so I'll I'll try that out I when I
built it originally I used sandstone so

96
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
built it originally I used sandstone so
 

97
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,040
built it originally I used sandstone so
we'll see what that looks like first but

98
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,050
we'll see what that looks like first but
 

99
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,920
we'll see what that looks like first but
we might want to change that because

100
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:38,930
we might want to change that because
 

101
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,110
we might want to change that because
there's no sandstone in this village as

102
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,120
there's no sandstone in this village as
 

103
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,190
there's no sandstone in this village as
much as I love it

104
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
much as I love it
 

105
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,440
much as I love it
you can always use it even when you want

106
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,450
you can always use it even when you want
 

107
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,850
you can always use it even when you want
to so yeah I really like this design

108
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:49,860
to so yeah I really like this design
 

109
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,900
to so yeah I really like this design
basically what I did is I had stairs in

110
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:53,910
basically what I did is I had stairs in
 

111
00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:02,140
basically what I did is I had stairs in
the corners I use these for the middles

112
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,150

 

113
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,320

and just the second

114
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,330
and just the second
 

115
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,100
and just the second
oops I'm not using the right blocks even

116
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,110
oops I'm not using the right blocks even
 

117
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,840
oops I'm not using the right blocks even
I use the creeperface ones there we go

118
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:14,850
I use the creeperface ones there we go
 

119
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,930
I use the creeperface ones there we go
and I'm just going to build off on the

120
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:17,940
and I'm just going to build off on the
 

121
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:29,650
and I'm just going to build off on the
side here get this flipped like so and

122
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:29,660

 

123
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,530

one more over there that's the basic

124
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:33,540
one more over there that's the basic
 

125
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,100
one more over there that's the basic
look of the door it you know I like the

126
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,110
look of the door it you know I like the
 

127
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,199
look of the door it you know I like the
ones I don't know why I actually prefer

128
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:39,209
ones I don't know why I actually prefer
 

129
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,610
ones I don't know why I actually prefer
the ones with the hole in the middle and

130
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:40,620
the ones with the hole in the middle and
 

131
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,039
the ones with the hole in the middle and
they're a lot easier to build so that's

132
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,049
they're a lot easier to build so that's
 

133
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:44,870
they're a lot easier to build so that's
what we're doing it kind of makes an X

134
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:44,880
what we're doing it kind of makes an X
 

135
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,210
what we're doing it kind of makes an X
shape just for now we'll put up our

136
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:50,220
shape just for now we'll put up our
 

137
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,500
shape just for now we'll put up our
beams on the sides this is what it looks

138
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:54,510
beams on the sides this is what it looks
 

139
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,979
beams on the sides this is what it looks
like when it's closed I should say so

140
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:57,989
like when it's closed I should say so
 

141
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,539
like when it's closed I should say so
just do this for now get a frame for it

142
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:01,549
just do this for now get a frame for it
 

143
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,920
just do this for now get a frame for it
hop over to the other side do the same

144
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:03,930
hop over to the other side do the same
 

145
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,390
hop over to the other side do the same
thing

146
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:07,400

 

147
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,130

this thing is actually fairly easy to

148
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:10,140
this thing is actually fairly easy to
 

149
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,969
this thing is actually fairly easy to
wire it's not much to it

150
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:15,979
wire it's not much to it
 

151
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:19,120
wire it's not much to it
oops

152
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,130

 

153
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,020

nope well we might change this up anyway

154
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,030
nope well we might change this up anyway
 

155
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,720
nope well we might change this up anyway
so that's our basic door that we want to

156
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:26,730
so that's our basic door that we want to
 

157
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,360
so that's our basic door that we want to
make the way I would did it before is I

158
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,370
make the way I would did it before is I
 

159
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,560
make the way I would did it before is I
put just rip up the whole door after we

160
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:33,570
put just rip up the whole door after we
 

161
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,560
put just rip up the whole door after we
laid it out here what I did is I put

162
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:36,570
laid it out here what I did is I put
 

163
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:43,180
laid it out here what I did is I put
pistons on the sides three of them no

164
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,190
pistons on the sides three of them no
 

165
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,620
pistons on the sides three of them no
let's go further right no that was right

166
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:47,630
let's go further right no that was right
 

167
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,740
let's go further right no that was right
three pistons on the sides do that for

168
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:51,750
three pistons on the sides do that for
 

169
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,350
three pistons on the sides do that for
both sides that takes care of those and

170
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
both sides that takes care of those and
 

171
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,810
both sides that takes care of those and
I had one on the top so gotta go higher

172
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:04,820
I had one on the top so gotta go higher
 

173
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,810
I had one on the top so gotta go higher
no that's right right there one there

174
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:08,820
no that's right right there one there
 

175
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:15,290
no that's right right there one there
and then also one down below here like

176
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:15,300
and then also one down below here like
 

177
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,510
and then also one down below here like
that so those are all the Pistons we

178
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
that so those are all the Pistons we
 

179
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,350
that so those are all the Pistons we
need to move the eight blocks and to

180
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
need to move the eight blocks and to
 

181
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,420
need to move the eight blocks and to
wire them it's fairly simple what I did

182
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:25,430
wire them it's fairly simple what I did
 

183
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,250
wire them it's fairly simple what I did
see should we use these galaxies those

184
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:30,260
see should we use these galaxies those
 

185
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:36,560
see should we use these galaxies those
for the wiring okay so I have it where's

186
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:36,570
for the wiring okay so I have it where's
 

187
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:42,760
for the wiring okay so I have it where's
my redstone and torches we need torches

188
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:42,770
my redstone and torches we need torches
 

189
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,940
my redstone and torches we need torches
okay

190
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:43,950
okay
 

191
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,940
okay
also yeah I brought these for just add

192
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:46,950
also yeah I brought these for just add
 

193
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,320
also yeah I brought these for just add
some more life to the let's see if we

194
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,330
some more life to the let's see if we
 

195
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,530
some more life to the let's see if we
get some chicken stock there we go

196
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:51,540
get some chicken stock there we go
 

197
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:58,880
get some chicken stock there we go
hopefully they stay inside so I think I

198
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:58,890
hopefully they stay inside so I think I
 

199
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:06,920
hopefully they stay inside so I think I
went down one torch there and then oops

200
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:06,930
went down one torch there and then oops
 

201
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,020
went down one torch there and then oops
redstone above so that takes care of the

202
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,030
redstone above so that takes care of the
 

203
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,070
redstone above so that takes care of the
three pistons do that for this one as

204
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,080
three pistons do that for this one as
 

205
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,530
three pistons do that for this one as
well

206
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:18,540

 

207
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,600

okay so that's six Pistons then

208
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:20,610
okay so that's six Pistons then
 

209
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,230
okay so that's six Pistons then
reconnects I ran the wiring up below

210
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
reconnects I ran the wiring up below
 

211
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,210
reconnects I ran the wiring up below
actually let's do it on this side this

212
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:26,220
actually let's do it on this side this
 

213
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,550
actually let's do it on this side this
will be our main side this is going to

214
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
will be our main side this is going to
 

215
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,190
will be our main side this is going to
be a one-way door I figure so we want

216
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,200
be a one-way door I figure so we want
 

217
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,900
be a one-way door I figure so we want
the villagers to go from the portal room

218
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:32,910
the villagers to go from the portal room
 

219
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,580
the villagers to go from the portal room
into the village but we don't want them

220
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:34,590
into the village but we don't want them
 

221
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,280
into the village but we don't want them
to go from the village into the portal

222
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,290
to go from the village into the portal
 

223
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,680
to go from the village into the portal
room

224
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:41,690

 

225
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:47,330

yeah then see what do we do

226
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:47,340
yeah then see what do we do
 

227
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:57,080
yeah then see what do we do
think mmm I'm very forgetful how did I

228
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,090
think mmm I'm very forgetful how did I
 

229
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,100
think mmm I'm very forgetful how did I
do that I think I had yeah as blocks

230
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,110
do that I think I had yeah as blocks
 

231
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,480
do that I think I had yeah as blocks
running here I remember them encircling

232
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:05,490
running here I remember them encircling
 

233
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,120
running here I remember them encircling
the piston and I had a redstone torch

234
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,130
the piston and I had a redstone torch
 

235
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:15,470
the piston and I had a redstone torch
below that the wire kind of wraps around

236
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:15,480
below that the wire kind of wraps around
 

237
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,690
below that the wire kind of wraps around
like that and somehow yeah I just need

238
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:20,700
like that and somehow yeah I just need
 

239
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,240
like that and somehow yeah I just need
to make it go directly to that block and

240
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,250
to make it go directly to that block and
 

241
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,390
to make it go directly to that block and
that's pretty much all there is to it I

242
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
that's pretty much all there is to it I
 

243
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:34,090
that's pretty much all there is to it I
got too much junk don't I think I do

244
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,100

 

245
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,370

that and one more over here

246
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:39,380
that and one more over here
 

247
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,720
that and one more over here
okay so that goes the torch and then up

248
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:41,730
okay so that goes the torch and then up
 

249
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:47,090
okay so that goes the torch and then up
there do the same for this side where's

250
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:47,100
there do the same for this side where's
 

251
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,300
there do the same for this side where's
my soil just I can't have empty spaces

252
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,310
my soil just I can't have empty spaces
 

253
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,550
my soil just I can't have empty spaces
underground it bugs me I really got to

254
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
underground it bugs me I really got to
 

255
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,190
underground it bugs me I really got to
throw waste on this junk though so I

256
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,200
throw waste on this junk though so I
 

257
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:03,910
throw waste on this junk though so I
gotta fill this in or drive me crazy

258
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:03,920

 

259
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:10,840

just like that's I think this is right

260
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:10,850
just like that's I think this is right
 

261
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,530
just like that's I think this is right
okay let's get up

262
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:13,540
okay let's get up
 

263
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,150
okay let's get up
oh you know what I'm doing I'm breaking

264
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,160
oh you know what I'm doing I'm breaking
 

265
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,710
oh you know what I'm doing I'm breaking
my gravel blocks and that's becoming

266
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
my gravel blocks and that's becoming
 

267
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,360
my gravel blocks and that's becoming
Flint's and that's where all the Flint's

268
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,370
Flint's and that's where all the Flint's
 

269
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:23,220
Flint's and that's where all the Flint's
going and to add to the troubles I'm

270
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,230
going and to add to the troubles I'm
 

271
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,230
going and to add to the troubles I'm
going to introduce a lever into my

272
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:25,240
going to introduce a lever into my
 

273
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,480
going to introduce a lever into my
inventory let's just try this out okay

274
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:30,490
inventory let's just try this out okay
 

275
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,520
inventory let's just try this out okay
so that retracts seven Pistons all in

276
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:32,530
so that retracts seven Pistons all in
 

277
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,300
so that retracts seven Pistons all in
the same same tick then we got to get

278
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:36,310
the same same tick then we got to get
 

279
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:42,719
the same same tick then we got to get
one to the top still and sadly I did not

280
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:42,729
one to the top still and sadly I did not
 

281
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,760
one to the top still and sadly I did not
come up with a super fancy way of doing

282
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:44,770
come up with a super fancy way of doing
 

283
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,320
come up with a super fancy way of doing
that what I did is right put a half slab

284
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,330
that what I did is right put a half slab
 

285
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,440
that what I did is right put a half slab
here half slabs are awesome for redstone

286
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:52,450
here half slabs are awesome for redstone
 

287
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,450
here half slabs are awesome for redstone
by the way if you if you're not used to

288
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:54,460
by the way if you if you're not used to
 

289
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,640
by the way if you if you're not used to
using them they are really cool what you

290
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:56,650
using them they are really cool what you
 

291
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,270
using them they are really cool what you
can do with okay go on a little redstone

292
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:00,280
can do with okay go on a little redstone
 

293
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,240
can do with okay go on a little redstone
dad tangent here something really cool

294
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,250
dad tangent here something really cool
 

295
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,570
dad tangent here something really cool
you can do with them is you can run a

296
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:08,580
you can do with them is you can run a
 

297
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,800
you can do with them is you can run a
staircase up kind of like you can with

298
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:10,810
staircase up kind of like you can with
 

299
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:16,460
staircase up kind of like you can with
glowstone so if we whoops if we do this

300
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:16,470
glowstone so if we whoops if we do this
 

301
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,550
glowstone so if we whoops if we do this
and put redstone dust on that it'll go

302
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
and put redstone dust on that it'll go
 

303
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:30,450
and put redstone dust on that it'll go
all the way up so just just a quick

304
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:30,460
all the way up so just just a quick
 

305
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:39,830
all the way up so just just a quick
tangent here there so if we power this

306
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:39,840

 

307
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,420

it can climb up the staircase like that

308
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,430
it can climb up the staircase like that
 

309
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,430
it can climb up the staircase like that
right it doesn't go down no which is

310
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:44,440
right it doesn't go down no which is
 

311
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,800
right it doesn't go down no which is
interesting

312
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:45,810
interesting
 

313
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,080
interesting
so we powered from above it won't go

314
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,090
so we powered from above it won't go
 

315
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,300
so we powered from above it won't go
down the staircase it only only goes up

316
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:51,310
down the staircase it only only goes up
 

317
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,720
down the staircase it only only goes up
so JC didn't know that that's a pretty

318
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:54,730
so JC didn't know that that's a pretty
 

319
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,070
so JC didn't know that that's a pretty
handy way of doing redstone and that's

320
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,080
handy way of doing redstone and that's
 

321
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,420
handy way of doing redstone and that's
what I did with this door although I

322
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:00,430
what I did with this door although I
 

323
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,160
what I did with this door although I
have to make it come out an extra block

324
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,170
have to make it come out an extra block
 

325
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,620
have to make it come out an extra block
which I don't really like with the way I

326
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:04,630
which I don't really like with the way I
 

327
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,040
which I don't really like with the way I
have it here there might be a better way

328
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,050
have it here there might be a better way
 

329
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,750
have it here there might be a better way
of doing it I didn't spend a whole lot

330
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
of doing it I didn't spend a whole lot
 

331
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,020
of doing it I didn't spend a whole lot
of time on it though that comes out over

332
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,030
of time on it though that comes out over
 

333
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,040
of time on it though that comes out over
to there actually we should be using

334
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,050
to there actually we should be using
 

335
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,470
to there actually we should be using
maybe sandstone kind of slabs that

336
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
maybe sandstone kind of slabs that
 

337
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,810
maybe sandstone kind of slabs that
doesn't matter too much

338
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:26,820
doesn't matter too much
 

339
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,510
doesn't matter too much
and basically I this runs up to the

340
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:30,520
and basically I this runs up to the
 

341
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:37,020
and basically I this runs up to the
piston on the top like so and there we

342
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,030
piston on the top like so and there we
 

343
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:41,090
piston on the top like so and there we
go so that's all eight Pistons I believe

344
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,100
go so that's all eight Pistons I believe
 

345
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,860
go so that's all eight Pistons I believe
they all go together so that's that's

346
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:43,870
they all go together so that's that's
 

347
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,600
they all go together so that's that's
pretty cool so I'm going to fill this in

348
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:45,610
pretty cool so I'm going to fill this in
 

349
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:52,140
pretty cool so I'm going to fill this in
a little bit and might continue it all

350
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,150
a little bit and might continue it all
 

351
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,870
a little bit and might continue it all
right it very good so this is the door

352
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
right it very good so this is the door
 

353
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,660
right it very good so this is the door
it's wired here's the demonstration of

354
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:57,670
it's wired here's the demonstration of
 

355
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,840
it's wired here's the demonstration of
it working pretty sleek I like it

356
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:02,850
it working pretty sleek I like it
 

357
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,730
it working pretty sleek I like it
we can even see the Sun when the door is

358
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:05,740
we can even see the Sun when the door is
 

359
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,550
we can even see the Sun when the door is
closed you know I liked it

360
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
closed you know I liked it
 

361
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,140
closed you know I liked it
okay I'll tell you why I like the ones

362
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,150
okay I'll tell you why I like the ones
 

363
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,600
okay I'll tell you why I like the ones
with the hole in the middle they keep

364
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:12,610
with the hole in the middle they keep
 

365
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,570
with the hole in the middle they keep
the mobs out still you can see what's on

366
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:15,580
the mobs out still you can see what's on
 

367
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,160
the mobs out still you can see what's on
the other side so it's kind of like

368
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,170
the other side so it's kind of like
 

369
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,100
the other side so it's kind of like
having a glass door hey guy but also

370
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,110
having a glass door hey guy but also
 

371
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,780
having a glass door hey guy but also
there's a way to go through without the

372
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:24,790
there's a way to go through without the
 

373
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,160
there's a way to go through without the
mobs being able to go through using

374
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,170
mobs being able to go through using
 

375
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:33,330
mobs being able to go through using
enderpearls OOP that was weird so yeah

376
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:33,340
enderpearls OOP that was weird so yeah
 

377
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,680
enderpearls OOP that was weird so yeah
that's why I like the ones with the hole

378
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:34,690
that's why I like the ones with the hole
 

379
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,250
that's why I like the ones with the hole
in the middle so I was thinking about

380
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:38,260
in the middle so I was thinking about
 

381
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,060
in the middle so I was thinking about
how I'm going to finalize this and I

382
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,070
how I'm going to finalize this and I
 

383
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,530
how I'm going to finalize this and I
decide I want to have pressure plates on

384
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:45,540
decide I want to have pressure plates on
 

385
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,860
decide I want to have pressure plates on
this side and I want buttons like this

386
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:49,870
this side and I want buttons like this
 

387
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:56,820
this side and I want buttons like this
on this side okay and I even have a wire

388
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:56,830
on this side okay and I even have a wire
 

389
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,620
on this side okay and I even have a wire
right now but you can see if I press a

390
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:01,630
right now but you can see if I press a
 

391
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,540
right now but you can see if I press a
button it opens and then it closes I got

392
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:03,550
button it opens and then it closes I got
 

393
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,520
button it opens and then it closes I got
to hook up a T flip-flop to this as well

394
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:05,530
to hook up a T flip-flop to this as well
 

395
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,040
to hook up a T flip-flop to this as well
so it it will stay open if I hit the

396
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,050
so it it will stay open if I hit the
 

397
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,790
so it it will stay open if I hit the
button and then it'll close if I hit it

398
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:11,800
button and then it'll close if I hit it
 

399
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,950
button and then it'll close if I hit it
again or if I walk over the pressure

400
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:16,960
again or if I walk over the pressure
 

401
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,840
again or if I walk over the pressure
plates it'll open and stay open and

402
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:18,850
plates it'll open and stay open and
 

403
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,750
plates it'll open and stay open and
close if I walk back over them so that's

404
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
close if I walk back over them so that's
 

405
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,290
close if I walk back over them so that's
the idea but I had I had a new idea of

406
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:25,300
the idea but I had I had a new idea of
 

407
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,020
the idea but I had I had a new idea of
how to wire it that's a little bit

408
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,030
how to wire it that's a little bit
 

409
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,000
how to wire it that's a little bit
bizarre but I think it'll work out

410
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,010
bizarre but I think it'll work out
 

411
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,760
bizarre but I think it'll work out
pretty good so since I don't want to

412
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:32,770
pretty good so since I don't want to
 

413
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,650
pretty good so since I don't want to
spend the whole episode on the door

414
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:34,660
spend the whole episode on the door
 

415
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,780
spend the whole episode on the door
alone I'm going to just go ahead and do

416
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:36,790
alone I'm going to just go ahead and do
 

417
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,880
alone I'm going to just go ahead and do
it and I'll show you afterwards when I

418
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:38,890
it and I'll show you afterwards when I
 

419
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,020
it and I'll show you afterwards when I
got it done

420
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,030
got it done
 

421
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,610
got it done
if it works well there we go guys it is

422
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:44,620
if it works well there we go guys it is
 

423
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,370
if it works well there we go guys it is
done and best of all it works

424
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:47,380
done and best of all it works
 

425
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,070
done and best of all it works
hahaha so I'll give you a quick

426
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,080
hahaha so I'll give you a quick
 

427
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,930
hahaha so I'll give you a quick
run-through of its there's actually a

428
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:51,940
run-through of its there's actually a
 

429
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,400
run-through of its there's actually a
few tricks I want to point out to you

430
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,410
few tricks I want to point out to you
 

431
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,250
few tricks I want to point out to you
that I used here first of all there's no

432
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:56,260
that I used here first of all there's no
 

433
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,830
that I used here first of all there's no
more redstone torches they're too slow I

434
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:58,840
more redstone torches they're too slow I
 

435
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,640
more redstone torches they're too slow I
don't like them we got rid of them

436
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:01,650
don't like them we got rid of them
 

437
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,200
don't like them we got rid of them
actually they wouldn't work for what I

438
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,210
actually they wouldn't work for what I
 

439
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,940
actually they wouldn't work for what I
have planned I don't think so

440
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:05,950
have planned I don't think so
 

441
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,570
have planned I don't think so
Oh actually maybe they would have well

442
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:09,580
Oh actually maybe they would have well
 

443
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,040
Oh actually maybe they would have well
either wait it's faster without them so

444
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,050
either wait it's faster without them so
 

445
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,200
either wait it's faster without them so
we got rid of them here's a quick

446
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,210
we got rid of them here's a quick
 

447
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:21,770
we got rid of them here's a quick
demonstration SuperDuper fast very cool

448
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:21,780

 

449
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,020

and I have it all open up still so you

450
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,030
and I have it all open up still so you
 

451
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,940
and I have it all open up still so you
can see the wiring and over here with

452
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:26,950
can see the wiring and over here with
 

453
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,570
can see the wiring and over here with
the buttons again very quick I'm going

454
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:30,580
the buttons again very quick I'm going
 

455
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,830
the buttons again very quick I'm going
to hold right click on it just so you

456
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:31,840
to hold right click on it just so you
 

457
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,830
to hold right click on it just so you
can see how quick it can all go that's

458
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:37,840
can see how quick it can all go that's
 

459
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,740
can see how quick it can all go that's
pretty cool

460
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:39,750
pretty cool
 

461
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,930
pretty cool
so first trick I kind of all kind of

462
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:42,940
so first trick I kind of all kind of
 

463
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,400
so first trick I kind of all kind of
trick first kind of cool thing I did

464
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:47,410
trick first kind of cool thing I did
 

465
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,590
trick first kind of cool thing I did
here I had to connect this wire and this

466
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:49,600
here I had to connect this wire and this
 

467
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,110
here I had to connect this wire and this
wire together right so what I did is I

468
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,120
wire together right so what I did is I
 

469
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,510
wire together right so what I did is I
went below the piston and since a piston

470
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:54,520
went below the piston and since a piston
 

471
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,180
went below the piston and since a piston
is a block that doesn't cut the power

472
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,190
is a block that doesn't cut the power
 

473
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,940
is a block that doesn't cut the power
it's able to connect down below here but

474
00:13:59,940 --> 00:13:59,950
it's able to connect down below here but
 

475
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,530
it's able to connect down below here but
I also have to power the piston and

476
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:01,540
I also have to power the piston and
 

477
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,960
I also have to power the piston and
thankfully since this wire is still

478
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:03,970
thankfully since this wire is still
 

479
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,760
thankfully since this wire is still
pointing at it it does that as well so

480
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:05,770
pointing at it it does that as well so
 

481
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,320
pointing at it it does that as well so
it's like killing - killing three birds

482
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,330
it's like killing - killing three birds
 

483
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,570
it's like killing - killing three birds
really with one stone alright so wanted

484
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:12,580
really with one stone alright so wanted
 

485
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,550
really with one stone alright so wanted
to connect them wanted power well maybe

486
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
to connect them wanted power well maybe
 

487
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,970
to connect them wanted power well maybe
two words whatever so that's kind of

488
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:17,980
two words whatever so that's kind of
 

489
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,310
two words whatever so that's kind of
cool I also used two T flip-flops in

490
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:23,320
cool I also used two T flip-flops in
 

491
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,110
cool I also used two T flip-flops in
this believe it or not which allows me

492
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
this believe it or not which allows me
 

493
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,340
this believe it or not which allows me
to do something neat which I'll show you

494
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:26,350
to do something neat which I'll show you
 

495
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,520
to do something neat which I'll show you
in a second but I set this up just to

496
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:29,530
in a second but I set this up just to
 

497
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,079
in a second but I set this up just to
help you understand how it works

498
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:31,089
help you understand how it works
 

499
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:33,780
help you understand how it works
there's a really cool trick you can do

500
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:33,790
there's a really cool trick you can do
 

501
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,670
there's a really cool trick you can do
in Minecraft for making a monostable

502
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
in Minecraft for making a monostable
 

503
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,800
in Minecraft for making a monostable
circuit which is a circuit that allows

504
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:37,810
circuit which is a circuit that allows
 

505
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,450
circuit which is a circuit that allows
you to control the timing of a pulse so

506
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:42,460
you to control the timing of a pulse so
 

507
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,980
you to control the timing of a pulse so
normally with if you press a button it

508
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:43,990
normally with if you press a button it
 

509
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,880
normally with if you press a button it
lasts for a second but if I think it's a

510
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:47,890
lasts for a second but if I think it's a
 

511
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,590
lasts for a second but if I think it's a
second still maybe they changed it who

512
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
second still maybe they changed it who
 

513
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,490
second still maybe they changed it who
knows but with this little do

514
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:53,500
knows but with this little do
 

515
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,950
knows but with this little do
gee it's very simple just a sticky

516
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:55,960
gee it's very simple just a sticky
 

517
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,720
gee it's very simple just a sticky
piston and a block and a repeater or

518
00:14:59,720 --> 00:14:59,730
piston and a block and a repeater or
 

519
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:06,000
piston and a block and a repeater or
yeah so if you press that it's this

520
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,010
yeah so if you press that it's this
 

521
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,140
yeah so if you press that it's this
repeater only goes on for one tick I'll

522
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,150
repeater only goes on for one tick I'll
 

523
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:15,350
repeater only goes on for one tick I'll
set up another piston so you can see it

524
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360

 

525
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,210

and if we want we can extend that that

526
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,220
and if we want we can extend that that
 

527
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,610
and if we want we can extend that that
would make it two ticks the pulse this

528
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:20,620
would make it two ticks the pulse this
 

529
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,680
would make it two ticks the pulse this
would make it three ticks you can see

530
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:22,690
would make it three ticks you can see
 

531
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,890
would make it three ticks you can see
it's kind of slowing down for ticks

532
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:24,900
it's kind of slowing down for ticks
 

533
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,210
it's kind of slowing down for ticks
before this only used to be a

534
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:27,220
before this only used to be a
 

535
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,700
before this only used to be a
directional trick but with the recent

536
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:29,710
directional trick but with the recent
 

537
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,670
directional trick but with the recent
patches it now works pretty reliably

538
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:32,680
patches it now works pretty reliably
 

539
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,770
patches it now works pretty reliably
I've noticed so that's what I've been

540
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:34,780
I've noticed so that's what I've been
 

541
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,430
I've noticed so that's what I've been
using for my T flip-flops actually so

542
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
using for my T flip-flops actually so
 

543
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,770
using for my T flip-flops actually so
I'll show you how that works there's a

544
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:43,780
I'll show you how that works there's a
 

545
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,440
I'll show you how that works there's a
trick with pistons if you only power it

546
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:46,450
trick with pistons if you only power it
 

547
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,120
trick with pistons if you only power it
for one tick it will leave a block

548
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,130
for one tick it will leave a block
 

549
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:56,340
for one tick it will leave a block
behind so there so even though it's a

550
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:56,350
behind so there so even though it's a
 

551
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,090
behind so there so even though it's a
sticky piston it doesn't retract and it

552
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:00,100
sticky piston it doesn't retract and it
 

553
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,980
sticky piston it doesn't retract and it
does that so if we put a redstone torch

554
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:01,990
does that so if we put a redstone torch
 

555
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,060
does that so if we put a redstone torch
below this it's effectively a redstone

556
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,070
below this it's effectively a redstone
 

557
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:11,400
below this it's effectively a redstone
or a T flip-flop I don't have a light or

558
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:11,410
or a T flip-flop I don't have a light or
 

559
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,070
or a T flip-flop I don't have a light or
anything so we'll just use this to show

560
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:14,080
anything so we'll just use this to show
 

561
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,950
anything so we'll just use this to show
you when the repeaters on the circuit is

562
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:16,960
you when the repeaters on the circuit is
 

563
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,829
you when the repeaters on the circuit is
on what's off it's off so that's kind of

564
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:22,839
on what's off it's off so that's kind of
 

565
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:25,490
on what's off it's off so that's kind of
how I did the TTIP flops here this

566
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:25,500
how I did the TTIP flops here this
 

567
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,200
how I did the TTIP flops here this
pressure plate or these pressure plates

568
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,210
pressure plate or these pressure plates
 

569
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,650
pressure plate or these pressure plates
they go down here and this is my

570
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:30,660
they go down here and this is my
 

571
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,440
they go down here and this is my
monostable circuits and it goes to my

572
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:34,450
monostable circuits and it goes to my
 

573
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,660
monostable circuits and it goes to my
door wiring which connects to all the

574
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:36,670
door wiring which connects to all the
 

575
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,380
door wiring which connects to all the
Pistons and same with on the other side

576
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,390
Pistons and same with on the other side
 

577
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,710
Pistons and same with on the other side
here I'm going to spend the whole day on

578
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:43,720
here I'm going to spend the whole day on
 

579
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,920
here I'm going to spend the whole day on
this door I didn't want to but that's

580
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:46,930
this door I didn't want to but that's
 

581
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,490
this door I didn't want to but that's
how it's going so over here same thing I

582
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:50,500
how it's going so over here same thing I
 

583
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,680
how it's going so over here same thing I
got another one of those they're

584
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:52,690
got another one of those they're
 

585
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,240
got another one of those they're
independent of each other which is

586
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,250
independent of each other which is
 

587
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,030
independent of each other which is
important for what I what I've done here

588
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
important for what I what I've done here
 

589
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,460
important for what I what I've done here
and that goes to this bottom part below

590
00:16:59,460 --> 00:16:59,470
and that goes to this bottom part below
 

591
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,020
and that goes to this bottom part below
the piston and connects to the main part

592
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,030
the piston and connects to the main part
 

593
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:04,500
the piston and connects to the main part
of the door so where is the D flip-flop

594
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:04,510
of the door so where is the D flip-flop
 

595
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,470
of the door so where is the D flip-flop
you may ask it's the whole door

596
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:07,480
you may ask it's the whole door
 

597
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,370
you may ask it's the whole door
kind of so when those Pistons extends

598
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:13,380
kind of so when those Pistons extends
 

599
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,929
kind of so when those Pistons extends
you'll notice that the pistons aren't

600
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:15,939
you'll notice that the pistons aren't
 

601
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:17,250
you'll notice that the pistons aren't
extended right now even though the

602
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:17,260
extended right now even though the
 

603
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,090
extended right now even though the
blocks are out so it leaves the whole

604
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:21,100
blocks are out so it leaves the whole
 

605
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,259
blocks are out so it leaves the whole
door behind all eight Pistons so I

606
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:24,269
door behind all eight Pistons so I
 

607
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:29,850
door behind all eight Pistons so I
thought that was kind of cool since

608
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:29,860
thought that was kind of cool since
 

609
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,350
thought that was kind of cool since
these are independent it also allows us

610
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
these are independent it also allows us
 

611
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,620
these are independent it also allows us
to do something kind of cool if it

612
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:34,630
to do something kind of cool if it
 

613
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,940
to do something kind of cool if it
allows us to make a locking mechanism

614
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:35,950
allows us to make a locking mechanism
 

615
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,820
allows us to make a locking mechanism
for the door so if I have I can have a

616
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:38,830
for the door so if I have I can have a
 

617
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,440
for the door so if I have I can have a
button on one side and a lever on the

618
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,450
button on one side and a lever on the
 

619
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,409
button on one side and a lever on the
other side

620
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:42,419
other side
 

621
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:46,230
other side
all right control it with the lever

622
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
all right control it with the lever
 

623
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:55,620
all right control it with the lever
oh yeah every up and down is only one

624
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:55,630
oh yeah every up and down is only one
 

625
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:01,470
oh yeah every up and down is only one
pulse I was like why is it going so slow

626
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:01,480

 

627
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,080

those fast doors fast but if this is

628
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,090
those fast doors fast but if this is
 

629
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:11,460
those fast doors fast but if this is
powered wait yeah we can we can lock it

630
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:11,470
powered wait yeah we can we can lock it
 

631
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,009
powered wait yeah we can we can lock it
so that this button won't open it

632
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:14,019
so that this button won't open it
 

633
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:15,899
so that this button won't open it
anymore we can also lock it the other

634

close so I at the very edge of the
 

897
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,049
close so I at the very edge of the
glowing trees where I stopped putting

898
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:48,059
glowing trees where I stopped putting
 

899
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:51,200

maybe we'll get out of the boat it'll
 

907
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,830
maybe we'll get out of the boat it'll
probably be faster

908

of comes out over here bends around
 

927
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,320
of comes out over here bends around
and then it dead-ends and then there's

928
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,330
and then it dead-ends and then there's
 

929

dry dry land here and then there's a big
water area here that kind of comes out

932
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:53,850
water area here that kind of comes out
 

933
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,550
water area here that kind of comes out
and then dead ends so I want to connect

934
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:55,560
and then dead ends so I want to connect
 

935
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,910
and then dead ends so I want to connect
that with that and make it run through

936
00:26:58,910 --> 00:26:58,920
that with that and make it run through
 

937
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:08,300
