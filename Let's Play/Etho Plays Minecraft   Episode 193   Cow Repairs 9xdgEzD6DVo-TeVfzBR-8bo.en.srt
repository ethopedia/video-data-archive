98
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
um but then they changed another thing
 

99
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,590
um but then they changed another thing
where they made it so cows only jumped

100
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
where they made it so cows only jumped
 

101

where they made it so cows only jumped
uh if they're climbing up something like

if they're trying to get over this fence
 

105
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,990
if they're trying to get over this fence
he'll jump over

106
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
he'll jump over
 

107
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,309
he'll jump over
it but if they're just walking around

108
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
it but if they're just walking around
 

109
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,190
it but if they're just walking around
they won't jump

110
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200

 

111
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,710

and i've been watching them and that's

112
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
and i've been watching them and that's
 

113
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,470
and i've been watching them and that's
definitely true so

114
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
definitely true so
 

115
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,589
definitely true so
we we can convert this back to

116
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
we we can convert this back to
 

117
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,990
we we can convert this back to
a wheat farm as well if we put some

118
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
a wheat farm as well if we put some
 

119
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,830
a wheat farm as well if we put some
fences

120
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
fences
 

121
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,869
fences
in between keep them from jumping

122
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
in between keep them from jumping
 

123
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,470
in between keep them from jumping
so if they can't make it over they won't

124
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
so if they can't make it over they won't
 

125
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,229
so if they can't make it over they won't
try

357
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,020

00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
world i just kept having more and stuff
 

377
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,510
world i just kept having more and stuff
more and more stuff break and it got to

378
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
more and more stuff break and it got to
 

379
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,589
more and more stuff break and it got to
the point where over 50 percent

380
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
the point where over 50 percent
 

381
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,189
the point where over 50 percent
of the stuff in the world wasn't going

382
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
of the stuff in the world wasn't going
 

383
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:39,029
of the stuff in the world wasn't going
to work anymore

384
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039

 

385
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,829

hmm okay one second here

387
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,150

okay so it would be a real shame if we

388
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
okay so it would be a real shame if we
 

389
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,829
okay so it would be a real shame if we
did all this with the wheat farm and we

390
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
did all this with the wheat farm and we
 

391
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,030
did all this with the wheat farm and we
didn't fix

392
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
didn't fix
 

393
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,350
didn't fix
the ufo as well so let's check this out

394
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
the ufo as well so let's check this out
 

395
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,230
the ufo as well so let's check this out
and see what we need to do

396
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
and see what we need to do
 

397
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,150
and see what we need to do
to finish it

398
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
and my world got corrupted and
 

405
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,829

408
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
erased when i loaded the back up
 

409
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,470
erased when i loaded the back up
and i haven't fixed it since

410
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480

 

411

so i have to i got to fill this up
 

413
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,750
so i have to i got to fill this up
with water another layer at least

414
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
with water another layer at least
 

415
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,310
with water another layer at least
and

416
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320

426
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
flow
 

427
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,870
flow
to here and then

428
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880

 

429
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,710

see if we can make the shot

430
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720

 

431
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,430

oh beautiful make the water go this way
 

433
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,990
oh beautiful make the water go this way
and then we'll

434
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
and then we'll
 

435
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,630
and then we'll
have a a hole that comes down around

436
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
have a a hole that comes down around
 

437
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,590
have a a hole that comes down around
here

438
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
here
 

439
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,710
here
and we'll drop the cows right like where

440
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
and we'll drop the cows right like where
 

441
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,829
and we'll drop the cows right like where
this torch is

442
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
this torch is
 

443
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,949
this torch is
right in the center and that'll give us

444
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
right in the center and that'll give us
 

445
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,550
right in the center and that'll give us
something we can put lighting around

446
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
something we can put lighting around
 

447
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,310
something we can put lighting around
here as well because

448
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
here as well because
 

449
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,630
here as well because
i haven't been able to hide the lighting

450
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
i haven't been able to hide the lighting
 

451
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,829
i haven't been able to hide the lighting
all that well and we

452
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
all that well and we
 

453
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,590
all that well and we
if we have something in the middle of

454
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
if we have something in the middle of
 

455
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,750
if we have something in the middle of
this fence to break it up

456
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
this fence to break it up
 

457
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,750
this fence to break it up
we can hide some extra lighting around

458
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
we can hide some extra lighting around
 

459
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,110
we can hide some extra lighting around
here

460
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120

 

461
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,150

stream
 

481
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,670
stream
uh converging converging can

482
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
uh converging converging can
 

483
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,790
uh converging converging can
coming together at that hole it's meant

484
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
coming together at that hole it's meant
 

485
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,389
coming together at that hole it's meant
for the cows in case we ever have to

486
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
for the cows in case we ever have to
 

487
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,190
for the cows in case we ever have to
reload this

488
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
reload this
 

489
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,069
reload this
but occasionally a mob will make its way

490
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079

but what i'll do with this we're gonna
put

510
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
put
 

511
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,710

leaves along here

512
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720

 

513
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,069

and then put water next to them

514
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079

 

515
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,710

and we should put a infinite spring

516
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
and we should put a infinite spring
 

517
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,150
and we should put a infinite spring
somewhere too

518
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160

 

519
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,150

yeah right there

520
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160

 

521
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,990

so we gotta go all the way along got to

522
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
so we gotta go all the way along got to
 

523
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,069
so we gotta go all the way along got to
place every single water source there's

524
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
place every single water source there's
 

525
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,230
place every single water source there's
no shortcut to that

526
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
no shortcut to that
 

527
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,910
no shortcut to that
because there's no there's no ground

528
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
because there's no there's no ground
 

529
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:54,150
because there's no there's no ground
below to make a infinite water source

530
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160

 

531
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:03,110

and i'll be back when i'm done that

532
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120

 

533
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,350

okay i got the second water layer done

534
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
okay i got the second water layer done
 

535
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,310
okay i got the second water layer done
uh we need

536
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
uh we need
 

537
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,990
uh we need
the water fairly thick because if i

538
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
the water fairly thick because if i
 

539
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,790
the water fairly thick because if i
remember right before

540
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
remember right before
 

541
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,550
remember right before
sometimes the cow would the cows would

542
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
sometimes the cow would the cows would
 

543
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,870
sometimes the cow would the cows would
fall through if it wasn't thick enough

544
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
fall through if it wasn't thick enough
 

545
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,470
fall through if it wasn't thick enough
like before they would start swimming

546
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
like before they would start swimming
 

547
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,990
like before they would start swimming
they would come up and they'd just fall

548
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
they would come up and they'd just fall
 

549
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,430
they would come up and they'd just fall
down through

550
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
down through
 

551
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,350
down through
this is where we will stand for the ufo

552
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
this is where we will stand for the ufo
 

553
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,550
this is where we will stand for the ufo
um put a rim around this we're going to

554
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:26,560
um put a rim around this we're going to
 

555
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,670
um put a rim around this we're going to
try to make the water go

556
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
try to make the water go
 

557
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,069
try to make the water go
this way different than we did it before

558
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
this way different than we did it before
 

559
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,990
this way different than we did it before
so i got a row of water in the back i

560
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
so i got a row of water in the back i
 

561
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,550
so i got a row of water in the back i
gotta make it spread now

562
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
gotta make it spread now
 

563
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,670
gotta make it spread now
which i can do by

564
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
which i can do by
 

565
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:47,590
which i can do by
doing that to make it go out

566
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600

 

567
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,710

okay and then that will only go eight

568
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
okay and then that will only go eight
 

569
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,190
okay and then that will only go eight
blocks is the thing so

570
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,200
blocks is the thing so
 

571
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,870
blocks is the thing so
starts there one two three

572
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
starts there one two three
 

573
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,550
starts there one two three
four five six

574
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
four five six
 

575
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,910
four five six
seven eight so the water is going to end

576
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
seven eight so the water is going to end
 

577
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,910
seven eight so the water is going to end
right about there

578
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920

 

579
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,310

and we need to make it go further yet so

580
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
and we need to make it go further yet so
 

581
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,230
and we need to make it go further yet so
i'm going to try

582
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
i'm going to try
 

583
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,310
i'm going to try
this out we'll have an iron bar

584
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320

 

585
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,230

stretching along here

586
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
stretching along here
 

587
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,670
stretching along here
could also use signs for this but i'm

588
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:21,680
could also use signs for this but i'm
 

589
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,509
could also use signs for this but i'm
going to try an iron bar

590
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
going to try an iron bar
 

591
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,629
going to try an iron bar
and then

592
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
and then
 

593
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,670
and then
one layer up have another one i don't

594
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
one layer up have another one i don't
 

595
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,389
one layer up have another one i don't
know if a cow will fit through that

596
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
know if a cow will fit through that
 

597
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,110
know if a cow will fit through that
that's what i'm trying to do um

598
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120

 

599
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,949

i know a player can fit through this no

600
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
i know a player can fit through this no
 

601
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,430
i know a player can fit through this no
problem um

602
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
problem um
 

603
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,430
problem um
because this will actually wait a minute

604
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440
because this will actually wait a minute
 

605
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,269
because this will actually wait a minute
wait a minute

606
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
wait a minute
 

607
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,949
wait a minute
i'm not careful the cows might get

608
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
i'm not careful the cows might get
 

609
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:53,030
i'm not careful the cows might get
underneath here and drown

610
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040

 

611
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,470

hmm well anyway we'll have to play

612
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
hmm well anyway we'll have to play
 

613
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,069
hmm well anyway we'll have to play
around with this a bit i'm sure

614
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
around with this a bit i'm sure
 

615
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,750
around with this a bit i'm sure
but if a towel will fit up through here

616
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
but if a towel will fit up through here
 

617
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,350
but if a towel will fit up through here
i can put

618
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
i can put
 

619
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,389
i can put
another water source

620
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
another water source
 

621
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,550
another water source
right on top of this fence here and make

622
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
right on top of this fence here and make
 

623
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,470
right on top of this fence here and make
it go further

624
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480

 

625
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,470

okay well i'm going to show you how this

626
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
okay well i'm going to show you how this
 

627
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,990
okay well i'm going to show you how this
is intended

628
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
is intended
 

629
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,870
is intended
to work uh i'm a towel right now pretend

630
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
to work uh i'm a towel right now pretend
 

631
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,069
to work uh i'm a towel right now pretend
i'm a cow

632
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:20,079
i'm a cow
 

633
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,189
i'm a cow
i'm a cow i'm a cow i'm a cow

634
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
i'm a cow i'm a cow i'm a cow
 

635
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,069
i'm a cow i'm a cow i'm a cow
uh they'll hit this uh iron bar i'm

636
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
uh they'll hit this uh iron bar i'm
 

637
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,670
uh they'll hit this uh iron bar i'm
expecting they're gonna

638
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680
expecting they're gonna
 

639
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,389
expecting they're gonna
swim up and then fall down and i think

640
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:30,399
swim up and then fall down and i think
 

641
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,870
swim up and then fall down and i think
that will

642
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
that will
 

643
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,750
that will
allow them to go underneath and then

644
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760
allow them to go underneath and then
 

645
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,350
allow them to go underneath and then
they'll try to swim up again

646
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
they'll try to swim up again
 

647
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,750
they'll try to swim up again
because they're only going to be half in

648
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:37,760
because they're only going to be half in
 

649
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,350
because they're only going to be half in
this air space and half in the water

650
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
this air space and half in the water
 

651
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,069
this air space and half in the water
still so

652
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
still so
 

653
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,590
still so
they should still continue to swim

654
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
they should still continue to swim
 

655
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,590
they should still continue to swim
assuming they can fit between the two

656
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
assuming they can fit between the two
 

657
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,350
assuming they can fit between the two
iron bars

658
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
iron bars
 

659
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,670
iron bars
and then there's water streams at both

660
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
and then there's water streams at both
 

661
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,470
and then there's water streams at both
ends which

662
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
ends which
 

663
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,189
ends which
will pull them to the middle here and

664
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
will pull them to the middle here and
 

665
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,790
will pull them to the middle here and
then we'll make them go

666
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
then we'll make them go
 

667
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,150
then we'll make them go
this way with the one

668
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160
this way with the one
 

669
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,430
this way with the one
one block wide water stream so

670
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
one block wide water stream so
 

671
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,350
one block wide water stream so
what what we're trying to do essentially

672
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
what what we're trying to do essentially
 

673
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,030
what what we're trying to do essentially
here is to get

674
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
here is to get
 

675
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,790
here is to get
all the channels that come up in this

676
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
all the channels that come up in this
 

677
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,430
all the channels that come up in this
nine by nine area down to a one

678
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
nine by nine area down to a one
 

679
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,269
nine by nine area down to a one
wide water stream

680
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
wide water stream
 

681
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,550
wide water stream
which is easier said than done so i did

682
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
which is easier said than done so i did
 

683
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,470
which is easier said than done so i did
get a fishing rod we're gonna try it out

684
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
get a fishing rod we're gonna try it out
 

685
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,629
get a fishing rod we're gonna try it out
it's been a long time since i fished for

686
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
it's been a long time since i fished for
 

687
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,230
it's been a long time since i fished for

be

692
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160

 

693
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,470

696
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519

 

697
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,269

interesting let's try one more

698
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
interesting let's try one more
 

699
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,389
interesting let's try one more
maybe in a different spot

700
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
maybe in a different spot
 

701
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:50,550
maybe in a different spot
we'll do something different

702
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560

 

703
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,069

okay that is not working

704
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
okay that is not working
 

705
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,749
okay that is not working
oh oh he made it

706
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:57,759

 

707
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,430

he's too fat though why are you so fat

708
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
he's too fat though why are you so fat
 

709
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,350
he's too fat though why are you so fat
ah okay they cannot fit through that

710
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:05,360
ah okay they cannot fit through that
 

711
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,629
ah okay they cannot fit through that
could also move this back

712
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
could also move this back
 

713
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,189
could also move this back
no we can't

714
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199

 

715
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,550

so i think what it comes down to is i

716
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560
so i think what it comes down to is i
 

717
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,230
so i think what it comes down to is i
have to use the signs all across here

718
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,240
have to use the signs all across here
 

719
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,749
have to use the signs all across here

878
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,559
here
 

879
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,310
here
and this will be our way in and out

880
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,320

 

881
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,110

can we get back out yes okay the nice

882
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
can we get back out yes okay the nice
 

883
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,029
can we get back out yes okay the nice
thing about this

884
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:19,039
thing about this
 

885
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,110
thing about this
cows are fatter than the player they

886
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,120
cows are fatter than the player they
 

887
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,070
cows are fatter than the player they
cannot fit

888
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080

 

889
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,549

between this ladder like in this block

890
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:26,559
between this ladder like in this block
 

891
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,590
between this ladder like in this block
they're too fat

892
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
they're too fat
 

893
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,789
they're too fat
while we can so

894
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
while we can so
 

895
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,549
while we can so
works rest doesn't work for them there's

896
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:32,559
works rest doesn't work for them there's
 

897
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,270
works rest doesn't work for them there's
no chance of them swimming up that

898
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
no chance of them swimming up that
 

899
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,669
no chance of them swimming up that
this is the water path

900
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
this is the water path
 

901
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,029
this is the water path
basically they'll get flung up into

902
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:43,039
basically they'll get flung up into
 

903
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,270
basically they'll get flung up into
this huge block of water thing

904
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
this huge block of water thing
 

905
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,310
this huge block of water thing
just holding the space bar

906
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
just holding the space bar
 

907
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,549
just holding the space bar
they'll get pulled along here then

908
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:52,559
they'll get pulled along here then
 

909
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,230
they'll get pulled along here then
there's a

910
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,240
there's a
 

911
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,350
there's a
there's a it's higher here

912
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360
there's a it's higher here
 

913
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,909
there's a it's higher here
and that will align them into the center

914
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
and that will align them into the center
 

915
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,110
and that will align them into the center
even though

916
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
even though
 

917
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,750
even though
the fence gates won't do that the the

918
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
the fence gates won't do that the the
 

919
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,510
the fence gates won't do that the the
leaves here will

920
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,520
leaves here will
 

921
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,990
leaves here will
and the water stream ends perfectly

922
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
and the water stream ends perfectly
 

923
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,830
and the water stream ends perfectly
right

924
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
right
 

925
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,070
right
here so this is what where they'll get

926
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,080
here so this is what where they'll get
 

927
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,909
here so this is what where they'll get
dropped

928
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
dropped
 

929
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,310
dropped
hey whoa what is with all the creepers

00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,520
i'm assuming he came down here again
 

943
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,430
i'm assuming he came down here again
it's because i'm close to the surface

944
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,440
it's because i'm close to the surface
 

945
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,950
it's because i'm close to the surface
and they're tracking me

946
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
and they're tracking me
 

947
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,180
and they're tracking me
and finding their way down here

what it probably is i think they're
spawning in there

954
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,480
spawning in there
 

955
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,390
spawning in there
and messing up the carts

ah because i thought i fixed that there
might also be a cart stuck on the track

960
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
might also be a cart stuck on the track
 

961
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,830
might also be a cart stuck on the track

one of the weirdest water streams i've
 

995
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,149

ever done doesn't matter if it takes
 

997

them a long time just
 

999
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,789
them a long time just
as long as they get there

of the weirdest water streams i've ever
 

1005
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,950
of the weirdest water streams i've ever
done

1007
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,149

because i used iron bars and leaves

1008
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,159
because i used iron bars and leaves
 

1009
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,149
because i used iron bars and leaves
yeah okay

1015
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,230

i do want lighting around the base of it

1016
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:44,240
i do want lighting around the base of it
 

1017
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,669
i do want lighting around the base of it
to help light up this

1018
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
to help light up this
 

1019
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,830
to help light up this
area get rid of this torch it's like the

1020
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
area get rid of this torch it's like the
 

1021
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,110
area get rid of this torch it's like the
last well there's a few around here

1022
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,120
last well there's a few around here
 

1023
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,350
last well there's a few around here
still

1024
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,360
still
 

1025
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,590
still
some one of the last few though that we

1026
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
some one of the last few though that we
 

1027
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,310
some one of the last few though that we
need to get rid of

1028
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,320
need to get rid of
 

1029
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,870
need to get rid of
and if we have a fence

1030
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:02,880
and if we have a fence
 

1031
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,669
and if we have a fence
here and one here they won't be able to

1032
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679

we might change it to something else
 

1055
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,070
we might change it to something else
but we'll try the these out for a while

1056
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
but we'll try the these out for a while

underneath the iron
 

1107
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,070
underneath the iron
bars the reason is because it they get

1108
