21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,029

there's at least four

26
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480

 

27

so i know one of them is power one of

32
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
so i know one of them is power one of
 

33
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,750
so i know one of them is power one of
them's infinity

34
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
them's infinity
 

35
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,630

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
was
 

53
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,670
was
and also they improved the randomness

54
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
and also they improved the randomness
 

55
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,789
and also they improved the randomness
randomness thing

56
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799

103
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,229
or i didn't have enough levels for it
but today

104
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
but today
 

105
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,750
but today
we're going to do our first level 50

106
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760

107
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,470

enchantment on my first

108
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
enchantment on my first
 

109
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,309
enchantment on my first
i have enchanted a bow already but this

110
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
i have enchanted a bow already but this
 

111
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,150
i have enchanted a bow already but this
is my first high level enchantment i've

112
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
is my first high level enchantment i've
 

113
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,910
is my first high level enchantment i've
done on it so let's see how this goes

114
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920

 

115
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,670

infinity one is that good i don't know

116
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680

 

117
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,390

sounds good if i was to guess i'd say

118
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
sounds good if i was to guess i'd say
 

119
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,470
sounds good if i was to guess i'd say
infinity is probably the rarest but

120
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
infinity is probably the rarest but
 

121
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,030
infinity is probably the rarest but
that's just my instinct not based on

122
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
that's just my instinct not based on
 

123
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,110
that's just my instinct not based on
fact i have no idea

124
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
fact i have no idea
 

125
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,229
fact i have no idea
so let's try this out apparently if you

126
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
so let's try this out apparently if you
 

127
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,030
so let's try this out apparently if you
have at least

128
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
have at least
 

129
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,949
have at least
one arrow in your inventory it won't

130
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
one arrow in your inventory it won't
 

131
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,309
one arrow in your inventory it won't
you won't run out

132
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319

 

133
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,470

and that seems to be true

134
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480

 

135
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,149

oh so you can't actually pick them up

136
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
oh so you can't actually pick them up
 

137
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,070
oh so you can't actually pick them up
that's what i was wondering about

138
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
that's what i was wondering about
 

139
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,710
that's what i was wondering about
because it seemed like you could create

140
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
because it seemed like you could create
 

141
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,149
because it seemed like you could create
infinite arrows if you could pick them

142
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
infinite arrows if you could pick them
 

143
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,430
infinite arrows if you could pick them
up

144
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440

 

145
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,789

awesome so i wonder if i have more than

146
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
awesome so i wonder if i have more than
 

147
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,390
awesome so i wonder if i have more than
one in my inventory if uh

148
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
one in my inventory if uh
 

149
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:50,229
one in my inventory if uh
if it'll use them so we had 22

150
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239

 

151
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,149

still 22. okay that's awesome so it

152
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
still 22. okay that's awesome so it
 

153
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,830
still 22. okay that's awesome so it
doesn't use them at all but you can't

154
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
doesn't use them at all but you can't
 

155
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,630
doesn't use them at all but you can't
pick them up

156
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
pick them up
 

157
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,949
pick them up
after you shoot them so that that seems

158
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
after you shoot them so that that seems
 

159
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,550
after you shoot them so that that seems
like a fair trade

160
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
like a fair trade
 

161
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,070
like a fair trade
good skill and bows do

162
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
good skill and bows do
 

163
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,390
good skill and bows do
break fairly quickly so it's not i don't

164
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
break fairly quickly so it's not i don't
 

165
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,309
break fairly quickly so it's not i don't
think it's overpowered either

166
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
think it's overpowered either
 

167
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,869
think it's overpowered either
so all in all that's a pretty pretty

168
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
so all in all that's a pretty pretty
 

169
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,630
so all in all that's a pretty pretty
awesome addition to the game

170
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640

 

171
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,309

all right i've heard another interesting

172
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319

apparently it's a little
 

241
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,830
apparently it's a little
challenging to do

242
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
challenging to do
 

243
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,710

otherwise
they seem to go right through it without

00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
they seem to go right through it without
 

255
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,629
they seem to go right through it without
catching fire

256
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
catching fire
 

257
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,790
catching fire

258
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
although if i make this a little bit
 

259
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,510
although if i make this a little bit
wider probably

260
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
wider probably
 

261
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,309
wider probably
we'll be able to do it more often

262
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319

 

263
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,309

291
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:35,110

yeah i'm pretty sure fire won't spread

292
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120

 

293
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,950

doesn't look like it's

294
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960

 

295
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,710

299
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,589
not for surely proof but i would be very
surprised if that did work

300
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,310
a lot of people seem to think that the

00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
ai improved with this patch as far as i
 

363
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,430
ai improved with this patch as far as i
can tell it has

364

can tell it has
 

365
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,550
can tell it has
not actually probably come later

366
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
not actually probably come later
 

367
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,110
not actually probably come later
if it does come oh yeah and the big

368
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
if it does come oh yeah and the big
 

369
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,710
if it does come oh yeah and the big
thing we gotta check out here is the

370
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
thing we gotta check out here is the
 

371
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,509
thing we gotta check out here is the
wheat farm

372
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
wheat farm
 

373
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,630
wheat farm
there's apparently some changes with

374
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
there's apparently some changes with
 

375
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,150
there's apparently some changes with
trampoline

376
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
trampoline
 

377
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,269
trampoline
and i went the wrong way here still not

378
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
and i went the wrong way here still not
 

379
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,750
and i went the wrong way here still not
used to

380
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760

 

381
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,030

having that a little bit more fixed

382
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
having that a little bit more fixed
 

383
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,710
having that a little bit more fixed
let's see we gotta go over here

384
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720

 

385
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,310

i'll clean this up eventually

386
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
i'll clean this up eventually
 

387
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,150
i'll clean this up eventually
right so i'm going to

388
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
right so i'm going to
 

389
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,750
right so i'm going to
i'm not going to do the whole thing just

390
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
i'm not going to do the whole thing just
 

391
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,910
i'm not going to do the whole thing just
in case

392
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
in case
 

393
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,430
in case
this doesn't work i'm not sure if it

394
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
this doesn't work i'm not sure if it
 

395
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,990
this doesn't work i'm not sure if it
will work

396
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
will work
 

397
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,150
will work
i've heard different things but i know

398
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
i've heard different things but i know
 

399
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,030
i've heard different things but i know
it won't trample if i'm walking on it

400
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
it won't trample if i'm walking on it
 

401
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,030
it won't trample if i'm walking on it
or if the cows walk on it it sounds like

402
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
or if the cows walk on it it sounds like
 

403
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,069
or if the cows walk on it it sounds like
they won't

404
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
they won't
 

405
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,990
they won't
trample it but if uh i think if i jump

406
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
trample it but if uh i think if i jump
 

407
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,430
trample it but if uh i think if i jump
or if they jump on it

408
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
or if they jump on it
 

409
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,910
or if they jump on it
it will trample the farmland

410
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920

 

411
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,550

we'll see what happens here

412
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560

 

413
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,949

yeah you just saw you trampled it there

414
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
yeah you just saw you trampled it there
 

415
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,310
yeah you just saw you trampled it there
she just trampled

416
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
she just trampled
 

417
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,509
she just trampled
there if you want to get technical um

418
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519

 

419
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,190

we'll see what happens here i got plenty

420
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,200
we'll see what happens here i got plenty
 

421
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,630
we'll see what happens here i got plenty
of seats to waste anyway

422
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
of seats to waste anyway
 

423
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,509
of seats to waste anyway
and if this doesn't work still i will

424
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
and if this doesn't work still i will
 

425
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,949
and if this doesn't work still i will
probably eventually make a new farm

426
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
probably eventually make a new farm
 

427
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,829
probably eventually make a new farm
i actually really wanted to make a

428
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
i actually really wanted to make a
 

429
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,190
i actually really wanted to make a
redstone project

430
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
redstone project
 

431
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,230
redstone project
lately i'll probably do something a

432
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
lately i'll probably do something a
 

433
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,870
lately i'll probably do something a
little bit more

434
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
little bit more
 

435
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,470
little bit more
redstone intensive soon because uh

436
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
redstone intensive soon because uh
 

437
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,590
redstone intensive soon because uh
i'm in the mood we'll see how that goes

438
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
i'm in the mood we'll see how that goes
 

439
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,069
i'm in the mood we'll see how that goes
there

440
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:08,079
there
 

441
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,509
there
actually what i've been wanting to do is

442
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
actually what i've been wanting to do is
 

443
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,910
actually what i've been wanting to do is
set up the trivia game again

444
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
set up the trivia game again
 

445
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,110
set up the trivia game again
and i have figured out a general idea of

446
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
and i have figured out a general idea of
 

447
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,230
and i have figured out a general idea of
where i want to build it

448
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
where i want to build it
 

449
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,110
where i want to build it
it's going to be in the tree farm-ish

450
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
it's going to be in the tree farm-ish
 

451
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,389
it's going to be in the tree farm-ish
area

452
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
area
 

453
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,470
area
most likely somewhere around

454
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
most likely somewhere around
 

455
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,949
most likely somewhere around
in the walls maybe or i don't know

456
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
in the walls maybe or i don't know
 

457
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,069
in the walls maybe or i don't know
i will have to work it

458
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
i will have to work it
 

459
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,550
i will have to work it
finishing this a little bit better i'll

460
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
finishing this a little bit better i'll
 

461
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,350
finishing this a little bit better i'll
probably

462
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
probably
 

463
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,310
probably
replace a lot of these trees with the

464
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
replace a lot of these trees with the
 

465
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,430
replace a lot of these trees with the
regular trees and

466
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
regular trees and
 

467
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,110
regular trees and
with the pine trees as well so we can

468
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
with the pine trees as well so we can
 

469
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,230
with the pine trees as well so we can
get all three types of wood in here

470
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
get all three types of wood in here
 

471
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,470
get all three types of wood in here
and if i get time today i will try to

472
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
and if i get time today i will try to
 

473
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,310
and if i get time today i will try to
add some more names to this and if i do

474
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
add some more names to this and if i do
 

475
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,069
add some more names to this and if i do
that then i can

476
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
that then i can
 

477
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,670
that then i can
release the world again so hopefully

478
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
release the world again so hopefully
 

479
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,190
release the world again so hopefully
it doesn't get too late here it's like

480
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
it doesn't get too late here it's like
 

481
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,870
it doesn't get too late here it's like
10 30 right now so

482
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
10 30 right now so
 

483
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,910
10 30 right now so
depending on how long it takes this is

484
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
depending on how long it takes this is
 

485
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,790
depending on how long it takes this is
actually

486
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
actually
 

487
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,949
actually

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,150

and let's see oh yeah fence gates

504
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
and let's see oh yeah fence gates
 

505
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,670
and let's see oh yeah fence gates
sounds like there's another slime coming

506

sounds like there's another slime coming
 

507
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,230
sounds like there's another slime coming
up fence gates have been

508
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
up fence gates have been
 

509
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,949
up fence gates have been
changed i do not have any here

510
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
changed i do not have any here
 

511

i do have some apparently you can
 

513
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,150
i do have some apparently you can
control them with redstone now which is

514
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
control them with redstone now which is
 

515
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,310
control them with redstone now which is
an awesome

516
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
an awesome
 

517
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,550
an awesome
improvement

518
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560

 

519
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,590

they should have done that from the

520
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
they should have done that from the
 

521
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,590
they should have done that from the
beginning

522
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600

 

523
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,350

awesome so i wonder how it's going to

524
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
awesome so i wonder how it's going to
 

525
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,030
awesome so i wonder how it's going to
work out i'm going to get some redstone

526
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
work out i'm going to get some redstone
 

527
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,269
work out i'm going to get some redstone
together and just see how

528
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:55,279
together and just see how
 

529
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,430
together and just see how
we can cause this to open and close

530
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
we can cause this to open and close
 

531
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,030
we can cause this to open and close
so i just want to take a minute to see

532
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
so i just want to take a minute to see
 

533
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,870
so i just want to take a minute to see
how the fence gates interact with

534
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
how the fence gates interact with
 

535
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,670
how the fence gates interact with
redstone

536
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
redstone
 

537
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,389
redstone
so first of all let's try torches next

538
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
so first of all let's try torches next
 

539
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,949
so first of all let's try torches next
to it

540
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959

 

541
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,310

yep that does it um we'll send

542
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
yep that does it um we'll send
 

543
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,509
yep that does it um we'll send
power directly to it with a wire

544
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
power directly to it with a wire
 

545
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,389
power directly to it with a wire
that opens it if it's not pointing at it

546
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
that opens it if it's not pointing at it
 

547
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,910
that opens it if it's not pointing at it
does not power it

548
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920

 

549
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,110

if it's at the same level anyway

550
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
if it's at the same level anyway
 

551
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,310
if it's at the same level anyway
okay um let's see

552
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
okay um let's see
 

553
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,230
okay um let's see
repeater yeah that works i

554
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
repeater yeah that works i
 

555
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,629
repeater yeah that works i
can pretty sure it doesn't send power

556
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:36,639
can pretty sure it doesn't send power
 

557
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,150
can pretty sure it doesn't send power
through it

558
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
through it
 

559
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,790
through it
nope um

560
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800

 

561
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,590

see what else oh yeah let's try

562
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
see what else oh yeah let's try
 

563
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,870
see what else oh yeah let's try
send power through a block to it

564
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
send power through a block to it
 

565
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,350
send power through a block to it
that opened it okay

566
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360

 

567
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,790

oh it's stuck open now that's weird

568
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
oh it's stuck open now that's weird
 

569
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,230
oh it's stuck open now that's weird
wonder why that happened

570
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240

 

571
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,949

hmm

572
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959

 

573
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:23,269

was it doing that before

574
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279

 

575
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,189

that's just when you remove the repeater

576
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:25,199
that's just when you remove the repeater
 

577
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,670
that's just when you remove the repeater
okay that's probably just a

578
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680
okay that's probably just a
 

579
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,030
okay that's probably just a
unrelated glitch in the game uh what

580
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
unrelated glitch in the game uh what
 

581
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,470
unrelated glitch in the game uh what
else can we try here

582
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480

 

583
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,590

power above yep that opens it what about

584
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
power above yep that opens it what about
 

585
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,030
power above yep that opens it what about
if we have it like this

586
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,040
if we have it like this
 

587
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,629
if we have it like this
redstone torch above that works

588
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
redstone torch above that works
 

589
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,750
redstone torch above that works
um it's good to do this when new block

590
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
um it's good to do this when new block
 

591
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,110
um it's good to do this when new block
comes out just to

592
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120
comes out just to
 

593
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,829
comes out just to
get familiar with it new input device or

594
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839

 

595
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,710

receiver

596
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
receiver
 

597
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,590
receiver
okay so behaves much like i was

598
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
okay so behaves much like i was
 

599
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,949
okay so behaves much like i was
expecting

600
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
expecting
 

601
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,310
expecting
um try maybe from below yet too

602
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
um try maybe from below yet too
 

603
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,470
um try maybe from below yet too
so the thing that really interests me

604
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
so the thing that really interests me
 

605
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,350
so the thing that really interests me
about these

606
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,360
about these
 

607
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,389
about these
is i believe this is the first block

608
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
is i believe this is the first block
 

609
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,710
is i believe this is the first block
that opened it good i believe this is

610
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
that opened it good i believe this is
 

611
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,910
that opened it good i believe this is
the first block

612
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:17,920
the first block
 

613
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,790
the first block
um that you can move with pistons that

614
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
um that you can move with pistons that
 

615
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,430
um that you can move with pistons that
you can then

616
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
you can then
 

617
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,550
you can then
control with redstone so like doors

618
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
control with redstone so like doors
 

619
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,870
control with redstone so like doors
you can't move with pistons trapdoors

620
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
you can't move with pistons trapdoors
 

621
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,829
you can't move with pistons trapdoors
you can't move with pistons

622
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
you can't move with pistons
 

623
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,710
you can't move with pistons
um and that has a collision mask i

624
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
um and that has a collision mask i
 

625
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,990
um and that has a collision mask i
should say

626
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,000
should say
 

627
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,269
should say
so might be some potential uses for that

628
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,279
so might be some potential uses for that
 

629
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,350
so might be some potential uses for that
i have to think about it

630
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
i have to think about it
 

631
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,629
i have to think about it
sure somebody will come up with

632
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
sure somebody will come up with
 

633
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,269
sure somebody will come up with
something cool

634
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279

 

635
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,269

all right let's move on to something

636
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
all right let's move on to something
 

637
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,590
all right let's move on to something
else

638
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600

 

639
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,509

so overall i can say i really like the

640
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
so overall i can say i really like the
 

641
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,949
so overall i can say i really like the
1.1 patch

642
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
1.1 patch
 

643
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,629
1.1 patch
but there's one change they made i don't

644
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
but there's one change they made i don't
 

645
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,189
but there's one change they made i don't
like

646
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
like
 

647
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,870
like
and i think it's really stupid that they

648
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880
and i think it's really stupid that they
 

649
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,110
and i think it's really stupid that they
did this but the latter

650
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
did this but the latter
 

651
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,030
did this but the latter
collision mast is gone so

652
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,040
collision mast is gone so
 

653
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,069
collision mast is gone so
they act a lot different now to a lot of

654
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
they act a lot different now to a lot of
 

655
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,670
they act a lot different now to a lot of
people this wasn't really a big deal but

656
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
people this wasn't really a big deal but
 

657
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,949
people this wasn't really a big deal but
it does

658
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:08,959
it does
 

659
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,269
it does
bug me quite a bit it wrecks a lot of

660
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:13,279
bug me quite a bit it wrecks a lot of
 

661
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,269
bug me quite a bit it wrecks a lot of
parkour maps adventure maps um

662
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
parkour maps adventure maps um
 

663
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,710
parkour maps adventure maps um
and it doesn't seem to really have any

664
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
and it doesn't seem to really have any
 

665
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,110
and it doesn't seem to really have any
benefits so it's just an annoying change

666
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
benefits so it's just an annoying change
 

667
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,670
benefits so it's just an annoying change
in my opinion

668
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
in my opinion
 

669
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,430
in my opinion
so you can't stand at the top of ladders

670
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
so you can't stand at the top of ladders
 

671
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,590
so you can't stand at the top of ladders
anymore which means i can't jump

672
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
anymore which means i can't jump
 

673
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,389
anymore which means i can't jump
up here so i'll have to make that go all

674
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
up here so i'll have to make that go all
 

675
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,509
up here so i'll have to make that go all
the way to the top

676
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
the way to the top
 

677
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,870
the way to the top
if i want to use it like i

678
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
if i want to use it like i
 

679
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,829
if i want to use it like i
was originally there but the main reason

680
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
was originally there but the main reason
 

681
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,629
was originally there but the main reason
it's annoying me

682
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
it's annoying me
 

683
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,310
it's annoying me
is because ladders were actually quite

684
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
is because ladders were actually quite
 

685
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,069
is because ladders were actually quite
useful for dealing with mobs

686
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:46,079
useful for dealing with mobs
 

687
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,790
useful for dealing with mobs
when they had a collision mask and you

688
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
when they had a collision mask and you
 

689
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,990
when they had a collision mask and you
could even use them as a mob

690
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
could even use them as a mob
 

691
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,430
could even use them as a mob
evader if you could squeeze two

692
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440

 

693
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,269

like slimes together they would

694
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
like slimes together they would
 

695
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,230
like slimes together they would
automatically climb up ladders or two

696
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
automatically climb up ladders or two
 

697
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,309
automatically climb up ladders or two
oops two of any mob would be able to

698
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
oops two of any mob would be able to
 

699
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,510
oops two of any mob would be able to
climb up the ladders and now i don't

700
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
climb up the ladders and now i don't
 

701
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,549
climb up the ladders and now i don't
think that's gonna work

702
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
think that's gonna work
 

703
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,949
think that's gonna work
uh eats road you'll have to use

704
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
uh eats road you'll have to use
 

705
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,870
uh eats road you'll have to use
trapdoors or something instead of

706
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
trapdoors or something instead of
 

707
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,069
trapdoors or something instead of
ladders

708
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
ladders
 

709
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,429
ladders
which again is annoying

710
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439

 

711
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,350

if you use the old design of course we

712
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,360
if you use the old design of course we
 

713
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,829
if you use the old design of course we
have glass panes now

714
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839

 

715
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,429

another change of course is you can

716
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
another change of course is you can
 

717
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,429
another change of course is you can
apparently get apples from these

718
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
apparently get apples from these
 

719
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,950
apparently get apples from these
oak trees

720
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960

 

721
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,150

with a very rare chance

722
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,160

 

723
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,070

villages i've heard have a

724
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,080
villages i've heard have a
 

725
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,750
villages i've heard have a
chest you can get i don't know what's in

726
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
chest you can get i don't know what's in
 

727
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,190
chest you can get i don't know what's in
it

728
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,200
it
 

729
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,830
it
there's been some biome changes smoother

730
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:44,840
there's been some biome changes smoother
 

731
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,470
there's been some biome changes smoother
transitions

732
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
transitions
 

733
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,909
transitions
oh yeah let's let's check that out

734
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
oh yeah let's let's check that out
 

735
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,150
oh yeah let's let's check that out
smoother transitions i'm curious about

736
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
smoother transitions i'm curious about
 

737
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,029
smoother transitions i'm curious about
that because

738
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:51,039
that because
 

739
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,510
that because
i know over by the mountain there it's

740
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
i know over by the mountain there it's
 

741
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,950
i know over by the mountain there it's
really

742
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:54,960
really
 

743
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,150
really
really nasty or it was

744
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
really nasty or it was
 

745
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,950
really nasty or it was
it's all brown the grass let's check it

746
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
it's all brown the grass let's check it
 

747
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,590
it's all brown the grass let's check it
out now

748
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600

 

749
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,350

yeah i don't know it still looks pretty

750
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360
yeah i don't know it still looks pretty
 

751
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,430
yeah i don't know it still looks pretty
brown to me

752
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
brown to me
 

753
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,950
brown to me
um over here it seems like there's a

754
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
um over here it seems like there's a
 

755
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,510
um over here it seems like there's a
sharp change too

756
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
sharp change too
 

757
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,870
sharp change too
let's take a look

758
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880

 

759
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,630

um it is smoother but not

760
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:22,640
um it is smoother but not
 

761
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,870
um it is smoother but not
it's still really noticeable

762
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
it's still really noticeable
 

763
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,830
it's still really noticeable
kind of uh spreads it out over three or

764
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
kind of uh spreads it out over three or
 

765
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,110
kind of uh spreads it out over three or
four blocks instead of

766
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
four blocks instead of
 

767
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,190
four blocks instead of
changing instantly which is better but

768
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
changing instantly which is better but
 

769
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,710
changing instantly which is better but
it's still

770
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
it's still
 

771
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,270
it's still
really noticeable

772
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,280

 

773
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,390

i'm out of food

774
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400

 

775
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,029

oh yeah we got an apple from that so i

776
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
oh yeah we got an apple from that so i
 

777
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,909
oh yeah we got an apple from that so i
guess it's a one

778
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
guess it's a one
 

779
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,630
guess it's a one
in 200 chance of dropping from oak

780
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:50,640
in 200 chance of dropping from oak
 

781
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,909
in 200 chance of dropping from oak
leaves when they die

782
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:51,919
leaves when they die
 

783
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,110
leaves when they die
or decay which doesn't sound like much

784
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
or decay which doesn't sound like much
 

785
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,789
or decay which doesn't sound like much
but i think your average tree

786
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:56,799
but i think your average tree
 

787
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,990
but i think your average tree
probably is going to have i'm just

788
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
probably is going to have i'm just
 

789
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,630
probably is going to have i'm just
looking at

790
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
looking at
 

791
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,390
looking at
like this is a really small tree here

792
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
like this is a really small tree here
 

793
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,950
like this is a really small tree here
i'm sure there's at least 25

794
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:04,960
i'm sure there's at least 25
 

795
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,230
i'm sure there's at least 25
leaf blocks there so every eight trees

796
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
leaf blocks there so every eight trees
 

797
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,590
leaf blocks there so every eight trees
you cut down like that will probably

798
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
you cut down like that will probably
 

799
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,430
you cut down like that will probably
give you one apple which isn't bad

800
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,440
give you one apple which isn't bad
 

801
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:11,990
give you one apple which isn't bad
really

802
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
really
 

803
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,830
really
if you cut down a big tree like that

804
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
if you cut down a big tree like that
 

805
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,350
if you cut down a big tree like that
you're

806
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
you're
 

807
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,630
you're
most likely guaranteed to get one

808
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
most likely guaranteed to get one
 

809
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,310
most likely guaranteed to get one
so um

810
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,320
so um
 

811
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,590
so um
it's nice there in the game they've been

812
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
it's nice there in the game they've been
 

813
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,990
it's nice there in the game they've been
in the game for months now but there's

814
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
in the game for months now but there's
 

815
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,630
in the game for months now but there's
no way

816
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
no way
 

817
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,310
no way
there was no way of legitimately getting

818
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
there was no way of legitimately getting
 

819
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,230
there was no way of legitimately getting
them until recently you

820
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,240
them until recently you
 

821
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,630
them until recently you
you could get them in strongholds and

822
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640
you could get them in strongholds and
 

823
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,789
you could get them in strongholds and
now you can actually get them

824
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:34,799
now you can actually get them
 

825
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,230
now you can actually get them
from a renewable source

826
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240

 

827
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,230

and once you do get apples you can make

828
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240
and once you do get apples you can make
 

829
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,630
and once you do get apples you can make
golden apples using nuggets now

830
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
golden apples using nuggets now
 

831
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,390
golden apples using nuggets now
you only need eight and every

832
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
you only need eight and every
 

833
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,710
you only need eight and every
iron ore you get can be converted into

834
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720
iron ore you get can be converted into
 

835
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,990
iron ore you get can be converted into
nine of these so it's

836
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
nine of these so it's
 

837
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,270
nine of these so it's
not not a terrible trade

838
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,280
not not a terrible trade
 

839
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,750
not not a terrible trade
to get such an awesome item

840
00:19:59,750 --> 00:19:59,760
to get such an awesome item
 

841
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,870
to get such an awesome item
let's see let's try this out so i think

842
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:02,880
let's see let's try this out so i think
 

843
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,470
let's see let's try this out so i think
um these have been nerfed though

844
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
um these have been nerfed though
 

845
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,669
um these have been nerfed though
in the latest patch see we got four

846
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:09,679
in the latest patch see we got four
 

847
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,990
in the latest patch see we got four
heart damage

848
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,000
heart damage
 

849
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,950
heart damage
eat it we got i think four seconds of

850
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:14,960
eat it we got i think four seconds of
 

851
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,830
eat it we got i think four seconds of
regeneration

852
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840

 

853
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,750

um only recovered three hearts in that

854
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,760
um only recovered three hearts in that
 

855
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,110
um only recovered three hearts in that
time so i think

856
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,120
time so i think
 

857
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,110
time so i think
eating a golden apple probably boosts

858
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,120
eating a golden apple probably boosts
 

859
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,990
eating a golden apple probably boosts
your hearts by two and a half

your hearts by two and a half
 

861
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,789
your hearts by two and a half
in that time if i was to guess and of

862
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
in that time if i was to guess and of

it potions
 

867
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,310
it potions
are probably better the regeneration

868
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320

i had this thing in my world with cheap
 

969
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,830
i had this thing in my world with cheap
going

970
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:19,840
going
 

971
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,630
going
um sheep going around a loop for

972
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,640
um sheep going around a loop for
 

973
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,510
um sheep going around a loop for
decoration

974
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
decoration
 

975
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,510
decoration
and i think the mine cart was on fire

976
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,520
and i think the mine cart was on fire
 

977
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,350
and i think the mine cart was on fire
too i can't remember

978
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
too i can't remember
 

979
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,669
too i can't remember
so i probably will try to do something

980
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
so i probably will try to do something
 

981
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,950
so i probably will try to do something
similar

982
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
similar
 

983
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,110
similar
to that with slimes i might try make a

984
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,120
to that with slimes i might try make a
 

985
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,110
to that with slimes i might try make a
endless loop for the big slimes to go

986
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
endless loop for the big slimes to go
 

987
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,270
endless loop for the big slimes to go
around the tree farm or something just

988
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,280
around the tree farm or something just
 

989
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,710
around the tree farm or something just
for comedic value

990
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720

 

991
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,230

let's see

992
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
let's see
 

993
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,590
let's see
it won't be there we go that seemed to

994
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:53,600
it won't be there we go that seemed to
 

995
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,110
it won't be there we go that seemed to
work

996
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
work
 

997
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,630
work
i will have to be careful though that i

998
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
i will have to be careful though that i
 

999
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,510
i will have to be careful though that i
don't uh suffocate them like that

1000
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,520
don't uh suffocate them like that
 

1001
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,669
don't uh suffocate them like that
have to give give them space

1002
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679
have to give give them space
 

1003
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,350
have to give give them space
so i'll probably make the minecart track

1004
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
so i'll probably make the minecart track
 

1005
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,029
so i'll probably make the minecart track
go down

1006
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:09,039
go down
 

1007
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,909
go down
um there and that should meet up with

1008
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:13,919
um there and that should meet up with
 

1009
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,350
um there and that should meet up with
with the tree farm pretty nicely

1010
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
with the tree farm pretty nicely
 

1011
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,310
with the tree farm pretty nicely
it's right over there

1012
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320

 

1013
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,950

yeah let me know you think of that idea

1014
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
yeah let me know you think of that idea
 

1015
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,549
yeah let me know you think of that idea
just to have these guys going around and

1016
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
just to have these guys going around and
 

1017
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,510
just to have these guys going around and
around

1018
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:27,520
around
 

1019
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,310
around
automatically on their own the minecarts

1020
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,320
automatically on their own the minecarts
 

1021
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,750
automatically on their own the minecarts
will pick them up

1022
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:31,760
will pick them up
 

1023
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,549
will pick them up
when it detects there's one in here and

1024
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
when it detects there's one in here and
 

1025
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,190
when it detects there's one in here and
then they'll

1026
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
then they'll
 

1027
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,190
then they'll
send them around the loop

1028
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200

 

1029
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,149

okay i think that'll be pretty cool

1030
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,159

 

1031
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,350

and the minecarts

1032
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,360
and the minecarts
 

1033
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,990
and the minecarts
track will probably come from this side

1034
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,000
track will probably come from this side
 

1035
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,149
track will probably come from this side
actually not

1036
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:52,159
actually not
 

1037
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,590
actually not
not from the side although that may be

1038
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
not from the side although that may be
 

1039
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,230
not from the side although that may be
this side

1040
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
this side
 

1041
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,510
this side
i don't know we'll see but that's the

1042
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
i don't know we'll see but that's the
 

1043
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,630
i don't know we'll see but that's the
idea for that

1044
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,640
idea for that
 

1045
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,789
idea for that

1048
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
though today
 

1049
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,350
though today
because it's getting really late here

1050

world though
even though we didn't do the tree thing

1058
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:13,039
