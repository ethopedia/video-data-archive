family everything good I hope it's all
good uh branch buy and I'm sorry going

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:22,380
good uh branch buy and I'm sorry going
 

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,240
good uh branch buy and I'm sorry going
to the branch mine again just I built

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:26,250
to the branch mine again just I built
 

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,400
to the branch mine again just I built
something here I want to show you or I'm

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:28,410
something here I want to show you or I'm
 

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,500
something here I want to show you or I'm
building in the process of building

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:30,510
building in the process of building
 

15
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,420
building in the process of building
something not related to the branch why

16
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:32,430
something not related to the branch why
 

17
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,400
something not related to the branch why
I just built it down in the branch mines

18
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:34,410
I just built it down in the branch mines
 

19
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,650
I just built it down in the branch mines
so don't worry about that

20
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:38,660

 

21
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,330

so it goes off to the left here now this

22
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:41,340
so it goes off to the left here now this
 

23
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,440
so it goes off to the left here now this
is new and if you can figure out what

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:45,450
is new and if you can figure out what
 

25
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,450
is new and if you can figure out what
this is before I tell you I will be very

26
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:47,460
this is before I tell you I will be very
 

27
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,090
this is before I tell you I will be very
impressed I'll tell you that because

28
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:50,100
impressed I'll tell you that because
 

29
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,520
impressed I'll tell you that because
it's a very simple thing but I've made

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:55,530
it's a very simple thing but I've made
 

31
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,279
it's a very simple thing but I've made
it very complicated very needlessly and

32
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:58,289
it very complicated very needlessly and
 

33
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,040
it very complicated very needlessly and
it's not necessarily a practical thing

34
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,050
it's not necessarily a practical thing
 

35
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,410
it's not necessarily a practical thing
I'm building here it's more doing it for

36
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:03,420
I'm building here it's more doing it for
 

37
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,450
I'm building here it's more doing it for
the fun of it I don't know if I'll

38
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:05,460
the fun of it I don't know if I'll
 

39
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,160
the fun of it I don't know if I'll
actually end up using it very much it's

40
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,170
actually end up using it very much it's
 

41
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,490
actually end up using it very much it's
so weird that block is flickering the

42
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:15,500
so weird that block is flickering the
 

43
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,289
so weird that block is flickering the
redstone one or to me it is anyway yeah

44
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:21,299
redstone one or to me it is anyway yeah
 

45
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,460
redstone one or to me it is anyway yeah
okay so down here is what I'm doing um

46
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:27,470
okay so down here is what I'm doing um
 

47
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,810
okay so down here is what I'm doing um
yeah if you can figure this out I'll be

48
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:29,820
yeah if you can figure this out I'll be
 

49
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,310
yeah if you can figure this out I'll be
impressed but I just want to show you

50
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,320
impressed but I just want to show you
 

51
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,120
impressed but I just want to show you
the wiring before I seal it up here and

52
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,130
the wiring before I seal it up here and
 

53
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,710
the wiring before I seal it up here and
so the wiring comes down the staircase

54
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:39,720
so the wiring comes down the staircase
 

55
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:49,969
so the wiring comes down the staircase
from this thing up here this is a it's

56
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:49,979
from this thing up here this is a it's
 

57
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,870
from this thing up here this is a it's
called a tea bud so what people named it

58
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
called a tea bud so what people named it
 

59
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,850
called a tea bud so what people named it
the bud switch that's a T flip-flop

60
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:55,860
the bud switch that's a T flip-flop
 

61
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,179
the bud switch that's a T flip-flop
basically so it's connected or it's

62
00:01:59,179 --> 00:01:59,189
basically so it's connected or it's
 

63
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,020
basically so it's connected or it's
right below of this redstone block so at

64
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,030
right below of this redstone block so at
 

65
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,499
right below of this redstone block so at
this moment let's go down one more time

66
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:06,509
this moment let's go down one more time
 

67
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,830
this moment let's go down one more time
see this repeaters on if we right-click

68
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
see this repeaters on if we right-click
 

69
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,580
see this repeaters on if we right-click
on this you heard that

70
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:13,590
on this you heard that
 

71
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,890
on this you heard that
this is now off and it's going to stay

72
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:16,900
this is now off and it's going to stay
 

73
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,600
this is now off and it's going to stay
off for a little while I'm around them

74
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:18,610
off for a little while I'm around them
 

75
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,179
off for a little while I'm around them
random is your mount of time and then

76
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:21,189
random is your mount of time and then
 

77
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:24,050
random is your mount of time and then
it's going to come back on and this will

78
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:24,060
it's going to come back on and this will
 

79
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,759
it's going to come back on and this will
retract okay probably don't want to wait

80
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:29,769
retract okay probably don't want to wait
 

81
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:31,589
retract okay probably don't want to wait
around to watch it but that's what's

82
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
around to watch it but that's what's
 

83
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,110
around to watch it but that's what's
going to happen and then what we're

84
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,120
going to happen and then what we're
 

85
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:42,149
going to happen and then what we're
going to do so we got all these pistons

86
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:42,159
going to do so we got all these pistons
 

87
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,890
going to do so we got all these pistons
here which are going to hold water back

88
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:43,900
here which are going to hold water back
 

89
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,319
here which are going to hold water back
I think we're going to give them a

90
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:46,329
I think we're going to give them a
 

91
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:49,020
I think we're going to give them a
special delay just for a little bit of a

92
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,030
special delay just for a little bit of a
 

93
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,330
special delay just for a little bit of a
cool factor so we'll keep this middle

94
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:51,340
cool factor so we'll keep this middle
 

95
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,160
cool factor so we'll keep this middle
one on one then we'll switch these two

96
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,170
one on one then we'll switch these two
 

97
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,970
one on one then we'll switch these two
too and then the very side ones we will

98
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:56,980
too and then the very side ones we will
 

99
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,280
too and then the very side ones we will
put two three should be good this is

100
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,290
put two three should be good this is
 

101
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,210
put two three should be good this is
still off shits which still glowing and

102
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:06,220
still off shits which still glowing and
 

103
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,809
still off shits which still glowing and
see it's a little bit lighter right now

104
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:08,819
see it's a little bit lighter right now
 

105
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,920
see it's a little bit lighter right now
and now we got to connect these together

106
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:13,930
and now we got to connect these together
 

107
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,379
and now we got to connect these together
pay attention to this to this will make

108
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:16,389
pay attention to this to this will make
 

109
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:19,439
pay attention to this to this will make
a little bit more sense in a little

110
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:19,449
a little bit more sense in a little
 

111
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,699
a little bit more sense in a little
while here okay

112
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:23,709
while here okay
 

113
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,659
while here okay
good I have some on me I'm going to

114
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:27,669
good I have some on me I'm going to
 

115
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:33,000
good I have some on me I'm going to
connect this all together there so now

116
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,010
connect this all together there so now
 

117
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,159
connect this all together there so now
the pistons should be hooked up to this

118
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,169

 

119
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,309

well that's that's taking a really long

120
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:41,319
well that's that's taking a really long
 

121
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,369
well that's that's taking a really long
time to switch I'm surprised I oh I

122
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:44,379
time to switch I'm surprised I oh I
 

123
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:50,670
time to switch I'm surprised I oh I
can't get out of here can i nuts

124
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:50,680
can't get out of here can i nuts
 

125
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,659
can't get out of here can i nuts
um mm-hmm I hate to just destroy stuff

126
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:57,669
um mm-hmm I hate to just destroy stuff
 

127
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:00,780
um mm-hmm I hate to just destroy stuff
randomly here yeah it's a good thing I

128
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:00,790
randomly here yeah it's a good thing I
 

129
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,069
randomly here yeah it's a good thing I
showed you this because we're probably

130
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:02,079
showed you this because we're probably
 

131
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,490
showed you this because we're probably
not going to be coming back down here

132
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:07,500

 

133
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,750

and still on this it's taking a while

134
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
and still on this it's taking a while
 

135
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,250
and still on this it's taking a while
okay so we're going to close this all up

136
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:16,260
okay so we're going to close this all up
 

137
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,740
okay so we're going to close this all up
and

138
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:21,750

 

139
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:30,330

put water in over here and one over

140
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:30,340
put water in over here and one over
 

141
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:40,380
put water in over here and one over
there one there and one over there grab

142
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,390
there one there and one over there grab
 

143
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,660
there one there and one over there grab
a little bit more and the water flows

144
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:42,670
a little bit more and the water flows
 

145
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,430
a little bit more and the water flows
all go to this very edge here I really

146
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
all go to this very edge here I really
 

147
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,650
all go to this very edge here I really
hope that switches soon that's a crazy

148
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:55,660
hope that switches soon that's a crazy
 

149
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:02,220
hope that switches soon that's a crazy
amount of time that's been on okay well

150
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,230
amount of time that's been on okay well
 

151
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,170
amount of time that's been on okay well
I'll be back once it switches alright it

152
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:07,180
I'll be back once it switches alright it
 

153
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,480
I'll be back once it switches alright it
finally switched here it happened about

154
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:09,490
finally switched here it happened about
 

155
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,980
finally switched here it happened about
fifteen or thirty seconds after I

156
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:10,990
fifteen or thirty seconds after I
 

157
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,890
fifteen or thirty seconds after I
stopped recording and now we're going to

158
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:13,900
stopped recording and now we're going to
 

159
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,600
stopped recording and now we're going to
fill this in and I was looking at this

160
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:18,610
fill this in and I was looking at this
 

161
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,970
fill this in and I was looking at this
and I think I should really put a piston

162
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:20,980
and I think I should really put a piston
 

163
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,030
and I think I should really put a piston
here - so mr. Peter will go to this

164
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,040
here - so mr. Peter will go to this
 

165
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,440
here - so mr. Peter will go to this
block this wire and then it'll also

166
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,450
block this wire and then it'll also
 

167
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,360
block this wire and then it'll also
control a sticky piston right in between

168
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,370
control a sticky piston right in between
 

169
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,110
control a sticky piston right in between
these pumpkins I think that I'll make it

170
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,120
these pumpkins I think that I'll make it
 

171
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,510
these pumpkins I think that I'll make it
cooler do that and we'll put another one

172
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
cooler do that and we'll put another one
 

173
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:47,360
cooler do that and we'll put another one
here right over here

174
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,370
here right over here
 

175
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,590
here right over here
yeah I don't know how effective this is

176
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
yeah I don't know how effective this is
 

177
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,500
yeah I don't know how effective this is
going to be but I'm having fun building

178
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:52,510
going to be but I'm having fun building
 

179
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,110
going to be but I'm having fun building
it at least okay so we got that and then

180
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
it at least okay so we got that and then
 

181
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:06,900
it at least okay so we got that and then
finally I'll show you this Oh nuts you

182
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:06,910
finally I'll show you this Oh nuts you
 

183
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,740
finally I'll show you this Oh nuts you
got to be kidding me

184
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:07,750
got to be kidding me
 

185
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:13,180
got to be kidding me
didn't work

186
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,190

 

187
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,160

ah I'll be right back what's wrong now

188
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,170
ah I'll be right back what's wrong now
 

189
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:28,180
ah I'll be right back what's wrong now
ah I'll be right back ok I've spied the

190
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,190
ah I'll be right back ok I've spied the
 

191
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,100
ah I'll be right back ok I've spied the
problem it's right over here this

192
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,110
problem it's right over here this
 

193
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,680
problem it's right over here this
repeater sends power to this block and

194
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:35,690
repeater sends power to this block and
 

195
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,320
repeater sends power to this block and
there's that piston above it but it's

196
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,330
there's that piston above it but it's
 

197
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,930
there's that piston above it but it's
also sending power back to that wire and

198
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:40,940
also sending power back to that wire and
 

199
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,110
also sending power back to that wire and
it's making a continuous loop so it

200
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,120
it's making a continuous loop so it
 

201
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,220
it's making a continuous loop so it
never shuts off so we just have to move

202
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,230
never shuts off so we just have to move
 

203
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:59,670
never shuts off so we just have to move
this I guess over here probably work

204
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680

 

205
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:08,860

something like that and ooh get bad

206
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:08,870
something like that and ooh get bad
 

207
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:15,460
something like that and ooh get bad
burps that one was gross yeah that

208
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:15,470
burps that one was gross yeah that
 

209
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:22,330
burps that one was gross yeah that
should work all right cover this again

210
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:22,340
should work all right cover this again
 

211
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:32,310
should work all right cover this again
and now let me right click beautiful

212
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:32,320

 

213
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:40,660

okay next thing I guess we'll put chest

214
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:40,670
okay next thing I guess we'll put chest
 

215
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:51,060
okay next thing I guess we'll put chest
down here here here here here here there

216
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,070

 

217
00:07:51,070 --> 00:08:00,600

whoop and there then in the middle I

218
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:00,610
whoop and there then in the middle I
 

219
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:06,000
whoop and there then in the middle I
don't know what to do about the middle

220
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,010

 

221
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,070

sure maybe put wood or something I don't

222
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,080
sure maybe put wood or something I don't
 

223
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:17,940
sure maybe put wood or something I don't
know almost need this one to come up to

224
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:17,950

 

225
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,740

this looks fairly cool I like it so

226
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:20,750
this looks fairly cool I like it so
 

227
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,390
this looks fairly cool I like it so
that's what we're trying to get for over

228
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
that's what we're trying to get for over
 

229
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,150
that's what we're trying to get for over
here now and I figured out what I can do

230
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:25,160
here now and I figured out what I can do
 

231
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,650
here now and I figured out what I can do
to make it work is just a real nightmare

232
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:28,660
to make it work is just a real nightmare
 

233
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,490
to make it work is just a real nightmare
working out the wiring so what I did

234
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:32,500
working out the wiring so what I did
 

235
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,440
working out the wiring so what I did
there used to be Pistons all across here

236
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:35,450
there used to be Pistons all across here
 

237
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,630
there used to be Pistons all across here
now I loved the middle one and replace

238
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:37,640
now I loved the middle one and replace
 

239
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,630
now I loved the middle one and replace
it with this sticky piston and that

240
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
it with this sticky piston and that
 

241
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,890
it with this sticky piston and that
should work and now I'm going to also

242
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:41,900
should work and now I'm going to also
 

243
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,270
should work and now I'm going to also
put a sticky piston right here

244
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:45,280
put a sticky piston right here
 

245
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,170
put a sticky piston right here
apparently I can't place it

246
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:47,180
apparently I can't place it
 

247
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,080
apparently I can't place it
there we go okay right below that torch

248
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,090
there we go okay right below that torch
 

249
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,770
there we go okay right below that torch
and now I can put a block here and it

250
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:56,780
and now I can put a block here and it
 

251
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,160
and now I can put a block here and it
will go down when the water comes out

252
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,170
will go down when the water comes out
 

253
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:06,130
will go down when the water comes out
water goes over there okay and we'll

254
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:06,140
water goes over there okay and we'll
 

255
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,160
water goes over there okay and we'll
have a block here probably just stone I

256
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,170
have a block here probably just stone I
 

257
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,280
have a block here probably just stone I
will wait to put it though so what I got

258
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,290
will wait to put it though so what I got
 

259
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,120
will wait to put it though so what I got
to do now is run a redstone torch off

260
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,130
to do now is run a redstone torch off
 

261
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:26,080
to do now is run a redstone torch off
that block and run it to this one so I

262
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,090
that block and run it to this one so I
 

263
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,040
that block and run it to this one so I
can't actually get over there now so

264
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,050
can't actually get over there now so
 

265
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,070
can't actually get over there now so
that's how we're going to do it and

266
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
that's how we're going to do it and
 

267
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,590
that's how we're going to do it and
we'll go underneath

268
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600

 

269
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,750

I think that's right I think right over

270
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
I think that's right I think right over
 

271
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:47,330
I think that's right I think right over
here should do it like that I hope and

272
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:47,340
here should do it like that I hope and
 

273
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:53,580
here should do it like that I hope and
we'll go back ouch oh where am I now

274
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:53,590
we'll go back ouch oh where am I now
 

275
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:59,340
we'll go back ouch oh where am I now
oh I didn't make it darn there we go

276
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,350
oh I didn't make it darn there we go
 

277
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:06,270
oh I didn't make it darn there we go
okay so now we can hopefully yeah so

278
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,280
okay so now we can hopefully yeah so
 

279
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,400
okay so now we can hopefully yeah so
that went underneath that block to that

280
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:08,410
that went underneath that block to that
 

281
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,960
that went underneath that block to that
torch so we can put one here bridge the

282
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:12,970
torch so we can put one here bridge the
 

283
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,430
torch so we can put one here bridge the
gap and I think all should be fine now I

284
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:16,440
gap and I think all should be fine now I
 

285
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,020
gap and I think all should be fine now I
hope and this should at the same timing

286
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,030
hope and this should at the same timing
 

287
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,210
hope and this should at the same timing
because we have two torches and that's

288
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:21,220
because we have two torches and that's
 

289
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,910
because we have two torches and that's
the same as going through this to this

290
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
the same as going through this to this
 

291
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,670
the same as going through this to this
so now all three of these will be time

292
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:26,680
so now all three of these will be time
 

293
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:37,530
so now all three of these will be time
the same okay yes that was good um so

294
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:37,540
the same okay yes that was good um so
 

295
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:45,480
the same okay yes that was good um so
put that back put this back and that

296
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,490
put that back put this back and that
 

297
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,130
put that back put this back and that
will just do it without the water first

298
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:47,140
will just do it without the water first
 

299
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,540
will just do it without the water first
see what it looks like I'm going to use

300
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,550
see what it looks like I'm going to use
 

301
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:56,490
see what it looks like I'm going to use
half slabs like that and what should

302
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:56,500
half slabs like that and what should
 

303
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,790
half slabs like that and what should
happen is that that and that should all

304
00:10:59,790 --> 00:10:59,800
happen is that that and that should all
 

305
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,450
happen is that that and that should all
go down

306
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:02,460

 

307
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,080

excellent okay and that one went down so

308
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,090
excellent okay and that one went down so
 

309
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,510
excellent okay and that one went down so
now instead of the piston being over

310
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:09,520
now instead of the piston being over
 

311
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,590
now instead of the piston being over
there it's below that block so perfect

312
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
there it's below that block so perfect
 

313
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,030
there it's below that block so perfect
so I'm going to put the water back in

314
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
so I'm going to put the water back in
 

315
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,130
so I'm going to put the water back in
and this should be done finally

316
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,140
and this should be done finally
 

317
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,840
and this should be done finally
and when you find out what this is for

318
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:18,850
and when you find out what this is for
 

319
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,610
and when you find out what this is for
you're going to be like did you

down below here as well I realized I'm
going to need a bunch of chests down

330
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
going to need a bunch of chests down
 

331
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,650
going to need a bunch of chests down
here for sure so I switch that over I'm

left this open just so you can see
 

337
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:50,000
left this open just so you can see
what's behind this these wood slabs

338
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,010
what's behind this these wood slabs
 

339
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,520
what's behind this these wood slabs
and I'm finally gonna tell you what this

340
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:52,530
and I'm finally gonna tell you what this
 

341

and he gave me inspiration for this

348
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:07,770
and he gave me inspiration for this
 

349
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,990
and he gave me inspiration for this
project basically he said and this is

350
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
project basically he said and this is
 

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,330
project basically he said and this is
true if you make a boat out of this

352
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:17,340
true if you make a boat out of this
 

353
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,590
true if you make a boat out of this
redwood or any of the new planks and

354
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:20,600
redwood or any of the new planks and
 

355
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,560
redwood or any of the new planks and
then break it you get regular planks

356
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:26,570
then break it you get regular planks
 

357
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,430
then break it you get regular planks
that's what this is for

358
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:28,440
that's what this is for
 

359
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,380
that's what this is for
it's to converts the other type of

360
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:30,390
it's to converts the other type of
 

361
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,600
it's to converts the other type of
planks into regular planks but this

362
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:32,610
planks into regular planks but this
 

363
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,340
planks into regular planks but this
comes at a cost as well

364
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:34,350
comes at a cost as well
 

365
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,230
comes at a cost as well
you get three wooden planks and two

366
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:39,240
you get three wooden planks and two
 

367
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,600
you get three wooden planks and two
sticks instead of five of the exotic

368
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:43,610
sticks instead of five of the exotic
 

369
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:48,320
sticks instead of five of the exotic
other planks alright so there is some

370
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,330
other planks alright so there is some
 

371
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,800
other planks alright so there is some
loss involved but the thing is I can

372
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:51,810
loss involved but the thing is I can
 

373
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,110
loss involved but the thing is I can
harvest jungle trees very very quickly

374
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,120
harvest jungle trees very very quickly
 

375
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,820
harvest jungle trees very very quickly
because I do a two by two tree grow it

376
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:58,830
because I do a two by two tree grow it
 

377
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,770
because I do a two by two tree grow it
with bone meal ender pearl to the top of

378
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:00,780
with bone meal ender pearl to the top of
 

379
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,740
with bone meal ender pearl to the top of
it and then just use my amazing axe and

380
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:03,750
it and then just use my amazing axe and
 

381
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,380
it and then just use my amazing axe and
cut my way down and I can get about ten

382
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:06,390
cut my way down and I can get about ten
 

383
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,500
cut my way down and I can get about ten
stacks of the jungle wood in like 15

384
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:09,510
stacks of the jungle wood in like 15
 

385
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,550
stacks of the jungle wood in like 15
minutes or so I found and that's what I

386
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:13,560
minutes or so I found and that's what I
 

387
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,110
minutes or so I found and that's what I
was doing when I started building all

388
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
was doing when I started building all
 

389
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,510
was doing when I started building all
this and then they introduced these new

390
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:17,520
this and then they introduced these new
 

391
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,100
this and then they introduced these new
plank types and now I can only get the

392
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,110
plank types and now I can only get the
 

393
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,960
plank types and now I can only get the
red ones from that and I have to harvest

394
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:23,970
red ones from that and I have to harvest
 

395
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,010
red ones from that and I have to harvest
the regular oak trees to get the type of

396
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:28,020
the regular oak trees to get the type of
 

397
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,120
the regular oak trees to get the type of
planks I need which is taking me a lot

398
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,130
planks I need which is taking me a lot
 

399
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,610
planks I need which is taking me a lot
longer so I'm still harvesting the

400
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:34,620
longer so I'm still harvesting the
 

401
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,930
longer so I'm still harvesting the
jungle trees and I've been just stacking

402
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:37,940
jungle trees and I've been just stacking
 

403
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:43,010
jungle trees and I've been just stacking
and like that to mimic wood wood planks

404
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,020
and like that to mimic wood wood planks
 

405
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,650
and like that to mimic wood wood planks
right but I'm finding that takes a

406
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:45,660
right but I'm finding that takes a
 

407
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,620
right but I'm finding that takes a
little while to place them all

408
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:47,630
little while to place them all
 

409
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,910
little while to place them all
especially at the top here which is

410
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
especially at the top here which is
 

411
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,130
especially at the top here which is
probably where I want regular planks the

412
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:52,140
probably where I want regular planks the
 

413
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,970
probably where I want regular planks the
most this top grid

414
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:57,980

 

415
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,180

and I think I think I'm gonna call this

416
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,190
and I think I think I'm gonna call this
 

417
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,600
and I think I think I'm gonna call this
a sawmill by the way I that's probably a

418
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:04,610
a sawmill by the way I that's probably a
 

419
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:10,270
a sawmill by the way I that's probably a
fitting name I think I can still harvest

420
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:10,280
fitting name I think I can still harvest
 

421
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,460
fitting name I think I can still harvest
jungle trees convert them to regular

422
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:12,470
jungle trees convert them to regular
 

423
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,200
jungle trees convert them to regular
planks like this quicker than I can

424
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,210
planks like this quicker than I can
 

425
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,810
planks like this quicker than I can
harvest oak trees I'm not sure even if I

426
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:16,820
harvest oak trees I'm not sure even if I
 

427
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,600
harvest oak trees I'm not sure even if I
can't this is just for fun but that's

428
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:19,610
can't this is just for fun but that's
 

429
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,080
can't this is just for fun but that's
the idea behind it that we're going to

430
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,090
the idea behind it that we're going to
 

431
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,430
the idea behind it that we're going to
do a test here and just see how well

432
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:24,440
do a test here and just see how well
 

433
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,880
do a test here and just see how well
this works in just a second in order for

434
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:27,890
this works in just a second in order for
 

435
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,150
this works in just a second in order for
this to be quicker like the time we

436
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,160
this to be quicker like the time we
 

437
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,730
this to be quicker like the time we
invest in to convert into crafting boats

438
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:33,740
invest in to convert into crafting boats
 

439
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,490
invest in to convert into crafting boats
and breaking them and losing that little

440
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:36,500
and breaking them and losing that little
 

441
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,220
and breaking them and losing that little
bit of wood that has to be faster than

442
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,230
bit of wood that has to be faster than
 

443
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,440
bit of wood that has to be faster than
just spending extra time growing oak

444
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:44,450
just spending extra time growing oak
 

445
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,120
just spending extra time growing oak
trees and cutting them down and it might

446
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,130
trees and cutting them down and it might
 

447
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,910
trees and cutting them down and it might
be I'm not sure the whole point of this

be I'm not sure the whole point of this
 

449
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,760
be I'm not sure the whole point of this
is to make crafting boats as quick as

is to make crafting boats as quick as
 

451
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,100
is to make crafting boats as quick as
possible destroying them as quickly as

much and we're going to go through some
 

467
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,400
much and we're going to go through some
of the numbers behind all this there is

468

stacks of the jungle wood converts into
 

479
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,820
stacks of the jungle wood converts into
and that is two thousand four hundred

480
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:42,830
and that is two thousand four hundred
 

481
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,450
and that is two thousand four hundred
and thirty red planks and that gets

482
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:46,460
and thirty red planks and that gets
 

483
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:51,730
and thirty red planks and that gets
converted into 1458 regular planks when

484
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:51,740
converted into 1458 regular planks when
 

485
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,940
converted into 1458 regular planks when
you break the boat plus nine hundred and

486
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:54,950
you break the boat plus nine hundred and
 

487
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,030
you break the boat plus nine hundred and
seventy two sticks so that's what this

488
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,040
seventy two sticks so that's what this
 

489
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,830
seventy two sticks so that's what this
all works out too assuming we feel all

490
00:15:59,830 --> 00:15:59,840
all works out too assuming we feel all
 

491
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:05,410
all works out too assuming we feel all
these chests up and the main issue with

492
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:05,420
these chests up and the main issue with
 

493
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,190
these chests up and the main issue with
all of this is inventory management so

494
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:09,200
all of this is inventory management so
 

495
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,650
all of this is inventory management so
that's what this is all about up here

496
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:11,660
that's what this is all about up here
 

497
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,760
that's what this is all about up here
down there is just for breaking them

498
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:14,770
down there is just for breaking them
 

499
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,830
down there is just for breaking them
major like so the quickest way to make

500
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:17,840
major like so the quickest way to make
 

501
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,250
major like so the quickest way to make
boats I think is to shift click on wood

502
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:23,260
boats I think is to shift click on wood
 

503
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:29,320
boats I think is to shift click on wood
range your boats but when you shift

504
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,330
range your boats but when you shift
 

505
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,630
range your boats but when you shift
click on the boat it only makes as many

506
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:31,640
click on the boat it only makes as many
 

507
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,230
click on the boat it only makes as many
as you have inventory space for right

508
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,240
as you have inventory space for right
 

509
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
as you have inventory space for right
now you could go down there and destroy

510
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,130
now you could go down there and destroy
 

511
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,760
now you could go down there and destroy
all those but that would involve

512
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:38,770
all those but that would involve
 

513
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,190
all those but that would involve
manually moving it to that spot then you

514
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:42,200
manually moving it to that spot then you
 

515
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,630
manually moving it to that spot then you
place it and then you'll have to move

516
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:43,640
place it and then you'll have to move
 

517
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,620
place it and then you'll have to move
another one down there and it will take

518
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:47,630
another one down there and it will take
 

519
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,410
another one down there and it will take
a long time to do right so ideally what

520
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:50,420
a long time to do right so ideally what
 

521
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,480
a long time to do right so ideally what
you want is to have a ton of outs on the

522
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:52,490
you want is to have a ton of outs on the
 

523
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,270
you want is to have a ton of outs on the
ground right at your feet and every time

524
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:55,280
ground right at your feet and every time
 

525
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,660
ground right at your feet and every time
you right-click a new boat that's at

526
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:58,670
you right-click a new boat that's at
 

527
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,700
you right-click a new boat that's at
your feet will go in the exact same spot

528
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:00,710
your feet will go in the exact same spot
 

529
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,050
your feet will go in the exact same spot
so you can just hold right click

530
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,060
so you can just hold right click
 

531
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,700
so you can just hold right click
hopefully but that's the thing we need a

532
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:06,710
hopefully but that's the thing we need a
 

533
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,980
hopefully but that's the thing we need a
whole bunch of boats on the ground bias

534
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:08,990
whole bunch of boats on the ground bias
 

535
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,100
whole bunch of boats on the ground bias
to keep that going so we got to fill up

536
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,110
to keep that going so we got to fill up
 

537
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,190
to keep that going so we got to fill up
all these chests and then when we're

538
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:15,200
all these chests and then when we're
 

539
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,680
all these chests and then when we're
ready we break them all and there'll be

540
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:17,690
ready we break them all and there'll be
 

541
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,090
ready we break them all and there'll be
hundreds of boats on the ground

542
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:19,100
hundreds of boats on the ground
 

543
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,320
hundreds of boats on the ground
hopefully the game will be able to

544
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:20,330
hopefully the game will be able to
 

545
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,730
hopefully the game will be able to
handle it and right-click that the water

546
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:24,740
handle it and right-click that the water
 

547
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,470
handle it and right-click that the water
will push all the boats down into one

548
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
will push all the boats down into one
 

549
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,170
will push all the boats down into one
spot nice a nice distance away from the

550
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:29,180
spot nice a nice distance away from the
 

551
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,800
spot nice a nice distance away from the
breaking area and I should be able to

552
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:32,810
breaking area and I should be able to
 

553
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,540
breaking area and I should be able to
just right click and get a bunch of

554
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:34,550
just right click and get a bunch of
 

555
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,590
just right click and get a bunch of
planks from it that's the idea behind

556
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:38,600
planks from it that's the idea behind
 

557
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,850
planks from it that's the idea behind
all this I don't know how well it all

558
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:39,860
all this I don't know how well it all
 

559
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,360
all this I don't know how well it all
work

560
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,370
work
 

561
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,600
work
just for fun anyway but yeah I think the

562
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:43,610
just for fun anyway but yeah I think the
 

563
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,290
just for fun anyway but yeah I think the
quickest way of making boats is to do

564
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:47,300
quickest way of making boats is to do
 

565
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:53,490
quickest way of making boats is to do
that really only need 32 or so at a time

566
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:53,500
that really only need 32 or so at a time
 

567
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,360
that really only need 32 or so at a time
and get rid of them out of your

568
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:55,370
and get rid of them out of your
 

569
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,200
and get rid of them out of your
inventory very quick this way just by

570
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,210
inventory very quick this way just by
 

571
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,490
inventory very quick this way just by
spamming like this so I'll fill these up

572
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:00,500
spamming like this so I'll fill these up
 

573
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,920
spamming like this so I'll fill these up
I'm going to make a backup of my world

574
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:02,930
I'm going to make a backup of my world
 

575
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:03,910
I'm going to make a backup of my world
just in case

576

just in case
I accidentally crash it or something and

578
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:05,860
I accidentally crash it or something and
 

579
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:14,680
I accidentally crash it or something and
we will see how this works out

580
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:14,690

 

581
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,840

okay here comes the fun part I got these

582
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:17,850
okay here comes the fun part I got these
 

583
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:22,520
okay here comes the fun part I got these
awful votes now and we're about to

584
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:22,530
awful votes now and we're about to
 

585
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,290
awful votes now and we're about to
harvest them all should be fun and that

586
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:27,300
harvest them all should be fun and that
 

587
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,740
harvest them all should be fun and that
took me about five minutes to craft them

588
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:30,750
took me about five minutes to craft them
 

589
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,630
took me about five minutes to craft them
all and put them in these chests so that

590
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
all and put them in these chests so that
 

591
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,330
all and put them in these chests so that
is a bit of time and you add that to the

592
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:35,340
is a bit of time and you add that to the
 

593
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,940
is a bit of time and you add that to the
15 minutes it took to get the wood the

594
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:37,950
15 minutes it took to get the wood the
 

595
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,880
15 minutes it took to get the wood the
jungle woods that is 20 minutes total so

596
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:40,890
jungle woods that is 20 minutes total so
 

597
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,330
jungle woods that is 20 minutes total so
far so the only thing left is the

598
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:43,340
far so the only thing left is the
 

599
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:49,070
far so the only thing left is the
destroying time and yeah here we go

600
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,080
destroying time and yeah here we go
 

601
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,020
destroying time and yeah here we go
umm might only be able to do half at a

running long enough for all the boats to

624
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:35,220
running long enough for all the boats to
 

625
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,130
running long enough for all the boats to
fall down let's see how many are left up

626
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:37,140
fall down let's see how many are left up
 

627
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,680
fall down let's see how many are left up
there actually one two two got stuck in

628
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:42,690
there actually one two two got stuck in
 

629
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,090
there actually one two two got stuck in
the wall for some reason okay here we go

see if I can hold right click I can

632
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:49,530
see if I can hold right click I can
 

633
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:55,310
see if I can hold right click I can
awesome oh that's so cool

634
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:55,320
awesome oh that's so cool
 

635
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:01,220
awesome oh that's so cool
oh and the frame rate is dropping more

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:08,990
oh and the frame rate is dropping more
and more down to 12 11 10 8 7 6 5 okay

638
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,000
and more down to 12 11 10 8 7 6 5 okay
 

639
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,540
and more down to 12 11 10 8 7 6 5 okay
I'm gonna stop recording yes the

640
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:14,550
I'm gonna stop recording yes the
 

641
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm gonna stop recording yes the
nightmare I think I figured out what I

642
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,010
nightmare I think I figured out what I
 

643
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,680
nightmare I think I figured out what I
need to do though to prevent that from

644
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:18,690
need to do though to prevent that from
 

645
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,400
need to do though to prevent that from
happening again I need to fill my

646
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,410
happening again I need to fill my
 

647
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,610
happening again I need to fill my
inventory slots with this

648
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:24,620
inventory slots with this
 

649
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,310
inventory slots with this
single thing of planks like this so I

650
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:27,320
single thing of planks like this so I
 

651
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,930
single thing of planks like this so I
can walk up collect it and then prevent

652
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:31,940
can walk up collect it and then prevent
 

653
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,590
can walk up collect it and then prevent
leg planks and sticks

654
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600
leg planks and sticks
 

655
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,730
leg planks and sticks
I'm just trying oh I got it all good

656
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:39,740
I'm just trying oh I got it all good
 

657
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,190
I'm just trying oh I got it all good
almost lost a bunch of wood there from

658
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,200
almost lost a bunch of wood there from
 

659
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,080
almost lost a bunch of wood there from
that because it was lagging so bad I

660
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,090
that because it was lagging so bad I
 

661
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:48,900
that because it was lagging so bad I
couldn't really deal with it but I think

662
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:48,910
couldn't really deal with it but I think
 

663
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,720
couldn't really deal with it but I think
managed to save it so in the future

664
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:52,730
managed to save it so in the future
 

665
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:59,980
managed to save it so in the future
that's probably all I need to do yeah so

666
00:20:59,980 --> 00:20:59,990
that's probably all I need to do yeah so
 

667
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,690
that's probably all I need to do yeah so
I like this this is pretty cool all

668
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:04,700
I like this this is pretty cool all
 

669
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,310
I like this this is pretty cool all
right I'll clean it up here this is what

670
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,320
right I'll clean it up here this is what
 

671
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,950
right I'll clean it up here this is what
we got that works out to 1161 planks and

672
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:13,960

 

673
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,830

774 sticks so we lost a few of them

674
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
774 sticks so we lost a few of them
 

675
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,870
774 sticks so we lost a few of them
somewhere I'm guessing what happened is

676
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:19,880
somewhere I'm guessing what happened is
 

677
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,080
somewhere I'm guessing what happened is
they fell into the piston arms when I

678
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,090
they fell into the piston arms when I
 

679
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,210
they fell into the piston arms when I
broke the chest and got stuck down down

680
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:28,220
broke the chest and got stuck down down
 

681
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,100
broke the chest and got stuck down down
there there there and there so might be

682
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,110
there there there and there so might be
 

683
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,230
there there there and there so might be
an issue

684
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,240
an issue
 

685
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,040
an issue
oh well so then we would replace all the

686
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,050
oh well so then we would replace all the
 

687
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,990
oh well so then we would replace all the
chests here I'll show you the water

688
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,000
chests here I'll show you the water
 

689
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,670
chests here I'll show you the water
streams though before I do so that's

690
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:45,680
streams though before I do so that's
 

691
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:52,260
streams though before I do so that's
what happens pretty cool but yeah it's

692
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,270
what happens pretty cool but yeah it's
 

693
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,380
what happens pretty cool but yeah it's
probably going to take me 20 to 25

694
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:56,390
probably going to take me 20 to 25
 

695
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,100
probably going to take me 20 to 25
minutes to do all that and that's about

696
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,110
minutes to do all that and that's about
 

697
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:06,180
minutes to do all that and that's about
equivalent harvesting five to six stacks

698
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,190
equivalent harvesting five to six stacks
 

699
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:12,100
equivalent harvesting five to six stacks
of oak wood so pretty sure I could do

700
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,110
of oak wood so pretty sure I could do
 

701
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,420
of oak wood so pretty sure I could do
that in 20 to 25 minutes we might try

702
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:16,430
that in 20 to 25 minutes we might try
 

703
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,810
that in 20 to 25 minutes we might try
that a little bit here see how how long

704
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:19,820
that a little bit here see how how long
 

705
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,880
that a little bit here see how how long
it takes so one of the rumors I've heard

706
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:24,890
it takes so one of the rumors I've heard
 

707
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,280
it takes so one of the rumors I've heard
with the recent patch is I don't know if

708
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:27,290
with the recent patch is I don't know if
 

709
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,750
with the recent patch is I don't know if
it's true or not we're going to check it

710
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:28,760
it's true or not we're going to check it
 

711
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,450
it's true or not we're going to check it
now is that it's a lot easier to grow

712
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:31,460
now is that it's a lot easier to grow
 

713
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,899
now is that it's a lot easier to grow
these oak trees if they're in a line

714
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:36,909

 

715
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:39,849

either by the Sun or using bonemeal so

716
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:39,859
either by the Sun or using bonemeal so
 

717
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,519
either by the Sun or using bonemeal so
we'll see what happens here hopefully we

718
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:42,529
we'll see what happens here hopefully we
 

719
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:47,589
we'll see what happens here hopefully we
don't get a big one oh it is I don't

720
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:47,599
don't get a big one oh it is I don't
 

721
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,259
don't get a big one oh it is I don't
believe it

722
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:49,269
believe it
 

723
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:53,039
believe it
so before if you did that you would use

724
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:53,049
so before if you did that you would use
 

725
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:56,709
so before if you did that you would use
usually between 10 and 30 bonemeal to

726
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:56,719
usually between 10 and 30 bonemeal to
 

727
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,969
usually between 10 and 30 bonemeal to
try to grow one tree

728
00:22:57,969 --> 00:22:57,979
try to grow one tree
 

729
00:22:57,979 --> 00:23:03,759
try to grow one tree
I guess it's yeah so everything I just

730
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:03,769
I guess it's yeah so everything I just
 

731
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:07,959
I guess it's yeah so everything I just
built pretty much very unpractical but

732
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:07,969
built pretty much very unpractical but
 

733
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,979
built pretty much very unpractical but
it was all for fun so I don't care so

734
00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:11,989
it was all for fun so I don't care so
 

735
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:15,099
it was all for fun so I don't care so
yeah that's the way to do it then you

736
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:15,109
yeah that's the way to do it then you
 

737
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:22,889
yeah that's the way to do it then you
just go right down and I may actually

738
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:22,899
just go right down and I may actually
 

739
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:27,099
just go right down and I may actually
make an automated farm sometime soon to

740
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:27,109
make an automated farm sometime soon to
 

741
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:33,009
make an automated farm sometime soon to
do this a little quicker see because I

742
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:33,019
do this a little quicker see because I
 

743
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:40,059
do this a little quicker see because I
think maybe not the quick binding trick

744
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:40,069
think maybe not the quick binding trick
 

745
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:43,839
think maybe not the quick binding trick
I think it works on on wood - yeah yeah

746
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:43,849
I think it works on on wood - yeah yeah
 

747
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:49,749
I think it works on on wood - yeah yeah
it does definitely all right you do get

748
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:49,759
it does definitely all right you do get
 

749
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,619
it does definitely all right you do get
these branches on the side hmm anyway it

750
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:53,629
these branches on the side hmm anyway it
 

751
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:55,239
these branches on the side hmm anyway it
seems to work I wonder what happens if

752
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:55,249
seems to work I wonder what happens if
 

753
00:23:55,249 --> 00:24:00,519
seems to work I wonder what happens if
you try to grow grow like a cube you

754
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:00,529
you try to grow grow like a cube you
 

755
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:08,519
you try to grow grow like a cube you
know what I mean so something like this

756
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:08,529

 

757
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:15,509

will go one row at a time

758
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:15,519

 

759
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:22,169

it's tough will they grow side by side

760
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:22,179
it's tough will they grow side by side
 

761
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:26,619
it's tough will they grow side by side
they do that is amazing and they make

762
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:26,629
they do that is amazing and they make
 

763
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:34,749
they do that is amazing and they make
this game so easy now unreal okay well I

764
00:24:34,749 --> 00:24:34,759
this game so easy now unreal okay well I
 

765
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,579
this game so easy now unreal okay well I
guess jungle trees have competition

766
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:36,589
guess jungle trees have competition
 

767
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:45,070
guess jungle trees have competition
after all that is crazy

768
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,080

 

769
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,690

well the main issue is the leaves

770
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:47,700
well the main issue is the leaves
 

771
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,700
well the main issue is the leaves
getting in your face but that's not a

772
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:52,710
getting in your face but that's not a
 

773
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:59,780
getting in your face but that's not a
big problem huh it's a solid thing would

774
00:24:59,780 --> 00:24:59,790
big problem huh it's a solid thing would
 

775
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,700
big problem huh it's a solid thing would
that's crazy

776
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:00,710
that's crazy
 

777
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,310
that's crazy
okay I'm going to show you one more

778
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
okay I'm going to show you one more
 

779
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,990
okay I'm going to show you one more
thing and then I'll probably in the

780
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,000
thing and then I'll probably in the
 

781
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,720
thing and then I'll probably in the
episode all right so that one project

782
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:11,730
episode all right so that one project
 

783
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,870
episode all right so that one project
gave me an idea for a pretty cool secret

784
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880
gave me an idea for a pretty cool secret
 

785
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,060
gave me an idea for a pretty cool secret
door you could do and I know you guys

786
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,070
door you could do and I know you guys
 

787
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,190
door you could do and I know you guys
like secret doors and I think you'll

788
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:19,200
like secret doors and I think you'll
 

789
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,010
like secret doors and I think you'll
like this so here's our door piston door

790
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:22,020
like this so here's our door piston door
 

791
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,560
like this so here's our door piston door
is all put together very rough I just

792
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:24,570
is all put together very rough I just
 

793
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,380
is all put together very rough I just
want to help you visualize it a little

794
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:27,390
want to help you visualize it a little
 

795
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,280
want to help you visualize it a little
bit we got a wall here just ignore this

796
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,290
bit we got a wall here just ignore this
 

797
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:36,050
bit we got a wall here just ignore this
wiring should be underground and behind

798
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:36,060
wiring should be underground and behind
 

799
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,300
wiring should be underground and behind
the wall is this there's basically a

800
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,310
the wall is this there's basically a
 

801
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,940
the wall is this there's basically a
pressure plate

802
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:39,950
pressure plate
 

803
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,990
pressure plate
loop pressure plates and then on there's

804
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,000
loop pressure plates and then on there's
 

805
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,600
loop pressure plates and then on there's
a block in between and then over here is

806
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:47,610
a block in between and then over here is
 

807
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,270
a block in between and then over here is
a place for lab it'll fall down and

808
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:50,280
a place for lab it'll fall down and
 

809
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,400
a place for lab it'll fall down and
that's being held by this piston which

810
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,410
that's being held by this piston which
 

811
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,420
that's being held by this piston which
is also connected to the pressure plate

812
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:55,430
is also connected to the pressure plate
 

813
00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:01,390
is also connected to the pressure plate
okay so what happens is you can use ah

814
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:01,400
okay so what happens is you can use ah
 

815
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:09,590
okay so what happens is you can use ah
am i doing oh yeah

816
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:09,600
am i doing oh yeah
 

817
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,990
am i doing oh yeah
you can use it boats as a key to your

818
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,000
you can use it boats as a key to your
 

819
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,280
you can use it boats as a key to your
door and basically you have a flat wall

820
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,290
door and basically you have a flat wall
 

821
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:20,990
door and basically you have a flat wall
no signs that it's a secret key key

822
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,000
no signs that it's a secret key key
 

823
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
no signs that it's a secret key key
holder or anything and you just place

824
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,010
holder or anything and you just place
 

825
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:27,190
holder or anything and you just place
your boat here

826
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,200

 

827
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,530

tada let's go around so one corner of

828
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:33,540
tada let's go around so one corner of
 

829
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,200
tada let's go around so one corner of
the boats on the pressure plates and the

830
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,210
the boats on the pressure plates and the
 

831
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,810
the boats on the pressure plates and the
other corner gets destroyed by the lava

832
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:38,820
other corner gets destroyed by the lava
 

833
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,120
other corner gets destroyed by the lava
coming down and this is really neat

834
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,130
coming down and this is really neat
 

835
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,490
coming down and this is really neat
because you can actually time how long

836
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:43,500
because you can actually time how long
 

837
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,100
because you can actually time how long
you want the door open very well with

838
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,110
you want the door open very well with
 

839
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,490
you want the door open very well with
this so if if you don't know lava

840
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:49,500
this so if if you don't know lava
 

841
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,440
this so if if you don't know lava
travels one block every 1.5 seconds

842
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:54,450
travels one block every 1.5 seconds
 

843
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,159
travels one block every 1.5 seconds
in this setup our boat is a hovering

844
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:58,169
in this setup our boat is a hovering
 

845
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:01,399
in this setup our boat is a hovering
here so the lab has to travel one two

846
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:01,409
here so the lab has to travel one two
 

847
00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:03,200
here so the lab has to travel one two
blocks to get to it before it destroys

848
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,210
blocks to get to it before it destroys
 

849
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,399
blocks to get to it before it destroys
it that's three seconds and then you

850
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:07,409
it that's three seconds and then you
 

851
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:10,669
it that's three seconds and then you
also have the redstone torch delay so

852
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:10,679
also have the redstone torch delay so
 

853
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,739
also have the redstone torch delay so
that's 0.3 seconds there so 3.3 seconds

854
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:14,749
that's 0.3 seconds there so 3.3 seconds
 

855
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:20,629
that's 0.3 seconds there so 3.3 seconds
is how long this door stays open for so

856
00:27:20,629 --> 00:27:20,639
is how long this door stays open for so
 

857
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,470
is how long this door stays open for so
you can very accurately control how long

858
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
you can very accurately control how long
 

859
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,930
you can very accurately control how long
you want your door open for by raising

860
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:26,940
you want your door open for by raising
 

861
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,330
you want your door open for by raising
or lowering the lava or you could just

862
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:29,340
or lowering the lava or you could just
 

863
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,989
or lowering the lava or you could just
tap it so you put the boat down and door

864
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:32,999
tap it so you put the boat down and door
 

865
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,549
tap it so you put the boat down and door
stays open until you destroy it

866
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:34,559
stays open until you destroy it
 

867
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,340
stays open until you destroy it
- there's lots of ways you could set it

868
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:37,350
- there's lots of ways you could set it
 

869
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,899
- there's lots of ways you could set it
up but I thought it was kind of cool so

870
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:41,909
up but I thought it was kind of cool so
 

871
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:44,180
up but I thought it was kind of cool so
I hope you enjoyed that and that is all

00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:58,470
I have been looking at or I did a little
 

883
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,759
I have been looking at or I did a little
bit of research into whoa into video

884
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:01,769
bit of research into whoa into video
 

885
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:03,859
bit of research into whoa into video
editing different programs I could use

886
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:03,869
editing different programs I could use
 

887
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:06,859
editing different programs I could use
because I'm still using virtualdub and

888
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:06,869
because I'm still using virtualdub and
 

889
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:09,320
because I'm still using virtualdub and
I've gone about as far as I can with it

890
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,330
I've gone about as far as I can with it
 

891
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,349
I've gone about as far as I can with it
I think it would be very good for

892
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:12,359
I think it would be very good for
 

893
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,450
I think it would be very good for
everybody if I actually got a real

894
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:14,460
everybody if I actually got a real
 

895
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,369
everybody if I actually got a real
editing program I'm really good with

896
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:16,379
editing program I'm really good with
 

897
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:19,879
editing program I'm really good with
virtualdub now but it's just very basic

898
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:19,889
virtualdub now but it's just very basic
 

899
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:23,810
virtualdub now but it's just very basic
just a simple thing like a transition

900
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:23,820
just a simple thing like a transition
 

901
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,239
just a simple thing like a transition
like a fade in can be a nightmare with

902
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:26,249
like a fade in can be a nightmare with
 

903
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:30,799
like a fade in can be a nightmare with
it so it would be good if I got

904
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:30,809
it so it would be good if I got
 

905
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,889
it so it would be good if I got
something better and what I did or what

906
00:28:33,889 --> 00:28:33,899
something better and what I did or what
 

907
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:36,859
something better and what I did or what
I found in my research is that CyberLink

908
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:36,869
I found in my research is that CyberLink
 

909
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:40,340
I found in my research is that CyberLink
PowerDirector is the top rated video

910
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:40,350
PowerDirector is the top rated video
 

911
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,359
PowerDirector is the top rated video
editing thing if that's true let me know

912
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:43,369
editing thing if that's true let me know
 

913
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:45,979
editing thing if that's true let me know
it could have just been a biased website

914
00:28:45,979 --> 00:28:45,989
it could have just been a biased website
 

915
00:28:45,989 --> 00:28:48,379
it could have just been a biased website
that I was looking at and it was only 50

916
00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:48,389
that I was looking at and it was only 50
 

917
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:50,930
that I was looking at and it was only 50
bucks which surprised me so if that's

918
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:50,940
bucks which surprised me so if that's
 

919
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,759
bucks which surprised me so if that's
the best the best editor and it's only

920
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:52,769
the best the best editor and it's only
 

921
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:55,399
the best the best editor and it's only
50 bucks I got no problem dishing that

922
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:55,409
50 bucks I got no problem dishing that
 

923
00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:58,669
50 bucks I got no problem dishing that
out for some reason I thought editing

924
00:28:58,669 --> 00:28:58,679
out for some reason I thought editing
 

925
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,220
out for some reason I thought editing
programs would be to 300 bucks but I

926
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,230
programs would be to 300 bucks but I
 

927
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,779
programs would be to 300 bucks but I
guess they're all really cheap by the

928
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:02,789
guess they're all really cheap by the
 

929
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:06,859
guess they're all really cheap by the
looks of it someone has suggested I use

930
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:06,869
looks of it someone has suggested I use

Vegas so what do you think is the best

936
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:17,370
Vegas so what do you think is the best
 

937
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,550
Vegas so what do you think is the best
let me know because I should probably

938
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:19,560
let me know because I should probably
 

939
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,780
let me know because I should probably
get something better it's that time time

940
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:23,790
get something better it's that time time
 

941
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:29,450
get something better it's that time time
