00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,550
but we do have our farmer back again the
interesting thing about this is he's

174
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
interesting thing about this is he's
 

175
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,110
interesting thing about this is he's
from

176
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
from
 

177
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,869
from
a long time ago right so his trades are

178
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
a long time ago right so his trades are
 

179
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,149
a long time ago right so his trades are
kind of broken

180
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
kind of broken
 

181
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,670
kind of broken
let's see if we can still trade

182
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680
let's see if we can still trade
 

183
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,630
let's see if we can still trade
infinitely with them

184
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640

 

185
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,229

without him having to restock looks like

186
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
without him having to restock looks like
 

187
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,630
without him having to restock looks like
we still can but his trades didn't get

188
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
we still can but his trades didn't get
 

189
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,229
we still can but his trades didn't get
cheaper after he got cured

190
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
cheaper after he got cured
 

191
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,509
cheaper after he got cured
a lot of people asked how you do that

192
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
a lot of people asked how you do that
 

193
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,949
a lot of people asked how you do that
with the trading by the way you just hit

194
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
with the trading by the way you just hit
 

195
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,830
with the trading by the way you just hit
spacebar to

196
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
spacebar to
 

197
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,550
spacebar to
refill anyways let's get to working on

198
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
refill anyways let's get to working on
 

199
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,350
refill anyways let's get to working on
some stuff here

200
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
some stuff here
 

201
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,990
some stuff here
so the plan for today is to expand out

202
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
so the plan for today is to expand out
 

203
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,589
so the plan for today is to expand out
to a new area

204
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
to a new area
 

205
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,030
to a new area
which means we gotta build a thousand

206
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
which means we gotta build a thousand
 

207
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,789
which means we gotta build a thousand
blocks of nether tunnel which means we

208
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
blocks of nether tunnel which means we
 

209
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,910
blocks of nether tunnel which means we
need basalt

210
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
need basalt
 

211
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,430
need basalt
which means we gotta build a basalt

212
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
which means we gotta build a basalt
 

213
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,949
which means we gotta build a basalt
generator

214
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
generator
 

215
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,710
generator
so we're building up a salt generator

216
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
so we're building up a salt generator
 

217
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,949
so we're building up a salt generator
above our goon farm where we can

218
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
above our goon farm where we can
 

219
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,589
above our goon farm where we can
uh either actively mine it or afk mine

220
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
uh either actively mine it or afk mine
 

221
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,350
uh either actively mine it or afk mine
it

222
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
it
 

223
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,270
it
gonna work something like this i'm still

224
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
gonna work something like this i'm still
 

225
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,589
gonna work something like this i'm still
in the middle of building it right now

226
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
in the middle of building it right now
 

227
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,910
in the middle of building it right now
we gotta make sure we spawn proof

228
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
we gotta make sure we spawn proof
 

229
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,750
we gotta make sure we spawn proof
everything we're putting glass over top

230
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
everything we're putting glass over top
 

231
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,309
everything we're putting glass over top
um so iron golems or mobs won't spawn on

232
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
um so iron golems or mobs won't spawn on
 

233
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,229
um so iron golems or mobs won't spawn on
top of anything

234
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
top of anything
 

235
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,630
top of anything
and it's a very strange idea

236
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
and it's a very strange idea
 

237
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,110
and it's a very strange idea
basically it if the salt gets mined

238
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
basically it if the salt gets mined
 

239
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,710
basically it if the salt gets mined
under any of these note blocks it'll

240
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
under any of these note blocks it'll
 

241
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,310
under any of these note blocks it'll
activate the pistons

242
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
activate the pistons
 

243
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,509
activate the pistons
and we're gonna be checkering the note

244
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
and we're gonna be checkering the note
 

245
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,390
and we're gonna be checkering the note
blocks

246
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
blocks
 

247
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,390
blocks
and then have three pistons on one side

248
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
and then have three pistons on one side
 

249
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,670
and then have three pistons on one side
and two on the other and they'll

250
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
and two on the other and they'll
 

251
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,469
and two on the other and they'll
intertwine

252
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
intertwine
 

253
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,350
intertwine
the basalts all into one big piece here

254
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
the basalts all into one big piece here
 

255
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,030
the basalts all into one big piece here
that we can hopefully mine

256
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
that we can hopefully mine
 

257
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,189
that we can hopefully mine
um and the way we got to do this is

258
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
um and the way we got to do this is
 

259
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,030
um and the way we got to do this is
let's see we're on this piston next we

260
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
let's see we're on this piston next we
 

261
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,030
let's see we're on this piston next we
got to get

262
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
got to get
 

263
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,790
got to get
uh i think we got to start this side

264
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
uh i think we got to start this side
 

265
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,390
uh i think we got to start this side
actually so

266
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
actually so
 

267
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,870
actually so
it'll be glass here note block

268
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
it'll be glass here note block
 

269
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,310
it'll be glass here note block
and then we want the observer going this

270
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
and then we want the observer going this
 

271
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,950
and then we want the observer going this
way to that piston

272
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
way to that piston
 

273
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,790
way to that piston
so then we just do something like this

274
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
so then we just do something like this
 

275
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,390
so then we just do something like this
all the way down now in order to

276
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
all the way down now in order to
 

277
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,990
all the way down now in order to
generate basalt you need to run

278
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
generate basalt you need to run
 

279
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,830
generate basalt you need to run
lava towards blue ice with soul soil

280
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
lava towards blue ice with soul soil
 

281
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,189
lava towards blue ice with soul soil
below and then that updates the note

282
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
below and then that updates the note
 

283
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,590
below and then that updates the note
block

284
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
block
 

285
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,629
block
above which pushes the piston so

286
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
above which pushes the piston so
 

287
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,270
above which pushes the piston so
there's a lot of stuff going on there

288
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
there's a lot of stuff going on there
 

289
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,110
there's a lot of stuff going on there
and i didn't pre-build this in creative

290
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
and i didn't pre-build this in creative
 

291
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,830
and i didn't pre-build this in creative
so it might be total garbage we'll find

292
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840

 

293
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,310

out

294
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
out
 

295
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,990
out
they're all activating right yeah i hope

296
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
they're all activating right yeah i hope
 

297
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,110
they're all activating right yeah i hope
so

298
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120

 

299
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,670

okay see what happens here

300
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680

 

301
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,110

i think it's okay

302
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
i think it's okay
 

303
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,310
i think it's okay
i don't know if it's gonna regenerate

304
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
i don't know if it's gonna regenerate
 

305
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,830
i don't know if it's gonna regenerate
fast enough oh we're only getting three

306
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
fast enough oh we're only getting three
 

307
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,029
fast enough oh we're only getting three
layers deep

308
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039

 

309
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,670

supposed to be all five and yeah

310
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
supposed to be all five and yeah
 

311
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,950
supposed to be all five and yeah
probably the best way of using it is

312
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
probably the best way of using it is
 

313
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,150
probably the best way of using it is
just to uh

314
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
just to uh
 

315
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,590
just to uh
kind of afk in the middle here and we'll

316
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
kind of afk in the middle here and we'll
 

317
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,670
kind of afk in the middle here and we'll
get all five rows at once

318
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
get all five rows at once
 

319
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,830
get all five rows at once
maybe even in between the hoppers would

320
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
maybe even in between the hoppers would
 

321
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,510
maybe even in between the hoppers would
be best

322
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
be best
 

323
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,469
be best
somewhere around here and then all the

324
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
somewhere around here and then all the
 

325
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,990
somewhere around here and then all the
hoppers collect the drops together and

326
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
hoppers collect the drops together and
 

327
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,950
hoppers collect the drops together and
the chest down

328
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
the chest down
 

329
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,029
the chest down
below and it's just another thing we can

330
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
below and it's just another thing we can
 

331
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,950
below and it's just another thing we can
do while we're waiting for iron golems

332
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
do while we're waiting for iron golems
 

333
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,189
do while we're waiting for iron golems
and

334
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
and
 

335
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,390
and
and gold to generate aha yep yep so

336
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
and gold to generate aha yep yep so
 

337
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,110
and gold to generate aha yep yep so
today is the day everybody oh i've been

338
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
today is the day everybody oh i've been
 

339
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,270
today is the day everybody oh i've been
looking forward to this

340
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
looking forward to this

and we'll get into more detail on what

410
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
and we'll get into more detail on what
 

411
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,029
and we'll get into more detail on what
that means exactly in just a second here

412
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
that means exactly in just a second here
 

413
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,710
that means exactly in just a second here
but first i just wanted to show you

414
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
but first i just wanted to show you
 

415
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,909
but first i just wanted to show you
where that tunnel we just built leads to

416
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
where that tunnel we just built leads to
 

417
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,909
where that tunnel we just built leads to
to a jungle of course we're going to be

418
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
to a jungle of course we're going to be
 

419
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,430
to a jungle of course we're going to be
starting our project

420
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
starting our project
 

421
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,350
starting our project
where the grass is the greenest you know

422
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
where the grass is the greenest you know
 

423
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,390
where the grass is the greenest you know
me we got to start off in a jungle

424
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
me we got to start off in a jungle
 

425
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,870
me we got to start off in a jungle
i actually spent many hours looking at

426
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
i actually spent many hours looking at
 

427
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,029
i actually spent many hours looking at
different locations and i figured this

428
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
different locations and i figured this
 

429
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,110
different locations and i figured this
one would be the best

430
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
one would be the best
 

431
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,270
one would be the best
for what we got planned with this

432
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
for what we got planned with this
 

433
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,870
for what we got planned with this
project um

434
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
project um
 

435
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,029
project um
the idea is we're gonna use this as our

436
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
the idea is we're gonna use this as our
 

437
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:41,909
the idea is we're gonna use this as our
central hub

438
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
central hub
 

439
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,990
central hub
location and ultimately the goal with

440
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
location and ultimately the goal with
 

441
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,550
location and ultimately the goal with
the project will be to expand out

442
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
the project will be to expand out
 

443
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,589
the project will be to expand out
hundreds if not thousands of blocks into

444
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
hundreds if not thousands of blocks into
 

445
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,950
hundreds if not thousands of blocks into
other biomes in order for it to be

446
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
other biomes in order for it to be
 

447
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,869
other biomes in order for it to be
complete it has to actually

448
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
complete it has to actually
 

449
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,070
complete it has to actually
so uh we should get further and further

450
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
so uh we should get further and further
 

451
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,230
so uh we should get further and further
away from this jungle as we work on this

452
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
away from this jungle as we work on this
 

453
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,990
away from this jungle as we work on this
more and more basically

454
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
more and more basically
 

455
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,469
more and more basically
um but i figured this would be a nice

456
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
um but i figured this would be a nice
 

457
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,110
um but i figured this would be a nice
starting

458
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
starting
 

459
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,510
starting
location now the cool thing about this

460
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
location now the cool thing about this
 

461
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,430
location now the cool thing about this
area we got picked out is there's many

462
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
area we got picked out is there's many
 

463
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,710
area we got picked out is there's many
different biomes

464
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
different biomes
 

465
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,110
different biomes
right next to this jungle like rare ones

466
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
right next to this jungle like rare ones
 

467
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,029
right next to this jungle like rare ones

508
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
and put it in our facility and then
 

509
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,870
and put it in our facility and then
arrange it present it in a way that is

510
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
arrange it present it in a way that is
 

511
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,630
arrange it present it in a way that is
hopefully useful

512
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
hopefully useful
 

513
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,710
hopefully useful
that hopefully looks good and

514
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
that hopefully looks good and
 

515
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,550
that hopefully looks good and
also very important is i want it to be

516
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
also very important is i want it to be
 

517
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,070
also very important is i want it to be
interactive as well

518
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
interactive as well
 

519
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,670
interactive as well
yeah so i'm thinking there's going to be

520
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
yeah so i'm thinking there's going to be
 

521
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,990
yeah so i'm thinking there's going to be
five main categories of information

522
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
five main categories of information
 

523
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,790
five main categories of information
we'll want to store in our facility here

524
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,800
we'll want to store in our facility here
 

525
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,509
we'll want to store in our facility here

techniques
 

529
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,470
techniques
and world generation and then each of

530
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
and world generation and then each of
 

531
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,150
and world generation and then each of
these main categories is going to have

532
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
these main categories is going to have
 

533
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,110
these main categories is going to have
subcategories

534
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
subcategories
 

535
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,190
subcategories
tied to it so let's take game mechanics

536
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
tied to it so let's take game mechanics
 

537
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,710
tied to it so let's take game mechanics
as an example

538
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
as an example
 

539
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,030
as an example
uh there's probably dozens and dozens of

540
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
uh there's probably dozens and dozens of
 

541
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,389
uh there's probably dozens and dozens of
game mechanics we would want to

542
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
game mechanics we would want to
 

543
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,150
game mechanics we would want to
represent in our facility here

544
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
represent in our facility here
 

545
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,910
represent in our facility here
i just put down 10 of them to give you

546
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
i just put down 10 of them to give you
 

547
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,430
i just put down 10 of them to give you
an idea what i mean

548
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
an idea what i mean
 

549
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,310
an idea what i mean
so let's take damage as an example

550
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
so let's take damage as an example
 

551
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,750
so let's take damage as an example
number five here

552
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
number five here
 

553
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,070
number five here
so the real world application of this is

554
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
so the real world application of this is
 

555
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,509
so the real world application of this is
we would build a room

556
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
we would build a room
 

557
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,790
we would build a room
in our facility to display

558
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
in our facility to display
 

559
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,870
in our facility to display
information on how damage works in the

560
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
information on how damage works in the
 

561
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,829
information on how damage works in the
game

562
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
game
 

563
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,670
game
now there's many different ways you can

564
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
now there's many different ways you can
 

565
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,790
now there's many different ways you can
take damage in this game cactus

566
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
take damage in this game cactus
 

567
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,750
take damage in this game cactus
fall damage fire you know getting shot

568
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760

we would need to have all those

572
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079
we would need to have all those
 

573
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,790
we would need to have all those
forms of damage housed in the facility

574
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
forms of damage housed in the facility
 

575
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,630
forms of damage housed in the facility
with what's possible in survival of

576
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
with what's possible in survival of
 

577
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,110
with what's possible in survival of
course

obviously we can't get an enderdragon in

580
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
obviously we can't get an enderdragon in
 

581
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,750
obviously we can't get an enderdragon in
our facility

our facility
 

583
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,590
our facility
i don't think at least unless you guys

584
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
i don't think at least unless you guys
 

585
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,870
i don't think at least unless you guys
know away

586
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
know away
 

587
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,710
know away
but as as far as it's possible we're

588
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
but as as far as it's possible we're
 

589
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,230
but as as far as it's possible we're
going to want to try to do this stuff

590
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
going to want to try to do this stuff
 

591
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,389
going to want to try to do this stuff
and not only do we want like a lectern

592
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
and not only do we want like a lectern
 

593
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,230
and not only do we want like a lectern
with information oh cactuses cause

594
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
with information oh cactuses cause
 

595

damage
 

597
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,310
damage
fire causes damage how much damage oh

598
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
fire causes damage how much damage oh
 

599
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,150
fire causes damage how much damage oh
this many hearts right we don't want to

600
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
this many hearts right we don't want to
 

601
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,670
this many hearts right we don't want to
just have the information

602
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
just have the information
 

603
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,750
just have the information
stored we want to be able to interact

604
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
stored we want to be able to interact
 

605
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,590
stored we want to be able to interact
with it we need to be able to test and

606
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
with it we need to be able to test and
 

607
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,190
with it we need to be able to test and
show

608
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
show
 

609
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,269
show
cactuses cause damage we need to be able

610
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:41,279
cactuses cause damage we need to be able
 

611
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,430
cactuses cause damage we need to be able
to design experiments where we can hop

612
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
to design experiments where we can hop
 

613
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,269
to design experiments where we can hop
on cactuses and see how much damage they

614
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
on cactuses and see how much damage they
 

615
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,069
on cactuses and see how much damage they
cause

616
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
cause
 

617
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,910
cause
so there's gonna be a lot of stuff to

618
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
so there's gonna be a lot of stuff to
 

619
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,269
so there's gonna be a lot of stuff to
factor in here

620
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
factor in here
 

621
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,670
factor in here
a lot of things to think about um and

622
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
a lot of things to think about um and
 

623
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,350
a lot of things to think about um and
that's just the first one mobs

624
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
that's just the first one mobs
 

625
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,509
that's just the first one mobs
we talked about making a zoo a long time

626
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
we talked about making a zoo a long time
 

627
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,470
we talked about making a zoo a long time
ago and that's

628
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
ago and that's
 

629
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,910
ago and that's
we're gonna combine that into this

630
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920
we're gonna combine that into this
 

631
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,630
we're gonna combine that into this
project we're going to have a room for

632
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
project we're going to have a room for
 

633
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,069
project we're going to have a room for
every single type of mob in the game and

634
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
every single type of mob in the game and
 

635
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,990
every single type of mob in the game and
rather than like on a wiki page where

636
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
rather than like on a wiki page where
 

637
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,509
rather than like on a wiki page where
you just have a picture of a mob we're

638
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
you just have a picture of a mob we're
 

639
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,190
you just have a picture of a mob we're
going to have the actual mob

640
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
going to have the actual mob
 

641
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,310
going to have the actual mob
in the game here on display and then

642
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
in the game here on display and then
 

643
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,470
in the game here on display and then
all the information tied to that mob

644
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
all the information tied to that mob
 

645
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,069
all the information tied to that mob
hopefully within a room

646
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
hopefully within a room
 

647
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,389
hopefully within a room
every every category gets its own room

648
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
every every category gets its own room
 

649
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,350
every every category gets its own room
basically

650
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
basically
 

651
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,590
basically
so our facility is made up of two main

652
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
so our facility is made up of two main
 

653
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,949
so our facility is made up of two main
things the rooms

654
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
things the rooms
 

655
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,230
things the rooms
those are our wiki entries basically the

656
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
those are our wiki entries basically the
 

657
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,670
those are our wiki entries basically the
data

658
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
data
 

659
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,030
data
and then there's gonna be um like

660
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
and then there's gonna be um like
 

661
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,190
and then there's gonna be um like
hallways and corridors to tie our rooms

662
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
hallways and corridors to tie our rooms
 

663
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,870
hallways and corridors to tie our rooms
together to organize them

664
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
together to organize them
 

665
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,790
together to organize them
maybe transportation systems through the

666
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
maybe transportation systems through the
 

667
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,710
maybe transportation systems through the
facility elevators

668
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
facility elevators
 

669
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,030
facility elevators
i'm gonna need like a storage room and

670
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
i'm gonna need like a storage room and
 

671
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,350
i'm gonna need like a storage room and
like smelting area

672
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
like smelting area
 

673
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,829
like smelting area
um so there's two main things the rooms

674
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
um so there's two main things the rooms
 

675
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,509
um so there's two main things the rooms
and then the facility

676
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
and then the facility
 

677
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,150
and then the facility
and the lore behind it basically this is

678
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
and the lore behind it basically this is
 

679
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,670
and the lore behind it basically this is
a very talky episode i hope you guys

680
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
a very talky episode i hope you guys
 

681
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,870
a very talky episode i hope you guys
don't mind

682
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
don't mind
 

683
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,710
don't mind
i just want to make some stuff clear

684
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
i just want to make some stuff clear
 

685
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,470
i just want to make some stuff clear
here before we get into it

686
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
here before we get into it
 

687
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,590
here before we get into it
um now some of these are pretty closely

688
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
um now some of these are pretty closely
 

689
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,350
um now some of these are pretty closely
linked to each other as well like mining

690
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
linked to each other as well like mining
 

691
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,870
linked to each other as well like mining
is kind of linked with tools

692
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
is kind of linked with tools
 

693
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,269
is kind of linked with tools
certain tools speed up your mining speed

694
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
certain tools speed up your mining speed
 

695
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:05,910
certain tools speed up your mining speed
right

696
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
right
 

697
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,030
right
so rather than having like url links um

698
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
so rather than having like url links um
 

699
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,470
so rather than having like url links um
like you would have on a wiki page we'll

700
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
like you would have on a wiki page we'll
 

701
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,310
like you would have on a wiki page we'll
probably have like a tunnel from

702
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
probably have like a tunnel from
 

703
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,870
probably have like a tunnel from
our mining room to our tool room and

704
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
our mining room to our tool room and
 

705
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,430
our mining room to our tool room and
link them together that way

706
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
link them together that way
 

707
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,629
link them together that way
in the facility if that makes sense

708
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
in the facility if that makes sense
 

709
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,150
in the facility if that makes sense
and then we've talked about making a

710
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
and then we've talked about making a
 

711
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,069
and then we've talked about making a
redstone museum before i'd like to have

712
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
redstone museum before i'd like to have
 

713
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,389
redstone museum before i'd like to have
all the different redstone components um

714
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
all the different redstone components um
 

715
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,230
all the different redstone components um
on display somewhere building technique

716
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
on display somewhere building technique
 

717
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,750
on display somewhere building technique
i'm not quite sure what we're gonna do

718
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
i'm not quite sure what we're gonna do
 

719
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,790
i'm not quite sure what we're gonna do
with that but i would like to

720
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
with that but i would like to
 

721
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,910
with that but i would like to
maybe go over some things like this and

722
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
maybe go over some things like this and
 

723
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,829
maybe go over some things like this and
have a room for each of these things

724
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:37,839
have a room for each of these things
 

725
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,509
have a room for each of these things
world generation i would like to

726
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
world generation i would like to
 

727
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,430
world generation i would like to
make a room for each of the biomes in

728
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:41,440
make a room for each of the biomes in
 

729
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,550
make a room for each of the biomes in
the game

730
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
the game
 

731
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,030
the game
um like what blocks generate in those

732
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
um like what blocks generate in those
 

733
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,750
um like what blocks generate in those
biomes

734
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
biomes
 

735
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,870
biomes
and also like any structures like

736
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
and also like any structures like
 

737
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,629
and also like any structures like
rather than just having a picture of a

738
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
rather than just having a picture of a
 

739
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,069
rather than just having a picture of a
water temple like you would have on the

740
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
water temple like you would have on the
 

741
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,590
water temple like you would have on the
wiki page we want to

742
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
wiki page we want to
 

743
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,790
wiki page we want to
find a water temple in our world

744
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
find a water temple in our world
 

745
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,230
find a water temple in our world
excavate it and have it on display in a

746
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
excavate it and have it on display in a
 

747
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,870
excavate it and have it on display in a
room

748
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
room
 

749
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,949
room
so that's why we need to like spread out

750
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
so that's why we need to like spread out
 

751
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,790
so that's why we need to like spread out
and cover lots of area

752
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
and cover lots of area
 

753
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,430
and cover lots of area
with this project that's the grand idea

754
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
with this project that's the grand idea
 

755
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,310
with this project that's the grand idea
with the project

756
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
with the project
 

757
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,069
with the project
how far we get with it is another

758
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
how far we get with it is another
 

759
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,389
how far we get with it is another
question though because obviously

760
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
question though because obviously
 

761
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,470
question though because obviously
we're talking about a ton of work here i

762
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
we're talking about a ton of work here i
 

763
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,910
we're talking about a ton of work here i
i would say minimum

764
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
i would say minimum
 

765
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,310
i would say minimum
100 episodes could easily be spent on

766
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
100 episodes could easily be spent on
 

767
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,629
100 episodes could easily be spent on
this probably a lot more

768
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
this probably a lot more
 

769
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,790
this probably a lot more
um so a lot of it's gonna depend on what

770
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
um so a lot of it's gonna depend on what
 

771
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,310
um so a lot of it's gonna depend on what
you guys think about the project if you

772
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
you guys think about the project if you
 

773
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,829
you guys think about the project if you
like it or if you think i should scrap

774
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
like it or if you think i should scrap
 

775
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:26,550
like it or if you think i should scrap
it

776
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
it
 

777
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,430
it
um if you like it the good news is we'll

778
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
um if you like it the good news is we'll
 

779
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,150
um if you like it the good news is we'll
never run out of content to do

780
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
never run out of content to do
 

781
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,430
never run out of content to do
um and the thing about this project like

782
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
um and the thing about this project like
 

783
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,949
um and the thing about this project like
if you think about the nexus it's like

784
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
if you think about the nexus it's like
 

785
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,430
if you think about the nexus it's like
it kind of gets repetitive over time

786
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
it kind of gets repetitive over time
 

787
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,550
it kind of gets repetitive over time
um the redstone systems get all big and

788
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
um the redstone systems get all big and
 

789
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,230
um the redstone systems get all big and
convoluted to where we can barely

790
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
convoluted to where we can barely
 

791
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,189
convoluted to where we can barely
understand them

792
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:45,199
understand them
 

793
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,030
understand them
and with this project i think most of

794
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
and with this project i think most of
 

795
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,389
and with this project i think most of
it's going to be pretty straightforward

796
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
it's going to be pretty straightforward
 

797
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,990
it's going to be pretty straightforward
we can look at it and get an idea of

798
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
we can look at it and get an idea of
 

799
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,389
we can look at it and get an idea of
what's going on so i like that

800
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:52,399
what's going on so i like that
 

801
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,829
what's going on so i like that
it's not really going to be repetitive

802
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
it's not really going to be repetitive
 

803
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,150
it's not really going to be repetitive
because every thing is a different thing

804
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
because every thing is a different thing
 

805
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,030
because every thing is a different thing
right

806
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
right
 

807
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,310
right
and also it doesn't need to be finished

808
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
and also it doesn't need to be finished
 

809
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,990
and also it doesn't need to be finished
for us to enjoy it like the more

810
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
for us to enjoy it like the more
 

811
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,550
for us to enjoy it like the more
we work on it the cooler and better it's

812
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
we work on it the cooler and better it's
 

813
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,430
we work on it the cooler and better it's
going to be

814
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
going to be
 

815
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,910
going to be
hmm it's looking like it's around here

816
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
hmm it's looking like it's around here
 

817
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,670
hmm it's looking like it's around here
somewhere it's going underground here so

818
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
somewhere it's going underground here so
 

819
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,910
somewhere it's going underground here so
let's go check out the stronghold

820
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
let's go check out the stronghold
 

821
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,829
let's go check out the stronghold
um that's another key reason we picked

822
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
um that's another key reason we picked
 

823
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,430
um that's another key reason we picked
this location

824
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
this location
 

825
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,790
this location
i'm going to dig straight down because i

826
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
i'm going to dig straight down because i
 

827
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,110
i'm going to dig straight down because i
got a fire resistant potion

828
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
got a fire resistant potion
 

829
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,030
got a fire resistant potion
now i don't want to damage the

830
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
now i don't want to damage the
 

831
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,389
now i don't want to damage the
stronghold because we might be using

832
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
stronghold because we might be using
 

833
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,629
stronghold because we might be using
this as our display

834
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:24,639
this as our display
 

835
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,829
this as our display
for the project right um let's go

836
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
for the project right um let's go
 

837
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,629
for the project right um let's go
through a stone brick

838
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:30,639
through a stone brick
 

839
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,269
through a stone brick

expensive project as well so we need to
 

871
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,230
expensive project as well so we need to
keep working on making farms in our

872

keep working on making farms in our
 

873
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,990
keep working on making farms in our
worlds building up infrastructure so

874
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,000
worlds building up infrastructure so
 

875
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,990
worlds building up infrastructure so
that we can actually afford

876
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
that we can actually afford
 

877
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,949
that we can actually afford
uh doing this brand project right so

878
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
uh doing this brand project right so
 

879
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,710
uh doing this brand project right so
we'll be spending probably 20 to 50

880
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
we'll be spending probably 20 to 50
 

881
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,310
we'll be spending probably 20 to 50
percent of our time

882
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
percent of our time
 

883
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,110
percent of our time

block
can doors float getting very close okay

898
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
can doors float getting very close okay
 

899
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,150
can doors float getting very close okay
i'm gonna check the fire resistance

900
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
i'm gonna check the fire resistance
 

901
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,670
i'm gonna check the fire resistance
hopefully there's no creeper in this

902
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
hopefully there's no creeper in this
 

903
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,069
hopefully there's no creeper in this
room i found the location though it

904
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
room i found the location though it
 

905
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,030
room i found the location though it
should be

906
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
should be
 

907
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,389
should be
right in the middle here yeah no creeper

908
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
right in the middle here yeah no creeper
 

909
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,430
right in the middle here yeah no creeper
okay we're safe

910
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
okay we're safe
 

911
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,189
okay we're safe
uh let's get out of the lava

912
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:47,199

 

913
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,389

and i am just gonna block the

914
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
and i am just gonna block the
 

915
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,189
and i am just gonna block the
door it's easy to remove later right

916
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
door it's easy to remove later right
 

917
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,110
door it's easy to remove later right
now i will light up the portal though

918
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
now i will light up the portal though
 

919
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,550
now i will light up the portal though
we're not going to preserve that because

920
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
we're not going to preserve that because
 

921
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,470
we're not going to preserve that because
i need to use this to get back

922
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
i need to use this to get back
 

923
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,870
i need to use this to get back
to like the man cave and stuff quickly

924
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
to like the man cave and stuff quickly
 

925
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,550
to like the man cave and stuff quickly
so yeah we're going to do that because

926
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
so yeah we're going to do that because
 

927
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,870
so yeah we're going to do that because
we are 11 000

928
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
we are 11 000
 

929
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,030
we are 11 000
blocks on the x coordinates and 9 000 on

930
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
blocks on the x coordinates and 9 000 on
 

931
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,550
blocks on the x coordinates and 9 000 on
the z it's a pretty

932
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
the z it's a pretty
 

933
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,590
the z it's a pretty
long distance so now we can just hop in

934
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
long distance so now we can just hop in
 

935
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,870
long distance so now we can just hop in
here

936
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
here
 

937
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,990
here
and then fly up to our

938
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000
and then fly up to our
 

939
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,910
and then fly up to our
end portal over here and we should get

940
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
end portal over here and we should get
 

941
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,310
end portal over here and we should get
taken back to

942
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,320
taken back to
 

943
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,230
taken back to
the man cave area yeah then we can just

944
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,240
the man cave area yeah then we can just
 

945
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,990
the man cave area yeah then we can just
take the nether if we need to go back

946
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,000
take the nether if we need to go back
 

947
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,910
take the nether if we need to go back
anyways my main goal with this episode

948
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
anyways my main goal with this episode
 

949
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,509
anyways my main goal with this episode
was just to introduce the idea to you

950
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
was just to introduce the idea to you
 

951
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:31,910
was just to introduce the idea to you
guys

952
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
guys
 

953
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,790
guys
but we'll probably get started on one of

954
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
but we'll probably get started on one of
 

955
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,150
but we'll probably get started on one of
the rooms to better

956
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
the rooms to better
 

957
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,629
the rooms to better
show you how it's going to work so maybe

958
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
show you how it's going to work so maybe
 

959
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,870
show you how it's going to work so maybe
we'll try to do the mining mechanic

960
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
we'll try to do the mining mechanic
 

961
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,949
we'll try to do the mining mechanic
game mechanic and we're on a fairly big

962
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:44,959
game mechanic and we're on a fairly big
 

963
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,189
game mechanic and we're on a fairly big
piece of land right now i think we're

964
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
piece of land right now i think we're
 

965
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,749
piece of land right now i think we're
going to need a big room for this one

966
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
going to need a big room for this one
 

967
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,949
going to need a big room for this one
we're going to dig down to about y

968
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
we're going to dig down to about y
 

969
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,310
we're going to dig down to about y
180 and then start hollowing out

970
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:56,320
180 and then start hollowing out
 

971
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,990
180 and then start hollowing out
this mountain um

972
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
this mountain um
 

973
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,509
this mountain um
the reason we're going down low is

974
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
the reason we're going down low is
 

975
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,629
the reason we're going down low is
because we're going to eventually move

976
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:02,639
because we're going to eventually move
 

977
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,710
because we're going to eventually move
an elder guardian here for

978
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
an elder guardian here for
 

979
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,189
an elder guardian here for
the mining fatigue effect we need that

980
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
the mining fatigue effect we need that
 

981
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,789
the mining fatigue effect we need that
for this room

982
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
for this room
 

983
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,309
for this room
and he's gonna be up at the top of the

984
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
and he's gonna be up at the top of the
 

985
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,829
and he's gonna be up at the top of the
world there so that we're

986
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
world there so that we're
 

987
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,750
world there so that we're
we can pull a switch to receive it when

988
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
we can pull a switch to receive it when
 

989
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,510
we can pull a switch to receive it when
we want uh

990

we want uh
 

991
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,110
we want uh
in this room now as far as how we're

992
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
in this room now as far as how we're
 

993
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,309
in this room now as far as how we're
doing the building

994
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:20,319
doing the building
 

995
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,990
doing the building
with this i think we'll want to try to

996
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
with this i think we'll want to try to
 

997
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,069
with this i think we'll want to try to
keep a lot of it underground

998
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
keep a lot of it underground
 

999
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,990
keep a lot of it underground
just to save time if i have to build

1000
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
just to save time if i have to build
 

1001
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,829
just to save time if i have to build
exteriors like this is never going to

1002
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
exteriors like this is never going to
 

1003
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,750
exteriors like this is never going to
get done

1004
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
get done
 

1005
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,190
get done
at the very most we'll probably have

1006
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
at the very most we'll probably have
 

1007
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,750
at the very most we'll probably have
facades like maybe we'll have something

1008
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
facades like maybe we'll have something
 

1009
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,830
facades like maybe we'll have something
showing on the outside of the hill here

1010
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
showing on the outside of the hill here
 

1011
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,230
showing on the outside of the hill here
uh but we don't want to spend too much

1012
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
uh but we don't want to spend too much
 

1013
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,310
uh but we don't want to spend too much
time building exteriors if we can help

1014
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
time building exteriors if we can help
 

1015
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,510
time building exteriors if we can help
it it's going to be more like

1016
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
it it's going to be more like
 

1017
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,710
it it's going to be more like
the man cave style and yeah let's just

1018
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
the man cave style and yeah let's just
 

1019
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,310
the man cave style and yeah let's just
clear out a bunch of land and see

1020
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
clear out a bunch of land and see
 

1021
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,470
clear out a bunch of land and see
how much space we have all right very

1022
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
how much space we have all right very
 

1023
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,830
how much space we have all right very
cool so we cleared out a little bit of

1024
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
cool so we cleared out a little bit of
 

1025
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,990
cool so we cleared out a little bit of
space here to get us started and

1026
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
space here to get us started and
 

1027
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,310
space here to get us started and
we got a fair bit of space to make a

1028
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
we got a fair bit of space to make a
 

1029
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,510
we got a fair bit of space to make a
mining room here

1030
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
mining room here
 

1031
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,350
mining room here
if we need more we can always extend

1032
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
if we need more we can always extend
 

1033
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,150
if we need more we can always extend
platforms off the side here it's fine or

1034
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
platforms off the side here it's fine or
 

1035
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,310
platforms off the side here it's fine or
we can go down vertically too

1036
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
we can go down vertically too
 

1037
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,110
we can go down vertically too
it should be okay now looking around

1038
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
it should be okay now looking around
 

1039
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,510
it should be okay now looking around
here i think

1040
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,520
here i think
 

1041
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,110
here i think
i think what we're going to want to do

1042
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
i think what we're going to want to do
 

1043
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,549
i think what we're going to want to do
is make the entrance

1044
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
is make the entrance
 

1045
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,150
is make the entrance
to this room over here because looking

1046
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,160
to this room over here because looking
 

1047
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,909
to this room over here because looking
out here it looks like uh we got a good

1048
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
out here it looks like uh we got a good
 

1049
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,430
out here it looks like uh we got a good
view for one thing

1050
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
view for one thing
 

1051
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,830
view for one thing
and we could maybe make a tunnel and

1052
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
and we could maybe make a tunnel and
 

1053
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,430
and we could maybe make a tunnel and
that goes from this room to

1054
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
that goes from this room to
 

1055
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,470
that goes from this room to
over here and make another room in this

1056
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
over here and make another room in this
 

1057
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,110
over here and make another room in this
big mountain area now to be honest i

1058
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
big mountain area now to be honest i
 

1059
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,150
big mountain area now to be honest i
don't exactly

1060
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,160
don't exactly
 

1061
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,230
don't exactly
know what i'm doing here i'm really

1062
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
know what i'm doing here i'm really
 

1063
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,590
know what i'm doing here i'm really
hoping you guys will help me out a lot

1064
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
hoping you guys will help me out a lot
 

1065
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,549
hoping you guys will help me out a lot
with this project like i need ideas for

1066
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
with this project like i need ideas for
 

1067
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,750
with this project like i need ideas for
um decorative things for building things

1068
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
um decorative things for building things
 

1069
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,630
um decorative things for building things
help me with how we're presenting the

1070
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
help me with how we're presenting the
 

1071
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,270
help me with how we're presenting the
information help me with organizing it

1072
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,280
information help me with organizing it
 

1073
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,710
information help me with organizing it
like i don't know if we should make this

1074
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
like i don't know if we should make this
 

1075
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,470
like i don't know if we should make this
the mining room or if it should be more

1076
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
the mining room or if it should be more
 

1077
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,270
the mining room or if it should be more
like the block

1078
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
like the block
 

1079
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,669
like the block
breaking room or maybe digging rooms a

1080
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:49,679
breaking room or maybe digging rooms a
 

1081
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,950
breaking room or maybe digging rooms a
better name for it

1082
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
better name for it
 

1083
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,390
better name for it
because mining kind of implies we're

1084
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
because mining kind of implies we're
 

1085
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,150
because mining kind of implies we're
going to have information on how ores

1086
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
going to have information on how ores
 

1087
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,750
going to have information on how ores
generate in the world and stuff and i

1088
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
generate in the world and stuff and i
 

1089
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,029
generate in the world and stuff and i
was thinking maybe

1090
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
was thinking maybe
 

1091
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,310
was thinking maybe
let's just focus on like breaking blocks

1092
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,320
let's just focus on like breaking blocks
 

1093
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,110
let's just focus on like breaking blocks
right

1094
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120
right
 

1095
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,150
right
so for example mining speed

1096
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
so for example mining speed
 

1097
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,070
so for example mining speed
speed mining would be a big thing i

1098
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
speed mining would be a big thing i
 

1099
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,070
speed mining would be a big thing i
would want in this room

1100
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,080
would want in this room
 

1101
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,549
would want in this room
and one of the things that affects that

1102
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
and one of the things that affects that
 

1103
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,590
and one of the things that affects that
is like if you're

1104
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
is like if you're
 

1105
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,990
is like if you're
airborne you break blocks slower

1106
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,000
airborne you break blocks slower
 

1107
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,029
airborne you break blocks slower
compared to if you're

1108
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
compared to if you're
 

1109
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,990
compared to if you're
on the ground now we would want maybe a

1110
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
on the ground now we would want maybe a
 

1111
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,830
on the ground now we would want maybe a
presentation to show

1112
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
presentation to show
 

1113
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,150
presentation to show
what happens if you're on a ladder like

1114
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
what happens if you're on a ladder like
 

1115
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,150
what happens if you're on a ladder like
floating like this

1116
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
floating like this
 

1117
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,630
floating like this
looks like it slows us down so i think

1118
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
looks like it slows us down so i think
 

1119
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,710
looks like it slows us down so i think
that slows down our mining speed by five

1120
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
that slows down our mining speed by five
 

1121
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,669
that slows down our mining speed by five
times

1122
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
times
 

1123
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,669
times
but uh we'll have to figure all that

1124
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:31,679
but uh we'll have to figure all that
 

1125
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,510
but uh we'll have to figure all that
stuff out

1126
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
stuff out
 

1127
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,590
stuff out
um another thing that slows down mining

1128
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:35,600
um another thing that slows down mining
 

1129
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,789
um another thing that slows down mining
speed is water

1130
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
speed is water
 

1131
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,150
speed is water
so we would probably want somewhere

1132
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
so we would probably want somewhere
 

1133
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,830
so we would probably want somewhere
where we can stand in water and try

1134
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
where we can stand in water and try
 

1135
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,110
where we can stand in water and try
mining

1136
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
mining
 

1137
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,549
mining
then we would want some way of combining

1138
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
then we would want some way of combining
 

1139
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,150
then we would want some way of combining
them together uh

1140
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
them together uh
 

1141
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,669
them together uh
if you're riding a mine cart you mine

1142
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
if you're riding a mine cart you mine
 

1143
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,230
if you're riding a mine cart you mine
slower we'll want to set up some beacons

1144
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
slower we'll want to set up some beacons
 

1145
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,029
slower we'll want to set up some beacons
in here i know

1146
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:49,039
in here i know
 

1147
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,870
in here i know
like one with haste one one with haste

1148
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
like one with haste one one with haste
 

1149
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,470
like one with haste one one with haste
two and then we can switch between them

1150
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480
two and then we can switch between them
 

1151
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,070
two and then we can switch between them
or turn them both off

1152
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,080
or turn them both off
 

1153
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,549
or turn them both off
um we'll want that elder guardian in

1154
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:56,559
um we'll want that elder guardian in
 

1155
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,470
um we'll want that elder guardian in
here

1156
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
here
 

1157
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,909
here
and i think we should make oh yeah

1158
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
and i think we should make oh yeah
 

1159
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,590
and i think we should make oh yeah
we'll probably wanna have some way of

1160
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
we'll probably wanna have some way of
 

1161
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,669
we'll probably wanna have some way of
detecting how far we can mine too like

1162
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
detecting how far we can mine too like
 

1163
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,630
detecting how far we can mine too like
our range

1164
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
our range
 

1165
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,789
our range
i think it's 4.5 blocks from us but

1166
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:08,799
i think it's 4.5 blocks from us but
 

1167
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,990
i think it's 4.5 blocks from us but
we'll want to

1168
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
we'll want to
 

1169
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,630
we'll want to
not just say we can mine 4.5 blocks away

1170
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
not just say we can mine 4.5 blocks away
 

1171
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,870
not just say we can mine 4.5 blocks away
from us we want to prove

1172
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:14,880
from us we want to prove
 

1173
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,510
from us we want to prove
with an experiment right so that'll be

1174
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:17,520
with an experiment right so that'll be
 

1175
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,669
with an experiment right so that'll be
one thing we put in here

1176
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
one thing we put in here
 

1177
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,310
one thing we put in here
i'm thinking we want like a main machine

1178
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,320
i'm thinking we want like a main machine
 

1179
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,190
i'm thinking we want like a main machine
to

1180
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
to
 

1181
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,110
to
measure mining speed so like we'll

1182
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
measure mining speed so like we'll
 

1183
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,870
measure mining speed so like we'll
again we don't want just the book saying

1184
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
again we don't want just the book saying
 

1185
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,630
again we don't want just the book saying
oh we can mine this block this fast

1186
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,640
oh we can mine this block this fast
 

1187
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,950
oh we can mine this block this fast
we want to prove we can mine that block

1188
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:32,960
we want to prove we can mine that block
 

1189
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,070
we want to prove we can mine that block
that fast

1190
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,080
that fast
 

1191
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,270
that fast
so one way we might do that is

1192
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,280
so one way we might do that is
 

1193
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,390
so one way we might do that is
set up a little mechanism here where

1194
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
set up a little mechanism here where
 

1195
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,190
set up a little mechanism here where
ah let's see it'll probably be something

1196
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,200
ah let's see it'll probably be something
 

1197
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,990
ah let's see it'll probably be something
like

1198
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,000
like
 

1199
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,390
like
this we'll have like a hole and then

1200
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,400
this we'll have like a hole and then
 

1201
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,230
this we'll have like a hole and then
we'll set up like five blocks of

1202
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
we'll set up like five blocks of
 

1203
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,470
we'll set up like five blocks of
whatever material that we're testing out

1204
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
whatever material that we're testing out
 

1205
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,990
whatever material that we're testing out
i guess we'll get moved back

1206
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
i guess we'll get moved back
 

1207
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,630
i guess we'll get moved back
all right and like when we mine this

1208
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
all right and like when we mine this
 

1209
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,870
all right and like when we mine this
first block here it'll start the timer

1210
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
first block here it'll start the timer
 

1211
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,549
first block here it'll start the timer
and then when we get to this one it'll

1212
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
and then when we get to this one it'll
 

1213
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,590
and then when we get to this one it'll
stop it and then we'll want an

1214
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:07,600
stop it and then we'll want an
 

1215
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,270
stop it and then we'll want an
accurate timer to show how much time

1216
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
accurate timer to show how much time
 

1217
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,710
accurate timer to show how much time
that takes if we're instant mining

1218
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
that takes if we're instant mining
 

1219
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,270
that takes if we're instant mining
it happens pretty quickly yeah let's

1220
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,280
it happens pretty quickly yeah let's
 

1221
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,470
it happens pretty quickly yeah let's
actually go ahead and do this i think

1222
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
actually go ahead and do this i think
 

1223
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,149
actually go ahead and do this i think
this would be a great first project it's

1224
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:18,159
this would be a great first project it's
 

1225
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,350
this would be a great first project it's
fairly simple

1226
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
fairly simple
 

1227
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,510
fairly simple
just a general mining machine speed

1228
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
just a general mining machine speed
 

1229
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,870
just a general mining machine speed
tester

1230
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
tester
 

1231
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,110
tester
um so let's have it so we'll have the

1232
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
um so let's have it so we'll have the
 

1233
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,789
um so let's have it so we'll have the
ladder here so you can be airborne and

1234
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
ladder here so you can be airborne and
 

1235
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,149
ladder here so you can be airborne and
get that penalty

1236
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,159
get that penalty
 

1237
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,149
get that penalty
and then we'll have a dispenser with

1238
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
and then we'll have a dispenser with
 

1239
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,590
and then we'll have a dispenser with
water bucket in

1240
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:31,600
water bucket in
 

1241
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,950
water bucket in
and that way we can combine them

1242
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:32,960
and that way we can combine them
 

1243
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,430
and that way we can combine them
together as well and still be able to

1244
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
together as well and still be able to
 

1245
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,950
together as well and still be able to
reach all five blocks when we're

1246
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
reach all five blocks when we're
 

1247
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,950
reach all five blocks when we're
standing here i like that

1248
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
standing here i like that
 

1249
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,310
standing here i like that
we'll probably want some way of

1250
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
we'll probably want some way of
 

1251
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,950
we'll probably want some way of
returning the stuff we mined to us

1252
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
returning the stuff we mined to us
 

1253
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,230
returning the stuff we mined to us
so maybe we'll have another dispenser

1254
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,240
so maybe we'll have another dispenser
 

1255
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,549
so maybe we'll have another dispenser
with a water bucket here that when the

1256
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
with a water bucket here that when the
 

1257
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,909
with a water bucket here that when the
timer stops

1258
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:49,919
timer stops
 

1259
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,990
timer stops
it ejects the water and delivers our

1260
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
it ejects the water and delivers our
 

1261
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,430
it ejects the water and delivers our
items back

1262
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
items back
 

1263
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,950
items back
this would have to be a trap door

1264
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
this would have to be a trap door
 

1265
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,750
this would have to be a trap door
probably because otherwise items will be

1266
00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
probably because otherwise items will be
 

1267
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,830
probably because otherwise items will be
too far away from us and then

1268
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
too far away from us and then
 

1269
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,430
too far away from us and then
we'll probably just want to encase this

1270
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,440
we'll probably just want to encase this
 

1271
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,510
we'll probably just want to encase this
with obsidian or crying obsidian so we

1272
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520
with obsidian or crying obsidian so we
 

1273
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,190
with obsidian or crying obsidian so we
don't accidentally break

1274
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,200
don't accidentally break
 

1275
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,789
don't accidentally break
the casing around this thing aha so

1276
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799
the casing around this thing aha so
 

1277
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,470
the casing around this thing aha so
we're not gonna worry too much about the

1278
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
we're not gonna worry too much about the
 

1279
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,510
we're not gonna worry too much about the
building style

1280
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520
building style
 

1281
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,870
building style
just for today but it's definitely

1282
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:14,880
just for today but it's definitely
 

1283
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,230
just for today but it's definitely
something we're gonna need to think

1284
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,240
something we're gonna need to think
 

1285
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,270
something we're gonna need to think
about

1286
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
about
 

1287
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,549
about
i kind of like the idea of using

1288
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:18,559
i kind of like the idea of using
 

1289
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,470
i kind of like the idea of using
blackstone and basalt in

1290
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480
blackstone and basalt in
 

1291
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,750
blackstone and basalt in
these rooms um but i know this is ugly

1292
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
these rooms um but i know this is ugly
 

1293
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,430
these rooms um but i know this is ugly
what we're looking at right now so

1294
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,440
what we're looking at right now so
 

1295
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,549
what we're looking at right now so
i'm gonna have to play around with the

1296
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:26,559
i'm gonna have to play around with the
 

1297
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,390
i'm gonna have to play around with the
block pellet a little bit i like uh

1298
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:28,400
block pellet a little bit i like uh
 

1299
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,110
block pellet a little bit i like uh
maybe using

1300
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,120
maybe using
 

1301
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,230
maybe using
light blue and and orange with our build

1302
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,240
light blue and and orange with our build
 

1303
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,870
light blue and and orange with our build
though

1304
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:32,880
though
 

1305
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,909
though
because like lamps are orange

1306
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
because like lamps are orange
 

1307
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,430
because like lamps are orange
a lot of the lighting options in this

1308
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
a lot of the lighting options in this
 

1309
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,510
a lot of the lighting options in this
game are light blue or orange like sea

1310
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,520
game are light blue or orange like sea
 

1311
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:39,990
game are light blue or orange like sea
lanterns

1312
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000
lanterns
 

1313
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,110
lanterns
or blue the fire types are

1314
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120
or blue the fire types are
 

1315
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,870
or blue the fire types are
blue and orange and lanterns blue and

1316
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:44,880
blue and orange and lanterns blue and
 

1317
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,630
blue and orange and lanterns blue and
orange so i think it would simplify a

1318
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640
orange so i think it would simplify a
 

1319
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,230
orange so i think it would simplify a
lot of things if we could use those two

1320
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
lot of things if we could use those two
 

1321
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,909
lot of things if we could use those two
colors

1322
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
colors
 

1323
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,710
colors
um let's see here so we're going to be

1324
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
um let's see here so we're going to be
 

1325
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,470
um let's see here so we're going to be
installing a timer

1326
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
installing a timer
 

1327
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,789
installing a timer
to keep track of the mining speeds and

1328
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:56,799
to keep track of the mining speeds and
 

1329
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,870
to keep track of the mining speeds and
you guys might recall a long long time

1330
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
you guys might recall a long long time
 

1331
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,669
you guys might recall a long long time
ago in a

1332
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
ago in a

land far far away minecraft season four

1334
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
land far far away minecraft season four
 

1335
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,549
land far far away minecraft season four
we came up with the horse timer now it's

1336
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
we came up with the horse timer now it's
 

1337
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,549
we came up with the horse timer now it's
not the exact same timer we used a long

1338
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
not the exact same timer we used a long
 

1339
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,549
not the exact same timer we used a long
time ago i revised it with modern

1340
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559
time ago i revised it with modern
 

1341
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,909
time ago i revised it with modern
redstone so it's a little bit more

1342
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:11,919
redstone so it's a little bit more
 

1343
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,750
redstone so it's a little bit more
compact and nicer and

1344
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:13,760
compact and nicer and
 

1345
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,669
compact and nicer and
and all kinds of stuff right i think

1346
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
and all kinds of stuff right i think
 

1347
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,590
and all kinds of stuff right i think
it's quieter as well

1348
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:17,600
it's quieter as well
 

1349
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,990
it's quieter as well
now the basic idea behind it is we have

1350
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,000
now the basic idea behind it is we have
 

1351
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,430
now the basic idea behind it is we have
10 repeaters all set at one tick

1352
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
10 repeaters all set at one tick
 

1353
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,430
10 repeaters all set at one tick
so each one represents a tenth of a

1354
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
so each one represents a tenth of a
 

1355
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,470
so each one represents a tenth of a
second

1356
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:26,480
second
 

1357
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,390
second
and it just goes around in a loop over

1358
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
and it just goes around in a loop over
 

1359
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,590
and it just goes around in a loop over
and over and over

1360
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
and over and over
 

1361
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,830
and over and over
until we want to stop the time then we

1362
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
until we want to stop the time then we
 

1363
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,270
until we want to stop the time then we
send a signal to this

1364
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:33,280
send a signal to this
 

1365
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,149
send a signal to this
wire and that locks the repeaters at

1366
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
wire and that locks the repeaters at
 

1367
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,669
wire and that locks the repeaters at
wherever they're at

1368
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
wherever they're at
 

1369
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,870
wherever they're at
um so yeah we send a signal to this line

1370
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:40,880
um so yeah we send a signal to this line
 

1371
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,909
um so yeah we send a signal to this line
to start it and then a solid pulse to

1372
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:43,919
to start it and then a solid pulse to
 

1373
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,430
to start it and then a solid pulse to
this one to stop it

1374
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
this one to stop it
 

1375
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,590
this one to stop it
so we got this for this line over here

1376
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,600
so we got this for this line over here
 

1377
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,549
so we got this for this line over here
hooked up to

1378
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:48,559
hooked up to
 

1379
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,909
hooked up to
our observer so whenever we

1380
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:51,919
our observer so whenever we
 

1381
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,029
our observer so whenever we
mine this block it'll start up

1382
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
mine this block it'll start up
 

1383
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,549
mine this block it'll start up
and start going around in a loop like

1384
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:56,559
and start going around in a loop like
 

1385
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,870
and start going around in a loop like
that then when it gets to the end

1386
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:58,880
that then when it gets to the end
 

1387
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,269
that then when it gets to the end
we should add a seconds timer as well

1388
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:01,279
we should add a seconds timer as well
 

1389
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,789
we should add a seconds timer as well
this is tenths of seconds

1390
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:02,799
this is tenths of seconds
 

1391
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,310
this is tenths of seconds
when it gets to the end it'll add one

1392
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320
when it gets to the end it'll add one
 

1393
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,990
when it gets to the end it'll add one
second above here

1394
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
second above here
 

1395
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,549
second above here
and that way we can keep track of up to

1396
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:08,559
and that way we can keep track of up to
 

1397
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,510
and that way we can keep track of up to
10 seconds

1398
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
10 seconds
 

1399
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,870
10 seconds
time accurate within a tenth of a second

1400
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:12,880
time accurate within a tenth of a second
 

1401
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,230
time accurate within a tenth of a second
but we'll probably won't get that far

1402
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
but we'll probably won't get that far
 

1403
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,310
but we'll probably won't get that far
with it today but whenever we want to

1404
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
with it today but whenever we want to
 

1405
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:16,870
with it today but whenever we want to
freeze it

1406
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:16,880
freeze it
 

1407
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,190
freeze it
we just send a pulse that's all it falls

1408
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
we just send a pulse that's all it falls
 

1409
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,789
we just send a pulse that's all it falls
to that and i can see it's on the one

1410
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:20,799
to that and i can see it's on the one
 

1411
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,750
to that and i can see it's on the one
two three four

1412
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,760
two three four
 

1413
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,950
two three four
five six point six seconds

1414
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
five six point six seconds
 

1415
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,390
five six point six seconds
but yeah we should probably think about

1416
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,400
but yeah we should probably think about
 

1417
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,149
but yeah we should probably think about
wrapping things up here for today we'll

1418
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:28,159
wrapping things up here for today we'll
 

1419
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,669
wrapping things up here for today we'll
work more on this later

1420
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:29,679
work more on this later
 

1421
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,990
work more on this later
assuming you guys actually like this

1422
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,000
assuming you guys actually like this
 

1423
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,350
assuming you guys actually like this
project idea

1424
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:33,360
project idea
 

1425
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,510
project idea
i don't know i was very worried about

1426
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:35,520
i don't know i was very worried about
 

1427
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,789
i don't know i was very worried about
hyping this up earlier

1428
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:36,799
hyping this up earlier
 

1429
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,110
hyping this up earlier
like i wanted to because i think it's an

1430
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
like i wanted to because i think it's an
 

1431
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,710
like i wanted to because i think it's an
amazing idea but

1432
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
amazing idea but
 

1433
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,029
amazing idea but
it's also a weird idea so some of you

1434
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:43,039
it's also a weird idea so some of you
 

1435
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,630
it's also a weird idea so some of you
might not like it i don't know i didn't

1436
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:44,640
might not like it i don't know i didn't
 

1437
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,350
might not like it i don't know i didn't
want to raise

1438
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,360
want to raise
 

1439
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,510
want to raise
expectations and then you guys would be

1440
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:47,520
expectations and then you guys would be
 

1441
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,110
expectations and then you guys would be
like oh that's this is kind of a dumb

1442
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
like oh that's this is kind of a dumb
 

1443
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,149
like oh that's this is kind of a dumb
idea etho

1444
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
idea etho
 

1445
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,390
idea etho
i don't know what you're thinking uh one

1446
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:52,400
i don't know what you're thinking uh one
 

1447
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,230
i don't know what you're thinking uh one
thing i just realized as well we should

1448
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
thing i just realized as well we should
 

1449
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,190
thing i just realized as well we should
have

1450
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
have
 

1451
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,870
have
maybe like around here

1452
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:58,880
maybe like around here
 

1453
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,029
maybe like around here
next to our mining machine we're going

1454
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
next to our mining machine we're going
 

1455
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,630
next to our mining machine we're going
to want a stash of all the different

1456
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
to want a stash of all the different
 

1457
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,669
to want a stash of all the different
tools in the game

1458
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
tools in the game
 

1459
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,230
tools in the game
with all the different efficiency levels

1460
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,240
with all the different efficiency levels
 

1461
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,870
with all the different efficiency levels
as well

1462
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:06,880
as well
 

1463
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,630
as well
so we'll need wooden picks efficiency

1464
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:08,640
so we'll need wooden picks efficiency
 

1465
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,149
so we'll need wooden picks efficiency
one through five

1466
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:10,159
one through five
 

1467
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,070
one through five
stone picks one through five we'll need

1468
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,080
stone picks one through five we'll need
 

1469
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,070
stone picks one through five we'll need
shovels one through five

1470
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,080
shovels one through five
 

1471
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,990
shovels one through five
and we'll have to get another right

1472
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000
and we'll have to get another right
 

1473
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,310
and we'll have to get another right
tools for that as well

1474
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
tools for that as well
 

1475
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,149
tools for that as well
you can you can see how things can start

1476
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
you can you can see how things can start
 

1477
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,909
you can you can see how things can start
getting expensive with this project

1478
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:21,919
getting expensive with this project
 

1479
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:22,789
getting expensive with this project
right

1480
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
right
 

1481
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,870
right
before we finish up here there is one

1482
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:24,880
before we finish up here there is one
 

1483
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,470
before we finish up here there is one
more project i wanted to show you guys

1484
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,480
more project i wanted to show you guys
 

1485
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,029
more project i wanted to show you guys
real quick

1486
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039
real quick
 

1487
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,430
real quick
just a simple one uh you might recall

1488
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,440
just a simple one uh you might recall
 

1489
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,630
just a simple one uh you might recall
we've been

the same
 

1597
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,269
the same
amount in time and not be sick at the

1598
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
amount in time and not be sick at the
 

1599
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,549
amount in time and not be sick at the

00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:20,559
same time and
 

1601
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,470
same time and
all sorts of things right it gets kind

1602
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:22,480
all sorts of things right it gets kind
 

1603
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,590
all sorts of things right it gets kind
of complicated

1604
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:23,600
of complicated
 

1605
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,990
of complicated
especially when you factor in time zones

1606
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,000
especially when you factor in time zones
 

1607
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,430
especially when you factor in time zones
then there's also the issue

1608
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:27,440
then there's also the issue
 

1609
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,430
then there's also the issue
that if anybody in the series wants to

1610
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
that if anybody in the series wants to
 

1611
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,350
that if anybody in the series wants to
stop at any point it kind of stops it

1612
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360
stop at any point it kind of stops it
 

1613
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:31,750
stop at any point it kind of stops it
for

1614
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:31,760
for
 

1615
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,070
for
everybody they're recording with or like

1616
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,080
everybody they're recording with or like
 

1617
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,110
everybody they're recording with or like
in the case of something like

1618
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,120
in the case of something like
 

1619
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,950
in the case of something like
hermitcraft if they want to reset the

1620
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:36,960
hermitcraft if they want to reset the
 

1621
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,350
hermitcraft if they want to reset the
map and you don't want to

1622
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
map and you don't want to
 

1623
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,630
map and you don't want to
well you don't have any control over

1624
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
well you don't have any control over
 

1625
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,549
well you don't have any control over
that or

1626
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559

1627
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,310
that or
you know you can't even just play the

1628
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
you know you can't even just play the
 

1629
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,149
you know you can't even just play the
game you got to also get servers

1630
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:46,159
game you got to also get servers
 

1631
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,630

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:48,640
you got to pay for servers and manage
 

1633
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,669
you got to pay for servers and manage
them then

1634
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:49,679
them then
 

1635
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,430
them then
you don't have access to the map you're

1636

you don't have access to the map you're
 

1637
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,870
you don't have access to the map you're

1638
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:52,880
playing on anymore usually
 

1639
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,590
playing on anymore usually
if you don't own the server and there's

1640
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,600
if you don't own the server and there's
 

1641
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,269
if you don't own the server and there's
just so many things

1642
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:57,279
just so many things
 

1643
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,590

1645
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,110
um a big one though for me is you can't
edit stuff really

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,120
edit stuff really
 

1647
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,710
