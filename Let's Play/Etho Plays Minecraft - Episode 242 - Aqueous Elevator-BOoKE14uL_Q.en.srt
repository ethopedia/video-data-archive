yeah the best part of the firework show
 

73
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,750

to accomplish that but I'll get
 

79
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,039
to accomplish that but I'll get
something I walk too far away from the

80
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,049
something I walk too far away from the

fire randomizers

86
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:51,520
fire randomizers
 

87
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,380
fire randomizers
I also have it now I can load the

88
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:55,390
I also have it now I can load the
 

89
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,840
I also have it now I can load the
dispensers from below here instead of

90
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:57,850
dispensers from below here instead of
 

91
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,800
dispensers from below here instead of
having to go in the water

92
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:58,810
having to go in the water
 

93
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,090
having to go in the water
which was the pain all right this one's

94
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:03,100
which was the pain all right this one's
 

95
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:11,010
which was the pain all right this one's
still going oh this one's gone darn load

97
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,870
still going oh this one's gone darn load
them from here and see I can't make it

98
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:15,880
them from here and see I can't make it
 

99
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,270
them from here and see I can't make it
any faster so it's just kind of a flaw

100
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:18,280
any faster so it's just kind of a flaw
 

101
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,310
any faster so it's just kind of a flaw
with the randomizer design all right

102
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:22,320
with the randomizer design all right
 

103
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:32,160
with the randomizer design all right
this way mmm think I'll have to play

104
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,170
this way mmm think I'll have to play
 

105
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,480
this way mmm think I'll have to play
around with it some more maybe there's a

106
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:33,490
around with it some more maybe there's a
 

107
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:39,630
around with it some more maybe there's a
way I can fix it that one's okay sounds

108
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:39,640
way I can fix it that one's okay sounds

116
00:03:59,850 --> 00:03:59,860
could they could handle 50 shots I'd be
 

117
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,280

that actually another one John even with
 

125
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,260
that actually another one John even with
the faster faster rate huh that's crazy

126
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,270

 

127
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,290

133
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,430
of that repeater I don't think it's
going to work so yeah can we get this

134

00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,270
alright here's what I did guys I
reloaded the firework show but I tried

164
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:58,280
reloaded the firework show but I tried
 

165
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,780
reloaded the firework show but I tried
it out on peaceful mode and that worked

166
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:01,790
it out on peaceful mode and that worked
 

167
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,720
it out on peaceful mode and that worked
a whole lot better like big big

168
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:04,730
a whole lot better like big big
 

169
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,730
a whole lot better like big big
difference to the point where I think

170
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:06,740
difference to the point where I think
 

171
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,550
difference to the point where I think
that's that it was an acceptable level

172
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:09,560
that's that it was an acceptable level
 

173
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,740
that's that it was an acceptable level
that wool would still burn but it would

174
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:11,750
that wool would still burn but it would
 

175
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,340
that wool would still burn but it would
shoot at least you know on average I

176
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:15,350
shoot at least you know on average I
 

177
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,750
shoot at least you know on average I
could see it going at least 50 times

178
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:16,760
could see it going at least 50 times
 

179
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,810
could see it going at least 50 times
which is what I wanted so if I don't

180
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:19,820
which is what I wanted so if I don't
 

181
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,280
which is what I wanted so if I don't
come up with a different randomizer I

182
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,290
come up with a different randomizer I
 

183
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,840
come up with a different randomizer I
think that would be acceptable we would

184
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:22,850
think that would be acceptable we would
 

185
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,550
think that would be acceptable we would
just have to do the fireworks show on

186
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
just have to do the fireworks show on
 

187
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,010
just have to do the fireworks show on
peaceful uh-huh but yeah I have an idea

188
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,020
peaceful uh-huh but yeah I have an idea
 

189
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,480
peaceful uh-huh but yeah I have an idea
for today this is what we're going to

190
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:31,490
for today this is what we're going to
 

191
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,060
for today this is what we're going to
check out I haven't built this in

192
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,070
check out I haven't built this in
 

193
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,470
check out I haven't built this in
creative mode I thought it would be fun

194
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:35,480
creative mode I thought it would be fun
 

195
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,880
creative mode I thought it would be fun
to investigate it in in the let's play

196
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:38,890
to investigate it in in the let's play
 

197
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,310
to investigate it in in the let's play
and kind of take you guys along on the

198
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:42,320
and kind of take you guys along on the
 

199
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,670
and kind of take you guys along on the
experience basically the other day let's

200
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
experience basically the other day let's
 

201
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,300
experience basically the other day let's
go over here I was I was in a ravine and

202
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,310
go over here I was I was in a ravine and
 

203
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,010
go over here I was I was in a ravine and
I didn't have any blocks to get out of

204
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,020
I didn't have any blocks to get out of
 

205
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,680
I didn't have any blocks to get out of
it so I used a water bucket to climb out

206
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:53,690
it so I used a water bucket to climb out
 

207
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,280
it so I used a water bucket to climb out
and while I was doing that I noticed

208
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,290
and while I was doing that I noticed
 

209
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,130
and while I was doing that I noticed
something kind of interesting which

210
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:00,140
something kind of interesting which
 

211
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,350
something kind of interesting which
we're going to check out today let's

212
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:02,360
we're going to check out today let's
 

213
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,850
we're going to check out today let's
just see if I can replicate what I saw

214
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:05,860
just see if I can replicate what I saw
 

215
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,470
just see if I can replicate what I saw
so basically I had a flat wall I was

216
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:08,480
so basically I had a flat wall I was
 

217
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,870
so basically I had a flat wall I was
trying to climb up with a water bucket

218
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:09,880
trying to climb up with a water bucket
 

219
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,970
trying to climb up with a water bucket
so

220
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:15,980

 

221
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:21,470

maybe it works different here yeah you

222
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:21,480
maybe it works different here yeah you
 

223
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,910
maybe it works different here yeah you
see that you see what I just did there I

224
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:22,920
see that you see what I just did there I
 

225
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,430
see that you see what I just did there I
kind of went up really quick mm can't

226
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,440
kind of went up really quick mm can't
 

227
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,040
kind of went up really quick mm can't
get the angle right

228
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,050
get the angle right
 

229
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,190
get the angle right
maybe it was more like this maybe I was

230
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:34,200
maybe it was more like this maybe I was
 

231
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,500
maybe it was more like this maybe I was
yeah right there I just did it there you

232
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:36,510
yeah right there I just did it there you
 

233
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,300
yeah right there I just did it there you
see how quickly I went up that those two

234
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:38,310
see how quickly I went up that those two
 

235
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,110
see how quickly I went up that those two
blocks basically that's what we're

236
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,120
blocks basically that's what we're
 

237
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,470
blocks basically that's what we're
checking out today if you are swimming

238
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:45,480
checking out today if you are swimming
 

239
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,590
checking out today if you are swimming
in water let's find some water there's

240
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:51,600
in water let's find some water there's
 

241
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,430
in water let's find some water there's
some water if you're swimming in water

242
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:54,440
some water if you're swimming in water
 

243
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,110
some water if you're swimming in water
normally you just Bob up and down right

244
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120

 

245
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,450

all right so I'm holding the spacebar

246
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:01,460
all right so I'm holding the spacebar
 

247
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,430
all right so I'm holding the spacebar
bobbing up and down not really moving

248
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:04,440
bobbing up and down not really moving
 

249
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,400
bobbing up and down not really moving
that quick vertically but if you're

250
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,410
that quick vertically but if you're
 

251
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,410
that quick vertically but if you're
about to jump out of the water or like

252
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:09,420
about to jump out of the water or like
 

253
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,340
about to jump out of the water or like
if you approach the edge it like shoots

254
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:13,350
if you approach the edge it like shoots
 

255
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,250
if you approach the edge it like shoots
you up really quick if you look to the Y

256
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:15,260
you up really quick if you look to the Y
 

257
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,940
you up really quick if you look to the Y
it like it goes up really fast and you

258
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:19,950
it like it goes up really fast and you
 

259
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,880
it like it goes up really fast and you
hop out of the water actually same thing

260
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:22,890
hop out of the water actually same thing
 

261
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:28,870
hop out of the water actually same thing
happens if you have a straight wall and

262
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:28,880
happens if you have a straight wall and
 

263
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:36,440
happens if you have a straight wall and
water pouring out on the side when you

264
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,450
water pouring out on the side when you
 

265
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,870
water pouring out on the side when you
get to the top you kind of jump up so I

266
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:41,880
get to the top you kind of jump up so I
 

267
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,410
get to the top you kind of jump up so I
think if we have dispensers shooting out

268
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:45,420
think if we have dispensers shooting out
 

269
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,670
think if we have dispensers shooting out
water buckets at just the right timing

270
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:48,680
water buckets at just the right timing
 

271
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,640
water buckets at just the right timing
gluing the mic just the right timing we

272
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:52,650
gluing the mic just the right timing we
 

273
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,160
gluing the mic just the right timing we
could possibly make a pretty quick

274
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,170
could possibly make a pretty quick
 

275
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,530
could possibly make a pretty quick
elevator using this there's a good

276
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:57,540
elevator using this there's a good
 

277
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,910
elevator using this there's a good
chance I won't be able to get the timing

278
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:58,920
chance I won't be able to get the timing
 

279
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,890
chance I won't be able to get the timing
right and this won't work but I thought

280
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:00,900
right and this won't work but I thought
 

281
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,329
right and this won't work but I thought
it would be fun to check out anyway so

282
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:02,339
it would be fun to check out anyway so
 

283
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,730
it would be fun to check out anyway so
that's that's kind of the plan for today

284
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:06,740

 

285
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,900

okay here we go we're going to build it

286
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:08,910
okay here we go we're going to build it
 

287
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,360
okay here we go we're going to build it
now or try to build it my general idea

288
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,370
now or try to build it my general idea
 

289
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,579
now or try to build it my general idea
is to have like a wall of zigzag

290
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:13,589
is to have like a wall of zigzag
 

291
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:17,510
is to have like a wall of zigzag
dispensers with water buckets in and to

292
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:17,520
dispensers with water buckets in and to
 

293
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,030
dispensers with water buckets in and to
get the the jump boost when you're going

294
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,040
get the the jump boost when you're going
 

295
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,470
get the the jump boost when you're going
out of the water I don't think the

296
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:21,480
out of the water I don't think the
 

297
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,870
out of the water I don't think the
player can be in water so the time I

298
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
player can be in water so the time I
 

299
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,850
player can be in water so the time I
jump out of the water is when I want

300
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:28,860
jump out of the water is when I want
 

301
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,210
jump out of the water is when I want
the water budget for the next dispenser

302
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:32,220
the water budget for the next dispenser
 

303
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,090
the water budget for the next dispenser
to put the water out so I'll be in mid

304
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:35,100
to put the water out so I'll be in mid
 

305
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,700
to put the water out so I'll be in mid
air and then it will force me back into

306
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:37,710
air and then it will force me back into
 

307
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,500
air and then it will force me back into
water and hopefully try to get the speed

308
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:42,510
water and hopefully try to get the speed
 

309
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:47,290
water and hopefully try to get the speed
boost every block we go up that way so a

310
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:47,300
boost every block we go up that way so a
 

311
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,840
boost every block we go up that way so a
problem I foresee is since I'm going to

312
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:50,850
problem I foresee is since I'm going to
 

313
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,940
problem I foresee is since I'm going to
be doing like a lot of sensitive timing

314
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:52,950
be doing like a lot of sensitive timing
 

315
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,530
be doing like a lot of sensitive timing
stuff with this I need to make sure I

316
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:54,540
stuff with this I need to make sure I
 

317
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,020
stuff with this I need to make sure I
can get into the elevator exactly the

318
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,030
can get into the elevator exactly the
 

319
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,340
can get into the elevator exactly the
same or pretty much the same every time

320
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:00,350
same or pretty much the same every time
 

321
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,930
same or pretty much the same every time
so the way I'm going to do that let's

322
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:02,940
so the way I'm going to do that let's
 

323
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,770
so the way I'm going to do that let's
just have water stream guiding me so

324
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:06,780
just have water stream guiding me so
 

325
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,200
just have water stream guiding me so
I'll go on at the same rate every time

326
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,210
I'll go on at the same rate every time
 

327
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,330
I'll go on at the same rate every time
because the water will push me the same

328
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:11,340
because the water will push me the same
 

329
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,020
because the water will push me the same
same speed we're going to make this too

330
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,030
same speed we're going to make this too
 

331
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,280
same speed we're going to make this too
wide so that we can have a fence or or

332
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,290
wide so that we can have a fence or or
 

333
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,070
wide so that we can have a fence or or

334
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,080
glass planes glass panes not planes
 

335
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,400

where we'll go in between this look this

336
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,410
where we'll go in between this look this
 

337
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,840
where we'll go in between this look this
will make sure we're in the middle

338
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:29,850
will make sure we're in the middle
 

339
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:36,800
will make sure we're in the middle
oh that's not going to work mmm well

340
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:36,810
oh that's not going to work mmm well
 

341
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,220
oh that's not going to work mmm well
I'll just brush up against this I guess

342
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:39,230
I'll just brush up against this I guess
 

343
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:44,630
I'll just brush up against this I guess
when I go in we'll do that so I'll go

344
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
when I go in we'll do that so I'll go
 

345
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,690
when I go in we'll do that so I'll go
right up next to this go down I'll be in

346
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:47,700
right up next to this go down I'll be in
 

347
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,630
right up next to this go down I'll be in
the center so that I can get affected by

348
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
the center so that I can get affected by
 

349
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:58,060
the center so that I can get affected by
both dispensers then I need let's have

350
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,070
both dispensers then I need let's have
 

351
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,160
both dispensers then I need let's have
we're going to build the wall here so

352
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,170
we're going to build the wall here so
 

353
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:06,500
we're going to build the wall here so
our first dispenser maybe let's just put

354
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:06,510
our first dispenser maybe let's just put
 

355
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:13,760
our first dispenser maybe let's just put
it here and we'll build up our wall next

356
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:13,770
it here and we'll build up our wall next
 

357
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:18,170
it here and we'll build up our wall next
one we'll go here I love the whole shift

358
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,180
one we'll go here I love the whole shift
 

359
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,090
one we'll go here I love the whole shift
like you can normally if you right-click

360
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,100
like you can normally if you right-click
 

361
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,710
like you can normally if you right-click
you go in the dispenser if you hold

362
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:21,720
you go in the dispenser if you hold
 

363
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,990
you go in the dispenser if you hold
shift now though it places a block that

364
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
shift now though it places a block that
 

365
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,100
shift now though it places a block that
is really good very useful

366
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,110

 

367
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,230

all right so that's going to be our wall

368
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,240
all right so that's going to be our wall
 

369
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,610
all right so that's going to be our wall
and I'm going to just to keep things a

370
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:37,620
and I'm going to just to keep things a
 

371
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,650
and I'm going to just to keep things a
little cleaner when we're testing this

372
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:39,660
little cleaner when we're testing this
 

373
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,230
little cleaner when we're testing this
but signs here so the water gets held in

374
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
but signs here so the water gets held in
 

375
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,700
but signs here so the water gets held in
place every level when this is all set

376
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:46,710
place every level when this is all set
 

377
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,330
place every level when this is all set
up properly the water shouldn't spread

378
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:50,340
up properly the water shouldn't spread
 

379
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,520
up properly the water shouldn't spread
like it'll go out and then dip suck back

380
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:52,530
like it'll go out and then dip suck back
 

381
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,610
like it'll go out and then dip suck back
in before has time to spread but until

382
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:55,620
in before has time to spread but until
 

383
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,140
in before has time to spread but until
you at the timing is right that's not

384
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,150
you at the timing is right that's not
 

385
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,920
you at the timing is right that's not
going to happen have a wall to keep the

386
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:00,930
going to happen have a wall to keep the
 

387
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:08,870
going to happen have a wall to keep the
water in as well there's a good chance

388
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
water in as well there's a good chance
 

389
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,640
water in as well there's a good chance
this will work

390
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:12,650

 

391
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:17,690

OOP sorry glass all right we need it to

392
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:17,700
OOP sorry glass all right we need it to
 

393
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,570
OOP sorry glass all right we need it to
be too high get in and as as I'm

394
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:23,580
be too high get in and as as I'm
 

395
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,040
be too high get in and as as I'm
traveling along here I'm going to hold

396
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,050
traveling along here I'm going to hold
 

397
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,880
traveling along here I'm going to hold
spacebar so let's have a little bit of a

398
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:28,890
spacebar so let's have a little bit of a
 

399
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,510
spacebar so let's have a little bit of a
thing like this hold spacebar so that as

400
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:32,520
thing like this hold spacebar so that as
 

401
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,980
thing like this hold spacebar so that as
soon as I get to this open area I'll

402
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:33,990
soon as I get to this open area I'll
 

403
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,820
soon as I get to this open area I'll
jump up and it's going to be time just

404
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:37,830
jump up and it's going to be time just
 

405
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,190
jump up and it's going to be time just
right so that actually I'm going to open

406
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,200
right so that actually I'm going to open
 

407
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,740
right so that actually I'm going to open
this up to you

408
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:44,750

 

409
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,640

yeah maybe old oops yeah right there

410
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:49,650
yeah maybe old oops yeah right there
 

411
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,470
yeah maybe old oops yeah right there
maybe I'll do that hold the water in

412
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:53,480
maybe I'll do that hold the water in
 

413
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,720
maybe I'll do that hold the water in
alright next I'm going to have trip

414
00:12:59,720 --> 00:12:59,730
alright next I'm going to have trip
 

415
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:06,220
alright next I'm going to have trip
wires to detect where I am not there and

416
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,230
wires to detect where I am not there and
 

417
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,270
wires to detect where I am not there and
since the water is pushing me to

418
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:08,280
since the water is pushing me to
 

419
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,130
since the water is pushing me to
constant rate I should be able to time

420
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:10,140
constant rate I should be able to time
 

421
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,900
constant rate I should be able to time
it just right

422
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:11,910
it just right
 

423
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:17,620
it just right
so that I can control it within one tick

424
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:17,630

 

425
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,840

get our string

426
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:20,850
get our string
 

427
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:27,379
get our string
that's the out Oh brush up against the

428
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:27,389
that's the out Oh brush up against the
 

429
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,069
that's the out Oh brush up against the
plane the pain not not the plane brush

430
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:31,079
plane the pain not not the plane brush
 

431
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,840
plane the pain not not the plane brush
up against this when I get under here

432
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:32,850
up against this when I get under here
 

433
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,159
up against this when I get under here
I'll start holding jump I'll hit the

434
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:34,169
I'll start holding jump I'll hit the
 

435
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:36,289
I'll start holding jump I'll hit the
trip wire that will activate my redstone

436
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:36,299
trip wire that will activate my redstone
 

437
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:39,679
trip wire that will activate my redstone
and I'll have it time just right so this

438
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:39,689
and I'll have it time just right so this
 

439
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:44,479
and I'll have it time just right so this
thing dispenses at the right time all

440
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:44,489
thing dispenses at the right time all
 

441
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:48,619
thing dispenses at the right time all
right now for the redstone I'm going to

442
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:48,629
right now for the redstone I'm going to
 

443
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,599
right now for the redstone I'm going to
skip the redstone part of this and just

444
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:50,609
skip the redstone part of this and just
 

445
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:52,639
skip the redstone part of this and just
set it up myself because that it's

446
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:52,649
set it up myself because that it's
 

447
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54,379
set it up myself because that it's
probably take a while I'm going to have

448
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:54,389
probably take a while I'm going to have
 

449
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:57,469
probably take a while I'm going to have
a monostable circuit to get the timing

450
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:57,479
a monostable circuit to get the timing
 

451
00:13:57,479 --> 00:14:03,259
a monostable circuit to get the timing
just right and actually with these

452
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:03,269
just right and actually with these
 

453
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:06,729
just right and actually with these
dispensers I'm going to do this have I

454
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:06,739
dispensers I'm going to do this have I
 

455
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:08,629
dispensers I'm going to do this have I
got to be careful about double

456
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
got to be careful about double
 

457
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,969
got to be careful about double
activating them so I'll do that and then

458
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:10,979
activating them so I'll do that and then
 

459
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:15,889
activating them so I'll do that and then
have repeaters oh wait no not like that

460
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:15,899
have repeaters oh wait no not like that
 

461
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,869
have repeaters oh wait no not like that
I don't want to do it I wanna do it like

462
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:20,879
I don't want to do it I wanna do it like
 

463
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,039
I don't want to do it I wanna do it like
this I think just to be

464
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:24,049
this I think just to be
 

465
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:28,309
this I think just to be
yeah like that so the repeater will be

466
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:28,319
yeah like that so the repeater will be
 

467
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:30,169
yeah like that so the repeater will be
will go through a block before goes to

468
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:30,179
will go through a block before goes to
 

469
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:32,179
will go through a block before goes to
the dispenser just so there's no

470
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:32,189
the dispenser just so there's no
 

471
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:41,299
the dispenser just so there's no
interference or their problems and one

472
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:41,309
interference or their problems and one
 

473
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:45,499
interference or their problems and one
more good all right so I'm going to do

474
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:45,509
more good all right so I'm going to do
 

475
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,479
more good all right so I'm going to do
the redstone I'll be back in a sec all

476
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:49,489

 

477
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,499

right well I've been playing around with

478
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:51,509
right well I've been playing around with
 

479
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:53,269
right well I've been playing around with
the timing for a little bit here and

480
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279
the timing for a little bit here and
 

481
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,949
the timing for a little bit here and
it's not hard to tell if it's going to

482
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
it's not hard to tell if it's going to
 

483
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,829
it's not hard to tell if it's going to
work or not so far it looks sort of like

484
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
work or not so far it looks sort of like
 

485
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,399
work or not so far it looks sort of like
it's not going to but I don't I'll let

486
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:01,409
it's not going to but I don't I'll let
 

487
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:03,949
it's not going to but I don't I'll let
you guys see this is as close of timing

488
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:03,959
you guys see this is as close of timing
 

489
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,789
you guys see this is as close of timing
as I could get with this setup hold

490
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:07,799
as I could get with this setup hold
 

491
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:11,920
as I could get with this setup hold
space bar

492
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:11,930

 

493
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:16,390

so that was two blocks we went up so I

494
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:16,400
so that was two blocks we went up so I
 

495
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,080
so that was two blocks we went up so I
guess let's just keep this thing going

496
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,090
guess let's just keep this thing going
 

497
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,360
guess let's just keep this thing going
and see how see how it goes if we go to

498
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,370
and see how see how it goes if we go to
 

499
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,260
and see how see how it goes if we go to
the next third and fourth one that's

500
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,270
the next third and fourth one that's
 

501
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,360
the next third and fourth one that's
with a one tick difference between the

502
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,370
with a one tick difference between the
 

503
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:34,750
with a one tick difference between the
dispensers okay so we're going to use

504
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:34,760
dispensers okay so we're going to use
 

505
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:44,490
dispensers okay so we're going to use
half slabs and go up to here and here

506
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:44,500
half slabs and go up to here and here
 

507
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,760
half slabs and go up to here and here
this will know for sure at this I think

508
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:47,770
this will know for sure at this I think
 

509
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,050
this will know for sure at this I think
if it seemed like we're going up pretty

510
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:50,060
if it seemed like we're going up pretty
 

511
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,360
if it seemed like we're going up pretty
quickly after four blocks there's a good

512
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:52,370
quickly after four blocks there's a good
 

513
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,440
quickly after four blocks there's a good
chance we could make a full-blown

514
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:53,450
chance we could make a full-blown
 

515
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,480
chance we could make a full-blown
elevator out of its if it seems like

516
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:55,490
elevator out of its if it seems like
 

517
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,730
elevator out of its if it seems like
we're kind of getting stuck in the water

518
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:57,740
we're kind of getting stuck in the water
 

519
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,110
we're kind of getting stuck in the water
then there's a good chance it's not

520
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
then there's a good chance it's not
 

521
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,440
then there's a good chance it's not
going to work get that one at three this

522
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:02,450
going to work get that one at three this
 

523
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,860
going to work get that one at three this
one's at two this one's at one and we'll

524
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:05,870
one's at two this one's at one and we'll
 

525
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,050
one's at two this one's at one and we'll
see what happens here I've got to put

526
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,060
see what happens here I've got to put
 

527
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:22,360
see what happens here I've got to put
water in all right and it almost seems

528
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:22,370
water in all right and it almost seems
 

529
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,040
water in all right and it almost seems
like it could work though too because

530
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,050
like it could work though too because
 

531
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,310
like it could work though too because
those we went up two blocks pretty quick

532
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
those we went up two blocks pretty quick
 

533
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,300
those we went up two blocks pretty quick
it's not going to be the fastest

534
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,310
it's not going to be the fastest
 

535
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,340
it's not going to be the fastest
elevator in the world but just another

536
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,350
elevator in the world but just another
 

537
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,889
elevator in the world but just another
alternative

538
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:34,899

 

539
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:43,619

ooh that wasn't too bad man I think the

540
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:43,629
ooh that wasn't too bad man I think the
 

541
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:48,949
ooh that wasn't too bad man I think the
water was going up too quickly though mm

542
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
water was going up too quickly though mm
 

543
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,379
water was going up too quickly though mm
that's going to be and it's like where

544
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:52,389
that's going to be and it's like where
 

545
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:55,439
that's going to be and it's like where
do you slow it down you know oh did I go

546
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:55,449
do you slow it down you know oh did I go
 

547
00:16:55,449 --> 00:17:02,160
do you slow it down you know oh did I go
to fifth level no try keep this one at 2

548
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,170
to fifth level no try keep this one at 2
 

549
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,110
to fifth level no try keep this one at 2
and this one at 3 then see what happens

550
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,120
and this one at 3 then see what happens
 

551
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,370
and this one at 3 then see what happens
water this is just playing around with

552
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:08,380
water this is just playing around with
 

553
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:18,649
water this is just playing around with
the timing all right here we go again

554
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:18,659

 

555
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:27,779

yeah it's still too quick hmm yeah

556
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:27,789
yeah it's still too quick hmm yeah
 

557
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:33,740
yeah it's still too quick hmm yeah
that's not a good thing son was it - oh

558
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:33,750
that's not a good thing son was it - oh
 

559
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,980
that's not a good thing son was it - oh
I shortened it why did I shorten it

560
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:36,990
I shortened it why did I shorten it
 

561
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,990
I shortened it why did I shorten it
about that at 4

562
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,000

 

563
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,420

that one probably won't be able to get

564
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:45,430
that one probably won't be able to get
 

565
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,110
that one probably won't be able to get
to work let's try it one two and four

566
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
to work let's try it one two and four
 

567
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:59,530
to work let's try it one two and four
for the third one

568
00:17:59,530 --> 00:17:59,540

 

569
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,600

hmm it's really hard to tell if it's any

570
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:02,610
hmm it's really hard to tell if it's any
 

571
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,570
hmm it's really hard to tell if it's any
quicker or not I want to keep messing

572
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:05,580
quicker or not I want to keep messing
 

573
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,530
quicker or not I want to keep messing
with it yeah I figured out something

574
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:09,540
with it yeah I figured out something
 

575
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,520
with it yeah I figured out something
important here

576
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:10,530
important here
 

577
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,500
important here
even with two water budgets there was a

578
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:12,510
even with two water budgets there was a
 

579
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,730
even with two water budgets there was a
problem already look at this I can't

580
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:16,740
problem already look at this I can't
 

581
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,100
problem already look at this I can't
jump out of the water

582
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,110
jump out of the water
 

583
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,960
jump out of the water
so it knows it knows I'm trying to cheat

584
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:20,970
so it knows it knows I'm trying to cheat
 

585
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,180
so it knows it knows I'm trying to cheat
it now I probably got to get rid of

586
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,190
it now I probably got to get rid of
 

587
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,190
it now I probably got to get rid of
these signs in this glass or something

588
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
these signs in this glass or something
 

589
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,830
these signs in this glass or something
to make it work it like I'm trying to do

590
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
to make it work it like I'm trying to do
 

591
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,750
to make it work it like I'm trying to do
so I'm not getting the speed boost from

592
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
so I'm not getting the speed boost from
 

593
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,850
so I'm not getting the speed boost from
the second one or the third one or the

594
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:31,860
the second one or the third one or the
 

595
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,530
the second one or the third one or the
fourth one and this is what it does when

596
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:36,540
fourth one and this is what it does when
 

597
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:44,060
fourth one and this is what it does when
you have three ticks between each one it

598
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,070
you have three ticks between each one it
 

599
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:49,340
you have three ticks between each one it
doesn't really sink in too well before I

600
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:49,350
doesn't really sink in too well before I
 

601
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,810
doesn't really sink in too well before I
give up on this so I'm going to try with

602
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:50,820
give up on this so I'm going to try with
 

603
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,430
give up on this so I'm going to try with
just single dispenser row instead of

604
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
just single dispenser row instead of
 

605
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,070
just single dispenser row instead of
this alternating thing see if that works

606
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
this alternating thing see if that works
 

607
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,300
this alternating thing see if that works
better because it's almost like it's

608
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,310
better because it's almost like it's
 

609
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,970
better because it's almost like it's
tossing me to the left and right now

610
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:00,980
tossing me to the left and right now
 

611
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:11,510
tossing me to the left and right now
without the signs there hmm okay guys I

612
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
without the signs there hmm okay guys I
 

613
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,820
without the signs there hmm okay guys I
am back here it's been a while actually

614
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:13,830
am back here it's been a while actually
 

615
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,200
am back here it's been a while actually
I've been messing around with this

616
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,210
I've been messing around with this
 

617
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,300
I've been messing around with this
trying different timings and all sorts

618
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:17,310
trying different timings and all sorts
 

619
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,520
trying different timings and all sorts
of different things and and learning new

620
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:19,530
of different things and and learning new
 

621
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,240
of different things and and learning new
things and I'll tell you what I learned

622
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,250
things and I'll tell you what I learned
 

623
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,920
things and I'll tell you what I learned
so you can see I got the one wide set up

624
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:24,930
so you can see I got the one wide set up
 

625
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,190
so you can see I got the one wide set up
here instead of the two wide originally

626
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:28,200
here instead of the two wide originally
 

627
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,930
here instead of the two wide originally
I had it where the dispensers were like

628
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:29,940
I had it where the dispensers were like
 

629
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,580
I had it where the dispensers were like
one on top of each other like one there

630
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:31,590
one on top of each other like one there
 

631
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,370
one on top of each other like one there
than one there all the way up but that

632
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:34,380
than one there all the way up but that
 

633
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,200
than one there all the way up but that
wasn't working out so well no matter

634
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,210
wasn't working out so well no matter
 

635
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,330
wasn't working out so well no matter
what I time did it so I started doing

636
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:38,340
what I time did it so I started doing
 

637
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,920
what I time did it so I started doing
the spacing thing and that worked a lot

638
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:39,930
the spacing thing and that worked a lot
 

639
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,540
the spacing thing and that worked a lot
better I kind of understand why now it's

640
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:44,550
better I kind of understand why now it's
 

641
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,000
better I kind of understand why now it's
a second I think you're gonna sleep

642
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,010
a second I think you're gonna sleep
 

643
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:54,610
a second I think you're gonna sleep
beautiful son sit ah sweet dreams

644
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:54,620
beautiful son sit ah sweet dreams
 

645
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,940
beautiful son sit ah sweet dreams
nightmares

646
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:55,950
nightmares
 

647
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:03,530
nightmares
oh no flags ah I couldn't quite tell if

648
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:03,540
oh no flags ah I couldn't quite tell if
 

649
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,210
oh no flags ah I couldn't quite tell if
it was working like it was actually

650
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:05,220
it was working like it was actually
 

651
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,260
it was working like it was actually
making me swim up faster so I built this

652
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,270
making me swim up faster so I built this
 

653
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,290
making me swim up faster so I built this
other model here which would do pretty

654
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:11,300
other model here which would do pretty
 

655
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,990
other model here which would do pretty
much the same thing right what I've been

656
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
much the same thing right what I've been
 

657
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,220
much the same thing right what I've been
doing now is holding forward and and

658
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,230
doing now is holding forward and and
 

659
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,250
doing now is holding forward and and
spacebar at the same time and this is

660
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:21,260
spacebar at the same time and this is
 

661
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,900
spacebar at the same time and this is
the rates you would normally swim up one

662
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:22,910
the rates you would normally swim up one
 

663
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,080
the rates you would normally swim up one
of these things so I I've recorded

664
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,090
of these things so I I've recorded
 

665
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,140
of these things so I I've recorded
little sections of this to of and then

666
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,150
little sections of this to of and then
 

667
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,520
little sections of this to of and then
played a back frame by frame

668
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:30,530
played a back frame by frame
 

669
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,850
played a back frame by frame
to figure things out this one takes me

670
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:33,860
to figure things out this one takes me
 

671
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,230
to figure things out this one takes me
four seconds to swim up the eight blocks

672
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:37,240
four seconds to swim up the eight blocks
 

673
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,820
four seconds to swim up the eight blocks
well my vertical position changes leave

674
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:39,830
well my vertical position changes leave
 

675
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,590
well my vertical position changes leave
blocks as I do this so four seconds

676
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:44,600
blocks as I do this so four seconds
 

677
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,660
blocks as I do this so four seconds
that's equivalent to about two blocks

678
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:46,670
that's equivalent to about two blocks
 

679
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:55,060
that's equivalent to about two blocks
per per per second yay brain this one

though this is the dispenser setup and

682
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,230
though this is the dispenser setup and
 

683
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:05,890

we'll go through this again aha so this

684
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:05,900
we'll go through this again aha so this
 

685
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,600
we'll go through this again aha so this
one is what I write down here two point

686
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:10,610
one is what I write down here two point
 

687
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:15,430
one is what I write down here two point
two three seconds two point two three to

688
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
two three seconds two point two three to
 

689
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,350
two three seconds two point two three to
go up to eight blocks so it's quite a

690
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,360
go up to eight blocks so it's quite a
 

691
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,040
go up to eight blocks so it's quite a
bit faster actually I don't know if that

692
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,050
bit faster actually I don't know if that
 

693
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,810
bit faster actually I don't know if that
speed would continue if I extended it

694
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:22,820
speed would continue if I extended it
 

695
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,760
speed would continue if I extended it
further but just from this test it looks

696
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:24,770
further but just from this test it looks
 

697
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:31,720
further but just from this test it looks
kind of promising pretty cool ah so yeah

698
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:31,730
kind of promising pretty cool ah so yeah
 

699
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,090
kind of promising pretty cool ah so yeah
does what I wanted to do actually I'm a

700
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:34,100
does what I wanted to do actually I'm a
 

701
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,790
does what I wanted to do actually I'm a
little surprised the wiring back here is

702
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:36,800
little surprised the wiring back here is
 

703
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,530
little surprised the wiring back here is
a mess because I just kept adding to it

704
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:38,540
a mess because I just kept adding to it
 

705
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,160
a mess because I just kept adding to it
but I think this is one thing that

706
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,170
but I think this is one thing that
 

707
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,900
but I think this is one thing that
worries me it's not like an even timing

708
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:43,910
worries me it's not like an even timing
 

709
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,610
worries me it's not like an even timing
between each one I have to keep

710
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:45,620
between each one I have to keep
 

711
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,510
between each one I have to keep
lengthening it so I'm thinking maybe if

712
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
lengthening it so I'm thinking maybe if
 

713
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,980
lengthening it so I'm thinking maybe if
I extended it long enough it would

714
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:50,990
I extended it long enough it would
 

715
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,460
I extended it long enough it would
actually level out to the same as that I

716
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:54,470
actually level out to the same as that I
 

717
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,380
actually level out to the same as that I
don't know for sure

718
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:56,390
don't know for sure
 

719
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,290
don't know for sure
but the first one at zero then this one

720
00:21:59,290 --> 00:21:59,300
but the first one at zero then this one
 

721
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:07,380
but the first one at zero then this one
goes to two ticks next one is at at four

722
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:07,390
goes to two ticks next one is at at four
 

723
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,890
goes to two ticks next one is at at four
for ticks

724
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:08,900
for ticks
 

725
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,520
for ticks
and then the next one

726
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:11,530
and then the next one
 

727
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,680
and then the next one
is it for ticks okay this one's at zero

728
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:16,690
is it for ticks okay this one's at zero
 

729
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,100
is it for ticks okay this one's at zero
this one's at two this one's at six and

730
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,110
this one's at two this one's at six and
 

731
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,160
this one's at two this one's at six and
then this one is at eleven so the

732
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,170
then this one is at eleven so the
 

733
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,480
then this one is at eleven so the
spacing is getting further and further

734
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:24,490
spacing is getting further and further
 

735
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,780
spacing is getting further and further
farther it goes I might not have the set

736
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:27,790
farther it goes I might not have the set
 

737
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,610
farther it goes I might not have the set
up ideally either though I don't know

738
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:31,620

 

739
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:36,410

all right and here is some other

740
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:36,420
all right and here is some other
 

741
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:42,720
all right and here is some other
interesting stuff basically when I jump

742
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:42,730
interesting stuff basically when I jump
 

743
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,640
interesting stuff basically when I jump
out of the water like this my

744
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:44,650
out of the water like this my
 

745
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,820
out of the water like this my
y-coordinate goes to seventy one point

746
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:47,830
y-coordinate goes to seventy one point
 

747
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,530
y-coordinate goes to seventy one point
five roughly at the peak so I'm when I

748
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:52,540
five roughly at the peak so I'm when I
 

749
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,180
five roughly at the peak so I'm when I
jump out of the water I jump half a

750
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,190
jump out of the water I jump half a
 

751
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,580
jump out of the water I jump half a
block out of the air all right

752
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:56,590
block out of the air all right
 

753
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,580
block out of the air all right
my actual acceleration starts occurring

754
00:22:59,580 --> 00:22:59,590
my actual acceleration starts occurring
 

755
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,220
my actual acceleration starts occurring
down at sixty nine point six so even

756
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:02,230
down at sixty nine point six so even
 

757
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,310
down at sixty nine point six so even
before I'm out of the water I start to

758
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:05,320
before I'm out of the water I start to
 

759
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,720
before I'm out of the water I start to
speed up vertically and that's about a

760
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:09,730
speed up vertically and that's about a
 

761
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,000
speed up vertically and that's about a
span of two blocks so that explains why

762
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,010
span of two blocks so that explains why
 

763
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,500
span of two blocks so that explains why
it wasn't really working for me when I

764
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:13,510
it wasn't really working for me when I
 

765
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,390
it wasn't really working for me when I
had them one on top of each other

766
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:15,400
had them one on top of each other
 

767
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,350
had them one on top of each other
there's there's a period of time when

768
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
there's there's a period of time when
 

769
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,610
there's there's a period of time when
you're in the water still that you

770
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:20,620
you're in the water still that you
 

771
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:26,130
you're in the water still that you
actually start speeding up but I know

772
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:26,140
actually start speeding up but I know
 

773
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,670
actually start speeding up but I know
it's kind of cool I don't know how

774
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:29,680
it's kind of cool I don't know how
 

775
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,030
it's kind of cool I don't know how
effective it is or anything but hey it's

776
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:33,040
effective it is or anything but hey it's
 

777
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,960
effective it is or anything but hey it's
quicker than that so got some results

778
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:36,970
quicker than that so got some results
 

779
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,850
quicker than that so got some results
out of it anyway I hope you enjoyed this

780
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:38,860
out of it anyway I hope you enjoyed this
 

781
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,120
out of it anyway I hope you enjoyed this
little experiment and maybe one day all

782
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,130
little experiment and maybe one day all
 

783
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,240
little experiment and maybe one day all
set up a full full-blown actual usage of

784
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,250
set up a full full-blown actual usage of
 

785
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,950
set up a full full-blown actual usage of
it somewhere how now what has happened

786
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:49,960
it somewhere how now what has happened
 

787
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,800
it somewhere how now what has happened
to my village oh they're real we were

788
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:55,810
to my village oh they're real we were
 

789
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,780
to my village oh they're real we were
near here I checked and see if it was

790
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:57,790
near here I checked and see if it was
 

791
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:02,730
near here I checked and see if it was
loaded or not maybe stuff happened it's

792
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:02,740
loaded or not maybe stuff happened it's
 

793
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:08,760
loaded or not maybe stuff happened it's
