did we leave off we got this I think

230
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:27,910
did we leave off we got this I think
 

231
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,450
did we leave off we got this I think
this is the last thing I did here's is a

232
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:30,460
this is the last thing I did here's is a
 

233
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,170
this is the last thing I did here's is a
staircase thing I'm kind of we got to

234
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:34,180
staircase thing I'm kind of we got to
 

235
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,760
staircase thing I'm kind of we got to
figure out how we're going to store our

236
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:35,770
figure out how we're going to store our
 

237
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,610
figure out how we're going to store our
enchanted books

238
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:37,620
enchanted books
 

239
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,080

am I still missing I'm missing the
glowstone I thought I had that there I

242
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:41,890
glowstone I thought I had that there I
 

243
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,570
glowstone I thought I had that there I
guess it's just in this one ah yeah we

244
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:45,580
guess it's just in this one ah yeah we
 

245
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,540
guess it's just in this one ah yeah we
got a store enchanted books here some

246
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:48,550
got a store enchanted books here some
 

247
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,390
got a store enchanted books here some
somehow in these bookshelves and there's

248
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:51,400
somehow in these bookshelves and there's
 

249
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,610
somehow in these bookshelves and there's
there's basically two ways I can think

250
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:53,620
there's basically two ways I can think
 

251
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,680
there's basically two ways I can think
of doing it either we try to hide a

252
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:55,690
of doing it either we try to hide a
 

253
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,170
of doing it either we try to hide a
minecart chest in the blocks themselves

254
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:58,180
minecart chest in the blocks themselves
 

255
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,330
minecart chest in the blocks themselves
or we use like a piston and move the

256
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:03,340
or we use like a piston and move the
 

257
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,890
or we use like a piston and move the
bookcase out of the way and then have a

258
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:04,900
bookcase out of the way and then have a
 

259
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,680
bookcase out of the way and then have a
chest behind it that would probably be

260
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:07,690
chest behind it that would probably be
 

261
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,870
chest behind it that would probably be
the more reliable method I'm going to

262
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:09,880
the more reliable method I'm going to
 

263
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,970
the more reliable method I'm going to
I'm going to try the minecart thing

264
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:11,980
I'm going to try the minecart thing
 

265
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:18,870
I'm going to try the minecart thing
though let's see if we can do that okay

266
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
though let's see if we can do that okay
 

267
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,700
though let's see if we can do that okay
it's been a long time since I've tried

268
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:20,710
it's been a long time since I've tried
 

269
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,080
it's been a long time since I've tried
this but I think this is how you set it

270
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,090
this but I think this is how you set it
 

271
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,740
this but I think this is how you set it
up I got a minecart up there you're

272
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:25,750
up I got a minecart up there you're
 

273
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,670
up I got a minecart up there you're
gonna drop it

274
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:26,680
gonna drop it
 

275
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,920
gonna drop it
you got a block there I think it's

276
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:28,930
you got a block there I think it's
 

277
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,420
you got a block there I think it's
facing the wrong way though mmm we'll

278
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:33,430
facing the wrong way though mmm we'll
 

279
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,950
facing the wrong way though mmm we'll
see how this looks I think the minecart

280
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
see how this looks I think the minecart
 

281
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,090
see how this looks I think the minecart
is not facing the right way

282
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:36,100
is not facing the right way
 

283
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:44,190
is not facing the right way
oh and also yeah okay let's see what it

284
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:44,200
oh and also yeah okay let's see what it
 

285
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,990
oh and also yeah okay let's see what it
looks like on this side oh and can we

286
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
looks like on this side oh and can we
 

287
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,160
looks like on this side oh and can we
place the bookshelf back okay we can

288
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,170
place the bookshelf back okay we can
 

289
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,150
place the bookshelf back okay we can
that's good I don't think it's gonna be

290
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
that's good I don't think it's gonna be
 

291
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,140
that's good I don't think it's gonna be
right now

292
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,150
right now
 

293
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:00,650
right now
darn it I clicked it I didn't click it

294
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:00,660
darn it I clicked it I didn't click it
 

295
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,910
darn it I clicked it I didn't click it
this might be a directional thing I've

296
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:02,920
this might be a directional thing I've
 

297
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,270
this might be a directional thing I've
never never really used this method so

298
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,280
never never really used this method so
 

299
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,670
never never really used this method so
you I put the block down make sure we

300
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:08,680
you I put the block down make sure we
 

301
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,050
you I put the block down make sure we
get the block down I forgot okay and

302
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:13,060
get the block down I forgot okay and
 

303
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,140
get the block down I forgot okay and
then we break it and it falls that way

304
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,150
then we break it and it falls that way
 

305
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,660
then we break it and it falls that way
again yeah it's directional

306
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:18,670
again yeah it's directional
 

307
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:24,510
again yeah it's directional
so yeah it's kind of a problem see how

308
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:24,520
so yeah it's kind of a problem see how
 

309
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,270
so yeah it's kind of a problem see how
the minecart changed directions there so

310
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
the minecart changed directions there so
 

311
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,850
the minecart changed directions there so
it would only work in the sides not not

312
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:29,860
it would only work in the sides not not
 

313
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:37,950
it would only work in the sides not not
this way pretty sure yeah mmm we're

314
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:37,960
this way pretty sure yeah mmm we're
 

315
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,680
this way pretty sure yeah mmm we're
going to try this one more time but

316
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:40,690
going to try this one more time but
 

317
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,120
going to try this one more time but

00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,590
we're going to push it the other way
this time and see if that makes a

320
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:43,600
this time and see if that makes a
 

321
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,480
this time and see if that makes a
difference

322
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,490
difference
 

323
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:50,640
difference

chests in an anvil and I'll keep the
 

425
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,310
chests in an anvil and I'll keep the
name up on the top left here so once I

426
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
name up on the top left here so once I
 

427
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,750
name up on the top left here so once I
figure out where I'm putting stuff

that's probably what I'll do ah so for
 

431
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,270
that's probably what I'll do ah so for
right now since I'm kind of out of space

right now since I'm kind of out of space
to store these books this is actually

434
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:44,400
to store these books this is actually
 

435
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,650
to store these books this is actually
pretty urgent project because I'm

436

pretty urgent project because I'm
 

437
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,690
pretty urgent project because I'm
running out of storage space in my cave

438

maybe we will make this left Cove area

442
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
maybe we will make this left Cove area
 

443
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,910

books in this chest and later we'll

448
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:07,630
books in this chest and later we'll
 

449
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,940
books in this chest and later we'll
probably end up moving these around so

450
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:08,950
probably end up moving these around so
 

451
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,340

00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:49,689
there you go and we got another one okay
 

475
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:51,629
there you go and we got another one okay
I'll show you the wiring real quick here

476
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:51,639
I'll show you the wiring real quick here
 

477
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,629
I'll show you the wiring real quick here
- it was a little bit tough to to wire

478
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
- it was a little bit tough to to wire
 

479
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,590
- it was a little bit tough to to wire
it in such a way that the the pistons

480
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:58,600
it in such a way that the the pistons
 

481
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,909
it in such a way that the the pistons
wouldn't interfere with each other

482
00:12:59,909 --> 00:12:59,919
wouldn't interfere with each other
 

483
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,909
wouldn't interfere with each other
so I have I have a wire running

484
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:02,919
so I have I have a wire running
 

485
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:05,340
so I have I have a wire running
underneath there and it could powers

486
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,350
underneath there and it could powers
 

487
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,099
underneath there and it could powers
this block there's like a redstone torch

488
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:08,109
this block there's like a redstone torch
 

489
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:11,429
this block there's like a redstone torch
below this or something then I got

490
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:11,439
below this or something then I got
 

491
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:16,979
below this or something then I got
another one running from here to - up

492
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:16,989
another one running from here to - up
 

493
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:21,599
another one running from here to - up
there and it adds a bit of size to the

494
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:21,609
there and it adds a bit of size to the
 

495
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:22,849
there and it adds a bit of size to the
whole thing but does it matter too much

496
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:22,859
whole thing but does it matter too much
 

497
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:26,009
whole thing but does it matter too much
because we have nothing planned out

498
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:26,019
because we have nothing planned out
 

499
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:29,400
because we have nothing planned out
there and I guess we can change this we

500
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:29,410
there and I guess we can change this we
 

501
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,470
there and I guess we can change this we
will put armor books for now again I'm

502
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480
will put armor books for now again I'm
 

503
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,169
will put armor books for now again I'm
not sure how much storage I actually am

504
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:37,179
not sure how much storage I actually am
 

505
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:41,569
not sure how much storage I actually am
going to put in this library but we may

506
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:41,579
going to put in this library but we may
 

507
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:44,699
going to put in this library but we may
may change things around later this one

508
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:44,709
may change things around later this one
 

509
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:47,099
may change things around later this one
we will turn into sword enchantments for

510
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:47,109
we will turn into sword enchantments for
 

511
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:53,759
we will turn into sword enchantments for
now or to go hey where'd my word my sign

512
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:53,769
now or to go hey where'd my word my sign
 

513
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:58,470
now or to go hey where'd my word my sign
go is it up it's it's gone is it oh it's

514
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
go is it up it's it's gone is it oh it's
 

515
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:58,979
go is it up it's it's gone is it oh it's
up there

516
00:13:58,979 --> 00:13:58,989
up there
 

517
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:05,789
up there
okay sword what did I put them right on

518
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:05,799
okay sword what did I put them right on
 

519
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:12,960
okay sword what did I put them right on
this armor books sword books okay all

520
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:12,970
this armor books sword books okay all
 

521
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,129
this armor books sword books okay all
right so we're going to move on here

522
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:14,139
right so we're going to move on here
 

523
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:15,960
right so we're going to move on here
we're gonna do some building planning

524
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:15,970
we're gonna do some building planning
 

525
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,220
we're gonna do some building planning
now basically this wall is pretty much

526
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:20,230
now basically this wall is pretty much
 

527
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,179
now basically this wall is pretty much
spoken for now isn't it so this is how I

528
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:24,189
spoken for now isn't it so this is how I
 

529
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:27,029
spoken for now isn't it so this is how I
build by the way I get what I need done

530
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:27,039
build by the way I get what I need done
 

531
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,069
build by the way I get what I need done
and then I figure out how much space I

532
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:29,079
and then I figure out how much space I
 

533
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:32,400
and then I figure out how much space I
got left and like in this case since we

534
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,410
got left and like in this case since we
 

535
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,429
got left and like in this case since we
don't really have anything to work with

536
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:34,439
don't really have anything to work with
 

537
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:37,829
don't really have anything to work with
we're going to cover it up I might want

538
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
we're going to cover it up I might want
 

539
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,970
we're going to cover it up I might want
to change this out later though I think

540
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:41,980
to change this out later though I think
 

541
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,029
to change this out later though I think
if I I don't know here's my question to

542
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:45,039
if I I don't know here's my question to
 

543
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,279
if I I don't know here's my question to
you guys if I have if I use books all

544
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:47,289
you guys if I have if I use books all
 

545
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:48,629
you guys if I have if I use books all
the time is it going to get to the point

546
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
the time is it going to get to the point
 

547
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,150
the time is it going to get to the point
where it's too many books or should I

548
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,160
where it's too many books or should I
 

549
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,639
where it's too many books or should I
like just change this to planks you know

550
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:53,649
like just change this to planks you know
 

551
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:58,019
like just change this to planks you know
or maybe some like half and half I don't

552
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:58,029
or maybe some like half and half I don't
 

553
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:58,820
or maybe some like half and half I don't
know

554
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:58,830
know
 

555
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,280
know
I'm using books a lot and I have a

556
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:01,290
I'm using books a lot and I have a
 

557
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,660
I'm using books a lot and I have a
feeling it's going to get overwhelming

558
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:02,670
feeling it's going to get overwhelming
 

559
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,840
feeling it's going to get overwhelming
if I do it too much alright anyway so

560
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:05,850
if I do it too much alright anyway so
 

561
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,090
if I do it too much alright anyway so
we're going to start curving this path

562
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:08,100
we're going to start curving this path
 

563
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,010
we're going to start curving this path
out this way I think is a good plan to

564
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,020
out this way I think is a good plan to
 

565
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,690
out this way I think is a good plan to
spruce wood so I think we wanted to go

566
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:17,700
spruce wood so I think we wanted to go
 

567
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,240
spruce wood so I think we wanted to go
at least up to here maybe further let's

568
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,250
at least up to here maybe further let's
 

569
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,030
at least up to here maybe further let's
see there's no real way to get to this

570
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,040
see there's no real way to get to this
 

571
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,130
see there's no real way to get to this
part of the library so we might want it

572
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:28,140
part of the library so we might want it
 

573
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,350
part of the library so we might want it
to go underneath this this bridge thing

574
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,360
to go underneath this this bridge thing
 

575
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:40,970
to go underneath this this bridge thing
we built - okay get that going and oh I

576
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:40,980
we built - okay get that going and oh I
 

577
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,900
we built - okay get that going and oh I
shouldn't have a lot of red wool here

578
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:46,910

 

579
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,830

okay Oh start it this thing I never did

580
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:51,840
okay Oh start it this thing I never did
 

581
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,040
okay Oh start it this thing I never did
fix by the way and I'm scared to fix it

582
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,050
fix by the way and I'm scared to fix it
 

583
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,720
fix by the way and I'm scared to fix it
with the minecart physics the way they

584
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:56,730
with the minecart physics the way they
 

585
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,490
with the minecart physics the way they
are um I was talking to doctor him the

586
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:01,500
are um I was talking to doctor him the
 

587
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,320
are um I was talking to doctor him the
other day he was telling me how the

588
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,330
other day he was telling me how the
 

589
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,240
other day he was telling me how the
reason we're having so much trouble with

590
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,250
reason we're having so much trouble with
 

591
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,660
reason we're having so much trouble with
the hopper minecarts at the gold and gas

592
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:08,670
the hopper minecarts at the gold and gas
 

593
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,230
the hopper minecarts at the gold and gas
firm on the Minecraft servers because

apparently depending on how many items
 

597
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,270
apparently depending on how many items
are in the hopper minecart affects how

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:17,280
are in the hopper minecart affects how
 

599
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,820
are in the hopper minecart affects how
how quick it goes or how quick it loses

600
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:19,830
how quick it goes or how quick it loses
 

601
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,640
how quick it goes or how quick it loses
momentum so it's almost impossible to

602
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:22,650
momentum so it's almost impossible to
 

603
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,560
momentum so it's almost impossible to
make something consistent at the moment

604
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:24,570
make something consistent at the moment
 

605
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:31,700
make something consistent at the moment
which is interesting all right I did

606
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:31,710
which is interesting all right I did
 

607
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,680
which is interesting all right I did
kind of want to put a statue here it's

608
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:33,690
kind of want to put a statue here it's
 

609
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,540
kind of want to put a statue here it's
getting pretty close to the wall now

610
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:35,550
getting pretty close to the wall now
 

611
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,750
getting pretty close to the wall now
though maybe I'm instead of putting the

612
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:38,760
though maybe I'm instead of putting the
 

613
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,550
though maybe I'm instead of putting the
statue there we'll put a statue in front

614
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
statue there we'll put a statue in front
 

615
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:47,870
statue there we'll put a statue in front
of a big window could be cool um all

616
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:47,880
of a big window could be cool um all
 

617
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,860
of a big window could be cool um all
right so do that the books that I get

618
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:51,870
right so do that the books that I get
 

619
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,660
right so do that the books that I get
from the comments I was going to put up

620
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:53,670
from the comments I was going to put up
 

621
00:16:53,670 --> 00:17:00,020
from the comments I was going to put up
on this like all along here um somehow

622
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,030
on this like all along here um somehow
 

623
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,950
on this like all along here um somehow
have them stored here so we'll have to

624
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:02,960
have them stored here so we'll have to
 

625
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,340
have them stored here so we'll have to
build out oops

626
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:06,350
build out oops
 

627
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:13,100
build out oops
place one block and mess up see ya I'm

628
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,110
place one block and mess up see ya I'm
 

629
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,600

we'll go check out right now actually is
I want to have a rail line going from

636
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:24,660
I want to have a rail line going from
 

637
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,590
I want to have a rail line going from
the gold farm there to the library and

638
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
the gold farm there to the library and
 

639
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,250
the gold farm there to the library and
we'll try to make a spot for for loading

640
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:31,260
we'll try to make a spot for for loading
 

641
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,350
we'll try to make a spot for for loading
enchanted books at the gold firm then

642
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
enchanted books at the gold firm then
 

643
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,390
enchanted books at the gold firm then
unloading them at the library here

644
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:35,400
unloading them at the library here
 

645
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,050
unloading them at the library here
because I do a lot of enchanting at the

646
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,060
because I do a lot of enchanting at the
 

647
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:44,380
because I do a lot of enchanting at the
gold farm there's a lot of badness

648
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:44,390
gold farm there's a lot of badness

I I take no responsibility alright so
 

659
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,950
I I take no responsibility alright so
what we're gonna be doing here I tried

660
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
what we're gonna be doing here I tried
 

661
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,390
what we're gonna be doing here I tried
laying out this path but I think it

662
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
laying out this path but I think it
 

663
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,360
laying out this path but I think it
might be a little too plain little too

664
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,370
might be a little too plain little too
 

665
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,540
might be a little too plain little too
plain it that's well floaty paths aren't

666
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:20,550
plain it that's well floaty paths aren't
 

667
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,510
plain it that's well floaty paths aren't
too good so we're gonna maybe attempt a

668
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
too good so we're gonna maybe attempt a
 

669
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,640
too good so we're gonna maybe attempt a
suspension bridge of some sort and also

670
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:28,650
suspension bridge of some sort and also
 

671
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,310
suspension bridge of some sort and also

numbers we kind of need to make our a

674
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:33,480
numbers we kind of need to make our a
 

675
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,940
numbers we kind of need to make our a
rail line even here too so even though

676
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:37,950
rail line even here too so even though
 

677
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,800
rail line even here too so even though
we don't need two rail lines I'm going

678
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:39,810
we don't need two rail lines I'm going
 

679
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,770
we don't need two rail lines I'm going
to make two

too specific into it but once you get
 

725
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,070
too specific into it but once you get
all your farms built then then it's like

726
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,080
all your farms built then then it's like
 

727
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,410

that is all set and that's good in a way

772
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,640
that is all set and that's good in a way
 

773
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,000
that is all set and that's good in a way
because I can build quickly and like get

774
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,010
because I can build quickly and like get
 

775
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,980
because I can build quickly and like get
stuff done quicker than if I was to

776
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:18,990
stuff done quicker than if I was to
 

777
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:24,740
stuff done quicker than if I was to
start fresh but now there's not much of

778
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:24,750
start fresh but now there's not much of
 

779
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,780
start fresh but now there's not much of
the survival aspect left in my world

780
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:26,790
the survival aspect left in my world
 

781
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,480
the survival aspect left in my world
here to be honest um

782
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:29,490
here to be honest um
 

783
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,070
here to be honest um
so that's that's kind of one one of the

784
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,080
so that's that's kind of one one of the
 

785
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,990
so that's that's kind of one one of the
things about starting one of the fun

786
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,000
things about starting one of the fun
 

787
