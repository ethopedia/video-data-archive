guys a raid farm ideally the plan was to
 

51
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,109
guys a raid farm ideally the plan was to
do something like this is just gonna

52
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:18,119
do something like this is just gonna
 

53
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,050
do something like this is just gonna
experiment with it here we set up like a

54
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,060
experiment with it here we set up like a
 

55
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,980
experiment with it here we set up like a
a tube loop here where we're gonna put a

56
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:24,990
a tube loop here where we're gonna put a
 

57
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,830
a tube loop here where we're gonna put a
villager in this just one and he was

58
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:27,840
villager in this just one and he was
 

59
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,560
villager in this just one and he was
gonna go around and around and pass by

60
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:30,570
gonna go around and around and pass by
 

61
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,569
gonna go around and around and pass by
the different layers of the farm and

62
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:32,579
the different layers of the farm and
 

63
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,490
the different layers of the farm and
then the pillagers were supposed to see

64
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:34,500
then the pillagers were supposed to see
 

65
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,429
then the pillagers were supposed to see
him as he passed by and then start

66
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
him as he passed by and then start
 

67
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,560
him as he passed by and then start
chasing him but not be able to shoot him

68
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,570
chasing him but not be able to shoot him
 

69
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,950
chasing him but not be able to shoot him
because he passes by so quickly right

70
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:41,960
because he passes by so quickly right
 

71
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,920
because he passes by so quickly right
that was the plan

72
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:44,930
that was the plan
 

73
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,770
that was the plan

of frustrated with it

108
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:29,540
of frustrated with it
 

109
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,870
of frustrated with it
and I can't get them from zombie spawner

110
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:31,880
and I can't get them from zombie spawner
 

111
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,220
and I can't get them from zombie spawner
anymore either that would have been

112
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,230
anymore either that would have been
 

113
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,960
anymore either that would have been
another good choice but like I think it

114
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:34,970
another good choice but like I think it
 

115
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,360
another good choice but like I think it
was back in 1.11 where they removed that

116
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,370
was back in 1.11 where they removed that
 

117
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,640
was back in 1.11 where they removed that
from the game where they no longer spawn

118
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:39,650
from the game where they no longer spawn
 

119
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,390
from the game where they no longer spawn
spawn from the spawners so I gotta get a

120
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:43,400
spawn from the spawners so I gotta get a
 

121
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,940
spawn from the spawners so I gotta get a
villager from a village and transport it

122
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:45,950
villager from a village and transport it
 

123
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,930
villager from a village and transport it
here which is gonna be a little bit

124
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:46,940
here which is gonna be a little bit
 

125
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,750
here which is gonna be a little bit
annoying so instead of doing that I

126
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
annoying so instead of doing that I
 

127
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,250
annoying so instead of doing that I
think we're gonna come up with a new

128
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:51,260
think we're gonna come up with a new
 

129
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,040
think we're gonna come up with a new
plan here we're gonna use iron golems

130
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,050
plan here we're gonna use iron golems
 

131
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,470
plan here we're gonna use iron golems
instead of villagers because iron golems

132
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
instead of villagers because iron golems
 

133
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,230
instead of villagers because iron golems
also attract villagers but we can just

134
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,240
also attract villagers but we can just
 

135
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,770
also attract villagers but we can just
craft them in place where we want them

136
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:01,780
craft them in place where we want them
 

137
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,410
craft them in place where we want them
which is way more convenient then trying

138
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:05,420
which is way more convenient then trying
 

139
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,920
which is way more convenient then trying
to get villagers somehow yeah so for

140
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:08,930
to get villagers somehow yeah so for
 

141
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,810
to get villagers somehow yeah so for
each of our layers here of the farm

142
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:10,820
each of our layers here of the farm
 

143
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,310
each of our layers here of the farm
we're gonna have an iron golem in the

144
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:12,320
we're gonna have an iron golem in the
 

145
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,920
we're gonna have an iron golem in the
very center and I want a pillager spawns

146
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:14,930
very center and I want a pillager spawns
 

147
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,290
very center and I want a pillager spawns
like over here on the outside they'll

148
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,300
like over here on the outside they'll
 

149
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,970
like over here on the outside they'll
see them we're gonna keep it open on

150
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:18,980
see them we're gonna keep it open on
 

151
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,310
see them we're gonna keep it open on
that layer but we can see it happening

152
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,320
that layer but we can see it happening
 

153
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,400
that layer but we can see it happening
right now actually

154
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,410
right now actually
 

155
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,720

unfortunately you can see if they are
close enough they will shoot the iron

160
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,370
close enough they will shoot the iron
 

161
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,150
close enough they will shoot the iron
golem right I worked it out and creative

162
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,160
golem right I worked it out and creative
 

163
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,270
golem right I worked it out and creative
if we have a five block gap here that's

164
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
if we have a five block gap here that's
 

165
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,520
if we have a five block gap here that's
the range they need to be in to shoot at

166
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:41,530
the range they need to be in to shoot at
 

167
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,230
the range they need to be in to shoot at
the golem if they can't get within that

168
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:43,240
the golem if they can't get within that
 

169
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,440
the golem if they can't get within that
range they will just try to get closer

170
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,450
range they will just try to get closer
 

171
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,010
range they will just try to get closer
to them so the way we're gonna do this

172
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,020
to them so the way we're gonna do this
 

173
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,630
to them so the way we're gonna do this
is on all four directions we will set up

174
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
is on all four directions we will set up
 

175
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,950
is on all four directions we will set up
a fall spot where they'll fall down here

176
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:57,960
a fall spot where they'll fall down here
 

177
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,750
a fall spot where they'll fall down here
they'll try to walk on trapdoors even

178
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:00,760
they'll try to walk on trapdoors even
 

179
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,480
they'll try to walk on trapdoors even
though they can't like this down here as

180
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:06,490
though they can't like this down here as
 

181
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,970
though they can't like this down here as
well then we can remove this glass and

182
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:10,980
well then we can remove this glass and
 

183
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,000
well then we can remove this glass and
then kind of dark down here let's get

184
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,010
then kind of dark down here let's get
 

185
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,460
then kind of dark down here let's get
some torches down then we will set up

186
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:17,470
some torches down then we will set up
 

187
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,600
some torches down then we will set up
just one piece of glass here and then

188
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:20,610
just one piece of glass here and then
 

189
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,030
just one piece of glass here and then
we'll have like a five block spacing all

190
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,040
we'll have like a five block spacing all
 

191
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,440
we'll have like a five block spacing all
around the goal so it's gonna be like a

192
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:25,450
around the goal so it's gonna be like a
 

193
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,080
around the goal so it's gonna be like a
doughnut shape platform basically good

194
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,090
doughnut shape platform basically good
 

195
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,120
doughnut shape platform basically good
stuff alright so just took a step back

196
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,130
stuff alright so just took a step back
 

197
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,810
stuff alright so just took a step back
here we're kind of watching what happens

198
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:32,820
here we're kind of watching what happens
 

199
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,290
here we're kind of watching what happens
so far it's looking like it's working

200
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:36,300
so far it's looking like it's working
 

201
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,790
so far it's looking like it's working
now they're not spawning oh here we go

202
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
now they're not spawning oh here we go
 

203
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,640
now they're not spawning oh here we go
we got one we got two

204
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:41,650
we got one we got two
 

205
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,310
we got one we got two
so you see they walk to those trap doors

206
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
so you see they walk to those trap doors
 

207
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,550
so you see they walk to those trap doors
and then they fall down you can get a

208
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:47,560
and then they fall down you can get a
 

209
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,070
and then they fall down you can get a
couple more spawning there's another one

210
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,080

 

211
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,740

spawned right in line with the golem and

212
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:55,750
spawned right in line with the golem and
 

213
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,659
spawned right in line with the golem and
he can't see him because the trapdoors

214
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:57,669
he can't see him because the trapdoors
 

215
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:00,379
he can't see him because the trapdoors
are in the way so I think we have to

216
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:00,389
are in the way so I think we have to
 

217
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,219
are in the way so I think we have to
here let's go up there I'll show you

218
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:02,229
here let's go up there I'll show you
 

219
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:06,200
here let's go up there I'll show you
what I mean so he spawned like right

220
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,210
what I mean so he spawned like right
 

221
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,320
what I mean so he spawned like right
here

222
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:07,330
here
 

223
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,959
here
and the trapdoor is totally block out

224
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:09,969
and the trapdoor is totally block out
 

225
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:12,719
and the trapdoor is totally block out
the view so we got to probably have a

226
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:12,729
the view so we got to probably have a
 

227
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:17,610
the view so we got to probably have a
couple blocks here removed like probably

228
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:17,620
couple blocks here removed like probably
 

229
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,909
couple blocks here removed like probably
all this otherwise they won't be able to

230
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:20,919
all this otherwise they won't be able to
 

231
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,369
all this otherwise they won't be able to
see him at all

232
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:22,379
see him at all
 

233
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:25,110
see him at all
uh-oh looks like we might need to remove

234
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
uh-oh looks like we might need to remove
 

235
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,879
uh-oh looks like we might need to remove
a few more blocks that guy's shooting

236
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:26,889
a few more blocks that guy's shooting
 

237
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:29,839
a few more blocks that guy's shooting
the golem right now which is not good

238
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:29,849
the golem right now which is not good
 

239
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:38,240
the golem right now which is not good
all right whoa okay let's go down oh

240
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,250

 

241
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:45,149

stop shooting the golem okay maybe let's

242
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:45,159
stop shooting the golem okay maybe let's
 

243
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:51,659
stop shooting the golem okay maybe let's
get rid of this this business yeah so

244
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:51,669
get rid of this this business yeah so
 

245
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:53,459
get rid of this this business yeah so
the idea is we want like where the

246
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:53,469
the idea is we want like where the
 

247
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:55,290
the idea is we want like where the
trapdoor is here to be the closest point

248
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:55,300
trapdoor is here to be the closest point
 

249
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,999
trapdoor is here to be the closest point
to the go home so that they try to go

250
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:57,009
to the go home so that they try to go
 

251
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:59,490
to the go home so that they try to go
there to shoot them but it looks like

252
00:05:59,490 --> 00:05:59,500
there to shoot them but it looks like
 

253
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,040
there to shoot them but it looks like
they are like going to here to shoot

254
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,050
they are like going to here to shoot
 

255
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,499
they are like going to here to shoot
them sometimes if we get rid of those

256
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:04,509
them sometimes if we get rid of those
 

257
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:06,209
them sometimes if we get rid of those
blocks then this should be the closest

258
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:06,219
blocks then this should be the closest
 

259
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:10,019
blocks then this should be the closest
point all right everybody well we made

260
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:10,029
point all right everybody well we made
 

261
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:11,700
point all right everybody well we made
about four more trips to our Brown

262
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:11,710
about four more trips to our Brown
 

263
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,740
about four more trips to our Brown
mushroom farm and smelt it a few

264
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:13,750
mushroom farm and smelt it a few
 

265
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,800
mushroom farm and smelt it a few
thousand blocks at our super smelter but

266
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:16,810
thousand blocks at our super smelter but
 

267
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,930
thousand blocks at our super smelter but
we have now put together pretty much the

268
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:18,940
we have now put together pretty much the
 

269
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,360
we have now put together pretty much the
whole farm I think we got five layers to

270
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,370
whole farm I think we got five layers to
 

271
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,879
whole farm I think we got five layers to
this super Donuts hopefully that'll be

272
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:23,889
this super Donuts hopefully that'll be
 

273
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,350
this super Donuts hopefully that'll be
enough I think we're just gonna finish

274
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
enough I think we're just gonna finish
 

275
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,119
enough I think we're just gonna finish
these five layers and see how it

276
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:27,129
these five layers and see how it
 

277
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:29,760
these five layers and see how it
performs before we decide if we want to

278
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,770
performs before we decide if we want to
 

279
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,850
performs before we decide if we want to
add more onto it or not while building

280
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:32,860
add more onto it or not while building
 

281
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,399
add more onto it or not while building
this I actually discovered that might be

282
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:35,409
this I actually discovered that might be
 

283
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,320
this I actually discovered that might be
a problem if we spawn too many of these

284
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,330
a problem if we spawn too many of these
 

285
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,010
a problem if we spawn too many of these
guys rooms so I might have overdone it

286
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:41,020
guys rooms so I might have overdone it
 

287
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,219
guys rooms so I might have overdone it
already I don't know like potentially if

288
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:44,229
already I don't know like potentially if
 

289
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:45,659
already I don't know like potentially if
there's too many guys around I think

290
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:45,669
there's too many guys around I think
 

291
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,820
there's too many guys around I think
afraid won't start

292
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:47,830
afraid won't start
 

293
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,070
afraid won't start
understand right but we'll find out when

294
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
understand right but we'll find out when
 

295
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,780
understand right but we'll find out when
we try it out I guess basically the way

296
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:54,790
we try it out I guess basically the way
 

297
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,550
we try it out I guess basically the way
I've been doing these layers as I do the

298
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
I've been doing these layers as I do the
 

299
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,220
I've been doing these layers as I do the
outline and brow mushroom blocks and

300
00:06:59,220 --> 00:06:59,230
outline and brow mushroom blocks and
 

301
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,970
outline and brow mushroom blocks and
then I just fill in the center here

302
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:01,980
then I just fill in the center here
 

303
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,280
then I just fill in the center here
pretty good and you can see we've made a

304
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,290
pretty good and you can see we've made a
 

305
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,050
pretty good and you can see we've made a
few design changes as well with this

306
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,060
few design changes as well with this
 

307
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,300
few design changes as well with this
thing so I've expanded the size of the

308
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,310
thing so I've expanded the size of the
 

309
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,580
thing so I've expanded the size of the
donuts I think there were about 12

310
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:11,590
donuts I think there were about 12
 

311
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:18,150
donuts I think there were about 12
blocks before now cheater 15 3 6 9 12 15

312
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
blocks before now cheater 15 3 6 9 12 15
 

313
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,870
blocks before now cheater 15 3 6 9 12 15
yeah and in these dead zones where they

314
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:21,880
yeah and in these dead zones where they
 

315
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,820
yeah and in these dead zones where they
spawn in front of the trapdoors I just

316
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:23,830
spawn in front of the trapdoors I just
 

317
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,620
spawn in front of the trapdoors I just
filled in earth blocks we don't really

318
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:28,630
filled in earth blocks we don't really
 

319
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,620
filled in earth blocks we don't really
want to leave these open because what

320
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:31,630
want to leave these open because what
 

321
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,160
want to leave these open because what
they'll do they'll spawn like here and

322
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,170
they'll do they'll spawn like here and
 

323
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,810
they'll do they'll spawn like here and
then that's the closest point so they'll

324
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:36,820
then that's the closest point so they'll
 

325
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,540
then that's the closest point so they'll
run up to here and as soon as they see

326
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:38,550
run up to here and as soon as they see
 

327
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,310
run up to here and as soon as they see
it's open they'll start shooting at the

328
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:41,320
it's open they'll start shooting at the
 

329
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,370
it's open they'll start shooting at the
Golem when they get there but if this is

330
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:44,380
Golem when they get there but if this is
 

331
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,100
Golem when they get there but if this is
a blocks they'll just just wander down

332
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,110
a blocks they'll just just wander down
 

333
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,910
a blocks they'll just just wander down
and fall away so at the very tippy top

334
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:50,920
and fall away so at the very tippy top
 

335
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,310
and fall away so at the very tippy top
of the farm here I decided to slab the

336
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:53,320
of the farm here I decided to slab the
 

337
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,590
of the farm here I decided to slab the
final layer so that hopefully none of

338
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:55,600
final layer so that hopefully none of
 

339
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,090
final layer so that hopefully none of
the pillagers will actually spawn up

340
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:57,100
the pillagers will actually spawn up
 

341
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,920
the pillagers will actually spawn up
here and get stuck there's not gonna be

342
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:58,930
here and get stuck there's not gonna be
 

343
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,180
here and get stuck there's not gonna be
an iron golem at the top layer um we we

344
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,190
an iron golem at the top layer um we we
 

345
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,560
an iron golem at the top layer um we we
need to get the iron golems and now we

346
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:04,570
need to get the iron golems and now we
 

347
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,480
need to get the iron golems and now we
have to currently this is kind of the

348
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:06,490
have to currently this is kind of the
 

349
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:12,920
have to currently this is kind of the
method I think we have to do up in here

350
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:12,930

 

351
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,190

and a fall-off so most of them are doing

352
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:17,200
and a fall-off so most of them are doing
 

353
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,260
and a fall-off so most of them are doing
that good good all right so what I like

354
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,270
that good good all right so what I like
 

355
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,100
that good good all right so what I like
to do is just building a little bit of a

356
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,110
to do is just building a little bit of a
 

357
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,930
to do is just building a little bit of a
place we can stand here oh they found me

358
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:29,940

 

359
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,940

see sometimes they go to a farther one

360
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:32,950
see sometimes they go to a farther one
 

361
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,310
see sometimes they go to a farther one
I'm not quite sure why that is like that

362
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm not quite sure why that is like that
 

363
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,510
I'm not quite sure why that is like that
would have been the closest group but

364
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:36,520
would have been the closest group but
 

365
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,610
would have been the closest group but
they went all the way over there which

366
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:38,620
they went all the way over there which
 

367
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,240
they went all the way over there which
is a little weird

368
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,250
is a little weird
 

369
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,570
is a little weird
Oh didn't get shot again

370
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:43,580
Oh didn't get shot again
 

371
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,700
Oh didn't get shot again
this is kind of like the never ending

372
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:45,710
this is kind of like the never ending
 

373
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,520
this is kind of like the never ending
thing to building this thing it just

374
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,530
thing to building this thing it just
 

375
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,660
thing to building this thing it just
never stops they never leave you alone

376
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:51,670
never stops they never leave you alone
 

377
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,490
never stops they never leave you alone
okay met Jemaine quickly but typically

378
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:54,500
okay met Jemaine quickly but typically
 

379
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,910
okay met Jemaine quickly but typically
you know it's not gonna happen oh oh

380
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:00,920
you know it's not gonna happen oh oh
 

381
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,580
you know it's not gonna happen oh oh
they're gonna shoot him now okay that

382
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:03,590
they're gonna shoot him now okay that
 

383
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,640
they're gonna shoot him now okay that
was a failure let's go back see if I can

384
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:06,650
was a failure let's go back see if I can
 

385
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,580
was a failure let's go back see if I can
save them I've been throwing regen

386
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:09,590
save them I've been throwing regen
 

387
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,990
save them I've been throwing regen
potions at these guys every so often

388
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,000
potions at these guys every so often
 

389
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,570
potions at these guys every so often
just that keep them alive oh man I did

390
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:19,580
just that keep them alive oh man I did
 

391
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,130
just that keep them alive oh man I did
it again okay we got him in there what

392
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,140
it again okay we got him in there what
 

393
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,840
it again okay we got him in there what
we got to do then is get some slabs

394
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:25,850
we got to do then is get some slabs
 

395
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,800
we got to do then is get some slabs
above them like this and this is kind of

396
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:29,810
above them like this and this is kind of
 

397
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,590
above them like this and this is kind of
the tricky part we get some upside down

398
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:32,600
the tricky part we get some upside down
 

399
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,570
the tricky part we get some upside down
Pistons we got to push this layer down

400
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:36,580
Pistons we got to push this layer down
 

401
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,800
Pistons we got to push this layer down
so that they'll be able to fit within

402
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:38,810
so that they'll be able to fit within
 

403
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:45,040
so that they'll be able to fit within
three layers okay do it like this we'll

404
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,050
three layers okay do it like this we'll
 

405
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,720
three layers okay do it like this we'll
fill the space in-between with some

406
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:46,730
fill the space in-between with some
 

407
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,500
fill the space in-between with some
blocks and then activate these so I

408
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:50,510
blocks and then activate these so I
 

409
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,690
blocks and then activate these so I
pushes a slab down one block kind of

410
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:52,700
pushes a slab down one block kind of
 

411
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:59,070
pushes a slab down one block kind of
into his hitbox be the way one more here

412
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,080
into his hitbox be the way one more here
 

413
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,480
into his hitbox be the way one more here
okay so all those got pushed down and

414
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:03,490
okay so all those got pushed down and
 

415
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,710
okay so all those got pushed down and
then this that's gonna serve as the

416
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:05,720
then this that's gonna serve as the
 

417
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,000
then this that's gonna serve as the
floor for the next school over at this

418
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,010
floor for the next school over at this
 

419
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,900
floor for the next school over at this
level here you see just the top of his

420
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:13,910
level here you see just the top of his
 

421
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,050
level here you see just the top of his
head's kind of smooshed into that

422
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,060
head's kind of smooshed into that
 

423
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,400
head's kind of smooshed into that
alright so we pretty much got most of

424
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,410
alright so we pretty much got most of
 

425
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,080
alright so we pretty much got most of
the farm built here but we might want to

426
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,090
the farm built here but we might want to
 

427
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,180
the farm built here but we might want to
make a couple more changes to it if

428
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:22,190
make a couple more changes to it if
 

429
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,270
make a couple more changes to it if
we're down here the rates aren't that

430
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,280
we're down here the rates aren't that
 

431
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,810
we're down here the rates aren't that
great to be honest just the odd guy

432
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:28,820
great to be honest just the odd guy
 

433
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,850
great to be honest just the odd guy
every so often as far as I can tell

434
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:30,860
every so often as far as I can tell
 

435
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,020
every so often as far as I can tell
though they're not getting stuck

436
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,030
though they're not getting stuck
 

437
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,790
though they're not getting stuck
anywhere with their pathfinding which is

438
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:33,800
anywhere with their pathfinding which is
 

439
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,540
anywhere with their pathfinding which is
great

440
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:34,550
great
 

441
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,550
great
I think our design actually works pretty

442
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
I think our design actually works pretty
 

443
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,610
I think our design actually works pretty
good I've noticed though like when I'm

444
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:39,620
good I've noticed though like when I'm
 

445
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,080
good I've noticed though like when I'm
actually on the farm it works a lot

446
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,090
actually on the farm it works a lot
 

447
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,470
actually on the farm it works a lot
better like they spawn a lot quicker we

448
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
better like they spawn a lot quicker we
 

449
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,940
better like they spawn a lot quicker we
got our five golems in there in the

450
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:45,950
got our five golems in there in the
 

451
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,070
got our five golems in there in the
middle five Golden's for five layers

452
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:48,080
middle five Golden's for five layers
 

453
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
middle five Golden's for five layers
yeah you see how much quicker it is now

454
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,090
yeah you see how much quicker it is now
 

455
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,230
yeah you see how much quicker it is now
that we're up here we fully slabbed at

456
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,240
that we're up here we fully slabbed at
 

457
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,120
that we're up here we fully slabbed at
the top I think what we're gonna do is

458
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,130
the top I think what we're gonna do is
 

459
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,350
the top I think what we're gonna do is
maybe slab over the donut hole here

460
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
maybe slab over the donut hole here
 

461
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,860
maybe slab over the donut hole here
as well I kind of feel like darkness

462
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:00,870
as well I kind of feel like darkness
 

463
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,780
as well I kind of feel like darkness
makes them spawn faster so I kind of

464
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:02,790
makes them spawn faster so I kind of
 

465
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,630
makes them spawn faster so I kind of
went test that out to see if this helps

466
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:05,640
went test that out to see if this helps
 

467
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,240
went test that out to see if this helps
if we cover over everything here uh-huh

468
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,250
if we cover over everything here uh-huh
 

469
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,639
if we cover over everything here uh-huh
yeah yep so we filled in the doughnut

470
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:13,649
yeah yep so we filled in the doughnut
 

471
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:15,769
yeah yep so we filled in the doughnut
hole and I filled in the sides here as

472
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:15,779
hole and I filled in the sides here as
 

473
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,980
hole and I filled in the sides here as
well so it's completely dark on all five

474
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:18,990
well so it's completely dark on all five
 

475
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,980
well so it's completely dark on all five
layers now in the farm it doesn't look

476
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:21,990
layers now in the farm it doesn't look
 

477
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,380
layers now in the farm it doesn't look
the best honestly though I might change

478
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:24,390
the best honestly though I might change
 

479
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,819
the best honestly though I might change
that to a different block like if we

480
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:25,829
that to a different block like if we
 

481
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:27,079
that to a different block like if we
decide to keep it like this but we're

482
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:27,089
decide to keep it like this but we're
 

483
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:29,840
decide to keep it like this but we're
kind of just testing it right now it's

484
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:29,850
kind of just testing it right now it's
 

485
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,940
kind of just testing it right now it's
really hard to say whether or not that

486
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:31,950
really hard to say whether or not that
 

487
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,889
really hard to say whether or not that
improved the rates like the rates are

488
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:33,899
improved the rates like the rates are
 

489
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,639
improved the rates like the rates are
good ish now I would say I'm not sure if

490
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:37,649
good ish now I would say I'm not sure if
 

491
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:39,139
good ish now I would say I'm not sure if
the darkness actually helped because it

492
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:39,149
the darkness actually helped because it
 

493
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:40,880
the darkness actually helped because it
seems to matter a lot where I'm standing

494
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:40,890
seems to matter a lot where I'm standing
 

495
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,060
seems to matter a lot where I'm standing
and stuff and I might not have this I

496
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,070
and stuff and I might not have this I
 

497
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,130
and stuff and I might not have this I
might be standing in a wrong spot or

498
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:46,140
might be standing in a wrong spot or
 

499
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,980
might be standing in a wrong spot or
something I find like if I go up here

500
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:48,990
something I find like if I go up here
 

501
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,630
something I find like if I go up here
though or at least last time I did this

502
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:50,640
though or at least last time I did this
 

503
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,250
though or at least last time I did this
I went up and I went back down to look

504
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:52,260
I went up and I went back down to look
 

505
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,470
I went up and I went back down to look
at it it like got really fast for a

506
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
at it it like got really fast for a
 

507
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,180
at it it like got really fast for a
moment yeah

508
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,190
moment yeah
 

509
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,790
moment yeah
oh yeah it's way faster now right so I

510
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
oh yeah it's way faster now right so I
 

511
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
oh yeah it's way faster now right so I
think what we got to do is position

512
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:02,570
think what we got to do is position
 

513
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,960
think what we got to do is position
ourselves on top of the farm when we're

514
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:04,970
ourselves on top of the farm when we're
 

515
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,540
ourselves on top of the farm when we're
using it not off up this side like this

516
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:07,550
using it not off up this side like this
 

517
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,920
using it not off up this side like this
not underneath or anything like that

518
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:08,930
not underneath or anything like that
 

519
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,140
not underneath or anything like that
seems to get the best rates when we're

520
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,150
seems to get the best rates when we're
 

521
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:43,630
seems to get the best rates when we're
on top okay so we're doing something a

522
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:43,640
on top okay so we're doing something a
 

523
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,630
on top okay so we're doing something a
little crazy a little dangerous here

524
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:45,640
little crazy a little dangerous here
 

525
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,660
little crazy a little dangerous here
they fall down here right we got it so

526
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:49,670
they fall down here right we got it so
 

527
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,640
they fall down here right we got it so
they're gonna land in some water that's

528
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:51,650
they're gonna land in some water that's
 

529
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,820
they're gonna land in some water that's
moving this way yeah there's some fences

530
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:54,830
moving this way yeah there's some fences
 

531
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,830
moving this way yeah there's some fences
below here so it's it's like a half

532
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:56,840
below here so it's it's like a half
 

533
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,370
below here so it's it's like a half
block so they can actually step up onto

534
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:00,380
block so they can actually step up onto
 

535
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,470
block so they can actually step up onto
the souls hands you don't have to jump

536
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
the souls hands you don't have to jump
 

537
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,360
the souls hands you don't have to jump
on it they'll just they'll get moved on

538
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,370
on it they'll just they'll get moved on
 

539
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,630
on it they'll just they'll get moved on
to it we're using two signs on each side

540
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:07,640
to it we're using two signs on each side
 

541
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,490
to it we're using two signs on each side
here to hold the water in place that

542
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:09,500
here to hold the water in place that
 

543
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,920
here to hold the water in place that
we're gonna put over here and there's

544
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:11,930
we're gonna put over here and there's
 

545
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,840
we're gonna put over here and there's
also a little compartment here for the

546
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:13,850
also a little compartment here for the
 

547
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,140
also a little compartment here for the
water flow this way some more when these

548
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,150
water flow this way some more when these
 

549
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,910
water flow this way some more when these
blocks break and basically we're gonna

550
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:20,920
blocks break and basically we're gonna
 

551
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,410
blocks break and basically we're gonna
make a water elevator that goes to the

552
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:23,420
make a water elevator that goes to the
 

553
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,100
make a water elevator that goes to the
top of the farm now when we get to this

554
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,110
top of the farm now when we get to this
 

555
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,630
top of the farm now when we get to this
level here I don't really want to block

556
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:28,640
level here I don't really want to block
 

557
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,090
level here I don't really want to block
out the view that they have to the iron

558
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,100
out the view that they have to the iron
 

559
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,610
out the view that they have to the iron
golem which got destroyed but I'm

560
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:33,620
golem which got destroyed but I'm
 

561
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,500
golem which got destroyed but I'm
working on the farm here it kind of

562
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:35,510
working on the farm here it kind of
 

563
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,990
working on the farm here it kind of
messes up their their path finding a bit

564
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000
messes up their their path finding a bit
 

565
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,110
messes up their their path finding a bit
so if they are targeting me and I leave

566
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
so if they are targeting me and I leave
 

567
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,880
so if they are targeting me and I leave
they can sometimes this switch to the

568
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:42,890
they can sometimes this switch to the
 

569
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,890
they can sometimes this switch to the
iron golem without moving to get them

570
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:44,900
iron golem without moving to get them
 

571
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,870
iron golem without moving to get them
you know they'll just switch to shooting

572
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
you know they'll just switch to shooting
 

573
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,290
you know they'll just switch to shooting
him and that's how he got killed it's

574
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:50,300
him and that's how he got killed it's
 

575
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,760
him and that's how he got killed it's
now gonna put a replacement there

576
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:51,770
now gonna put a replacement there
 

577
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,310
now gonna put a replacement there
somehow

578
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:53,320
somehow
 

579
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,900
somehow
so I'm putting trapdoors here so it'll

580
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:55,910
so I'm putting trapdoors here so it'll
 

581
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,000
so I'm putting trapdoors here so it'll
still be an open space but we need to

582
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,010
still be an open space but we need to
 

583
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:01,120
still be an open space but we need to
hold the water back so the trapdoors

584
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,130
hold the water back so the trapdoors
 

585
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,790
hold the water back so the trapdoors
work pretty good for that nope

586
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:05,800
work pretty good for that nope
 

587
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,050
work pretty good for that nope
yeah so he lost view of me and then he

588
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,060
yeah so he lost view of me and then he
 

589
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,560
yeah so he lost view of me and then he
switched an iron golem and shot him

590
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,570
switched an iron golem and shot him
 

591
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,650
switched an iron golem and shot him
okay like this so I really shouldn't be

592
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:14,660
okay like this so I really shouldn't be
 

593
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,120
okay like this so I really shouldn't be
working inside the farm I should have

594
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,130
working inside the farm I should have
 

595
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,560
working inside the farm I should have
put the iron golems in the last I guess

596
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:19,570
put the iron golems in the last I guess
 

597
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,240
put the iron golems in the last I guess
okay go up and basically we got to get

598
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,250
okay go up and basically we got to get
 

599
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,790
okay go up and basically we got to get
all the way to the top here alright and

600
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
all the way to the top here alright and
 

601
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,290
all the way to the top here alright and
then when we get to the top here I break

602
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:26,300
then when we get to the top here I break
 

603
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,610
then when we get to the top here I break
the ice I slab over top and then we make

604
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:30,620
the ice I slab over top and then we make
 

605
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,620
the ice I slab over top and then we make
our way down the tower here filling this

606
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:35,630
our way down the tower here filling this
 

607
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,260
our way down the tower here filling this
up with a water source box so that we

608
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,270
up with a water source box so that we
 

609
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,040
up with a water source box so that we
get a bubble screen alright and then

610
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,050
get a bubble screen alright and then
 

611
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,800
get a bubble screen alright and then
they're all free to flow here and then

612
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:44,810
they're all free to flow here and then
 

613
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,350
they're all free to flow here and then
we escaped with the ender pearl

614
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360

 

615
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,090

alright so still kind of just making it

616
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:52,100
alright so still kind of just making it
 

617
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,190
alright so still kind of just making it
up as we go here how we're gonna build

618
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:54,200
up as we go here how we're gonna build
 

619
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,300
up as we go here how we're gonna build
the farm

620
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,310
the farm
 

621
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,440
the farm
apparently pillagers have 12 hearts of

622
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,450
apparently pillagers have 12 hearts of
 

623
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,420
apparently pillagers have 12 hearts of
health which is quite a bit like zombies

624
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:01,430
health which is quite a bit like zombies
 

625
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,579
health which is quite a bit like zombies
or ten which means I think we got to

626
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:03,589
or ten which means I think we got to
 

627
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:06,040
or ten which means I think we got to
drop them 27 blocks to get them down to

628
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,050
drop them 27 blocks to get them down to
 

629
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,329
drop them 27 blocks to get them down to
a one hit kill so we're gonna make these

630
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:10,339
a one hit kill so we're gonna make these
 

631
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:13,690
a one hit kill so we're gonna make these
elevators go up about 30 blocks above

632
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:13,700
elevators go up about 30 blocks above
 

633
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,310
elevators go up about 30 blocks above
the top of the farm and then we're gonna

634

got quite a bit of space underneath more
 

725
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,860
got quite a bit of space underneath more
than I probably need okay so yeah this

726
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:54,870
than I probably need okay so yeah this
 

727
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,780

this part of the farm is done so let's
 

729
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,050
this part of the farm is done so let's
talk about a few things here where do we

730
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:00,060
talk about a few things here where do we
 

731
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,680
talk about a few things here where do we
go from this point I think maybe I

732
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:03,690
go from this point I think maybe I
 

733
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,990
go from this point I think maybe I
overdid this first part of the farm it

734
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
overdid this first part of the farm it
 

735
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,720

game mechanics actually work for this
 

771
00:18:58,409 --> 00:18:59,869
game mechanics actually work for this
yet we'll figure that out as we build

772
00:18:59,869 --> 00:18:59,879
yet we'll figure that out as we build
 

773
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:03,349
yet we'll figure that out as we build
more onto this but if possible we want

774
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:03,359
more onto this but if possible we want
 

775
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,169
more onto this but if possible we want
to try have multiple raids going on at

776
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:06,179
to try have multiple raids going on at
 

777
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,659
to try have multiple raids going on at
the same time that was possible

778
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:08,669
the same time that was possible
 

779
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:09,979
the same time that was possible
previously I don't know if it is

780
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:09,989
previously I don't know if it is
 

781
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:12,979
previously I don't know if it is
currently in one point 14.4 they might

782
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:12,989
currently in one point 14.4 they might
 

783
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:16,969
currently in one point 14.4 they might
have patched that out of it if you can't

784
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:16,979
have patched that out of it if you can't
 

785
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:18,589
have patched that out of it if you can't
do multiple grades you might be able to

786
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:18,599
do multiple grades you might be able to
 

787
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,719
do multiple grades you might be able to
do it if we set up multiple villages

788
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:20,729
do it if we set up multiple villages
 

789
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:23,029
do it if we set up multiple villages
like we can have one village in this

790
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,039
like we can have one village in this
 

791
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,859
like we can have one village in this
side one over here one over here one

00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:29,149
side one over here one over here one
over there and then activate four

794
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:29,159
over there and then activate four
 

795
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:30,859
over there and then activate four
different raids at the same time maybe

796
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:30,869
different raids at the same time maybe
 

797
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,039
different raids at the same time maybe
if that works I'm not sure that's kind

798
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:34,049
if that works I'm not sure that's kind
 

799
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,749
if that works I'm not sure that's kind
of what I'm thinking at the moment but

800
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:35,759
of what I'm thinking at the moment but
 

801
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,239
of what I'm thinking at the moment but
the next step to this farm is we

802
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:38,249
the next step to this farm is we
 

803
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:39,769
the next step to this farm is we
actually happy at some villagers here to

804
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:39,779
actually happy at some villagers here to
 

805
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,979
actually happy at some villagers here to
test out triggering the raids and stuff

806
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:42,989
test out triggering the raids and stuff
 

807
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:45,619
test out triggering the raids and stuff
now we don't want to like when we

808
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:45,629
now we don't want to like when we
 

809
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:47,599
now we don't want to like when we
trigger the raids we don't want the raid

810
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:47,609
trigger the raids we don't want the raid
 

811
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:49,669
trigger the raids we don't want the raid
guys drops to mix with these ones

812
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
guys drops to mix with these ones
 

813
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,359
guys drops to mix with these ones
because these are like garbage drops

814
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:52,369
because these are like garbage drops
 

815
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:56,389
because these are like garbage drops
which will probably end up trashing when

816
00:19:56,389 --> 00:19:56,399
which will probably end up trashing when
 

817
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,619
which will probably end up trashing when
we start getting emeralds and stuff

818
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:57,629
we start getting emeralds and stuff
 

819
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,839
we start getting emeralds and stuff
though we want those separate so that we

820
00:19:59,839 --> 00:19:59,849
though we want those separate so that we
 

821
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:02,330
though we want those separate so that we
get the good stuff separate from the

822
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:02,340
get the good stuff separate from the
 

823
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,690
get the good stuff separate from the
garbage you know so have a separate kill

824
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:05,700
garbage you know so have a separate kill
 

825
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,210
garbage you know so have a separate kill
chamber for the guys we spawn in I think

826
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:08,220
chamber for the guys we spawn in I think
 

827
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,129
chamber for the guys we spawn in I think
what we'll do is remove this portal up

828
00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:10,139
what we'll do is remove this portal up
 

829
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:13,039
what we'll do is remove this portal up
to the top there and what we're gonna

830
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,049
to the top there and what we're gonna
 

831
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,080
to the top there and what we're gonna
have to transport some villagers through

832
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,090
have to transport some villagers through
 

833
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,849
have to transport some villagers through
our nether to build the second part of

834
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:19,859
our nether to build the second part of
 

835
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,830
our nether to build the second part of
this farm probably since we can't get

836
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:21,840
this farm probably since we can't get
 

837
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,359
this farm probably since we can't get
zombie villagers I still haven't seen

838
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:23,369
zombie villagers I still haven't seen
 

839
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:26,509
zombie villagers I still haven't seen
one alright so this is actually a great

840
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:26,519
one alright so this is actually a great
 

841
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,700
one alright so this is actually a great
project for me cuz it's gonna teach me a

842
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:28,710
project for me cuz it's gonna teach me a
 

843
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,589
project for me cuz it's gonna teach me a
lot of game mechanics I'm a little bit

844
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:30,599
lot of game mechanics I'm a little bit
 

845
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,310
lot of game mechanics I'm a little bit
hazy on mainly villages I I know a

846
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
hazy on mainly villages I I know a
 

847
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,960
hazy on mainly villages I I know a
decent amount of villages but not all

848
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:35,970
decent amount of villages but not all
 

849
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,259
decent amount of villages but not all
the superfine details this is what the

850
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:39,269
the superfine details this is what the
 

851
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:42,560
the superfine details this is what the
wiki page says upon creation a village

852
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:42,570
wiki page says upon creation a village
 

853
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,960
wiki page says upon creation a village
center is defined as a bad claim by the

854
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:44,970
center is defined as a bad claim by the
 

855
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,299
center is defined as a bad claim by the
first villager or the gathering site

856
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:47,309
first villager or the gathering site
 

857
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:49,280
first villager or the gathering site
block a bell

858
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,290
block a bell
 

859
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,470
block a bell
and the villages size is the greater of

860
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:51,480
and the villages size is the greater of
 

861
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,990
and the villages size is the greater of
32 blocks or the distance the furthest

862
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000
32 blocks or the distance the furthest
 

863
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,570
32 blocks or the distance the furthest
bed from the center so I don't know if

864
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:56,580
bed from the center so I don't know if
 

865
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,620
bed from the center so I don't know if
that means diameter 32 blocks

866
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:00,630
that means diameter 32 blocks
 

867
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,139
that means diameter 32 blocks
that's what we're gonna test out here so

868
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:03,149
that's what we're gonna test out here so
 

869
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:08,240
that's what we're gonna test out here so
my plan is like from here this portal is

870
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,250
my plan is like from here this portal is
 

871
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,249
my plan is like from here this portal is
over 16 blocks and we're gonna get a

872
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:10,259
over 16 blocks and we're gonna get a
 

873
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:13,039
over 16 blocks and we're gonna get a
villager on this side of it give them a

874
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,049
villager on this side of it give them a
 

875
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:17,060
villager on this side of it give them a
bed and like a workstation and

876
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,070
bed and like a workstation and
 

877
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,490
bed and like a workstation and

879
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,770

what that means is whenever I did a bad

880
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:21,780
what that means is whenever I did a bad
 

881
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,360
what that means is whenever I did a bad
omen effect if I move like from from

882
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,370
omen effect if I move like from from
 

883
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,909
omen effect if I move like from from
like so here it should trigger a raid

884
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:28,919
like so here it should trigger a raid
 

885
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,060
like so here it should trigger a raid
right but if I'm standing here it should

886
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,070
right but if I'm standing here it should
 

887
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,640
right but if I'm standing here it should
be too far away assuming that's like

888
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:34,650
be too far away assuming that's like
 

889
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,460
be too far away assuming that's like
radius I don't know we'll find out I'm

890
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:37,470
radius I don't know we'll find out I'm
 

891
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,039
radius I don't know we'll find out I'm
gonna learn some stuff here but in order

892
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:40,049
gonna learn some stuff here but in order
 

893
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,960
gonna learn some stuff here but in order
to get a villager here guess what that

894
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:41,970
to get a villager here guess what that
 

895
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,620
to get a villager here guess what that
means I have to build another tunnel

896
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:44,630
means I have to build another tunnel
 

897
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,850
means I have to build another tunnel
because probably the easiest way is

898
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:46,860
because probably the easiest way is
 

899
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,500
because probably the easiest way is
gonna be by boats so check this out we

900
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:51,510
gonna be by boats so check this out we
 

901
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,289
gonna be by boats so check this out we
got ourselves a brand new extension to

902
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:54,299
got ourselves a brand new extension to
 

903
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:58,549
got ourselves a brand new extension to
our massive nether tunnel Network this

904
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
our massive nether tunnel Network this
 

905
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,779
our massive nether tunnel Network this
is probably about it

906
00:21:59,779 --> 00:21:59,789
is probably about it
 

907
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:05,320
is probably about it
thousand blocks no it's not a thousand

908
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:05,330
thousand blocks no it's not a thousand
 

909
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,580
thousand blocks no it's not a thousand
the 300 or 400 something about there

910
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:10,590
the 300 or 400 something about there
 

911
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,289
the 300 or 400 something about there
yeah so this is this links up to the

912
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:12,299
yeah so this is this links up to the
 

913
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,490
yeah so this is this links up to the
part we had built before so I did see a

914
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:16,500
part we had built before so I did see a
 

915
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,140
part we had built before so I did see a
green villager running around our nether

916
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,150
green villager running around our nether
 

917
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,090
green villager running around our nether
tunnels we might snag that guy or we

918
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,100
tunnels we might snag that guy or we
 

919
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,430
tunnels we might snag that guy or we
might go to our underground village and

920
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:22,440
might go to our underground village and
 

921
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,529
might go to our underground village and
spawn some guys in there and send them

922
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:24,539
spawn some guys in there and send them
 

923
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,350
spawn some guys in there and send them
through the nether so I did find the

924
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
through the nether so I did find the
 

925
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,390
through the nether so I did find the
green coke guy but he's like way off the

926
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:29,400
green coke guy but he's like way off the
 

927
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,169
green coke guy but he's like way off the
path here and he's not he's not

928
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:33,179
path here and he's not he's not
 

929
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:37,490
path here and he's not he's not
accepting my nudges at all actually I

930
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:37,500
accepting my nudges at all actually I
 

931
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,140
accepting my nudges at all actually I
didn't just lock them in with a minecart

932
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,150
didn't just lock them in with a minecart
 

933
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,230
didn't just lock them in with a minecart
track and I that'll make it so those

934
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
track and I that'll make it so those
 

935
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,610
track and I that'll make it so those
pathfinding won't go out of that now can

936
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:46,620
pathfinding won't go out of that now can
 

937
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,720
pathfinding won't go out of that now can
we get him in a minecart have to like

938
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:50,730
we get him in a minecart have to like
 

939
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,399
we get him in a minecart have to like
push him onto the track a bit maybe go

940
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:55,409
push him onto the track a bit maybe go
 

941
00:22:55,409 --> 00:23:02,149
push him onto the track a bit maybe go
in that way no oh he's gone don't go

942
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
in that way no oh he's gone don't go
 

943
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:09,289
in that way no oh he's gone don't go
through the portal no not allowed man

944
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:09,299
through the portal no not allowed man
 

945
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,890
through the portal no not allowed man
what a disaster okay what if we like

946
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:12,900
what a disaster okay what if we like
 

947
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,919
what a disaster okay what if we like
lock them right here he'll just go out

948
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:15,929
lock them right here he'll just go out
 

949
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:18,820
lock them right here he'll just go out
of it that's that's what will happen um

00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,190
no idea where it's gone and like their
health went down I think that's a glitch

1108
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,200
health went down I think that's a glitch
 

1109
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,810
health went down I think that's a glitch
I don't think I've killed any of them

1110
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:34,820
I don't think I've killed any of them
 

1111
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,500
I don't think I've killed any of them
actually so

1112
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:40,510

 

1113
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:44,430

not too sure what to do about this I

1114
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:44,440
not too sure what to do about this I
 

1115
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,510
not too sure what to do about this I
kind of figured they would have spawned

1116
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:46,520
kind of figured they would have spawned
 

1117
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,550
kind of figured they would have spawned
on this hill somewhere but I don't see

1118
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:48,560
on this hill somewhere but I don't see
 

1119
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:54,040
on this hill somewhere but I don't see
them so yeah we're kind of stuck with a

1120
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,050
them so yeah we're kind of stuck with a
 

1121
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,380
them so yeah we're kind of stuck with a
raid right now here's what I found out

1122
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:56,390
raid right now here's what I found out
 

1123
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,390
raid right now here's what I found out
though it seems like if a raid is in

1124
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:58,400
though it seems like if a raid is in
 

1125
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,360
though it seems like if a raid is in
progress and we kill more bannermen we

1126
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,370
progress and we kill more bannermen we
 

1127
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,960
progress and we kill more bannermen we
don't get the bad omen effect at least

1128
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:04,970
don't get the bad omen effect at least
 

1129
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,630
don't get the bad omen effect at least
not while we're within range of the raid

1130
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:07,640
not while we're within range of the raid
 

1131
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,170
not while we're within range of the raid
Baro there may be if the raid happened

1132
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:11,180
Baro there may be if the raid happened
 

1133
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,030
Baro there may be if the raid happened
somewhere farther away we would be able

1134
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,040
somewhere farther away we would be able
 

1135
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:19,780
somewhere farther away we would be able
to go it again during the raid but kind

1136
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:19,790
to go it again during the raid but kind
 

1137
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,040
to go it again during the raid but kind
of in trouble here I can't really do

1138
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,050
of in trouble here I can't really do
 

1139
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,720
of in trouble here I can't really do
anything until I figure out how to get

1140
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:22,730
anything until I figure out how to get
 

1141
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,650
anything until I figure out how to get
rid of this raid so I think what's

1142
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:26,660
rid of this raid so I think what's
 

1143
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,510
rid of this raid so I think what's
happening it's counting these guys as

1144
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:28,520
happening it's counting these guys as
 

1145
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:34,800
happening it's counting these guys as
part of the raid even though they're not

1146
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:34,810

 

1147
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:37,990

and I think the raid wave won't end

1148
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,000
and I think the raid wave won't end
 

1149
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,660
and I think the raid wave won't end
unless all these guys die which is

1150
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:40,670
unless all these guys die which is
 

1151
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,370
unless all these guys die which is
impossible because as soon as we kill it

1152
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:42,380
impossible because as soon as we kill it
 

1153
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,050
impossible because as soon as we kill it
more will spawn so that could be what's

1154
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:47,060
more will spawn so that could be what's
 

1155
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:53,050
more will spawn so that could be what's
happening I'm kind of curious what

1156
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:53,060
happening I'm kind of curious what
 

1157
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,330
happening I'm kind of curious what
happens if we destroy the the bed the

1158
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:55,340
happens if we destroy the the bed the
 

1159
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,210
happens if we destroy the the bed the
village here let's let's give that a

village here let's let's give that a
 

1161
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,830
village here let's let's give that a
shot will that end the raid

1162
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:01,840
shot will that end the raid
 

1163
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,490
shot will that end the raid

need to do that
 

1229
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,120
need to do that
so we got bad omen again you can see it

1230
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,130
so we got bad omen again you can see it
 

1231
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:01,460
so we got bad omen again you can see it
up there right got the bad omen and the

raid did not activate this time so let's

1234
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,120
raid did not activate this time so let's
 

1235
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,700
raid did not activate this time so let's
see how close we have to get for it to

1236
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:04,710
see how close we have to get for it to
 

1237
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:13,070
see how close we have to get for it to
actually activate and go slow here once

1238
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,080
actually activate and go slow here once
 

1239
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,600
actually activate and go slow here once
we know the range we might be able to

1240
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:14,610
we know the range we might be able to
 

1241
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,520
we know the range we might be able to
put four villages around the center of

1242
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:16,530
put four villages around the center of
 

1243
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:20,270
put four villages around the center of
this thing still not activated still not

1244
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:20,280
this thing still not activated still not
 

1245
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,240
this thing still not activated still not

activated that should be a village now I
think I didn't think we'd have to get

00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:30,390
think I didn't think we'd have to get
 

1249
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:35,140
think I didn't think we'd have to get
this close though I'm a little confused

1250
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,150
this close though I'm a little confused
 

1251
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:39,290
this close though I'm a little confused

00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,140
is the question they actually spawn this
 

1261
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,860
is the question they actually spawn this
time I feel like that mountains the only

1262
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:57,870
time I feel like that mountains the only
 

1263
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,300
time I feel like that mountains the only
place they could spawn because there's

1264
00:31:59,300 --> 00:31:59,310
place they could spawn because there's
 

1265
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,930
place they could spawn because there's
no land nearby here it must be those two

1266
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:02,940
no land nearby here it must be those two
 

1267
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,020
no land nearby here it must be those two
guys there so let's do an experiment

1268
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,030
guys there so let's do an experiment
 

1269
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,080
guys there so let's do an experiment
here my question is if we get outside of

1270
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,090
here my question is if we get outside of
 

1271
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,080
here my question is if we get outside of
the range of a raid so like if we go

1272
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,090
the range of a raid so like if we go
 

1273
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,330
the range of a raid so like if we go
over here the raid bar shows up so we're

1274
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:14,340
over here the raid bar shows up so we're
 

1275
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,860
over here the raid bar shows up so we're
like just on the border of it right what

1276
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:18,870
like just on the border of it right what
 

1277
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,520
like just on the border of it right what
happens if we kill a Bannerman from up

1278
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:22,530
happens if we kill a Bannerman from up
 

1279
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:25,630
happens if we kill a Bannerman from up
here is that gonna give us the

1280
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:25,640
here is that gonna give us the
 

1281
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,640
here is that gonna give us the
Battlement again during the raid like

1282
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:28,650
Battlement again during the raid like
 

1283
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,010
Battlement again during the raid like
while one's going on might be like

1284
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:31,020
while one's going on might be like
 

1285
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,640
while one's going on might be like
really hard to tell if we even kill one

1286
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:34,650
really hard to tell if we even kill one
 

1287
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:38,470
really hard to tell if we even kill one
though unfortunately

1288
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:38,480

 

1289
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,649

they can't see that far I'm just gonna

1290
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:41,659
they can't see that far I'm just gonna
 

1291
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:42,970
they can't see that far I'm just gonna
keep checking this thing for a while and

1292
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:42,980
keep checking this thing for a while and
 

1293
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,009
keep checking this thing for a while and
see if anything happens so I'm pretty

1294
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:45,019
see if anything happens so I'm pretty
 

1295
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:46,769
see if anything happens so I'm pretty
sure I've killed the bannermen by now

1296
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:46,779
sure I've killed the bannermen by now
 

1297
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:49,479
sure I've killed the bannermen by now
and we're outside the range of the raid

1298
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:49,489
and we're outside the range of the raid
 

1299
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:51,609
and we're outside the range of the raid
but I haven't been able to get the bad

1300
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:51,619
but I haven't been able to get the bad
 

1301
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:56,019
but I haven't been able to get the bad
omen affecting again so it might not be

1302
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:56,029
omen affecting again so it might not be
 

1303
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:57,820
omen affecting again so it might not be
possible to trigger more than one raid

1304
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:57,830
possible to trigger more than one raid
 

1305
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,880
possible to trigger more than one raid
at a time

1306
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:00,890

 

1307
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:05,070

which is what I'm trying to go for here

1308
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,080

 

1309
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,990

yeah all right rates still going on

1310
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
yeah all right rates still going on
 

1311
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,639
yeah all right rates still going on
right let's go over here yeah it's still

1312
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:09,649
right let's go over here yeah it's still
 

1313
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:15,279
right let's go over here yeah it's still
happening so good to know also getting

1314
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:15,289
happening so good to know also getting
 

1315
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:17,560
happening so good to know also getting
an incredible amount a leg for some

1316
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:17,570
an incredible amount a leg for some
 

1317
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,060
an incredible amount a leg for some
reason now something's happening down

1318
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,070
reason now something's happening down
 

1319
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,930
reason now something's happening down
there that's not good let's break the

1320
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:22,940
there that's not good let's break the
 

1321
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,310
there that's not good let's break the
bed

1322
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:23,320
bed
 

1323
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,639
bed

something is not running right I have
 

1325
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:30,850
something is not running right I have
activated some glitch I don't know

1326
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:30,860
activated some glitch I don't know
 

1327
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,889
activated some glitch I don't know
actually let's let's keep it broken for

1328
00:33:32,889 --> 00:33:32,899
actually let's let's keep it broken for
 

1329
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:35,100
actually let's let's keep it broken for
right now

1330
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,110

1335
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:53,669
saw that but there's like a million guys
going up the tower right now and that is

1336
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:53,679
going up the tower right now and that is
 

1337
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,610
going up the tower right now and that is
what it's causing all the leg okay okay

1338

what it's causing all the leg okay okay
 

1339
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,450
what it's causing all the leg okay okay
I think we figured it out

1340
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:01,460
I think we figured it out
 

1341
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:07,790
I think we figured it out
[Applause]

1342
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:07,800

 

1343

1347
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,639

well anyways guys our episode is getting

1348
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:20,649
well anyways guys our episode is getting
 

1349
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:22,440
well anyways guys our episode is getting
a little bit long here at this point so

1350
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:22,450
a little bit long here at this point so
 

1351
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,720
a little bit long here at this point so
we should probably wrap up but man I had

1352
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:24,730
we should probably wrap up but man I had
 

1353
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,320
we should probably wrap up but man I had
a lot of fun building that today I like

1354
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,330
a lot of fun building that today I like
 

1355
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,510
a lot of fun building that today I like
doing stuff with mobs especially when

1356
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:30,520
doing stuff with mobs especially when
 

1357
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,079
doing stuff with mobs especially when
you don't know what's gonna happen right

1358
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:33,089
you don't know what's gonna happen right
 

1359
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:36,180
you don't know what's gonna happen right
that's the cool thing about new things

1360
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:36,190
that's the cool thing about new things
 

1361
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,909
that's the cool thing about new things
so I guess with that in mind though some

1362
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:38,919
so I guess with that in mind though some
 

1363
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:40,260
so I guess with that in mind though some
of you guys probably do know the

1364
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:40,270
of you guys probably do know the
 

1365
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,240
of you guys probably do know the
mechanics better than me with that so if

1366
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:42,250
mechanics better than me with that so if
 

1367
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:46,579
mechanics better than me with that so if
if you know a way that I can make a

1368
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:46,589
if you know a way that I can make a
 

1369
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:48,960
if you know a way that I can make a
multiple raids happen at the same time

we're spawning in it kind of looks like

1378
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:56,530
we're spawning in it kind of looks like
 

1379
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,740
we're spawning in it kind of looks like
you can't spawn more than one raid at a

1380
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:58,750
you can't spawn more than one raid at a
 

1381
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,200
you can't spawn more than one raid at a
time but I'm gonna play around with it a

1382
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,210
time but I'm gonna play around with it a
 

1383
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,420
time but I'm gonna play around with it a
bit more but let's get to the comment of

1384

with hearthstone I kind of got to the
 

1405
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,460
with hearthstone I kind of got to the
point where

point where
 

1407
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,080
point where
I was playing it because I felt

1408
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,090
I was playing it because I felt
 

1409
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,980
I was playing it because I felt
