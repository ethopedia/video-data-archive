that stronghold we found so I'll have to
 

397
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,720
that stronghold we found so I'll have to
think I'm just going to do it like this

398

think I'm just going to do it like this
 

399
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,160

again and follow where it goes we'll
 

401
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,480
again and follow where it goes we'll
probably end up with a new stronghold

402
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:54,490
probably end up with a new stronghold
 

403

417
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,400
blocks one way I'd go there throw it
again it'll go 16 blocks back and it

418
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:17,410
again it'll go 16 blocks back and it
 

419

700
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:12,020
that means our chickens probably won't
 

701
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,100
that means our chickens probably won't
die either which is really nice and get

702

more eggs from them and I well you

704
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:21,500
more eggs from them and I well you
 

705
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,740

706
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:23,750
should be able to make wheat farms and
 

707

00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:30,440
places like the nether and the end
 

711
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,340
places like the nether and the end
because they're kind of like a skyblock

712
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:33,350
because they're kind of like a skyblock
 

713
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,370
because they're kind of like a skyblock
survival to me you start with nothing

714
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:36,380
survival to me you start with nothing
 

715
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,190
survival to me you start with nothing
and then it's up to you to make it

716
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
and then it's up to you to make it
 

717
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,160
and then it's up to you to make it
awesome kind of with your limited

718
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,170
awesome kind of with your limited
 

719
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,970
awesome kind of with your limited
resources and so it's almost like you're

720
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:45,980
resources and so it's almost like you're
 

721
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,950
resources and so it's almost like you're
the ant in corruption that's how I feel

722
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:50,960
the ant in corruption that's how I feel
 

723
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,350
the ant in corruption that's how I feel
anyway it's kind of a fun challenge to

724
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:53,360
anyway it's kind of a fun challenge to
 

725
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,390
anyway it's kind of a fun challenge to
make it cool even though there's nothing

726
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:55,400
make it cool even though there's nothing
 

727
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:06,419
make it cool even though there's nothing
really here seems to be just an island

728
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:06,429

 

729
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:11,080

yeah just an island those things are

730
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,090
yeah just an island those things are
 

731
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,960

healing him it doesn't seem to hurt me

732
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:13,970
healing him it doesn't seem to hurt me
 

733
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,530
healing him it doesn't seem to hurt me
for some reason these guys leave me

734
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:17,540
for some reason these guys leave me
 

735
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:23,020
for some reason these guys leave me
alone around hard this is pretty

736
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,030
alone around hard this is pretty
 

737
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:31,470
alone around hard this is pretty
pathetic as far as challenge goes I

738
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:31,480

 

739
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,299

think what I'm gonna do when we actually

740
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:34,309
think what I'm gonna do when we actually
 

741
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:35,650
think what I'm gonna do when we actually
do fight the dragon I think I'm just

742
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:35,660
do fight the dragon I think I'm just
 

743
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,660
do fight the dragon I think I'm just
going to try to kill them with TNT I

744
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:37,670
going to try to kill them with TNT I
 

745
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,700
going to try to kill them with TNT I
don't have a lot of arrows saved up so I

746
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:41,710
don't have a lot of arrows saved up so I
 

747
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,560
don't have a lot of arrows saved up so I
think that's what we'll do and probably

748
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:44,570
think that's what we'll do and probably
 

749
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,730
think that's what we'll do and probably
won't even try to get rid of those

750
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:45,740
won't even try to get rid of those
 

751
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,640
won't even try to get rid of those
things

752
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:47,650
things
 

753
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,700
things
just do one big TNT blast on them

754
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:50,710
just do one big TNT blast on them
 

755
00:28:50,710 --> 00:29:02,580
just do one big TNT blast on them
if we can I thought this is a little

756
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:02,590
if we can I thought this is a little
 

757
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:24,120
if we can I thought this is a little
exciting dragon won't even throw there

758
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,130
exciting dragon won't even throw there
 

759
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:24,920
exciting dragon won't even throw there
we go

760
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:24,930
we go
 

761
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,970
we go
it was weird though because I'm pretty

762
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:26,980
it was weird though because I'm pretty
 

763
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,460
it was weird though because I'm pretty
sure he hit me right when I got there

764
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:29,470
sure he hit me right when I got there
 

765
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,860
sure he hit me right when I got there
but after that he was just pushing me

766
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:31,870
but after that he was just pushing me
 

767
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:38,490
but after that he was just pushing me
around that was it well anyway that was

768
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:38,500
around that was it well anyway that was
 

769
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,070

our end journey I hope you enjoyed it
 

771
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,370
our end journey I hope you enjoyed it
even though sorry it is it is what it is

772
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:44,380
even though sorry it is it is what it is
 

773
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,030
even though sorry it is it is what it is
and I could have been a little more

774
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,040
and I could have been a little more
 

775
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,400
and I could have been a little more
excited too I guess but that was my

776
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,410
excited too I guess but that was my
 

777
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:56,240
excited too I guess but that was my
reaction to it kind of whatever I'm

778
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,250
reaction to it kind of whatever I'm
 

779
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,080
reaction to it kind of whatever I'm
sometime will probably kill the dragon

780
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,090
sometime will probably kill the dragon
 

781
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,770
sometime will probably kill the dragon
and then establish something there cuz I

782
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:01,780
and then establish something there cuz I
 

783
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,920
and then establish something there cuz I
don't think he comes back I think once

784
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:04,930
don't think he comes back I think once
 

785
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,160
don't think he comes back I think once
he kill him that's it he drops egg and

786
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,170
he kill him that's it he drops egg and
 

787
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:11,220
he kill him that's it he drops egg and
then the egg doesn't do anything you can

788
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:11,230
then the egg doesn't do anything you can
 

789
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,280
then the egg doesn't do anything you can
go through the portal back to the world

790
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,290
go through the portal back to the world
 

791
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:18,510
go through the portal back to the world
once he kill them and and yeah when you

792
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:18,520
once he kill them and and yeah when you
 

793
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,340
once he kill them and and yeah when you
return I don't there's going to be

794
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,350
return I don't there's going to be
 

795
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,920
return I don't there's going to be
another one but I think each stronghold

796
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:22,930
another one but I think each stronghold
 

797
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,750
another one but I think each stronghold
has one ender dragon from what I've read

798
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:26,760
has one ender dragon from what I've read
 

799
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,610
has one ender dragon from what I've read
