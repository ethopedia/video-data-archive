nether here to the overworld and when I
 

51
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,219
nether here to the overworld and when I
went through the portal the nether

52
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:19,229
went through the portal the nether
 

53
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,450

altogether we'll just go straight to the
end because to get the new glider guys

74
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,140
end because to get the new glider guys
 

75

end because to get the new glider guys
that's where it is you have to get to

76
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
that's where it is you have to get to

there that has the glider wings in so
 

85
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,230
there that has the glider wings in so
it's gonna go try get those and go

get you airborne because normally you

192
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,220
get you airborne because normally you
 

193
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,360
get you airborne because normally you
can't just jump in and float oh uh it

194
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,370
can't just jump in and float oh uh it
 

195
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,180
can't just jump in and float oh uh it
seems to start but yeah you don't go

196
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,190
seems to start but yeah you don't go
 

197
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,330

yeah you see I'm just pressing spacebar

200
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
yeah you see I'm just pressing spacebar
 

201
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,210
yeah you see I'm just pressing spacebar
right now and I'm moving forward a

so no quick travel on flatland okay I

210
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:03,390
so no quick travel on flatland okay I
 

211
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,010
so no quick travel on flatland okay I
was wondering about that and let's see

212
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,020
was wondering about that and let's see
 

213
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,380
was wondering about that and let's see
oh yeah so the wings they have a

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:09,390
oh yeah so the wings they have a
 

215
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,430
oh yeah so the wings they have a
durability to them they have 432 and you

216
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
durability to them they have 432 and you
 

217
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,830
durability to them they have 432 and you
can apparently repair them they just go

218
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
can apparently repair them they just go
 

219
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
can apparently repair them they just go
is it there like a chess piece right

220

223
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,450
you can apparently repair them
infinitely I don't know if that's true

224
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:23,460
infinitely I don't know if that's true
 

225
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,890
infinitely I don't know if that's true
or not let's let's use them again and I

226
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:27,900
or not let's let's use them again and I

00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:35,640
I read okay let's try it again so it was
 

233
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,040
I read okay let's try it again so it was
one the first time oh that didn't I

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,050
one the first time oh that didn't I
 

235
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,330
one the first time oh that didn't I
think we flew for a second there didn't

still one level to repair it has 426 oh

262
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,120
still one level to repair it has 426 oh
 

263

still one level to repair it has 426 oh
it's two levels now I don't know hmm

I'll have to look into that a bit more

266
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:29,610
I'll have to look into that a bit more

I wanted to see though if you can put
 

269
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,520
I wanted to see though if you can put
unbreaking on these like that's getting

270
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:34,530
unbreaking on these like that's getting
 

271
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,020
unbreaking on these like that's getting
more expensive for every time you repair

272
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,030
more expensive for every time you repair

unrepairable because you

276
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,280
unrepairable because you
 

277
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,830

in there they're hard to find okay so if

280
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:45,380
in there they're hard to find okay so if
 

281
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,160
in there they're hard to find okay so if
you put thorns on is that possible no no

282
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,170
you put thorns on is that possible no no
 

283
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,950
you put thorns on is that possible no no

if we can do a bit of that ok I found a

306
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,310
if we can do a bit of that ok I found a
 

307
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,620
if we can do a bit of that ok I found a
pretty good challenge here and we'll see

308
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:23,630
pretty good challenge here and we'll see
 

309
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,810
pretty good challenge here and we'll see
if we didn't do it our first step is to

310
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:25,820
if we didn't do it our first step is to
 

311
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,490
if we didn't do it our first step is to
get into that opening there and then we

312
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:27,500
get into that opening there and then we
 

313
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,200
get into that opening there and then we
I think we got to go down into the left

314
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,210
I think we got to go down into the left
 

315
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,850
I think we got to go down into the left
and then it gets really crazy so we'll

guys I just had an idea

342
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,270
guys I just had an idea
 

343
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,740
guys I just had an idea
let's try make a sky Road okay so it's

344
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:17,750
let's try make a sky Road okay so it's
 

345
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,020
let's try make a sky Road okay so it's
an inverted sky road instead of going on

346
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,030
an inverted sky road instead of going on
 

347
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,370
an inverted sky road instead of going on
top of it you go underneath it and this

348
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:24,380
top of it you go underneath it and this
 

349
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,680
top of it you go underneath it and this
would serve instead of a launching

350
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:26,690
would serve instead of a launching
 

351
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,029
would serve instead of a launching
mechanic so if you didn't want to do a

352
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:28,039
mechanic so if you didn't want to do a
 

353
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,240
mechanic so if you didn't want to do a
slime block launcher or TNT blasting you

354
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,250
slime block launcher or TNT blasting you
 

355
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,399
slime block launcher or TNT blasting you
into space I don't know why you wouldn't

356
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:33,409
into space I don't know why you wouldn't
 

357
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,920
into space I don't know why you wouldn't
want to do that but if you want to try

358
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:35,930
want to do that but if you want to try
 

359
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,829
want to do that but if you want to try
something else an idea is as you lose

360
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839
something else an idea is as you lose
 

361
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,500
something else an idea is as you lose
altitude throw an enderpearl

362
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,510
altitude throw an enderpearl
 

363
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,659
altitude throw an enderpearl
up and then you regain it right and you

364
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:43,669
up and then you regain it right and you
 

365
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:46,090
up and then you regain it right and you
can potentially travel forever this way

366
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,100
can potentially travel forever this way
 

367
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,950

them back on calling it now it's gonna

484
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:49,550
them back on calling it now it's gonna
 

485
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,400
them back on calling it now it's gonna
happen all the time okay here we go I

486

don't know it's gonna take some practice

488
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:55,880
don't know it's gonna take some practice
 

489
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,990
don't know it's gonna take some practice
to get good at these two Oh totally

490
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,000
to get good at these two Oh totally
 

491

to get good at these two Oh totally
missed it let's try again I like the way

492
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:03,650
missed it let's try again I like the way
 

493
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,020
missed it let's try again I like the way
they implemented them though that

494
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,030
they implemented them though that
 

495
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,820
they implemented them though that
actually takes a bit of skill to fly

496
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:06,830
actually takes a bit of skill to fly
 

497
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,490
actually takes a bit of skill to fly
them like controlled it's not like a

498
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:09,500
them like controlled it's not like a
 

499
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,699
them like controlled it's not like a
static speed you can adjust it and set

500
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:12,709
static speed you can adjust it and set
 

501
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:16,030
static speed you can adjust it and set
up courses and obstacles if you want

502
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,040
up courses and obstacles if you want
 

503
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,020
up courses and obstacles if you want
it's good

504
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,030
it's good
 

505
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:22,930
it's good
be a real fun thing I wonder from going

506
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:22,940
be a real fun thing I wonder from going
 

507
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,710
be a real fun thing I wonder from going
through them or did I write my bad at

508
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
through them or did I write my bad at
 

509
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,420
through them or did I write my bad at
lining it up it looked like that was

510
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:28,430
lining it up it looked like that was
 

511
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,960
lining it up it looked like that was
right to me but you can kind of go

512
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:31,970
right to me but you can kind of go
 

513
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:37,110
right to me but you can kind of go
through tripwires too as a problem ah

514
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120

 

515
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,770

delays too long

516
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:38,780
delays too long
 

517
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,800
delays too long
yeah you move fast and I should test the

518
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:41,810
yeah you move fast and I should test the
 

519
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,250
yeah you move fast and I should test the
speed too I haven't done that yet yeah

520
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:45,260
speed too I haven't done that yet yeah
 

521
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,600
speed too I haven't done that yet yeah
let's set it to one okay here we go

522
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:49,610
let's set it to one okay here we go
 

523
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,370
let's set it to one okay here we go
again I think the trick is we got to

524
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:51,380
again I think the trick is we got to
 

525
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,210
again I think the trick is we got to
really slow down oh let's get low and

526
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:55,220
really slow down oh let's get low and
 

527
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,200
really slow down oh let's get low and
then slow I missed it I missed it

528
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,210
then slow I missed it I missed it
 

529
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:04,180
then slow I missed it I missed it
yeah oh this is so difficult I can't do

530
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,190
yeah oh this is so difficult I can't do
 

531
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,160
yeah oh this is so difficult I can't do
it one more time come on it is so

532
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,170
it one more time come on it is so
 

533
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,120
it one more time come on it is so
difficult to hit this little target I

534
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,130
difficult to hit this little target I
 

535
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,440
difficult to hit this little target I
hope I get really good with these wings

536
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:14,450
hope I get really good with these wings
 

537
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,850
hope I get really good with these wings
I'm gonna practice you know enderpearls

538
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:18,860
I'm gonna practice you know enderpearls
 

539
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,130
I'm gonna practice you know enderpearls
were hard at first but now everybody's

540
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:21,140
were hard at first but now everybody's
 

541
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,320
were hard at first but now everybody's
really good at them um okay we got it

542
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,330
really good at them um okay we got it
 

543
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:33,940
really good at them um okay we got it
that time but again delays wrong oh no

544
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:33,950
that time but again delays wrong oh no
 

545
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:43,450
that time but again delays wrong oh no
oh yeah I think I did that right but it

546
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:43,460
oh yeah I think I did that right but it
 

547
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,670
oh yeah I think I did that right but it
likes stop me then actually push me up

548
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
likes stop me then actually push me up
 

549
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,100
likes stop me then actually push me up
hmm I landed instead of actually getting

550
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,110
hmm I landed instead of actually getting
 

551
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:59,490
hmm I landed instead of actually getting
launched at all which is kind of weird

552
00:13:59,490 --> 00:13:59,500

 

553
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:11,730

ow oh I did it oh my goodness yes it is

554
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:11,740
ow oh I did it oh my goodness yes it is
 

555
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,680
ow oh I did it oh my goodness yes it is
possible

556
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:12,690
possible
 

557
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,780
possible
oh that's awesome

558
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:15,790
oh that's awesome
 

559
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,660
oh that's awesome
you have to be going fairly fast though

560
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:18,670
you have to be going fairly fast though
 

561
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,670
you have to be going fairly fast though
it is so hard to do that was like my

562
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:20,680
it is so hard to do that was like my
 

563
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,150
it is so hard to do that was like my
30th or 40th attempt already but the

564
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
30th or 40th attempt already but the
 

565
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,940
30th or 40th attempt already but the
idea is if you can get a refresh you

566
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:26,950
idea is if you can get a refresh you
 

567
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,280
idea is if you can get a refresh you
don't actually have to land and it's the

568
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,290
don't actually have to land and it's the
 

569
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,830
don't actually have to land and it's the
landing that messes you up because once

570
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:31,840
landing that messes you up because once
 

571
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,230
landing that messes you up because once
you land you have to go through the

572
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
you land you have to go through the
 

573
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,790
you land you have to go through the
whole downward and then horizontal where

574
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
whole downward and then horizontal where
 

575
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,950
whole downward and then horizontal where
you lose about five to ten blocks of

576
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:40,960
you lose about five to ten blocks of
 

577
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,320
you lose about five to ten blocks of
height but if you're just going

578
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,330
height but if you're just going
 

579
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,240
height but if you're just going
horizontal at full speed like that you

580
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,250
horizontal at full speed like that you
 

581
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,980
horizontal at full speed like that you
just keep cruising now to take it to the

582
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:49,990
just keep cruising now to take it to the
 

583
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,470
just keep cruising now to take it to the
next level I want to try chain multiple

584
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
next level I want to try chain multiple
 

585
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,790
next level I want to try chain multiple
of them together so I'm just going to

586
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:53,800
of them together so I'm just going to
 

587
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,160
of them together so I'm just going to
try to do two because my pilot's skills

588
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,170
try to do two because my pilot's skills
 

589
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,160
try to do two because my pilot's skills
kind of suck right now but these are the

590
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,170
kind of suck right now but these are the
 

591
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,710
kind of suck right now but these are the
same heights and you should be able to

592
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:01,720
same heights and you should be able to
 

593
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,630
same heights and you should be able to
space um pretty far apart I don't know

594
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:03,640
space um pretty far apart I don't know
 

595
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,360
space um pretty far apart I don't know
the right distance or anything yet it'll

596
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,370
the right distance or anything yet it'll
 

597
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,040
the right distance or anything yet it'll
be a bit of a trial and error sort of

598
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,050
be a bit of a trial and error sort of
 

599
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,800
be a bit of a trial and error sort of
thing but I'm gonna try do two now so

600
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:10,810
thing but I'm gonna try do two now so
 

601
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:18,390
thing but I'm gonna try do two now so
wish me luck there we go that's the

602
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:18,400
wish me luck there we go that's the
 

603
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,340
wish me luck there we go that's the
secret you didn't you just need more

604
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,350
secret you didn't you just need more
 

605
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:28,200
secret you didn't you just need more
surface area oh I think I landed on that

606
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,210
surface area oh I think I landed on that
 

607
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,550
surface area oh I think I landed on that
though because I saw the walking

608
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:29,560
though because I saw the walking
 

609
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,750
though because I saw the walking
animation ah this is killing me guys I

610
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:33,760
animation ah this is killing me guys I
 

611
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,090
animation ah this is killing me guys I
know there's a trick to it I know there

612
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,100
know there's a trick to it I know there
 

613
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,860
know there's a trick to it I know there
is I just can't figure out what it is

614
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:39,870

 

615
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,060

see this that's what's happening to me

616
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,070
see this that's what's happening to me
 

617
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,530
see this that's what's happening to me
now I'm getting stuck on it

618
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:43,540
now I'm getting stuck on it
 

619
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,810
now I'm getting stuck on it
I think increasing the size of the

620
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:45,820
I think increasing the size of the
 

621
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,860
I think increasing the size of the
launcher is actually not a good thing

622
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:48,870
launcher is actually not a good thing
 

623
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,920
launcher is actually not a good thing
I'm guessing it's like it's figuring out

624
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:52,930
I'm guessing it's like it's figuring out
 

625
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,510
I'm guessing it's like it's figuring out
that I'm hanging the side of a slime

626
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:54,520
that I'm hanging the side of a slime
 

627
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,730
that I'm hanging the side of a slime
block instead now and that stops me oh

628
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:58,740
block instead now and that stops me oh
 

629
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,250
block instead now and that stops me oh
went through and the tripwires seem to

630
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:02,260
went through and the tripwires seem to
 

631
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,900
went through and the tripwires seem to
not activate a lot of the times which is

632
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:03,910
not activate a lot of the times which is
 

633
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,380
not activate a lot of the times which is
another big problem so I don't know if I

634
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:07,390
another big problem so I don't know if I
 

635
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:11,280
another big problem so I don't know if I
can do this consistently

636
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:11,290

 

637
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:18,120

ah what I went too fast I don't know um

638
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,130
ah what I went too fast I don't know um
 

639
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,850
ah what I went too fast I don't know um
now a few times I did seem to get it to

640
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:20,860
now a few times I did seem to get it to
 

641
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,010
now a few times I did seem to get it to
work I believe I was moving upwards

642
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:23,020
work I believe I was moving upwards
 

643
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:31,560
work I believe I was moving upwards
slightly at a pretty decent speed ah oh

644
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:31,570
slightly at a pretty decent speed ah oh
 

645
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,510
slightly at a pretty decent speed ah oh
yeah I think that might have counted

646
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:33,520
yeah I think that might have counted
 

647
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,860
yeah I think that might have counted
actually I felt like we slowed down a

648
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:34,870
actually I felt like we slowed down a
 

649
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,510
actually I felt like we slowed down a
lot though it's hard to say okay one

650
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:39,520
lot though it's hard to say okay one
 

651
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,090
lot though it's hard to say okay one
more time and slightly move upwards now

652
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:45,100
more time and slightly move upwards now
 

653
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,050
more time and slightly move upwards now
I got stuck on it hmm

654
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:48,060
I got stuck on it hmm
 

655
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,880
I got stuck on it hmm
well anyways I'll practice that some

656
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:50,890
well anyways I'll practice that some
 

657
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,010
well anyways I'll practice that some
more later maybe you guys know what I'm

658
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,020
more later maybe you guys know what I'm
 

659
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,130
more later maybe you guys know what I'm
doing wrong you let me know but I wanted

660
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,140
doing wrong you let me know but I wanted
 

661
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,110
doing wrong you let me know but I wanted
to check out what happens when you go

662
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:58,120
to check out what happens when you go
 

663
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,390
to check out what happens when you go
through lava and water as well so let's

664
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:00,400
through lava and water as well so let's
 

665
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,270
through lava and water as well so let's
let's see this and then drink a fire

666
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:03,280
let's see this and then drink a fire
 

667
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:12,150
let's see this and then drink a fire
resistant potion to stop you um-hmm yeah

668
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160
resistant potion to stop you um-hmm yeah
 

669
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,800
resistant potion to stop you um-hmm yeah
it slows you down okay then you got to

670
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:13,810
it slows you down okay then you got to
 

671
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,710
it slows you down okay then you got to
do the freefall again so it's like like

672
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
do the freefall again so it's like like
 

673
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,360
do the freefall again so it's like like
you're starting over I believe yeah

674
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:21,370
you're starting over I believe yeah
 

675
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,490
you're starting over I believe yeah
really slows you down you seem to keep

676
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:23,500
really slows you down you seem to keep
 

677
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,650
really slows you down you seem to keep
some horizontal momentum so it's not

678
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:25,660
some horizontal momentum so it's not
 

679
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,740
some horizontal momentum so it's not
terrible but it does slow you down quite

680
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:28,750
terrible but it does slow you down quite
 

681
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,650
terrible but it does slow you down quite
a bit

682
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:30,660
a bit
 

683
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,160
a bit
mmm project ice runway doesn't seem to

684
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,170
mmm project ice runway doesn't seem to
 

685
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,640

work either the idea was that if you use

686
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:38,650
work either the idea was that if you use
 

687
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,010
work either the idea was that if you use
ice you might keep some of your

688
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,020
ice you might keep some of your
 

689
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,510
ice you might keep some of your
horizontal momentum so even if you land

690
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:42,520
horizontal momentum so even if you land
 

691
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,130
horizontal momentum so even if you land
it doesn't slow you down too much but I

692
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:47,140
it doesn't slow you down too much but I
 

693
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,190
it doesn't slow you down too much but I
keep getting stuck on the slime box and

694
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:50,200
keep getting stuck on the slime box and
 

695
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,840
keep getting stuck on the slime box and
I'm not sure what the deal is with that

696
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:53,850
I'm not sure what the deal is with that
 

697
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,720
I'm not sure what the deal is with that
and you'll get rid of all the delay see

698
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:57,730
and you'll get rid of all the delay see
 

699
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:07,980
and you'll get rid of all the delay see
if that does anything and now I can't

700
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:07,990
if that does anything and now I can't
 

701
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:12,600
if that does anything and now I can't

exploded and I don't know where that
 

739
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:05,430
exploded and I don't know where that
came from

740

don't work currently they'll probably

748
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:23,470
don't work currently they'll probably
 

749
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,379
don't work currently they'll probably
come out soon but in survival all you

750
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:25,389
come out soon but in survival all you
 

751
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:30,470
come out soon but in survival all you
can do with the the 41b is oak ya 41b

752
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
can do with the the 41b is oak ya 41b
 

753

can do with the the 41b is oak ya 41b
uh-huh anyways let's try these out I

754
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:33,580
uh-huh anyways let's try these out I
 

755
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,879
uh-huh anyways let's try these out I
have not wrote in them once yet so this

756
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:35,889
have not wrote in them once yet so this
 

757
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:39,180
have not wrote in them once yet so this
is my first time since the change let's

758
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,190
is my first time since the change let's
 

759
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,850
is my first time since the change let's
see how it how it works I know whoa why

760
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:41,860
see how it how it works I know whoa why
 

761
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:47,210
see how it how it works I know whoa why
am I going did I play some backwards

762
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:47,220
am I going did I play some backwards
 

763
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,759
am I going did I play some backwards
okay turn it around so you press a and D

764
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:50,769
okay turn it around so you press a and D
 

765
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:54,330
okay turn it around so you press a and D
now a this will happen when I press a

766
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:54,340
now a this will happen when I press a
 

767
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,639
now a this will happen when I press a
this is what happens when I press T so

768
00:19:56,639 --> 00:19:56,649
this is what happens when I press T so
 

769
00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:59,580
this is what happens when I press T so
it controls one paddle at a time let's

770
00:19:59,580 --> 00:19:59,590
it controls one paddle at a time let's
 

771
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:03,299
it controls one paddle at a time let's
go into this view I guess and there

772
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:03,309
go into this view I guess and there
 

773
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,460
go into this view I guess and there
seems to be a limit to how fast you can

774
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:05,470
seems to be a limit to how fast you can
 

775
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,249
seems to be a limit to how fast you can
press into if you hold both together oh

776
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:08,259
press into if you hold both together oh
 

777
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:11,159
press into if you hold both together oh
you can pick up entities too yeah that's

778
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:11,169
you can pick up entities too yeah that's
 

779
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:15,450
you can pick up entities too yeah that's
awesome oh it is a little bit confusing

780
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:15,460
awesome oh it is a little bit confusing
 

781
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,310
awesome oh it is a little bit confusing
because I want to go right when I press

782
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:17,320
because I want to go right when I press
 

783
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,440
because I want to go right when I press
D and that makes me go left ah I don't

784
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,450
D and that makes me go left ah I don't
 

785
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,999
D and that makes me go left ah I don't
think a little while to get used to but

786
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:24,009
think a little while to get used to but
 

787
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:26,610
think a little while to get used to but
you can just hold them down a and D

788
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:26,620
you can just hold them down a and D
 

789
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,850
you can just hold them down a and D
together and then you go straight look

790
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:29,860
together and then you go straight look
 

791
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,580
together and then you go straight look
around a zero as you're rowing it's kind

792
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:32,590
around a zero as you're rowing it's kind
 

793
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,009
around a zero as you're rowing it's kind
of nice the boat is very slow right now

794
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:35,019
of nice the boat is very slow right now
 

795
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:37,200
of nice the boat is very slow right now
but I'm guessing they're going to change

796
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,210
but I'm guessing they're going to change
 

797
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,760
but I'm guessing they're going to change
that because I saw so

798
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:38,770
that because I saw so
 

799
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,260
that because I saw so
complaints I can't imagine they will

800
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,270
complaints I can't imagine they will
 

801
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,080
complaints I can't imagine they will
leave it like this because yet is even

802
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,090
leave it like this because yet is even
 

803
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,370
leave it like this because yet is even
slower than I expected someone said

804
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:50,380
slower than I expected someone said
 

805
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,650
slower than I expected someone said
though that they they go the same speed

806
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:52,660
though that they they go the same speed
 

807
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,340
though that they they go the same speed
maybe I'm just not let's play around

808
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:56,350
maybe I'm just not let's play around
 

809
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,080
maybe I'm just not let's play around
with the timing of the paddles maybe

810
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,090
with the timing of the paddles maybe
 

811
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,070
with the timing of the paddles maybe
there is a trick to it oh man whoa you

812
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,080
there is a trick to it oh man whoa you
 

813
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,520
there is a trick to it oh man whoa you
can turn pretty fast okay here we go

814
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:07,530

 

815
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,070

and actually pressing the button

816
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
and actually pressing the button
 

817
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,940
and actually pressing the button
together I think it's the same speed

818
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:13,950
together I think it's the same speed
 

819
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:19,320
together I think it's the same speed
right I'll try a few different speeds

820
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:19,330
right I'll try a few different speeds
 

821
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,550
right I'll try a few different speeds
you can probably hear me press some

822
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:20,560
you can probably hear me press some
 

823
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,070
you can probably hear me press some
button through the mic slower slower

824
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,080
button through the mic slower slower
 

825
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,990
button through the mic slower slower
maybe now slower makes a girl slower

826
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
maybe now slower makes a girl slower
 

827
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,270
maybe now slower makes a girl slower
there's they did in a good way though

828
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280
there's they did in a good way though
 

829
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,190
there's they did in a good way though
where you don't just spam like the

830
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,200
where you don't just spam like the
 

831
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,870
where you don't just spam like the
faster you spam the faster you go

832
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
faster you spam the faster you go
 

833
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,280
faster you spam the faster you go
because that would be really annoying

834
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,290
because that would be really annoying
 

835
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,230
because that would be really annoying
there's there's a limit to how fast you

836
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
there's there's a limit to how fast you
 

837
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,140
there's there's a limit to how fast you
can press it it's more important that

838
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,150
can press it it's more important that
 

839
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,860
can press it it's more important that
you're consistent but it's also nice you

840
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:46,870
you're consistent but it's also nice you
 

841
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,870
you're consistent but it's also nice you
just hold it down and go I don't know if

842
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880
just hold it down and go I don't know if
 

843
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,470
just hold it down and go I don't know if
that's the fastest you can go with it

844
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:51,480
that's the fastest you can go with it
 

845
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,440
that's the fastest you can go with it
but I can't get it any quicker really

846
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:57,450

 

847
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,710

uh-huh okay let's try to maneuver the

848
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:01,720
uh-huh okay let's try to maneuver the
 

849
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,220
uh-huh okay let's try to maneuver the
river see if that's possible it seems

850
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,230
river see if that's possible it seems
 

851
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,370
river see if that's possible it seems
like once I start turning I lose all my

852
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:08,380
like once I start turning I lose all my
 

853
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,410
like once I start turning I lose all my
momentum though just kind of bad like I

854
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:13,420
momentum though just kind of bad like I
 

855
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,660
momentum though just kind of bad like I
would like to just gradually turn here

856
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:15,670
would like to just gradually turn here
 

857
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:20,340
would like to just gradually turn here
while still going fast but I can't yeah

858
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:20,350
while still going fast but I can't yeah
 

859
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:26,790
while still going fast but I can't yeah
that's an issue very easy to control

860
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:26,800
that's an issue very easy to control
 

861
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,550
that's an issue very easy to control
right now though because it's so slow

862
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:28,560
right now though because it's so slow
 

863
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,840
right now though because it's so slow
but I'm sure they're gonna they're going

864
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:30,850
but I'm sure they're gonna they're going
 

865
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,780
but I'm sure they're gonna they're going
to buff up the speed and make it a

866
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:33,790
to buff up the speed and make it a
 

867
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,550
to buff up the speed and make it a
little bit tighter controls it's a it's

868
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:35,560
little bit tighter controls it's a it's
 

869
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:40,290
little bit tighter controls it's a it's
a cool change oh I like that just needs

870
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:40,300
a cool change oh I like that just needs
 

871
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,200
a cool change oh I like that just needs
a little bit more improvement so if we

872
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,210
a little bit more improvement so if we
 

873
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,000
a little bit more improvement so if we
got an entity in the boat how do we get

874
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,010
got an entity in the boat how do we get
 

875
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,080
got an entity in the boat how do we get
rid of them if we hold shift I I get out

876
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,090
rid of them if we hold shift I I get out
 

877
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,760
rid of them if we hold shift I I get out
okay I have to actually break it

878
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:51,770
okay I have to actually break it
 

879
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,610
okay I have to actually break it
can I break it oh yeah that got him out

880
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:55,620
can I break it oh yeah that got him out
 

881
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,450
can I break it oh yeah that got him out
okay so you're pretty much always going

882
00:22:59,450 --> 00:22:59,460
okay so you're pretty much always going
 

883
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,870
okay so you're pretty much always going
to have a squid with you it seems

884
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:01,880
to have a squid with you it seems
 

885
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,100
to have a squid with you it seems
because they like to hang out on the

886
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,110
because they like to hang out on the
 

887
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,600
because they like to hang out on the
surface unless you get a chicken

888
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:05,610
surface unless you get a chicken
 

889
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:12,100
surface unless you get a chicken
come on chicken gonna get you ah ha oh

890
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,110
come on chicken gonna get you ah ha oh
 

891
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,570
come on chicken gonna get you ah ha oh
and they they get in your way too now

892
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:14,580
and they they get in your way too now
 

893
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,390
and they they get in your way too now
that's crazy okay so as far as I know

894
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:17,400
that's crazy okay so as far as I know
 

895
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
that's crazy okay so as far as I know
there's no way to break the boats by

896
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,410
there's no way to break the boats by
 

897
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:25,910
there's no way to break the boats by
ramming it to the side of the hill yeah

898
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:25,920
ramming it to the side of the hill yeah
 

899
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,270
ramming it to the side of the hill yeah
didn't break good what if we shoot it is

900
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,280
didn't break good what if we shoot it is
 

901
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,750
didn't break good what if we shoot it is
it like minecarts and stuff I imagine it

902
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:32,760
it like minecarts and stuff I imagine it
 

903
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,010
it like minecarts and stuff I imagine it
still is let's go to game mode one get

904
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:37,020
still is let's go to game mode one get
 

905
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:42,140
still is let's go to game mode one get
our bow let's try shoot the chicken

906
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,150
our bow let's try shoot the chicken
 

907
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,680
our bow let's try shoot the chicken
first

908
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:42,690
first
 

909
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:49,730
first
now you can yeah one shot broke it

910
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:49,740

 

911
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:58,810

yep they don't break it's wonderful

912
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:58,820

 

913
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,250

alright everyone so we're gonna wrap up

914
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:01,260
alright everyone so we're gonna wrap up
 

915
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,250
alright everyone so we're gonna wrap up
our episode here for today had some some

916
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:04,260
our episode here for today had some some
 

917
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,840
our episode here for today had some some
good fun with the gliders I didn't want

918
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:05,850
good fun with the gliders I didn't want
 

919
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,710
good fun with the gliders I didn't want
to stop I I did that stupid run like a

920
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:09,720
to stop I I did that stupid run like a
 

921
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,549
to stop I I did that stupid run like a
hundred times at least I just want to

922
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:13,559
hundred times at least I just want to
 

923
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,750
hundred times at least I just want to
keep playing with it and see what else

924
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:14,760
keep playing with it and see what else
 

925
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,700
keep playing with it and see what else
is possible because there's so there's

926
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:16,710
is possible because there's so there's
 

927
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,740
is possible because there's so there's
so many ideas and and just fun things

928
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:18,750
so many ideas and and just fun things
 

929
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,350
so many ideas and and just fun things
you can do not necessarily practical

930
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,360
you can do not necessarily practical
 

931
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,500
you can do not necessarily practical
things just a lot of fun goofy things

932
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:23,510
things just a lot of fun goofy things
 

933
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,659
things just a lot of fun goofy things
you can do with the colliders anyways

934
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:26,669
you can do with the colliders anyways
 

935
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:28,880
you can do with the colliders anyways
we'll hopefully be able to play around

936
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:28,890
we'll hopefully be able to play around
 

937
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,470
we'll hopefully be able to play around
with them in our world to your next

938
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:30,480
with them in our world to your next
 

939
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,500
with them in our world to your next
episode if they fix that portal bug

940
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:33,510
episode if they fix that portal bug
 

941
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,409
episode if they fix that portal bug
which I'm sure they will and then we can

942
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:36,419
which I'm sure they will and then we can
 

943
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,139
which I'm sure they will and then we can
start setting up some cool stuff here

944
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:38,149
start setting up some cool stuff here
 

945
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:40,880
start setting up some cool stuff here
but anyways here is the comment for

946
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:40,890
but anyways here is the comment for
 

947
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,490
but anyways here is the comment for
