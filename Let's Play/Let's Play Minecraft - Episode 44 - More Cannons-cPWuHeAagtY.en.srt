this is etho and this is another
exciting episode of is minecraft I'm

00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:11,960
exciting episode of is minecraft I'm
 

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,849
exciting episode of is minecraft I'm
just on the roof here and I've noticed

8
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:18,859
just on the roof here and I've noticed
 

9
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:26,099
just on the roof here and I've noticed
there is a ton of mobs on the island and

10
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:26,109
there is a ton of mobs on the island and
 

11
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,200
there is a ton of mobs on the island and
that's kind of a side effect of lighting

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,210
that's kind of a side effect of lighting
 

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,220
that's kind of a side effect of lighting
up tunnels in the area since I can't to

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:32,230
up tunnels in the area since I can't to
 

15
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,740
up tunnels in the area since I can't to
spawn in tunnels and I don't have

16
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:35,750
spawn in tunnels and I don't have
 

17
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,810
spawn in tunnels and I don't have
torches all over the island they spawn

18
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:39,820
torches all over the island they spawn
 

19
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:46,860
torches all over the island they spawn
very frequently on the island now and

20
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:46,870
very frequently on the island now and
 

21
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,790
very frequently on the island now and
they're spotting on top of my roof

22
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
they're spotting on top of my roof
 

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:58,270
they're spotting on top of my roof
sometimes which I don't like that's

24
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:58,280
sometimes which I don't like that's
 

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,250
sometimes which I don't like that's
better okay so I figured out the

26
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:03,260
better okay so I figured out the
 

27
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,850
better okay so I figured out the
lighting I'm going to turn around and

28
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:06,860
lighting I'm going to turn around and
 

29
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:13,920
lighting I'm going to turn around and
you're going to see what I did

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:13,930

 

31
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,140

no more torches Oh actually one sec I

32
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,150
no more torches Oh actually one sec I
 

33
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,880
no more torches Oh actually one sec I
forgot to check a name okay so this was

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:23,890
forgot to check a name okay so this was
 

35
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,750
forgot to check a name okay so this was
an idea suggested to me by CX gamer

36
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:29,760

 

37
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,210

originally I was going to raise the

38
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:33,220
originally I was going to raise the
 

39
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,420
originally I was going to raise the
track one block I tried that it looked

40
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:36,430
track one block I tried that it looked
 

41
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,530
track one block I tried that it looked
terrible let's stuck out way too much

42
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:39,540
terrible let's stuck out way too much
 

43
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,420
terrible let's stuck out way too much
another option would be to lower it but

44
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:42,430
another option would be to lower it but
 

45
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,890
another option would be to lower it but
I don't think that would be the best

46
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:43,900
I don't think that would be the best
 

47
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:51,060
I don't think that would be the best
either so it's a level and there's these

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,070
either so it's a level and there's these
 

49
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,490
either so it's a level and there's these
little cutouts on the side of the track

50
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:53,500
little cutouts on the side of the track
 

51
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,820
little cutouts on the side of the track
which is where the stairs are and

52
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:55,830
which is where the stairs are and
 

53
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,010
which is where the stairs are and
underneath the stairs our torches which

54
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,020
underneath the stairs our torches which
 

55
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,530
underneath the stairs our torches which
light up the storage room very nicely

56
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:03,540
light up the storage room very nicely
 

57
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,810
light up the storage room very nicely
and it kind of highlights the track and

58
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:06,820
and it kind of highlights the track and
 

59
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,670
and it kind of highlights the track and
you still have a half-block wood

60
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
you still have a half-block wood
 

61
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,060
you still have a half-block wood
highlights around the chests and stuff

62
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,070
highlights around the chests and stuff
 

63
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,140
highlights around the chests and stuff
so it looks good

64
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,150
so it looks good
 

65
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,650
so it looks good
I think same with over here at the

66
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:19,660
I think same with over here at the
 

67
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,610
I think same with over here at the
sandstone so it's a pretty good idea I

68
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:23,620
sandstone so it's a pretty good idea I
 

69
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,920
sandstone so it's a pretty good idea I
think I didn't do the pot lights they

70
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:28,930
think I didn't do the pot lights they
 

71
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,080
think I didn't do the pot lights they
were another good suggestion I did add a

72
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,090
were another good suggestion I did add a
 

73
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,020
were another good suggestion I did add a
few around the place so like I got some

74
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,030
few around the place so like I got some
 

75
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,670
few around the place so like I got some
here just for a variety I might to fill

76
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:38,680
here just for a variety I might to fill
 

77
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,910
here just for a variety I might to fill
it with lava I'm going to create a

78
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
it with lava I'm going to create a
 

79
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,130
it with lava I'm going to create a
backup before I do that first and I've

80
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,140
backup before I do that first and I've
 

81
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,100
backup before I do that first and I've
been working on this a little bit just

82
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,110
been working on this a little bit just
 

83
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:57,780
been working on this a little bit just
now got a lot to do on it

84
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:57,790
now got a lot to do on it
 

85
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,289
now got a lot to do on it
I had the front nicely curved but this

86
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:01,299
I had the front nicely curved but this
 

87
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:03,330
I had the front nicely curved but this
back part isn't curved nearly as much so

88
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:03,340
back part isn't curved nearly as much so
 

89
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,660
back part isn't curved nearly as much so
I'm going to have to probably make this

90
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:06,670
I'm going to have to probably make this
 

91
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,090
I'm going to have to probably make this
front curved a lot less so it bounces

92
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:09,100
front curved a lot less so it bounces
 

93
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,000
front curved a lot less so it bounces
out a little better

94
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,010
out a little better
 

95
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,870
out a little better
this is my new furnace room I might try

96
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:15,880
this is my new furnace room I might try
 

97
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,060
this is my new furnace room I might try
to move the furnaces like embed them one

98
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,070
to move the furnaces like embed them one
 

99
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,910
to move the furnaces like embed them one
block so they look better or something

100
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
block so they look better or something
 

101
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,710
block so they look better or something
and of course I'm going to add texture

102
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:25,720
and of course I'm going to add texture
 

103
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,720
and of course I'm going to add texture
different block types

104
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:27,730
different block types
 

105
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,720
different block types
instead of just solid wood so I think

106
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:30,730
instead of just solid wood so I think
 

107
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,229
instead of just solid wood so I think
that's a I don't think I'm a very good

108
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
that's a I don't think I'm a very good
 

109
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,539
that's a I don't think I'm a very good
builder in this game I think of myself

110
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:36,549
builder in this game I think of myself
 

111
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,610
builder in this game I think of myself
more as a inventor and a guy that likes

112
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:40,620
more as a inventor and a guy that likes
 

113
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,300
more as a inventor and a guy that likes
mechanisms and stuff

114
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,310
mechanisms and stuff
 

115
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:49,039
mechanisms and stuff
I think basic trick to building is to

116
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,049

 

117
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,780

have a variety of different blocks that

118
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:51,790
have a variety of different blocks that
 

119
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,449
have a variety of different blocks that
look good together instead of having

120
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:54,459
look good together instead of having
 

121
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:56,910
look good together instead of having
like solid wood in this whole storage

122
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:56,920
like solid wood in this whole storage
 

123
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,490
like solid wood in this whole storage
room kind of mix and stone in and and

124
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:01,500
room kind of mix and stone in and and
 

125
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,580
room kind of mix and stone in and and
tree bark look and stuff like that just

126
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:05,590
tree bark look and stuff like that just
 

127
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,520
tree bark look and stuff like that just
to add a lot of variety and I think it

128
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:08,530
to add a lot of variety and I think it
 

129
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,809
to add a lot of variety and I think it
looks good and of course don't build

130
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:12,819
looks good and of course don't build
 

131
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,089
looks good and of course don't build
stuff square kind of try to curve it if

132
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:15,099
stuff square kind of try to curve it if
 

133
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,569
stuff square kind of try to curve it if
you can or you know make a variety of

134
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:18,579
you can or you know make a variety of
 

135
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,710
you can or you know make a variety of
different shapes so it's more

136
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:19,720
different shapes so it's more
 

137
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:28,050
different shapes so it's more
interesting stuff like that I think it

138
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,060
interesting stuff like that I think it
 

139
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,490
interesting stuff like that I think it
helps and you know other things too like

140
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:31,500
helps and you know other things too like
 

141
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,010
helps and you know other things too like
before I just had to to live indoors

142
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,020
before I just had to to live indoors
 

143
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,110
before I just had to to live indoors
here nothing so special about that now I

144
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
here nothing so special about that now I
 

145
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,650
here nothing so special about that now I
got water controlled doors that are

146
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:46,660
got water controlled doors that are
 

147
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,070
got water controlled doors that are
synced together it's a lot more

148
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
synced together it's a lot more
 

149
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,950
synced together it's a lot more
interesting than just having double

150
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
interesting than just having double
 

151
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,010
interesting than just having double
wooden doors like every that you've seen

152
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,020
wooden doors like every that you've seen
 

153
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:06,270
wooden doors like every that you've seen
a million times but yeah expert I wanted

154
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:06,280
a million times but yeah expert I wanted
 

155
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,270
a million times but yeah expert I wanted
to check if our squid buddies have a

156
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
to check if our squid buddies have a
 

157
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,830
to check if our squid buddies have a
chicken while he is alright we got a new

158
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:16,840
chicken while he is alright we got a new

pet
hahaha

162
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720

 

163
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,960

okay we should stop goofing around we're

164
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:25,970

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:01,180
do is make sure the wire goes to all of
 

329
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,269
do is make sure the wire goes to all of
the T and T will be one here here here

330
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:06,279
the T and T will be one here here here
 

331
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,650
the T and T will be one here here here
and here

332
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:07,660
and here
 

333
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:13,710
and here
and then the repeaters delay the time

334
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:13,720
and then the repeaters delay the time
 

335
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,939
and then the repeaters delay the time
from the boosters to the projectile and

336
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:19,949

 

337
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:22,470

this wire sends the signal through this

338
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
this wire sends the signal through this
 

339
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:30,230
this wire sends the signal through this
block here to the T and T inside and

340
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
block here to the T and T inside and
 

341
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,800
block here to the T and T inside and
then what I do or have been doing is I

342
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:34,810
then what I do or have been doing is I
 

343
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:40,230
then what I do or have been doing is I
dig a hole down here and then another

344
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
dig a hole down here and then another
 

345
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,220
dig a hole down here and then another
one over here

346
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,230

 

347
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:52,519

this is to set up the display type thing

348
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:52,529
this is to set up the display type thing
 

349
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:58,439
this is to set up the display type thing
place a block one down from there don't

350
00:15:58,439 --> 00:15:58,449
place a block one down from there don't
 

351
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:06,620
place a block one down from there don't
dupe straight down

352
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:06,630

 

353
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,829

and this should connect to my tunnels

354
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
and this should connect to my tunnels
 

355
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:21,259
and this should connect to my tunnels
that I've set up yep and then I have the

356
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:21,269
that I've set up yep and then I have the
 

357
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:23,150
that I've set up yep and then I have the
redstone torch on the block I just

358
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,160
redstone torch on the block I just
 

359
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:34,819
redstone torch on the block I just
placed here and if we go above if we can

360
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:34,829
placed here and if we go above if we can
 

361
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:38,059
placed here and if we go above if we can
go above you'll see this wires all lit

362
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:38,069
go above you'll see this wires all lit
 

363
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:40,400
go above you'll see this wires all lit
up now that's because it's a redstone

364
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,410
up now that's because it's a redstone
 

365
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,059
up now that's because it's a redstone
torch is underneath this block here so

366
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:43,069
torch is underneath this block here so
 

367
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:46,670
torch is underneath this block here so
you can attach anywhere on this wire

368
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:46,680
you can attach anywhere on this wire
 

369
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,189
you can attach anywhere on this wire
before it's connected to these repeaters

370
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
before it's connected to these repeaters
 

371
00:16:49,199 --> 00:17:04,149
before it's connected to these repeaters
here and then I cover this up oops

372
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:04,159

 

373
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:07,159

and you would place another torch here

374
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:07,169
and you would place another torch here
 

375
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:14,919
and you would place another torch here
for the vertical wiring like that

376
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:14,929

 

377
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:19,699

Bradshaw flyer place one or two

378
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:19,709
Bradshaw flyer place one or two
 

379
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:24,919
Bradshaw flyer place one or two
repeaters wire wire there now it's

380
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:24,929
repeaters wire wire there now it's
 

381
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:29,899
repeaters wire wire there now it's
hooked up to the system so that's pretty

382
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:29,909
hooked up to the system so that's pretty
 

383
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:34,909
hooked up to the system so that's pretty
simple so one other thing I wanted to

384
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:34,919
simple so one other thing I wanted to
 

385
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:41,380
simple so one other thing I wanted to
try here I had this idea to put lava in

386
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:41,390
try here I had this idea to put lava in
 

387
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:46,310
try here I had this idea to put lava in
the center and someone else sent me this

388
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
the center and someone else sent me this
 

389
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,010
the center and someone else sent me this
idea - we're going to try it on cannon

390
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,020
idea - we're going to try it on cannon
 

391
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,340
idea - we're going to try it on cannon
that won't burn down let's go to the

392
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:55,350
that won't burn down let's go to the
 

393
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:07,140
that won't burn down let's go to the
obsidian one I have the most faith in it

394
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,150

 

395
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:18,400

put the ladder right here oops oops and

396
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,410
put the ladder right here oops oops and
 

397
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,830
put the ladder right here oops oops and
I'm curious if we place T and T if it's

398
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:20,840
I'm curious if we place T and T if it's
 

399
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:33,910
I'm curious if we place T and T if it's
going to go boom even if it explodes in

400
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:33,920
going to go boom even if it explodes in
 

401
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,860
going to go boom even if it explodes in
there since it's in lava

402
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:35,870
there since it's in lava
 

403
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:44,470
there since it's in lava
it won't do any damage it seems to be

404
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
it won't do any damage it seems to be
 

405
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,990
it won't do any damage it seems to be
okay low so this is another way that we

406
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
okay low so this is another way that we
 

407
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,169
okay low so this is another way that we
can achieve the flaming TNT like we had

408
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:53,179
can achieve the flaming TNT like we had
 

409
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:58,750
can achieve the flaming TNT like we had
with za Benji dose cannon except it

410
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:58,760
with za Benji dose cannon except it
 

411
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,200
with za Benji dose cannon except it
might burn down the wool cannons in the

412
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,210
might burn down the wool cannons in the
 

413
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,980
might burn down the wool cannons in the
wood ones so I might not make them all

414
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:05,990
wood ones so I might not make them all
 

415
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:13,560
wood ones so I might not make them all
like that

416
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:13,570

 

417
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:37,350

but it seems to be working okay I think

418
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
but it seems to be working okay I think
 

419
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,280
but it seems to be working okay I think
that's all I wanted to do here I'm going

420
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,290
that's all I wanted to do here I'm going
 

421
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:46,350
that's all I wanted to do here I'm going
to check the time well I guess we're 20

422
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:46,360
to check the time well I guess we're 20
 

423
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,660
to check the time well I guess we're 20
minutes in or so so time to end it here

424
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:51,670
minutes in or so so time to end it here
 

425
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:57,030
minutes in or so so time to end it here
I guess next episode I'm going to give
