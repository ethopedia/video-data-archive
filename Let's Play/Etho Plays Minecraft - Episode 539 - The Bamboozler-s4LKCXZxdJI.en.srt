00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,580
unlimited sticks cuz you can craft
bamboo into sticks as well and it's just

166
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:44,590
bamboo into sticks as well and it's just
 

167
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,220
bamboo into sticks as well and it's just
really nice and easy right so I thought

168
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,230
really nice and easy right so I thought
 

169
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,630
really nice and easy right so I thought
we would try build like something

170
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
we would try build like something
 

171
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,600
we would try build like something
similar to that like an easy farm to set

172
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:51,610
similar to that like an easy farm to set
 

173
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,010
similar to that like an easy farm to set
up it's not too big it grows quickly and

174
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,020
up it's not too big it grows quickly and
 

175
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,380
up it's not too big it grows quickly and
all that kind of stuff so you can set up

176
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:58,390
all that kind of stuff so you can set up
 

177
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,180
all that kind of stuff so you can set up
big fields of bamboo but I think that's

178
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:00,190
big fields of bamboo but I think that's
 

179
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,490
big fields of bamboo but I think that's
what those people don't like doing so

180
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:02,500
what those people don't like doing so
 

181
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,020
what those people don't like doing so
instead we're gonna make a bone meal

182
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,030
instead we're gonna make a bone meal
 

183
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,360
instead we're gonna make a bone meal
farm the major downside of this farm

184
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,370
farm the major downside of this farm
 

185
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,220
farm the major downside of this farm
though of course is it requires bone

186
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:08,230
though of course is it requires bone
 

187
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,750
though of course is it requires bone
meal but if you have bone meal this is

188
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
meal but if you have bone meal this is
 

189
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,220
meal but if you have bone meal this is
gonna be probably one of the best bamboo

190
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,230
gonna be probably one of the best bamboo
 

191
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,740
gonna be probably one of the best bamboo
farms you can build we can automatically

192
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:13,750
farms you can build we can automatically
 

193
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,690
farms you can build we can automatically
grow bamboo using a bone meal and a

194
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:15,700
grow bamboo using a bone meal and a
 

195
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,220
grow bamboo using a bone meal and a
dispenser and then triggering it with

196
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,230
dispenser and then triggering it with
 

197
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,840
dispenser and then triggering it with
redstone which is what we're gonna be

198
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:18,850
redstone which is what we're gonna be
 

199
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,000
redstone which is what we're gonna be
doing in our farm and the nice thing is

200
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,010
doing in our farm and the nice thing is
 

201
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,980
doing in our farm and the nice thing is
if it reaches max site and you trigger

202
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:22,990
if it reaches max site and you trigger
 

203
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,680
if it reaches max site and you trigger
it beyond that it doesn't waste it let's

204
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:25,690
it beyond that it doesn't waste it let's
 

205
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,660
it beyond that it doesn't waste it let's
get started so I got a begin set up over

206
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:27,670
get started so I got a begin set up over
 

207
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,310
get started so I got a begin set up over
here for speed mining we're gonna be

208
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:29,320
here for speed mining we're gonna be
 

209
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,740
here for speed mining we're gonna be
building this near our super smelter so

210
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:31,750
building this near our super smelter so
 

211
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,070
building this near our super smelter so
you can hook it up to our fuel and I'm

212
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,080
you can hook it up to our fuel and I'm
 

213
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,690
you can hook it up to our fuel and I'm
gonna put it underground actually we're

214
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:36,700
gonna put it underground actually we're
 

215
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,670
gonna put it underground actually we're
gonna dig down 16 blocks here hole is

216
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
gonna dig down 16 blocks here hole is
 

217
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,220
gonna dig down 16 blocks here hole is
dug and we already here so let's get to

218
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:44,230
dug and we already here so let's get to
 

219
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,400
dug and we already here so let's get to
it

220
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,410
it
 

221
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,000
it
now I actually designed this farm for

222
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,010
now I actually designed this farm for
 

223
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,830
now I actually designed this farm for
1.50 I'm hoping it still works at 1.60

224
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
1.50 I'm hoping it still works at 1.60
 

225
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,100
1.50 I'm hoping it still works at 1.60
we'll find out as we do it here

226
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,110
we'll find out as we do it here
 

227
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,460
we'll find out as we do it here
we need a seven by four area so two four

228
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:56,470
we need a seven by four area so two four
 

229
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,430
we need a seven by four area so two four
six seven I always count by twos

230
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
six seven I always count by twos
 

231
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,730
six seven I always count by twos
except here I challenge my horse seven

232
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:02,740
except here I challenge my horse seven
 

233
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,590
except here I challenge my horse seven
by four I think the bamboo needs to go

234
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:04,600
by four I think the bamboo needs to go
 

235
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,360
by four I think the bamboo needs to go
right here yeah bamboo go there we gotta

236
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,370
right here yeah bamboo go there we gotta
 

237
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,950
right here yeah bamboo go there we gotta
get some dispensers

238
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:11,960
get some dispensers
 

239
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,629
get some dispensers
probably got a mommy yeah that's so it

240
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:13,639
probably got a mommy yeah that's so it
 

241
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,240
probably got a mommy yeah that's so it
always happens that confuses me more

242
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,250
always happens that confuses me more
 

243
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,879
always happens that confuses me more
than anything and we're gonna set up six

244
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:18,889
than anything and we're gonna set up six
 

245
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:21,070
than anything and we're gonna set up six
dispensers around this and now we go

246
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,080
dispensers around this and now we go
 

247
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,900
dispensers around this and now we go
crazy with the hoppers so hopper here

248
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:22,910
crazy with the hoppers so hopper here
 

249
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,879
crazy with the hoppers so hopper here
hopper there hopper there hopper dere

250
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:24,889
hopper there hopper there hopper dere
 

251
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,670
hopper there hopper there hopper dere
opera here hopper here hopper there

00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
opera here hopper here hopper there
 

253
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,770
opera here hopper here hopper there
hopper there hopper here hopper here we

254
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:29,780
hopper there hopper here hopper here we
 

255
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,360
hopper there hopper here hopper here we
only really need one hopper running into

256
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,370
only really need one hopper running into
 

257
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,310
only really need one hopper running into
each of these dispensers but for some of

258
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:33,320
each of these dispensers but for some of
 

259
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,990
each of these dispensers but for some of
them were running too just so that the

260
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,000
them were running too just so that the
 

261
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,610
them were running too just so that the
bow meal feeds into them at the same

262
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:36,620
bow meal feeds into them at the same
 

263
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,890
bow meal feeds into them at the same
rate it gets used up that way we can run

264
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:38,900
rate it gets used up that way we can run
 

265
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,860
rate it gets used up that way we can run
the farm for longer if we want to then

266
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:41,870
the farm for longer if we want to then
 

267
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,510
the farm for longer if we want to then
we're gonna stop those barrels full of

268
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
we're gonna stop those barrels full of
 

269
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,779
we're gonna stop those barrels full of
bow meal and we're gonna have hoppers

270
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:46,789
bow meal and we're gonna have hoppers
 

271
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:48,610
bow meal and we're gonna have hoppers
running into all these in a nice line

272
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:48,620
running into all these in a nice line
 

273
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,010
running into all these in a nice line
our rails on top of the five hoppers

274
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,020
our rails on top of the five hoppers
 

275
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,680
our rails on top of the five hoppers
here we power it's over here and then we

276
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:53,690
here we power it's over here and then we
 

277
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,420
here we power it's over here and then we
have a copper mine cart that bounces

278
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:55,430
have a copper mine cart that bounces
 

279
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,050
have a copper mine cart that bounces
back and forth picking up I not items

280
00:05:59,050 --> 00:05:59,060
back and forth picking up I not items
 

281
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,700
back and forth picking up I not items
bow meal out of this double chest up

282
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:00,710
bow meal out of this double chest up
 

283
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,860
bow meal out of this double chest up
here and that goes to all five of these

284
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:02,870
here and that goes to all five of these
 

285
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,469
here and that goes to all five of these
barrels then and down into the

286
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:05,479
barrels then and down into the
 

287
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:10,029
barrels then and down into the
dispensers for the Redstone we're gonna

288
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:10,039
dispensers for the Redstone we're gonna
 

289
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,860
dispensers for the Redstone we're gonna
run two dispensers like this for right

290
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:11,870
run two dispensers like this for right
 

291
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,390
run two dispensers like this for right
now but we might need to come back and

292
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:13,400
now but we might need to come back and
 

293
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,520
now but we might need to come back and
adjust that just depends on how the farm

294
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:15,530
adjust that just depends on how the farm
 

295
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,550
adjust that just depends on how the farm
runs here and those dispensers are being

296
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
runs here and those dispensers are being
 

297
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,879
runs here and those dispensers are being
bud power which kind of confuses me we

298
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:21,889
bud power which kind of confuses me we
 

299
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:24,700
bud power which kind of confuses me we
get that in subtract mode run it back

300
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:24,710
get that in subtract mode run it back
 

301
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,159
get that in subtract mode run it back
like this and then we have to be careful

302
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:27,169
like this and then we have to be careful
 

303
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:29,050
like this and then we have to be careful
not to lock this hopper over here so I'm

304
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:29,060
not to lock this hopper over here so I'm
 

305
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,950
not to lock this hopper over here so I'm
gonna run redstone like this and now

306
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
gonna run redstone like this and now
 

307
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,620
gonna run redstone like this and now
that I'll run a loop to it by the way

308
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:35,630
that I'll run a loop to it by the way
 

309
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,879
that I'll run a loop to it by the way
this is something I really like about

310
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:36,889
this is something I really like about
 

311
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:39,580
this is something I really like about
the barrels in the game now unlike chess

312
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:39,590
the barrels in the game now unlike chess
 

313
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,260
the barrels in the game now unlike chess
you can actually send a redstone signal

314
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,270
you can actually send a redstone signal
 

315
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,629
you can actually send a redstone signal
through them or put redstone dust on top

316
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:43,639
through them or put redstone dust on top
 

317
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,520
through them or put redstone dust on top
of them which makes it a lot easier to

318
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:45,530
of them which makes it a lot easier to
 

319
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,200
of them which makes it a lot easier to
compact certain things like what we're

320
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,210
compact certain things like what we're
 

321
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,860
compact certain things like what we're
doing here so that's cool fifth block up

322
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:50,870
doing here so that's cool fifth block up
 

323
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,480
doing here so that's cool fifth block up
on the bamboo we're gonna put a piece of

324
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,490
on the bamboo we're gonna put a piece of
 

325
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,159
on the bamboo we're gonna put a piece of
soul sand here for a water elevator

326
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:54,169
soul sand here for a water elevator
 

327
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:56,110
soul sand here for a water elevator
we're gonna install that at the very end

328
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,120
we're gonna install that at the very end
 

329
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,460
we're gonna install that at the very end
though so we don't wash away our

330
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:57,470
though so we don't wash away our
 

331
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,890
though so we don't wash away our
redstone and then the sixth block up

332
00:06:59,890 --> 00:06:59,900
redstone and then the sixth block up
 

333
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,200
redstone and then the sixth block up
here is where we start our column of

334
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,210
here is where we start our column of
 

335
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,260
here is where we start our column of
sticky pistons we want to go up ten

336
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,270
sticky pistons we want to go up ten
 

337
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,240
sticky pistons we want to go up ten
blocks with these okay so we're almost

338
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,250
blocks with these okay so we're almost
 

339
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,560
blocks with these okay so we're almost
done with this we just have to run

340
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:08,570
done with this we just have to run
 

341
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,960
done with this we just have to run
redstone up to the column with pistons

342
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:10,970
redstone up to the column with pistons
 

343
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,170
redstone up to the column with pistons
there we do that with an observer

344
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:13,180
there we do that with an observer
 

345
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,480
there we do that with an observer
detecting when this redstone changes put

346
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:16,490
detecting when this redstone changes put
 

347
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,129
detecting when this redstone changes put
a piece of redstone dust on top of that

348
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:18,139
a piece of redstone dust on top of that
 

349
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,790
a piece of redstone dust on top of that
and then

350
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
and then
 

351
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,160
and then
run that into a block here to our first

352
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,170
run that into a block here to our first
 

353
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,690
run that into a block here to our first
piston and then we just do a staircase

354
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:25,700
piston and then we just do a staircase
 

355
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,080
piston and then we just do a staircase
up like this all the way to the top

356
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,090
up like this all the way to the top
 

357
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,580
up like this all the way to the top
listen to that music just like a zero

358
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:30,590
listen to that music just like a zero
 

359
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,520
listen to that music just like a zero
department loud and annoying cue also we

360
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:33,530
department loud and annoying cue also we
 

361
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,930
department loud and annoying cue also we
got the redstone done on this thing now

362
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:34,940
got the redstone done on this thing now
 

363
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,300
got the redstone done on this thing now
we just want to encase it in glass or

364
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,310
we just want to encase it in glass or
 

365
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,130
we just want to encase it in glass or
whatever block you want here in front of

366
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:39,140
whatever block you want here in front of
 

367
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,500
whatever block you want here in front of
all the Pistons we need a block and then

368
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:41,510
all the Pistons we need a block and then
 

369
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,600
all the Pistons we need a block and then
around the Pistons we want to surround

370
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:43,610
around the Pistons we want to surround
 

371
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,120
around the Pistons we want to surround
with blocks around the bamboo here

372
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,130
with blocks around the bamboo here
 

373
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,330
with blocks around the bamboo here
around our water elevator go to this

374
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:49,340
around our water elevator go to this
 

375
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,460
around our water elevator go to this
side as well and we got to build this to

376
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:51,470
side as well and we got to build this to
 

377
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:57,280
side as well and we got to build this to
the top then and then for the very top

378
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,290
the top then and then for the very top
 

379
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,690
the top then and then for the very top
layer here we're gonna cover over the

380
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:58,700
layer here we're gonna cover over the
 

381
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,810
layer here we're gonna cover over the
piston the bamboo and everything except

382
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:01,820
piston the bamboo and everything except
 

383
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,150
piston the bamboo and everything except
for the water elevator get our water in

384
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
for the water elevator get our water in
 

385
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,010
for the water elevator get our water in
here for the elevator and I think that's

386
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:06,020
here for the elevator and I think that's
 

387
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,590
here for the elevator and I think that's
the final step I'm gonna find out now if

388
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:08,600
the final step I'm gonna find out now if
 

389
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,370
the final step I'm gonna find out now if
I messed it up there we go all right

390
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:12,380
I messed it up there we go all right
 

391
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,930
I messed it up there we go all right
here we go this is the part that

392
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:13,940
here we go this is the part that
 

393
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,700
here we go this is the part that
actually scares me because I'm not sure

394
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:15,710
actually scares me because I'm not sure
 

395
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,130
actually scares me because I'm not sure
if it's gonna work or not um I got my

396
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:18,140
if it's gonna work or not um I got my
 

397
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,840
if it's gonna work or not um I got my
sound down I got it loaded up with bone

398
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:19,850
sound down I got it loaded up with bone
 

399
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,000
sound down I got it loaded up with bone
meal we're gonna want to have some

400
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,010
meal we're gonna want to have some
 

401
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,070
meal we're gonna want to have some
switch at the top there to turn this on

402
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
switch at the top there to turn this on
 

403
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,760
switch at the top there to turn this on
but for now do that hopefully it's

404
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:27,770
but for now do that hopefully it's
 

405
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,909
but for now do that hopefully it's
working oh it's looking good it's easy

406
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:30,919
working oh it's looking good it's easy
 

407
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:32,800
working oh it's looking good it's easy
it breaks the bamboo after it grows and

408
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:32,810
it breaks the bamboo after it grows and
 

409
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,540
it breaks the bamboo after it grows and
it goes right into the water column then

410
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:34,550
it goes right into the water column then
 

411
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,060
it goes right into the water column then
starts spewing out the top there let's

412
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,070
starts spewing out the top there let's
 

413
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,560
starts spewing out the top there let's
see how these are using up the bone meal

414
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:38,570
see how these are using up the bone meal
 

415
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,089
see how these are using up the bone meal
so that's the speed we want to see it

416
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:40,099
so that's the speed we want to see it
 

417
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:42,100
so that's the speed we want to see it
using it that means activating every

418
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,110
using it that means activating every
 

419
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,880
using it that means activating every
time that one's activating every time

420
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:44,890
time that one's activating every time
 

421
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,850
time that one's activating every time
this one's not activating at all that

422
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:48,860
this one's not activating at all that
 

423
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,710
this one's not activating at all that
could be because it's like reaching max

424
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
could be because it's like reaching max
 

425
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,590
could be because it's like reaching max
growth it's hard to tell or it could be

426
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
growth it's hard to tell or it could be
 

427
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,300
growth it's hard to tell or it could be
because of gain but powered I'm not sure

428
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,310
because of gain but powered I'm not sure
 

429
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,390
because of gain but powered I'm not sure
that ones are going at a good speed that

430
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:58,400
that ones are going at a good speed that
 

431
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,100
that ones are going at a good speed that
one's at a good speed so I think I think

432
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,110
one's at a good speed so I think I think
 

433
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,560
one's at a good speed so I think I think
actually this one's not running because

434
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:02,570
actually this one's not running because
 

435
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,050
actually this one's not running because
the other five here are throwing it

436
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:05,060
the other five here are throwing it
 

437
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,230
the other five here are throwing it
every time and it grows two blocks every

438
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
every time and it grows two blocks every
 

439
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,060
every time and it grows two blocks every
time so at five of them trigger it's

440
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,070
time so at five of them trigger it's
 

441
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,820
time so at five of them trigger it's
growing ten blocks to the very top there

442
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:12,830
growing ten blocks to the very top there
 

443
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,650
growing ten blocks to the very top there
and this doesn't need to activate them

444
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:15,660
and this doesn't need to activate them
 

445
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,860
and this doesn't need to activate them
and actually my game might start getting

446
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:18,870
and actually my game might start getting
 

447
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,130
and actually my game might start getting
laid you soon here all right let's load

the way very quick
I hope throughout our inventory we stand

454
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:31,950
I hope throughout our inventory we stand
 

455
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,650
I hope throughout our inventory we stand
right here you can see the speed that's

456
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:36,660
right here you can see the speed that's
 

457
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,310
right here you can see the speed that's
pretty good right well it turns out one

458
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
pretty good right well it turns out one
 

459
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,080
pretty good right well it turns out one

first so although all the streams end up
pretty close together here so it will be

496
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:29,400
pretty close together here so it will be
 

497
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,630
pretty close together here so it will be
pretty easy to connect them all and then

498
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640

very curious what you guys will say

796
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,130
very curious what you guys will say
 

797
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,310
very curious what you guys will say
about this so I think the proper

798
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:29,320
about this so I think the proper
 

799
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,780
about this so I think the proper
technique when you're doing a foundation

800
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:30,790
technique when you're doing a foundation
 

801
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,060
technique when you're doing a foundation
is to have straight walls right but I

802
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,070
is to have straight walls right but I
 

803
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,590
is to have straight walls right but I
don't usually do that I usually will

804
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:34,600
don't usually do that I usually will
 

805
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,620
don't usually do that I usually will
make it like jet out a block here and

806
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:37,630
make it like jet out a block here and
 

807
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:42,570
make it like jet out a block here and
there on purpose I do that and I I do it

808
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:42,580
there on purpose I do that and I I do it
 

809
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,370
there on purpose I do that and I I do it
because I think it'll add uniqueness to

810
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:44,380
because I think it'll add uniqueness to
 

811
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,870
because I think it'll add uniqueness to
my build but I'm not sure if that's a

812
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:45,880
my build but I'm not sure if that's a
 

813
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,650
my build but I'm not sure if that's a
mistake because they makes it really

814
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:49,660
mistake because they makes it really
 

815
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,570
mistake because they makes it really
hard to tie the bill together afterwards

816
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:51,580
hard to tie the bill together afterwards
 

817
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,490
hard to tie the bill together afterwards
when the walls don't line up and stuff

818
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:53,500
when the walls don't line up and stuff
 

819
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,010
when the walls don't line up and stuff
but at the same time that forces me to

820
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,020
but at the same time that forces me to
 

821
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,800
but at the same time that forces me to
do some weird stuff so to finish off the

822
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:58,810
do some weird stuff so to finish off the
 

823
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,660
do some weird stuff so to finish off the
build and sometimes that can look pretty

824
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:00,670
build and sometimes that can look pretty
 

825
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,300
build and sometimes that can look pretty
cool the weird things I do and it I know

826
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,310
cool the weird things I do and it I know
 

827
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,460
cool the weird things I do and it I know
like this house isn't gonna be the same

828
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:05,470
like this house isn't gonna be the same
 

829
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,110
like this house isn't gonna be the same
as any other one I build because it's

830
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
as any other one I build because it's
 

831
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,480
as any other one I build because it's
got some unique features to it so is

832
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:09,490
got some unique features to it so is
 

833
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,160
got some unique features to it so is
that a good thing to do or not should I

834
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,170
that a good thing to do or not should I
 

835
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,980
that a good thing to do or not should I
be laying out a straight foundation let

836
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:13,990
be laying out a straight foundation let
 

837
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,829
be laying out a straight foundation let
me know what you guys think about that

838
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
me know what you guys think about that
 

839
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,030
me know what you guys think about that
planning on having some kind of stall in

840
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,040
planning on having some kind of stall in
 

841
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,290
planning on having some kind of stall in
the front here I marked that with the

842
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:19,300
the front here I marked that with the
 

843
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,840
the front here I marked that with the
planks and this is gonna be our entrance

844
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:21,850
planks and this is gonna be our entrance
 

845
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,199
planks and this is gonna be our entrance
and I'm going to probably line it with

846
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:25,209
and I'm going to probably line it with
 

847
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:29,250
and I'm going to probably line it with
lime for some color and then stairs on

848
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:29,260
lime for some color and then stairs on
 

849
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,230
lime for some color and then stairs on
top of that and then oak on top that

850
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:31,240
top of that and then oak on top that
 

851
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,220
top of that and then oak on top that
like we've been doing with the other

852
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,230
like we've been doing with the other
 

853
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,990
like we've been doing with the other
buildings like oak over top here Oh

854
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
buildings like oak over top here Oh
 

855
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,310
buildings like oak over top here Oh
snappers so check it out everybody we

856
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,320
snappers so check it out everybody we
 

857
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,500
snappers so check it out everybody we
got ourselves a brand new building in

858
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:40,510
got ourselves a brand new building in
 

859
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,230
got ourselves a brand new building in
Sandy City our third one oh and you just

860
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:43,240
Sandy City our third one oh and you just
 

861
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,200
Sandy City our third one oh and you just
saw our shutter system on our stall here

862
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,210
saw our shutter system on our stall here
 

863
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,020
saw our shutter system on our stall here
it closes when it turns nighttime

864
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,030
it closes when it turns nighttime
 

865
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,970
it closes when it turns nighttime
shutters go down we got to get a

866
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:50,980
shutters go down we got to get a
 

867
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,950
shutters go down we got to get a
villager in in this little area here I

868
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:52,960
villager in in this little area here I
 

869
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,950
villager in in this little area here I
did some testing and if you have a fence

870
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:54,960
did some testing and if you have a fence
 

871
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,590
did some testing and if you have a fence
with carpet on top the baby zombies are

872
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:58,600
with carpet on top the baby zombies are
 

873
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,210
with carpet on top the baby zombies are
not able to get in there even when these

874
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:00,220
not able to get in there even when these
 

875
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,160
not able to get in there even when these
are open they won't try to get the

876
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,170
are open they won't try to get the
 

877
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,720
are open they won't try to get the
villager inside here he seems to be

878
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:03,730
villager inside here he seems to be
 

879
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,740
villager inside here he seems to be
perfectly safe so I want to try get a

880
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:06,750
perfectly safe so I want to try get a
 

881
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,340
perfectly safe so I want to try get a
with the workstation in there eventually

882
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,350
with the workstation in there eventually
 

883
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,720
with the workstation in there eventually
if I put trapdoors in front of the

884
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:11,730
if I put trapdoors in front of the
 

885
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,700
if I put trapdoors in front of the
fences here though the baby zombies will

886
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:13,710
fences here though the baby zombies will
 

887
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,290
fences here though the baby zombies will
be able to climb up those and get in so

888
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:15,300
be able to climb up those and get in so
 

889
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,320
be able to climb up those and get in so
I just put signs in front to make it

890
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,330
I just put signs in front to make it
 

891
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,460
I just put signs in front to make it
look like it's a bit more structured um

892
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:21,470
look like it's a bit more structured um
 

893
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,810
look like it's a bit more structured um
yeah check out this place what do you

894
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:23,820
yeah check out this place what do you
 

895
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,230
yeah check out this place what do you
guys think I again with what we talked

896
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:27,240
guys think I again with what we talked
 

897
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,520
guys think I again with what we talked
about there I don't know if it looks

898
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:28,530
about there I don't know if it looks
 

899
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,070
about there I don't know if it looks
like cool and crazy or if it looks kind

900
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,080
like cool and crazy or if it looks kind
 

901
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,850
like cool and crazy or if it looks kind
of sloppy yeah I kind of like it though

902
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:34,860
of sloppy yeah I kind of like it though
 

903
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,040
of sloppy yeah I kind of like it though
I think it's pretty unique we got like a

904
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,050
I think it's pretty unique we got like a
 

905
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,230
I think it's pretty unique we got like a
back alley here we'll probably make it a

906
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,240
back alley here we'll probably make it a
 

907
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,750
back alley here we'll probably make it a
nicer path eventually some interesting

908
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
nicer path eventually some interesting
 

909
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,820
nicer path eventually some interesting
structural stuff here so I made it come

910
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:46,830
structural stuff here so I made it come
 

911
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,650
structural stuff here so I made it come
out here and get supported and then we

912
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:48,660
out here and get supported and then we
 

913
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,140
out here and get supported and then we
got like a big box up there like a tower

914
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,150
got like a big box up there like a tower
 

915
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,270
got like a big box up there like a tower
okay let's check out some details here

916
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
okay let's check out some details here
 

917
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,190
okay let's check out some details here
so this is a very ninja friendly

918
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
so this is a very ninja friendly
 

919
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,570
so this is a very ninja friendly
building you can easily get onto the

920
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:56,580
building you can easily get onto the
 

921
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,510
building you can easily get onto the
roof here unfortunately the daylight

922
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
roof here unfortunately the daylight
 

923
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,970
roof here unfortunately the daylight
sensors are bluish colour not ideal look

924
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:04,980
sensors are bluish colour not ideal look
 

925
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,310
sensors are bluish colour not ideal look
probably better if we use like the slabs

926
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,320
probably better if we use like the slabs
 

927
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,620
probably better if we use like the slabs
there spruce slabs or something but

928
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:09,630
there spruce slabs or something but
 

929
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,720
there spruce slabs or something but
function before aesthetics right so we

930
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:11,730
function before aesthetics right so we
 

931
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,490
function before aesthetics right so we
want our shutter system to close at

932
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:13,500
want our shutter system to close at
 

933
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,740
want our shutter system to close at
nighttime so that is definitely staying

934
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:15,750
nighttime so that is definitely staying
 

935
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,140
nighttime so that is definitely staying
in we got a pretty interesting roof here

936
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,150
in we got a pretty interesting roof here
 

937
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,640
in we got a pretty interesting roof here
it kind of slopes a few different

938
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:19,650
it kind of slopes a few different
 

939
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,550
it kind of slopes a few different
directions and meets in the middle here

940
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:22,560
directions and meets in the middle here
 

941
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,250
directions and meets in the middle here
we can get onto our balcony oh don't you

you stop doing that I hate that future I
 

947
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,310
you stop doing that I hate that future I
never want to build with doors because

948
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
never want to build with doors because
 

949
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,400
never want to build with doors because
of that yeah you gotta found our balcony

950
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,410
of that yeah you gotta found our balcony
 

951
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,690
of that yeah you gotta found our balcony
