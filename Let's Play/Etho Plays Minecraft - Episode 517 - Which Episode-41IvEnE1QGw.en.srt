today I think that's gonna be the goal
but I think another big problem with

86
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,070
but I think another big problem with
 

87
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,740

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:13,670
we were to build a boat dispenser
 

235
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,730
we were to build a boat dispenser
nowadays how would we do it I don't know

236

nowadays how would we do it I don't know
 

237
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,340
nowadays how would we do it I don't know
exactly so we're gonna try figure it out

238
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:18,350
exactly so we're gonna try figure it out
 

239
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,450
exactly so we're gonna try figure it out
here

240
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:19,460
here
 

241
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,800
here
and then we'll build a few around our

242
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:20,810
and then we'll build a few around our
 

243
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,340
and then we'll build a few around our
worlds so that we can never use them now

244
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,350
worlds so that we can never use them now
 

245

you see that like we kind of we kind of
just stopped me there and when we get

284
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:29,410
just stopped me there and when we get
 

285
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,240
just stopped me there and when we get
out it like tries to fly still okay so

286
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,250
out it like tries to fly still okay so
 

287
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,880
out it like tries to fly still okay so
in our design it can't be moving when we

288
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:35,890
in our design it can't be moving when we
 

289
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,130
in our design it can't be moving when we
hop in I think that's the key there were

290
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,140
hop in I think that's the key there were
 

291
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,290
hop in I think that's the key there were
and we're in for a world of hurt okay

292
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:40,300
and we're in for a world of hurt okay
 

293
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,940
and we're in for a world of hurt okay
second thing we got to consider here is

294
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:41,950
second thing we got to consider here is
 

295
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,650
second thing we got to consider here is
how are we gonna actually dispense the

296
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:43,660
how are we gonna actually dispense the
 

297
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,990
how are we gonna actually dispense the
boats there was a time in Minecraft

298
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
boats there was a time in Minecraft
 

299
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,540
boats there was a time in Minecraft
where if you shot a boat of a dispenser

300
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:48,550
where if you shot a boat of a dispenser
 

301
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,420
where if you shot a boat of a dispenser
it would place it's like always always

302
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:51,430
it would place it's like always always
 

303
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,380
it would place it's like always always
always now there's a rule you have to

304
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:55,390
always now there's a rule you have to
 

305
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,820
always now there's a rule you have to
have some water for it to go in I'm

306
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:56,830
have some water for it to go in I'm
 

307
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,650
have some water for it to go in I'm
pretty sure I don't there's any way

308
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:58,660
pretty sure I don't there's any way
 

309
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,050
pretty sure I don't there's any way
around that or at least I've never found

310
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:01,060
around that or at least I've never found
 

311
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,940
around that or at least I've never found
a way around it and I think the rule is

312
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:04,950
a way around it and I think the rule is
 

313
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,980
a way around it and I think the rule is
has to either be like right in front of

314
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:07,990
has to either be like right in front of
 

315
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,230
has to either be like right in front of
the dispenser

316
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,240
the dispenser
 

317
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,300
the dispenser
then it'll place it I think it can be

318
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,310
then it'll place it I think it can be
 

319
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,670
then it'll place it I think it can be
one block below then it places it yep

320
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
one block below then it places it yep
 

321
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,070
one block below then it places it yep
I don't think it can be blue blocks

322
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
I don't think it can be blue blocks
 

323
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,470
I don't think it can be blue blocks
below but let's just double check oh I

324
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:22,480
below but let's just double check oh I
 

325
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,480
below but let's just double check oh I
went down a little too far there uh-huh

326
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,490
went down a little too far there uh-huh
 

327
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,070
went down a little too far there uh-huh
this is how you design stuff first you

328
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,080
this is how you design stuff first you
 

329
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,490
this is how you design stuff first you
figure out the mechanics and it's empty

330
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:32,500
figure out the mechanics and it's empty
 

331
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,650
figure out the mechanics and it's empty
okay oh yeah

332
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:34,660
okay oh yeah
 

333
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,450
okay oh yeah
so that's too low what about if it's one

334
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:36,460
so that's too low what about if it's one
 

335
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,180
so that's too low what about if it's one
above I've ever tried that before

336
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:38,190
above I've ever tried that before
 

337
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,800
above I've ever tried that before
umm okay so it looks like it doesn't

338
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:40,810
umm okay so it looks like it doesn't
 

339
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,330
umm okay so it looks like it doesn't
really matter I thought we might end up

340
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:42,340
really matter I thought we might end up
 

341
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,020
really matter I thought we might end up
doing something like this but remember

342
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,030
doing something like this but remember
 

343
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,880
doing something like this but remember
in our previous test where we just had

344
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:47,890
in our previous test where we just had
 

345
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,980
in our previous test where we just had
the water below here it looks like it

346
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:49,990
the water below here it looks like it
 

347
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,320
the water below here it looks like it
needs an air block like right here where

348
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,330
needs an air block like right here where
 

349
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,230
needs an air block like right here where
the sign is because now it doesn't it

350
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,240
the sign is because now it doesn't it
 

351
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,050
the sign is because now it doesn't it
doesn't dispense it it just shoots item

352
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:58,060
doesn't dispense it it just shoots item
 

353
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,120
doesn't dispense it it just shoots item
out if that sign is gone though then it

354
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,130
out if that sign is gone though then it
 

355
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,400
out if that sign is gone though then it
can place it so if we need an air block

356
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,410
can place it so if we need an air block
 

357
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,760
can place it so if we need an air block
and water and I think it'll work with

358
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:05,770
and water and I think it'll work with
 

359
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,530
and water and I think it'll work with
flowing water too so yeah now it'll

360
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:10,540
flowing water too so yeah now it'll
 

361
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,220
flowing water too so yeah now it'll
place it's let's do one more test here

362
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,230
place it's let's do one more test here
 

363
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,950
place it's let's do one more test here
just so we know the full range of things

364
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:15,960
just so we know the full range of things
 

365
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,909
just so we know the full range of things
what if the water is only a water stream

366
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
what if the water is only a water stream
 

367
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,890
what if the water is only a water stream
yeah okay so water streams work too

368
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:22,900
yeah okay so water streams work too
 

369
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,260
yeah okay so water streams work too
what about water log blocks okay so that

370
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:28,270
what about water log blocks okay so that
 

371
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,120
what about water log blocks okay so that
that's water logged right now what if

372
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,130
that's water logged right now what if
 

373
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,010
that's water logged right now what if
the slab is on the top part

374
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,020
the slab is on the top part
 

375
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,340
the slab is on the top part
oh we tricked it

376
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:37,350
oh we tricked it
 

377
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,140
oh we tricked it
okay that's kind of cool so you can even

378
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,150
okay that's kind of cool so you can even
 

379
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,210
okay that's kind of cool so you can even
hide the water yeah so this is gonna be

380
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:41,220
hide the water yeah so this is gonna be
 

381
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,160
hide the water yeah so this is gonna be
very simple I think there's not gonna be

382
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,170
very simple I think there's not gonna be
 

383
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,350
very simple I think there's not gonna be
a lot to this I think the idea we're

384
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
a lot to this I think the idea we're
 

385
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,880
a lot to this I think the idea we're
gonna go with is have the dispenser

386
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:46,890
gonna go with is have the dispenser
 

387
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,330
gonna go with is have the dispenser
facing up have our water and then we'll

388
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:50,340
facing up have our water and then we'll
 

389
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,430
facing up have our water and then we'll
hide the water with a slab like that I

390
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:52,440
hide the water with a slab like that I
 

391
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,380
hide the water with a slab like that I
think that's gonna be like the the

392
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:54,390
think that's gonna be like the the
 

393
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,130
think that's gonna be like the the
smoothest way of doing it the boat will

394
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:58,140
smoothest way of doing it the boat will
 

395
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,610
smoothest way of doing it the boat will
be here and then to like get launched I

396
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:01,620
be here and then to like get launched I
 

397
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,230
be here and then to like get launched I
want to have some launching mechanic

398
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:03,240
want to have some launching mechanic
 

399
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,390
want to have some launching mechanic
like you there's slime launchers or the

400
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:05,400
like you there's slime launchers or the
 

401
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,780
like you there's slime launchers or the
water columns I want it to trigger right

402
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:08,790
water columns I want it to trigger right
 

403
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:14,840
water columns I want it to trigger right
when we hop in the boat so I think the

404
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:14,850
when we hop in the boat so I think the
 

405
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,730
when we hop in the boat so I think the
way to do that let's we'll probably just

406
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:19,740
way to do that let's we'll probably just
 

407
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,560
way to do that let's we'll probably just
have like a slime block launcher here

408
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:21,570
have like a slime block launcher here
 

409
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,070
have like a slime block launcher here
maybe like right in the corner and when

410
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,080
maybe like right in the corner and when
 

411
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,570
maybe like right in the corner and when
we hop in we have to trigger a pressure

412
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:26,580
we hop in we have to trigger a pressure
 

413
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,100
we hop in we have to trigger a pressure
plate or something like that I think is

414
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,110
plate or something like that I think is
 

415
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,990
plate or something like that I think is
probably the easiest way of doing this

416
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
probably the easiest way of doing this
 

417
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,750
probably the easiest way of doing this
do you think this is gonna work so I put

418
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:32,760
do you think this is gonna work so I put
 

419
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,490
do you think this is gonna work so I put
the pressure plate above the dispenser

420
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:34,500
the pressure plate above the dispenser
 

421
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,070
the pressure plate above the dispenser
with the boats in the idea is we'll have

422
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,080
with the boats in the idea is we'll have
 

423
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,020
with the boats in the idea is we'll have
a boat here all the times and when we

424
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,030
a boat here all the times and when we
 

425
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,610
a boat here all the times and when we
hop in we want to get launched by the

426
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:40,620
hop in we want to get launched by the
 

427
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,620
hop in we want to get launched by the
slime block launcher here so the

428
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:42,630
slime block launcher here so the
 

429
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,810
slime block launcher here so the
observer detects when this dispenser

430
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:44,820
observer detects when this dispenser
 

431
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,260
observer detects when this dispenser
gets activated and and launches us what

432
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:48,270
gets activated and and launches us what
 

433
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,280
gets activated and and launches us what
do you think you think it's gonna work

434
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,290
do you think you think it's gonna work
 

435
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,980
do you think you think it's gonna work
oh it actually did wait a second now

436
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:54,990
oh it actually did wait a second now
 

437
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,180
oh it actually did wait a second now
I've tried a few times because I don't

438
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,190
I've tried a few times because I don't
 

439
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,140
I've tried a few times because I don't
think it did the first time and the idea

440
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,150
think it did the first time and the idea
 

441
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,550
think it did the first time and the idea
is we want another boat to be placed

442
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:01,560
is we want another boat to be placed
 

443
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,810
is we want another boat to be placed
behind us too like all in one thing so

444
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:05,820
behind us too like all in one thing so
 

445
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,430
behind us too like all in one thing so
we want to get launched and we want a

446
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
we want to get launched and we want a
 

447
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,500
we want to get launched and we want a
new boat to be there so this time I'm

448
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:09,510
new boat to be there so this time I'm
 

449
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,790
new boat to be there so this time I'm
gonna actually hold forward because I

450
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
gonna actually hold forward because I
 

451
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,850
gonna actually hold forward because I
didn't there oh yeah kind of glitchy so

452
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:16,860
didn't there oh yeah kind of glitchy so
 

453
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,930
didn't there oh yeah kind of glitchy so
we got a new boat there though yeah

454
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:20,940
we got a new boat there though yeah
 

455
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,910
we got a new boat there though yeah
using slime block launchers probably

456
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:22,920
using slime block launchers probably
 

457
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,210
using slime block launchers probably
isn't the best of ideas I think it's the

458
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,220
isn't the best of ideas I think it's the
 

459
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,450
isn't the best of ideas I think it's the
client-server desync issue where the

460
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:29,460
client-server desync issue where the
 

461
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,280
client-server desync issue where the
game doesn't know what it's doing even

462
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,290
game doesn't know what it's doing even
 

463
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:37,280
game doesn't know what it's doing even
though it should I did get it to launch

464
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,290
though it should I did get it to launch
 

465
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:42,400
though it should I did get it to launch
a few times but it's very unreliable

466
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,410

 

467
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,390

otherwise it would be a pretty nice

468
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:44,400
otherwise it would be a pretty nice
 

469
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,160
otherwise it would be a pretty nice
dispenser I think they didn't gather to

470
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,170
dispenser I think they didn't gather to
 

471
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,830
dispenser I think they didn't gather to
launch once yet

472
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:50,840
launch once yet
 

473
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,990
launch once yet
come on there we go just have to

474
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,000
come on there we go just have to
 

475
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,720
come on there we go just have to
complain about it that's the trick

476
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:57,730

 

477
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,990

mm-hmm

478
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,000
mm-hmm
 

479
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,750
mm-hmm
so I kind of realized that we're not

480
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
so I kind of realized that we're not
 

481
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,540
so I kind of realized that we're not
gonna be able to get this to work

482
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:03,550
gonna be able to get this to work
 

483
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,100
gonna be able to get this to work
there's a long-standing issue with the

484
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,110
there's a long-standing issue with the
 

485
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,570
there's a long-standing issue with the
slime blocks like when you use them with

486
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:07,580
slime blocks like when you use them with
 

487
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,270
slime blocks like when you use them with
boats most of the time they just push

488
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:10,280
boats most of the time they just push
 

489
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,060
boats most of the time they just push
you one block both vertically and

490
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,070
you one block both vertically and
 

491
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,030
you one block both vertically and
sideways they're kind of glitched out

492
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
sideways they're kind of glitched out
 

493
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,710
sideways they're kind of glitched out
the odd time you will get launched the

494
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:17,720
the odd time you will get launched the
 

495
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,390
the odd time you will get launched the
bounce effect actually works from the

496
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:19,400
bounce effect actually works from the
 

497
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,460
bounce effect actually works from the
slime blocks but it's very inconsistent

498
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:21,470
slime blocks but it's very inconsistent
 

499
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,670
slime blocks but it's very inconsistent
and I don't think there's any way to

500
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
and I don't think there's any way to
 

501
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,640
and I don't think there's any way to
make it consistent so rather than

502
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:27,650
make it consistent so rather than
 

503
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,240
make it consistent so rather than
launching the boat like I wanted to

504
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,250
launching the boat like I wanted to
 

505
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,420
launching the boat like I wanted to
we're just gonna launch ourselves like

506
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:34,430
we're just gonna launch ourselves like
 

507
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,850
we're just gonna launch ourselves like
so that's the best that's the best

508
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:36,860
so that's the best that's the best
 

509
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,770
so that's the best that's the best
compromise I could come up with that's

510
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:38,780
compromise I could come up with that's
 

511
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,270
compromise I could come up with that's
the closest thing I could get to like

512
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:40,280
the closest thing I could get to like
 

513
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,770
the closest thing I could get to like
what I wanted aha so I think that I'll

514
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:44,780
what I wanted aha so I think that I'll
 

515
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,050
what I wanted aha so I think that I'll
have to do but look at this we can ride

516
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:47,060
have to do but look at this we can ride
 

517
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,220
have to do but look at this we can ride
ride the water now that's awesome so

518
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:51,230
ride the water now that's awesome so
 

519
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,260
ride the water now that's awesome so
while working on that I got to thinking

520
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:53,270
while working on that I got to thinking
 

521
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,600
while working on that I got to thinking
hey maybe let's add some trees along the

522
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:55,610
hey maybe let's add some trees along the
 

523
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,810
hey maybe let's add some trees along the
water here so let's do that I'm gonna go

524
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:58,820
water here so let's do that I'm gonna go
 

525
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,550
water here so let's do that I'm gonna go
for a t-shirt I normally I like to use

526
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
for a t-shirt I normally I like to use
 

527
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,010
for a t-shirt I normally I like to use
oak trees but let's change it up a bit

528
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,020
oak trees but let's change it up a bit
 

529
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,290
oak trees but let's change it up a bit
but I want to add can we change the bark

530
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:08,300
but I want to add can we change the bark
 

531
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,050
but I want to add can we change the bark
though cuz I don't like that Bart yeah

532
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:11,060
though cuz I don't like that Bart yeah
 

533
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,000
though cuz I don't like that Bart yeah
maybe let's just leave those two logs

534
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,010
maybe let's just leave those two logs
 

535
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,910
maybe let's just leave those two logs
there so the leaves don't be spawn and

536
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:14,920
there so the leaves don't be spawn and
 

537
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,020
there so the leaves don't be spawn and
then we'll try growing another one a

538
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,030
then we'll try growing another one a
 

539
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,860
then we'll try growing another one a
little bit different maybe raise it up

540
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:20,870
little bit different maybe raise it up
 

541
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,120
little bit different maybe raise it up
so we get some more layers is that gonna

542
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,130
so we get some more layers is that gonna
 

543
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,760
so we get some more layers is that gonna
work oh it does work look at that oh now

544
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:27,770
work oh it does work look at that oh now
 

545
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,300
work oh it does work look at that oh now
we got a super acacia tree uh-huh is

546
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:31,310
we got a super acacia tree uh-huh is
 

547
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,800
we got a super acacia tree uh-huh is
that a good idea is that gonna make it

548
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:32,810
that a good idea is that gonna make it
 

549
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:37,840
that a good idea is that gonna make it
look funny I kind of like it I I wish it

550
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:37,850
look funny I kind of like it I I wish it
 

551
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,850
look funny I kind of like it I I wish it
was like leaves on that layer than one

552
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:39,860
was like leaves on that layer than one
 

553
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,980
was like leaves on that layer than one
one block higher that layer then one

554
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:41,990
one block higher that layer then one
 

555
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,050
one block higher that layer then one
block higher you know it's like totally

556
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:44,060
block higher you know it's like totally
 

557
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,650
block higher you know it's like totally
flat right now you know what I think we

558
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:47,660
flat right now you know what I think we
 

559
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,320
flat right now you know what I think we
might actually have something here call

560
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,330
might actually have something here call
 

561
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,560
might actually have something here call
me crazy or don't please don't but I

562
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:53,570
me crazy or don't please don't but I
 

563
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,330
me crazy or don't please don't but I
don't think they look that bad actually

564
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:55,340
don't think they look that bad actually
 

565
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,120
don't think they look that bad actually
so these are like quick easy custom

566
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,130
so these are like quick easy custom
 

567
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,630
so these are like quick easy custom
trees basically each one is two acacia

568
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:01,640
trees basically each one is two acacia
 

569
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,940
trees basically each one is two acacia
trees merged together and then I

570
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:03,950
trees merged together and then I
 

571
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,670
trees merged together and then I
replaced the

572
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:04,680
replaced the
 

573
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,210
replaced the
bark and then bulk up the bottom and

574
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:07,220
bark and then bulk up the bottom and
 

575
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,050
bark and then bulk up the bottom and
that's about it

576
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,060
that's about it
 

577
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,840
that's about it
so I like this one the most look at this

578
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:11,850
so I like this one the most look at this
 

579
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,480
so I like this one the most look at this
this one turned out very good or I think

580
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,490
this one turned out very good or I think
 

581
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,930
this one turned out very good or I think
at least that's pretty cool it's a

582
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:17,940
at least that's pretty cool it's a
 

583
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,790
at least that's pretty cool it's a
little bit of a light game though like

584
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:19,800
little bit of a light game though like
 

585
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,130
little bit of a light game though like
trying to get trying to get to get it to

586
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:22,140
trying to get trying to get to get it to
 

587
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,350
trying to get trying to get to get it to
shape the way you want so usually the

588
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:24,360
shape the way you want so usually the
 

589
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,120
shape the way you want so usually the
first one I grow a little bit off the

590
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,130
first one I grow a little bit off the
 

591
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,360
first one I grow a little bit off the
ground like that and let's go for some

592
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,370
ground like that and let's go for some
 

593
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,110
ground like that and let's go for some
bone meal BAM ok so it's not a not a

594
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
bone meal BAM ok so it's not a not a
 

595
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,490
bone meal BAM ok so it's not a not a
great start I like it when it splits

596
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:34,500
great start I like it when it splits
 

597
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,220
great start I like it when it splits
into two at the at the very start but we

598
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,230
into two at the at the very start but we
 

599
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,740
into two at the at the very start but we
didn't mean try make this work so this

600
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:39,750
didn't mean try make this work so this
 

601
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,260
didn't mean try make this work so this
is a pretty straight up if it's lopsided

602
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:42,270
is a pretty straight up if it's lopsided
 

603
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,880
is a pretty straight up if it's lopsided
then you usually want to go on the

604
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:43,890
then you usually want to go on the
 

605
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,910
then you usually want to go on the
opposite sides it's kind of Leaning a

606
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:46,920
opposite sides it's kind of Leaning a
 

607
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,220
opposite sides it's kind of Leaning a
little bit that way so I'm gonna go just

608
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,230
little bit that way so I'm gonna go just
 

609
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,620
little bit that way so I'm gonna go just
a couple blocks over here not quite as

610
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:51,630
a couple blocks over here not quite as
 

611
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,660
a couple blocks over here not quite as
high this time actually let's go let's

612
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:53,670
high this time actually let's go let's
 

613
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,329
high this time actually let's go let's
go about it like here ideally we don't

614
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:56,339
go about it like here ideally we don't
 

615
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:57,800
go about it like here ideally we don't
want the leaves to merge we want the

616
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:57,810
want the leaves to merge we want the
 

617
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,570
want the leaves to merge we want the
layers the layers are what makes it look

618
00:13:59,570 --> 00:13:59,580
layers the layers are what makes it look
 

619
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,760
layers the layers are what makes it look
good so hopefully they don't merge

620
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:01,770
good so hopefully they don't merge
 

621
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:06,829
good so hopefully they don't merge
together here okay so you merge at the

622
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:06,839
together here okay so you merge at the
 

623
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,710
together here okay so you merge at the
top darn I saw this it's like okay we

624
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:09,720
top darn I saw this it's like okay we
 

625
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,079
top darn I saw this it's like okay we
got something No so I would chop this

626
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:12,089
got something No so I would chop this
 

627
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:13,070
got something No so I would chop this
down to try again

628
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:13,080
down to try again
 

629
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,980
down to try again
round two so ideally we're trying to get

630
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:15,990
round two so ideally we're trying to get
 

631
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,810
round two so ideally we're trying to get
like three layers of leaves and then

632
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:17,820
like three layers of leaves and then
 

633
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,880
like three layers of leaves and then
that looks pretty good if you can make

634
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:19,890
that looks pretty good if you can make
 

635
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,410
that looks pretty good if you can make
that happen so again we're gonna go

636
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:21,420
that happen so again we're gonna go
 

637
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,760
that happen so again we're gonna go
three blocks off the ground to start

638
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:22,770
three blocks off the ground to start
 

639
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,440
three blocks off the ground to start
with seems to be a good height although

640
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:24,450
with seems to be a good height although
 

641
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,960
with seems to be a good height although
a little bit of a short tree we got two

642
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:26,970
a little bit of a short tree we got two
 

643
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:31,100
a little bit of a short tree we got two
layers though that's something if we get

644
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,110
layers though that's something if we get
 

645
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,900
layers though that's something if we get
another dual this might be a four layer

646
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:32,910
another dual this might be a four layer
 

647
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,090
another dual this might be a four layer
tree though

648
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:34,100
tree though
 

649
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,790
tree though
but it's probably gonna merge somewhere

650
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
but it's probably gonna merge somewhere
 

651
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,190
but it's probably gonna merge somewhere
so it's I feel like we want it like over

652
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,200
so it's I feel like we want it like over
 

653
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,440
so it's I feel like we want it like over
here I'm gonna go two blocks up again

654
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,450
here I'm gonna go two blocks up again
 

655
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,970
here I'm gonna go two blocks up again
it's all random the how tall the tree is

656
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:46,980
it's all random the how tall the tree is
 

657
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,319
it's all random the how tall the tree is
gonna be I have no idea

658
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,329
gonna be I have no idea
 

659
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:52,069
gonna be I have no idea
Oh even corrupted our other tree there

660
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
Oh even corrupted our other tree there
 

661
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,380
Oh even corrupted our other tree there
uh see I wanted that like a little bit

662
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:57,390
uh see I wanted that like a little bit
 

663
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,840
uh see I wanted that like a little bit
lower and it would have been great okay

664
00:14:59,840 --> 00:14:59,850
lower and it would have been great okay
 

665
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,710
lower and it would have been great okay
that's a very boring starts let's go for

666
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:03,720
that's a very boring starts let's go for
 

667
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,930
that's a very boring starts let's go for
over here oh I think we got layers we

668
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:08,940
over here oh I think we got layers we
 

669
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,550
over here oh I think we got layers we
got layers guys look at that okay so we

670
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
got layers guys look at that okay so we
 

671
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,829
got layers guys look at that okay so we
got two big ones let's try a small one

672
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:12,839
got two big ones let's try a small one
 

673
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,499
got two big ones let's try a small one
over here that's not a tree

674
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:16,509
over here that's not a tree
 

675
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:20,749
over here that's not a tree
that's the grass okay let's try again oh

676
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:20,759
that's the grass okay let's try again oh
 

677
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,729
that's the grass okay let's try again oh
okay we can work with this maybe I kind

678
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:23,739
okay we can work with this maybe I kind
 

679
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:27,199
okay we can work with this maybe I kind
of wish this wasn't so big over here

680
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:27,209
of wish this wasn't so big over here
 

681
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:30,659
of wish this wasn't so big over here
maybe we do some trimming it's like

682
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:30,669
maybe we do some trimming it's like
 

683
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:33,840
maybe we do some trimming it's like
bringing it in one you know like we're

684
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:33,850
bringing it in one you know like we're
 

685
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,369
bringing it in one you know like we're
allowed to customise it a little bit

686
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:35,379
allowed to customise it a little bit
 

687
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:37,739
allowed to customise it a little bit
right uh-huh

688
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:37,749
right uh-huh
 

689
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:39,900
right uh-huh
shave it in a bit so it's not quite as

690
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:39,910
shave it in a bit so it's not quite as
 

691
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,369
shave it in a bit so it's not quite as
big okay yeah I think I think we can

692
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:44,379
big okay yeah I think I think we can
 

693
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:47,249
big okay yeah I think I think we can
make this into a tree this is good so

694
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:47,259
make this into a tree this is good so
 

695
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:49,319
make this into a tree this is good so
then what I would do you chop down all

696
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:49,329
then what I would do you chop down all
 

697
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:53,069
then what I would do you chop down all
these Keysha blocks and then you just

698
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:53,079
these Keysha blocks and then you just
 

699
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:56,939
these Keysha blocks and then you just
sort of draw branches towards like

700
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:56,949
sort of draw branches towards like
 

701
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:59,849
sort of draw branches towards like
imaginary thing in the middle so pretty

702
00:15:59,849 --> 00:15:59,859
imaginary thing in the middle so pretty
 

703
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,619
imaginary thing in the middle so pretty
much when you get three leaf piles that

704
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:01,629
much when you get three leaf piles that
 

705
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,599
much when you get three leaf piles that
look pretty good together then you just

706
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:03,609
look pretty good together then you just
 

707
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:05,999
look pretty good together then you just
play connect the dots chop down the

708
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:06,009
play connect the dots chop down the
 

709
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:08,639
play connect the dots chop down the
acacia logs and then try connect the

710
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:08,649
acacia logs and then try connect the
 

711
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,619
acacia logs and then try connect the
wood together in like a central place

712
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:12,629
wood together in like a central place
 

713
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:15,659
wood together in like a central place
maybe we'll do something like this so

714
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:15,669
maybe we'll do something like this so
 

715
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:17,489
maybe we'll do something like this so
you kind of have to build the custom

716
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:17,499
you kind of have to build the custom
 

717
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:20,519
you kind of have to build the custom
treats widths or extent but placing the

718
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:20,529
treats widths or extent but placing the
 

719
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:22,529
treats widths or extent but placing the
leaves is like the part that takes the

720
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:22,539
leaves is like the part that takes the
 

721
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:24,029
leaves is like the part that takes the
longest normally when you're making

722
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:24,039
longest normally when you're making
 

723
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,749
longest normally when you're making
trees get rid of that yeah okay put this

724
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:27,759
trees get rid of that yeah okay put this
 

725
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,019
trees get rid of that yeah okay put this
there you gotta be careful old leaves

726
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:31,029
there you gotta be careful old leaves
 

727
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:33,929
there you gotta be careful old leaves
don't despawn on you though try to be

728
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:33,939
don't despawn on you though try to be
 

729
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:38,129
don't despawn on you though try to be
really careful here okay do something

730
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:38,139
really careful here okay do something
 

731
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:41,279
really careful here okay do something
like that that can come back then let's

732
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:41,289
like that that can come back then let's
 

733
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:44,369
like that that can come back then let's
bring this over towards the central

734
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:44,379
bring this over towards the central
 

735
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,650
bring this over towards the central
stock and everything should look pretty

736
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:46,660
stock and everything should look pretty
 

737
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,179
stock and everything should look pretty
good right let's chop down the rest of

738
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:51,189
good right let's chop down the rest of
 

739
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:55,229
good right let's chop down the rest of
this and I think we got a tree here not

740
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:55,239
this and I think we got a tree here not
 

741
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:57,150
this and I think we got a tree here not
too bad right I think that turned out

742
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,160
too bad right I think that turned out
 

743
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,729
too bad right I think that turned out
pretty well actually looks good from

744
00:16:59,729 --> 00:16:59,739
pretty well actually looks good from
 

745
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:02,309
pretty well actually looks good from
other angles so the final thing I would

746
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:02,319
other angles so the final thing I would
 

747
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:05,009
other angles so the final thing I would
do is try to bulk up the bottom if he

748
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:05,019
do is try to bulk up the bottom if he
 

749
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:08,009
do is try to bulk up the bottom if he
can this one's a little hard cuz the

750
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:08,019
can this one's a little hard cuz the
 

751
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:14,759
can this one's a little hard cuz the
branches are so little whatever you can

752
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:14,769
branches are so little whatever you can
 

753
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:19,649
branches are so little whatever you can
do will make it look better yeah yeah my

754
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:19,659
do will make it look better yeah yeah my
 

755
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:23,820
do will make it look better yeah yeah my
big enough no no

756
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:23,830

 

757
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:28,790

sure let's actually bring this over oh

758
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:28,800
sure let's actually bring this over oh
 

759
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,400
sure let's actually bring this over oh
yeah you got to be a little bit finicky

760
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,410
yeah you got to be a little bit finicky
 

761
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,870
yeah you got to be a little bit finicky
with it basically it's that too far out

762
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
with it basically it's that too far out
 

763
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,440
with it basically it's that too far out
baby huh it'll work okay

764
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:43,450
baby huh it'll work okay
 

765
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,330
baby huh it'll work okay
I'm happy with that let's move on oh

766
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:45,340
I'm happy with that let's move on oh
 

767
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,490
I'm happy with that let's move on oh
wait a minute wait a minute I just

768
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:47,500
wait a minute wait a minute I just
 

769
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,680
wait a minute wait a minute I just
remembered something you guys are you

770
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:49,690
remembered something you guys are you
 

771
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,110
remembered something you guys are you
guys are probably freaking out right now

772
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
guys are probably freaking out right now
 

773
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,600
guys are probably freaking out right now
uh yeah we can't we can do this now

774
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:54,610
uh yeah we can't we can do this now
 

775
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,530
uh yeah we can't we can do this now
can't we a little bit late a little bit

776
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:58,540
can't we a little bit late a little bit
 

777
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,210
can't we a little bit late a little bit
late but let's do the lower stuff at

778
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:00,220
late but let's do the lower stuff at
 

779
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,440
late but let's do the lower stuff at
least the stuff we didn't see like down

780
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:04,450
least the stuff we didn't see like down
 

781
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,550
least the stuff we didn't see like down
to the ground it'll make a big

782
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:05,560
to the ground it'll make a big
 

783
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,000
to the ground it'll make a big
difference yeah so basically now you can

784
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,010
difference yeah so basically now you can
 

785
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,160
difference yeah so basically now you can
make trees where you don't see the

786
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,170
make trees where you don't see the
 

787
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,030
make trees where you don't see the
exposed sides which is pretty nice I

788
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,040
exposed sides which is pretty nice I
 

789
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:21,000
exposed sides which is pretty nice I
like that a lot all right so I just did

790
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,010
like that a lot all right so I just did
 

791
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,950
like that a lot all right so I just did
some bone meal around here as well I

happy with it so I went for the
 

1037
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,550
happy with it so I went for the
cobblestone gravel and andesite mix like

1038
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:27,560
cobblestone gravel and andesite mix like
 

1039
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,180
cobblestone gravel and andesite mix like
we've we've done over there and keep in

1040
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,190
we've we've done over there and keep in
 

1041
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,480
we've we've done over there and keep in
mind we're missing like probably future

1042
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:34,490
mind we're missing like probably future
 

1043
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,400
mind we're missing like probably future
developments we'll probably add more

1044
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:36,410
developments we'll probably add more
 

1045
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,530
developments we'll probably add more
buildings do more decorating in this

1046
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:38,540
buildings do more decorating in this

area it's still kind of on the the plain
 

1049
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,640
area it's still kind of on the the plain
side so there's not a lot to look at

1050
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:42,650
side so there's not a lot to look at
 

1051
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,250
side so there's not a lot to look at
right now but it's only gonna get better

1052

right now but it's only gonna get better
 

1053
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,220
right now but it's only gonna get better
right so we go down a mineshaft sort of

1054
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,230
right so we go down a mineshaft sort of
 

1055
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,270
right so we go down a mineshaft sort of
thing here it's bit steep a bit rocky

1056
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:51,280
thing here it's bit steep a bit rocky
 

1057
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,080
thing here it's bit steep a bit rocky
and it goes through the door but yeah I

1058
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,090
and it goes through the door but yeah I
 

1059
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,450
and it goes through the door but yeah I
like doing paths just because like

1060
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:58,460
like doing paths just because like
 

1061
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,760
like doing paths just because like
they're not really a big thing but they

1062
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:00,770
they're not really a big thing but they
 

1063
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,250
they're not really a big thing but they
make a big difference when you view the

1064
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:03,260
make a big difference when you view the
 

1065
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,430
make a big difference when you view the
world so like look at this now with the

1066
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:06,440
world so like look at this now with the
 

1067
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,610
world so like look at this now with the
trees and stuff you got a little bit

1068
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:09,620
trees and stuff you got a little bit
 

1069
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,550
trees and stuff you got a little bit
extra colour over there now a little bit

1070
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:12,560
extra colour over there now a little bit
 

1071
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,520
extra colour over there now a little bit
more to draw draw our eyes same width

1072
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:15,530
more to draw draw our eyes same width
 

1073
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,910
more to draw draw our eyes same width
over here this looks pretty nice I think

1074
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:17,920
over here this looks pretty nice I think
 

1075
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,790
over here this looks pretty nice I think
and you can spot that like opening from

1076
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:21,800
and you can spot that like opening from
 

1077
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,670
and you can spot that like opening from
a distance pretty easily that little

1078
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:23,680
a distance pretty easily that little
 

1079
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,490
a distance pretty easily that little
it's like oh what's over there you know

1080
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:26,500
it's like oh what's over there you know
 

1081
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,670

uh-huh
 

1083
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,220
uh-huh
anyways just a little project I thought

1084
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:30,230
anyways just a little project I thought
 

1085
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,430
anyways just a little project I thought
it would be nice to do nice to do but

1086
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,440
it would be nice to do nice to do but
 

1087
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,470
it would be nice to do nice to do but
anyways guys I think we're gonna keep it

1088
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:35,480
anyways guys I think we're gonna keep it
 

1089
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,350
anyways guys I think we're gonna keep it
kind of short and sweet and simple today

1090
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,360
kind of short and sweet and simple today
 

1091
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,170
kind of short and sweet and simple today
hopefully hopefully get into a more

1092
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:41,180
hopefully hopefully get into a more
 

1093
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,270
hopefully hopefully get into a more
regular routine with this with the

1094
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:43,280
regular routine with this with the
 

1095
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,520
regular routine with this with the
series and with that in mind I thought

1096
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:45,530
series and with that in mind I thought
 

1097
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,090
series and with that in mind I thought
this would be a comet to mention it's

1098
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:49,100
this would be a comet to mention it's
 

1099
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,250
this would be a comet to mention it's
kind of a general general question I

1100
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:51,260
kind of a general general question I
 

1101
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,800

people and the slower release schedule
 

1181
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,200
people and the slower release schedule
than most people and like I was just

1182
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,210

and I don't blame him for it it worked
 

1193
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,700

out well for them and we kind of knew
 

1195
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,250
out well for them and we kind of knew
that was gonna happen before we started

1196
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:54,260
that was gonna happen before we started
 

1197
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,529
that was gonna happen before we started
the server but we didn't know when the

1198
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:56,539
the server but we didn't know when the
 

1199
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:58,180
the server but we didn't know when the
patch was actually gonna come out

1200
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,190
patch was actually gonna come out
 

1201
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,460

because Mojang don't officially announce

1202
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:00,470
because Mojang don't officially announce
 

1203
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,860
because Mojang don't officially announce
though that like Munson it advanced or

1204
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:02,870
though that like Munson it advanced or
 

1205
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,260
though that like Munson it advanced or
anything so yeah it just kind of petered

1206
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:05,270
anything so yeah it just kind of petered
 

1207
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,580
anything so yeah it just kind of petered
out and it doesn't make sense for me to

1208
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:06,590
out and it doesn't make sense for me to
 

1209
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,590
out and it doesn't make sense for me to
play on the server alone because it's

1210
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:08,600
play on the server alone because it's
 

1211
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,260
play on the server alone because it's
not my server and like the government

1212
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:11,270
not my server and like the government
 

1213
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:16,090
not my server and like the government
would have to continuously like take

1214
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:16,100
would have to continuously like take
 

1215
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,730
would have to continuously like take
care of things on the server and keep it

1216
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:18,740
care of things on the server and keep it
 

1217
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,600
care of things on the server and keep it
updated and all for me you know

1218
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:21,610
updated and all for me you know
 

1219
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,830
updated and all for me you know
meanwhile someone else is paying for the

1220
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:23,840
meanwhile someone else is paying for the
 

1221
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,919
meanwhile someone else is paying for the
server and it just wouldn't be a good

1222
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:25,929
server and it just wouldn't be a good
 

1223
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:29,889
server and it just wouldn't be a good
situation so I felt like I shouldn't

1224
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:29,899
situation so I felt like I shouldn't
 

1225
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:32,530
situation so I felt like I shouldn't
continue it anyways that's kind of

1226
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:32,540
continue it anyways that's kind of
 

1227
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,140
