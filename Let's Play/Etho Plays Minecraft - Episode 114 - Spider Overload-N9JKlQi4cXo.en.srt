00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:38,380
maybe we'll mess around with these cheap
 

99
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,730

spider spawners again but I'm having a

100
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:41,740
spider spawners again but I'm having a
 

101
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,820
spider spawners again but I'm having a
lot of difficulty with them I've been

102
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:44,830
lot of difficulty with them I've been
 

103
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,710
lot of difficulty with them I've been
trying to find a way where I can attack

104
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
trying to find a way where I can attack
 

105
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,629
trying to find a way where I can attack
them easily without them attacking me

106
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
them easily without them attacking me
 

107
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,340
them easily without them attacking me
and I thought I thought glass panes

108
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,350
and I thought I thought glass panes
 

109
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,850
and I thought I thought glass panes
would work but they're not working you

110
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:56,860
would work but they're not working you
 

111
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,770
would work but they're not working you
can hit them through the corners of

112
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:58,780
can hit them through the corners of
 

113
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,320
can hit them through the corners of
blocks but then they're out of position

114
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,330
blocks but then they're out of position
 

115
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:07,740
blocks but then they're out of position
so you can't hit them again easily tried

116
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:07,750
so you can't hit them again easily tried
 

117
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,590
so you can't hit them again easily tried
stairs stairs don't really work maybe

118
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:10,600
stairs stairs don't really work maybe
 

119
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:19,040
stairs stairs don't really work maybe
I'll try try to show you

120
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,050

 

121
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,460

yeah block mechanic seem to have changed

122
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:23,470
yeah block mechanic seem to have changed
 

123
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,420
yeah block mechanic seem to have changed
a little bit from what I remember

124
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:26,430

 

125
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,129

basically you can attack through the gap

126
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:29,139
basically you can attack through the gap
 

127
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,719
basically you can attack through the gap
in stairs anymore least I'm pretty sure

128
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:33,729
in stairs anymore least I'm pretty sure
 

129
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:37,589
in stairs anymore least I'm pretty sure
you can't but maybe I could use a

130
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:37,599
you can't but maybe I could use a
 

131
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:39,690
you can't but maybe I could use a
minecart to hold them and then I could

132
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:39,700
minecart to hold them and then I could
 

133
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:45,390
minecart to hold them and then I could
easily attack them safely but I think

134
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:45,400
easily attack them safely but I think
 

135
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,680
easily attack them safely but I think
they're too small and you hit the

136
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:46,690
they're too small and you hit the
 

137
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:57,089
they're too small and you hit the
minecart instead of them yeah so I don't

138
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:57,099
minecart instead of them yeah so I don't
 

139
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:00,779
minecart instead of them yeah so I don't
know if there is any safe way besides

140
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:00,789
know if there is any safe way besides
 

141
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:05,689
know if there is any safe way besides
through what are the block like that

142
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:05,699
through what are the block like that
 

143
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,629
through what are the block like that
cuz they're just so dang small can't

144
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:09,639
cuz they're just so dang small can't
 

145
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:27,260
cuz they're just so dang small can't
really control ha yeah I don't know I

146
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,270
really control ha yeah I don't know I
 

147
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,490
really control ha yeah I don't know I
can't think of any good way of doing it

148
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:29,500
can't think of any good way of doing it
 

149
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,450
can't think of any good way of doing it
with your sword

150
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:30,460

maybe if you attack from the bottom it's

156
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:39,159
maybe if you attack from the bottom it's
 

157
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:49,680
maybe if you attack from the bottom it's

doesn't work well it kind of works thank
 

167
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:24,180
doesn't work well it kind of works thank
you if you have a block and then a half

168
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,190
you if you have a block and then a half
 

169
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,119
you if you have a block and then a half
slab above with water below them they

170
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:27,129
slab above with water below them they
 

171
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:30,149
slab above with water below them they
have a very difficult time getting out

172
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:30,159
have a very difficult time getting out
 

173
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,899
have a very difficult time getting out
and you can safely kind of safely not

174
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:33,909
and you can safely kind of safely not
 

175
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,420
and you can safely kind of safely not
perfectly safely attack them through the

176
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:36,430
perfectly safely attack them through the
 

177
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:41,550
perfectly safely attack them through the
half slab stuff the other items but you

178
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:41,560
half slab stuff the other items but you
 

179
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,519
half slab stuff the other items but you
will get the XP just rare occasions like

180
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:47,529
will get the XP just rare occasions like
 

181
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:55,100
will get the XP just rare occasions like
you just saw they'll actually climb

182
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,110

 

183
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,230

hmmm I don't know these guys are tough

184
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
hmmm I don't know these guys are tough
 

185
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:26,759
hmmm I don't know these guys are tough
to deal with I tell ya okay so I think

186
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:26,769
to deal with I tell ya okay so I think
 

187
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,590
to deal with I tell ya okay so I think
I'm going to try and make a system for

188
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:28,600
I'm going to try and make a system for
 

189
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,639
I'm going to try and make a system for
these two spawners now basically what I

190
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:32,649
these two spawners now basically what I
 

191
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:35,430
these two spawners now basically what I
need to do is connect them together with

192
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
need to do is connect them together with
 

193
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,960
need to do is connect them together with
the water stream and then have them

194
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:36,970
the water stream and then have them
 

195
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,389
the water stream and then have them
branch off to a killing system I still

196
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:39,399
branch off to a killing system I still
 

197
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,730
branch off to a killing system I still
don't know how I'm going to safely kill

198
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:41,740
don't know how I'm going to safely kill
 

199
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,480
don't know how I'm going to safely kill
them with my sword and really I think

200
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:45,490
them with my sword and really I think
 

201
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,639
them with my sword and really I think
that's basically all I want to do is

202
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:47,649
that's basically all I want to do is
 

203
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:48,900
that's basically all I want to do is
just to be able to kill them with my

204
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:48,910
just to be able to kill them with my
 

205
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,269
just to be able to kill them with my
sword because if you do an auto killing

206
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
sword because if you do an auto killing
 

207
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,249
sword because if you do an auto killing
system you don't get XP and you don't

208
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:53,259
system you don't get XP and you don't
 

209
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,949
system you don't get XP and you don't
get spider eyes from these guys so

210
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:55,959
get spider eyes from these guys so
 

211
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:58,530
get spider eyes from these guys so
there's not much benefit to it all you

212
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:58,540
there's not much benefit to it all you
 

213
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,100
there's not much benefit to it all you
did is string which is not hard to come

214
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,110
did is string which is not hard to come
 

215
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:10,740
did is string which is not hard to come
by so yeah I'm going to do that there is

216
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:10,750
by so yeah I'm going to do that there is
 

217
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,840
by so yeah I'm going to do that there is
a bit of positioning I need to take into

218
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:12,850
a bit of positioning I need to take into
 

219
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,120
a bit of positioning I need to take into
consideration though basically if

220
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,130
consideration though basically if
 

221
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,530
consideration though basically if
there's more than six cave spiders

222
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:19,540
there's more than six cave spiders
 

223
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,499
there's more than six cave spiders
within as seventeen by seventeen by nine

224
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:24,509
within as seventeen by seventeen by nine
 

225
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:27,720
within as seventeen by seventeen by nine
area around the spawner so imagine eight

226
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:27,730
area around the spawner so imagine eight
 

227
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,490
area around the spawner so imagine eight
blocks this way eight blocks this way

228
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:29,500
blocks this way eight blocks this way
 

229
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,769
blocks this way eight blocks this way
eight blocks this way eight blocks this

230
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:31,779
eight blocks this way eight blocks this
 

231
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:34,530
eight blocks this way eight blocks this
way and then four blocks above and four

232
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:34,540
way and then four blocks above and four
 

233
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,129
way and then four blocks above and four
blocks below if there's six or more cave

234
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:38,139
blocks below if there's six or more cave
 

235
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:40,400
blocks below if there's six or more cave
spiders in that area no more will spawn

236
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:40,410
spiders in that area no more will spawn
 

237
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,990
spiders in that area no more will spawn
so I need to carry the spiders out of

238
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,000
so I need to carry the spiders out of
 

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,170
so I need to carry the spiders out of
that area for both of these so I'm going

240
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:46,180
that area for both of these so I'm going
 

241
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,579
that area for both of these so I'm going
to count one two three four five six

242
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:50,589
to count one two three four five six
 

243
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:52,129
to count one two three four five six
seven eight

244
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:52,139
seven eight
 

245
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:56,639
seven eight
that would be eight away from that

246
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:56,649
that would be eight away from that
 

247
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:59,069
that would be eight away from that
spawner which is far enough or one two

248
00:10:59,069 --> 00:10:59,079
spawner which is far enough or one two
 

249
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:03,750
spawner which is far enough or one two
three four five six seven eight

250
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
three four five six seven eight
 

251
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,210
three four five six seven eight
oh yeah that's why I have this line here

252
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:06,220
oh yeah that's why I have this line here
 

253
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,550
oh yeah that's why I have this line here
so this would be nine blocks away from

254
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
so this would be nine blocks away from
 

255
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,470
so this would be nine blocks away from
the spawner so if I move the spiders

256
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
the spawner so if I move the spiders
 

257
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,660
the spawner so if I move the spiders
that far away from that spawner they'll

258
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:15,670
that far away from that spawner they'll
 

259
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:22,080
that far away from that spawner they'll
spawn infinitely excuse me and then if I

260
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,090
spawn infinitely excuse me and then if I
 

261
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,390
spawn infinitely excuse me and then if I
move four blocks below this spawner so

262
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:24,400
move four blocks below this spawner so
 

263
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,070
move four blocks below this spawner so
this would be 1 this would be 2 3 this

264
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,080
this would be 1 this would be 2 3 this
 

265
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,580
this would be 1 this would be 2 3 this
layer here before I need to go one lower

266
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:31,590
layer here before I need to go one lower
 

267
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:37,320
layer here before I need to go one lower
have the spiders in that area or so for

268
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,330
have the spiders in that area or so for
 

269
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,650
have the spiders in that area or so for
this one and then I'll Thierry them this

270
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:40,660
this one and then I'll Thierry them this
 

271
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,940
this one and then I'll Thierry them this
way kind of I'll have to mess around

272
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:44,950
way kind of I'll have to mess around
 

273
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,540
way kind of I'll have to mess around
with it see how it works I also have to

274
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:48,550
with it see how it works I also have to
 

275
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,540
with it see how it works I also have to
stand within 16 blocks of both spawners

276
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:51,550
stand within 16 blocks of both spawners
 

277
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,030
stand within 16 blocks of both spawners
for them to work so there's it's going

278
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,040
for them to work so there's it's going
 

279
00:11:54,040 --> 00:13:02,300
for them to work so there's it's going
to be tough making it work

280
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,310

 

281
00:13:02,310 --> 00:15:56,640

nice try hey stupid nose

282
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:56,650

 

283
00:15:56,650 --> 00:18:21,180

Hey

284
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:21,190

 

285
00:18:21,190 --> 00:19:07,970

the heck

286
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:07,980

 

287
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:36,890

oh isn't that the worst sound ever just

288
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:36,900
oh isn't that the worst sound ever just
 

289
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,380
oh isn't that the worst sound ever just
cutting my ears I've been listening to

290
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,390
cutting my ears I've been listening to
 

291
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,280
cutting my ears I've been listening to
it for so long I'm in the middle of

292
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,290
it for so long I'm in the middle of
 

293
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,200
it for so long I'm in the middle of
developing this thing still thought I'd

294
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,210
developing this thing still thought I'd
 

295
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,960
developing this thing still thought I'd
give you a little progress updates when

296
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:47,970
give you a little progress updates when
 

297
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,919
give you a little progress updates when
it's all done I'll give you a

298
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:48,929
it's all done I'll give you a
 

299
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:52,039
it's all done I'll give you a
run-through of how it works but as you

300
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:52,049
run-through of how it works but as you
 

301
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:54,860
run-through of how it works but as you
can see it's there's not really any

302
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:54,870
can see it's there's not really any
 

303
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,630
can see it's there's not really any
limit to the number of spiders that can

304
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
limit to the number of spiders that can
 

305
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
limit to the number of spiders that can
collect so the longer I stand here the

306
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:58,650
collect so the longer I stand here the
 

307
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,720
collect so the longer I stand here the
more that will come unlike a real mob

308
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:02,730
more that will come unlike a real mob
 

309
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:08,270
more that will come unlike a real mob
system that is bound by the mob cap with

310
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:08,280
system that is bound by the mob cap with
 

311
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,100
system that is bound by the mob cap with
spawners though they obey different

312
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,110
spawners though they obey different
 

313
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,919
spawners though they obey different
rules so there's no limit as far as I

314
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:12,929
rules so there's no limit as far as I
 

315
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,680
rules so there's no limit as far as I
know and my game is actually starting to

316
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:15,690
know and my game is actually starting to
 

317
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,120
know and my game is actually starting to
slow down because I have so many

318
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,130
slow down because I have so many
 

319
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,289
slow down because I have so many
collected here and at the moment I only

320
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:21,299
collected here and at the moment I only
 

321
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,320
collected here and at the moment I only
have one of the spawners being utilized

322
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:24,330
have one of the spawners being utilized
 

323
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,390
have one of the spawners being utilized
right now I'm trying to get the second

324
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
right now I'm trying to get the second
 

325
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,299
right now I'm trying to get the second
one to join up with this stream here

326
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:29,309
one to join up with this stream here
 

327
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:33,049
one to join up with this stream here
having a little trouble with it but once

328
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:33,059
having a little trouble with it but once
 

329
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:36,409
having a little trouble with it but once
I do that when I do that it'll be twice

330
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:36,419
I do that when I do that it'll be twice
 

331
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,789
I do that when I do that it'll be twice
as fast as it is right now and spider

332
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
as fast as it is right now and spider

spawning same stuff slowed down a little

334
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:42,990
spawning same stuff slowed down a little
 

335
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,440
spawning same stuff slowed down a little
bit too I think that's because there's

336
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,450
bit too I think that's because there's
 

337
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,039
bit too I think that's because there's
so many moms here if you'd like to

338
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,049
so many moms here if you'd like to
 

339
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:53,289
so many moms here if you'd like to
entities it says 126 so there's probably

340
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:53,299
entities it says 126 so there's probably
 

341
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:56,030
entities it says 126 so there's probably
probably about that many spiders in

342
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,040
probably about that many spiders in
 

343
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,549
probably about that many spiders in
front of me and I can hit them easily

344
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:58,559
front of me and I can hit them easily
 

345
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:04,480
front of me and I can hit them easily
through the glass

346
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:04,490

 

347
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,590

and it it's pretty cool so two hits with

348
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
and it it's pretty cool so two hits with
 

349
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,580
and it it's pretty cool so two hits with
an iron sword

350
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:10,590
an iron sword
 

351
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:16,570
an iron sword
I believe this works really really well

352
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:16,580
I believe this works really really well
 

353
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,730
I believe this works really really well
better than I was expecting

354
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:21,740

I believe cave spiders give quite a bit

360
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:29,340
I believe cave spiders give quite a bit
 

361
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:34,610
I believe cave spiders give quite a bit
of XP to like every mob has a certain

of XP to like every mob has a certain
 

363
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,980
of XP to like every mob has a certain
amount of XP they drop in and pretty

364

amount of XP they drop in and pretty
 

365
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,640
amount of XP they drop in and pretty
sure cave spiders are high on the list I

366
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:39,650
sure cave spiders are high on the list I
 

367
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,910
sure cave spiders are high on the list I
don't know the exact number though like

368
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:43,920
don't know the exact number though like
 

369
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,460
don't know the exact number though like
for example creepers drop more than cows

370
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:46,470
for example creepers drop more than cows
 

371
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,910
for example creepers drop more than cows
do when they die I'm guessing cave

372
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:49,920
do when they die I'm guessing cave
 

373
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,340
do when they die I'm guessing cave
spiders are pretty high anyway I'll

374
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:55,350
spiders are pretty high anyway I'll
 

375
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,350
spiders are pretty high anyway I'll
finish killing these guys it takes a

finish killing these guys it takes a
 

377
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,770
finish killing these guys it takes a
while and then little collect our XP

awesome so I'll have to polish this up a
 

399
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,230
awesome so I'll have to polish this up a
bit I'll probably do that another day

400
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
bit I'll probably do that another day
 

401
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,970
bit I'll probably do that another day
though I mean I spent quite a bit of

402
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:43,980
though I mean I spent quite a bit of
 

403
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,490
though I mean I spent quite a bit of
time on this today already pretty pretty

404
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:49,500
time on this today already pretty pretty
 

405
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,410
time on this today already pretty pretty
awesome though

406
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:53,420

 

407
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,310

don't know what to call it

00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,190
we got 41 spider eyes and about a
 

411
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:05,960
we got 41 spider eyes and about a
hundred string from that and they gather

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:05,970
hundred string from that and they gather
 

413
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,580
hundred string from that and they gather
pretty quick like it's it's awesome so

if you want XP in your world I would

416
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:14,220
if you want XP in your world I would
 

417
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,620
if you want XP in your world I would
definitely recommend building one of

418
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:15,630
definitely recommend building one of
 

419
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,430
definitely recommend building one of
these things find the tape spider

420
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:19,440
these things find the tape spider
 

421
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,680
these things find the tape spider
spawner or if you want it to go quicker

422
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:21,690
spawner or if you want it to go quicker
 

423
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,640
spawner or if you want it to go quicker
find two or three together it's actually

424
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:25,650
find two or three together it's actually
 

425
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,670
find two or three together it's actually
pretty common to find that many like

426
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:28,680
pretty common to find that many like
 

427
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,860
pretty common to find that many like
over there I found three together right

428
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,870
over there I found three together right
 

429
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:37,160
over there I found three together right
within range of each other so definitely

430
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,170
within range of each other so definitely
 

431
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:37,670
within range of each other so definitely
doable

432
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:37,680
doable
 

433
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,740
doable
I might work on this a bit more yet

434
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:39,750
I might work on this a bit more yet
 

435
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,700
I might work on this a bit more yet
today and then I'll run through the

436
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:43,710
today and then I'll run through the
 

437
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,590
today and then I'll run through the
water and the lighting system and all

438
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,600
water and the lighting system and all
 

439
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,480
water and the lighting system and all
that yeah I really need to be more

440
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:50,490
that yeah I really need to be more
 

441
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,850
that yeah I really need to be more
careful when I'm working on this thing

442
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:52,860
careful when I'm working on this thing
 

443
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,100
careful when I'm working on this thing
this is not the first time these guys

444
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,110
this is not the first time these guys
 

445
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,010
this is not the first time these guys
have killed me it probably won't be the

446
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:58,020
have killed me it probably won't be the
 

447
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,610
have killed me it probably won't be the
last

448
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:58,620
last
 

449
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:07,280
last
oh crap oh never getting back in it

450
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,290
oh crap oh never getting back in it
 

451
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,330
oh crap oh never getting back in it
there's like 50 cave spiders free right

452
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:11,340
there's like 50 cave spiders free right
 

453
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,570
there's like 50 cave spiders free right
now because when I was fighting them I

454
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:14,580
now because when I was fighting them I
 

455
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:19,790
now because when I was fighting them I
broke the glass and they all just shot

456
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:19,800
broke the glass and they all just shot
 

457
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,070
broke the glass and they all just shot
out the top of that thing at me oh no

458
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,080
out the top of that thing at me oh no
 

459
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:36,110
out the top of that thing at me oh no
dang they're so hard to hit I'm hoping

460
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,120
dang they're so hard to hit I'm hoping
 

461
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:43,210
dang they're so hard to hit I'm hoping
they spawn if I'm far enough away

462
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:43,220

 

463
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,490

yeah
 

465
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,310
yeah
so I got that I got to change a few

466
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,320
so I got that I got to change a few
 

467
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,380
so I got that I got to change a few
things too I want to make them a one-hit

468
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,390
things too I want to make them a one-hit
 

469
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,260
things too I want to make them a one-hit
kill so I might try to incorporate some

470
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:54,270
kill so I might try to incorporate some
 

471
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,620
kill so I might try to incorporate some
cat cacti or something in the water

472
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:57,630
cat cacti or something in the water
 

473
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,750
cat cacti or something in the water
streams to damage them before they get

474
00:24:59,750 --> 00:24:59,760
streams to damage them before they get
 

475
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,140
streams to damage them before they get
to the holding chamber I don't know if

476
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,150
to the holding chamber I don't know if
 

477
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,380
to the holding chamber I don't know if
they'll do enough damage though so I

478
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:06,390
they'll do enough damage though so I
 

479
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,120
they'll do enough damage though so I
might have to play around with fire or

480
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,130
might have to play around with fire or
 

481
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,620
might have to play around with fire or
something instead gravity would work

482
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:12,630
something instead gravity would work
 

483
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,350
something instead gravity would work
best but I don't want to have to go down

484
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
best but I don't want to have to go down
 

485
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,930
best but I don't want to have to go down
low to harvest the spiders and yeah

let's cover top now let's cover it with

502
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:15,750
let's cover top now let's cover it with
 

503

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:22,970

 

505
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,790

that's a bad thing I mean attacked by

that's a bad thing I mean attacked by
 

507
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,760
that's a bad thing I mean attacked by
spiders for hours now probably because

508
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:28,770
spiders for hours now probably because
 

509
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:37,240
spiders for hours now probably because
they're all running around somewhere

510
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,250

 

511
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:43,960

okay well I got my stuff back okay so

big improvement right now put an iron oh
 

515
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,790
big improvement right now put an iron oh
are they called iron fences check iron

516
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:52,800
are they called iron fences check iron
 

517
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,340
are they called iron fences check iron
bars I put an iron bar above instead

518
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:55,350
bars I put an iron bar above instead
 

519
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,430
bars I put an iron bar above instead
with glass block so that's a huge

520
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:58,440
with glass block so that's a huge
 

521
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,799
with glass block so that's a huge
improvement it's much easier to hit them

522
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:00,809
improvement it's much easier to hit them
 

523
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:06,020
improvement it's much easier to hit them
now I can get close to them without them

524
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,030
now I can get close to them without them
 

525
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,400
now I can get close to them without them
poisoning me the only place they can

526
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,410
poisoning me the only place they can
 

527
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,330
poisoning me the only place they can
poison me is in the corners here so I

528
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:11,340
poison me is in the corners here so I
 

529
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:18,020
poison me is in the corners here so I
have to be careful that still isn't

530
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,030
have to be careful that still isn't
 

531

continued with it so I'll show you

546
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,130
continued with it so I'll show you
 

547
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,080
continued with it so I'll show you
quickly how it works well you probably

548
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,090
quickly how it works well you probably
 

549
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,450
quickly how it works well you probably
saw it when I was building it it's a

550
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:47,460
saw it when I was building it it's a
 

551
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,240
saw it when I was building it it's a
little hard to see it's very dangerous

552
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,250
little hard to see it's very dangerous
 

553
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,650
little hard to see it's very dangerous
to go in it now but there's basically an

554
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:54,660
to go in it now but there's basically an
 

555
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,990
to go in it now but there's basically an
8 by 8 by 3 high room plus an extra

556
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,000
8 by 8 by 3 high room plus an extra
 

557
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,700
8 by 8 by 3 high room plus an extra
block for water so 8 by 8 by 4 the water

558
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:04,710
block for water so 8 by 8 by 4 the water
 

559
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,890
block for water so 8 by 8 by 4 the water
stream is 8 blocks long carries them to

560
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:06,900
stream is 8 blocks long carries them to
 

561
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,960
stream is 8 blocks long carries them to
another water stream which is also 8

562
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:08,970
another water stream which is also 8
 

563
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:12,500
another water stream which is also 8
blocks long then I do the stair and sign

564
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:12,510
blocks long then I do the stair and sign
 

565
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,680
blocks long then I do the stair and sign
trick

566
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:13,690
trick
 

567
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,960
trick
for moving the spiders uphill works

568
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:18,970
for moving the spiders uphill works
 

569
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,080
for moving the spiders uphill works
really well with them and then they get

570
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,090
really well with them and then they get
 

571
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,260
really well with them and then they get
pushed out and this area here is nine

572
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:25,270
pushed out and this area here is nine
 

573
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,150
pushed out and this area here is nine
blocks away from the spawner so it's

574
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:27,160
blocks away from the spawner so it's
 

575
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,790
blocks away from the spawner so it's
just out of range so that they will

576
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:29,800
just out of range so that they will
 

577
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,750
just out of range so that they will
continue to spawn until your game can't

578
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:33,760
continue to spawn until your game can't
 

579
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,830
continue to spawn until your game can't
handle it anymore basically now the

580
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:37,840
handle it anymore basically now the
 

581
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,380
handle it anymore basically now the
other thing we've got another room here

582
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:40,390
other thing we've got another room here
 

583
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,670
other thing we've got another room here
which is it coffee I try to link the two

584
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:44,680
which is it coffee I try to link the two
 

585
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,340
which is it coffee I try to link the two
together I know how to do it now but I'm

586
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:47,350
together I know how to do it now but I'm
 

587
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,140
together I know how to do it now but I'm
going to have to redo this I've played

588
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,150
going to have to redo this I've played
 

589
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,200
going to have to redo this I've played
around with the using stairs half slabs

590
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,210
around with the using stairs half slabs
 

591
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,950
around with the using stairs half slabs
fences and fence gates kind of find a

592
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:55,960
fences and fence gates kind of find a
 

593
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,050
fences and fence gates kind of find a
good combo but you'll see you see they

594
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:58,060
good combo but you'll see you see they
 

595
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:04,080
good combo but you'll see you see they
get stuck here I got it figured out now

596
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,090
get stuck here I got it figured out now
 

597
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,370
get stuck here I got it figured out now
though there's a stair underneath this

598
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:08,380
though there's a stair underneath this
 

599
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,550
though there's a stair underneath this
water screen here and when they go up

600
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:10,560
water screen here and when they go up
 

601
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,800
water screen here and when they go up
they don't go up all the way so they get

602
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:13,810
they don't go up all the way so they get
 

603
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,920
they don't go up all the way so they get
stuck on the glass block so they need

604
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:16,930
stuck on the glass block so they need
 

605
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,080
stuck on the glass block so they need
another spider to push them sometimes

606
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,090
another spider to push them sometimes
 

607
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:24,030
another spider to push them sometimes
they'll go on their own the trick of it

608
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,040
they'll go on their own the trick of it
 

609
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:30,630
they'll go on their own the trick of it
is to not the water screen needs to go

610
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:30,640
is to not the water screen needs to go
 

611
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,630
is to not the water screen needs to go
around the bend so we have to go like

612
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:33,640
around the bend so we have to go like
 

613
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,130
around the bend so we have to go like
oops my mouse is getting on my nerves

614
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:37,140
oops my mouse is getting on my nerves
 

615
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,530
oops my mouse is getting on my nerves
pretend this is water if we wanted to go

616
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:40,540
pretend this is water if we wanted to go
 

617
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,180
pretend this is water if we wanted to go
around a bend it would have to do this

618
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,190
around a bend it would have to do this
 

619
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,180
around a bend it would have to do this
has to be three blocks long and there

620
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:45,190
has to be three blocks long and there
 

621
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:50,280

I stare over here pretend that's a stare
and then the same thing if we wanted to

626
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:58,990
and then the same thing if we wanted to
 

627
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,510
and then the same thing if we wanted to
go up again we have to make it go around

628
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:00,520
go up again we have to make it go around
 

629
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,390
go up again we have to make it go around
the bend if we wanted to go around a bit

630
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:03,400
the bend if we wanted to go around a bit
 

631
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,190
the bend if we wanted to go around a bit
I should say and then there'd be a stare

632
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,200
I should say and then there'd be a stare
 

633
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,400

streams are only two blocks long because

636
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:09,940
streams are only two blocks long because

I was trying to get them up as quick as
 

639
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,070
I was trying to get them up as quick as
possible because that spawner is lower

640
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,080
possible because that spawner is lower

through water blocks like three or four
 

661

00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:47,020
water blocks to attack me so I'm curious
 

663

water blocks to attack me so I'm curious
to see what would happen if you had one

664
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:48,730
to see what would happen if you had one
 

665
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,790
to see what would happen if you had one
of these guys chasing you in the ocean I

666
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:50,800
of these guys chasing you in the ocean I
 

667
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,110
of these guys chasing you in the ocean I
don't know if they would be able to go

668
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,120
don't know if they would be able to go
 

669
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,810
don't know if they would be able to go
underwater or not but it seems like they

670
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:54,820
underwater or not but it seems like they
 

671
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,360
underwater or not but it seems like they
could from what I saw

672
00:30:59,360 --> 00:30:59,370

 

673
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:05,400

seventy yeah I'll work on finishing this

674
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,410
seventy yeah I'll work on finishing this
 

675
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,580
seventy yeah I'll work on finishing this
it's really really cool I liked it

676
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:08,590
it's really really cool I liked it
 

677
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:12,270
it's really really cool I liked it
I want to hook up cacti though so that

678
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:12,280
I want to hook up cacti though so that
 

679
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,390
I want to hook up cacti though so that
they get damaged ideally I want one hit

680
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:15,400
they get damaged ideally I want one hit
 

681
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,970
they get damaged ideally I want one hit
with a stone sword to kill them would be

682
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:17,980
with a stone sword to kill them would be
 

683
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,590
with a stone sword to kill them would be
a huge improvement if I could get that

684
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:19,600
a huge improvement if I could get that
 

685
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,549
a huge improvement if I could get that
working and I'll try to redo this so

686
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:23,559
working and I'll try to redo this so
 

687
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:25,620
working and I'll try to redo this so
that it joins up with other spawner so

688
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:25,630
that it joins up with other spawner so
 

689
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:31,890
that it joins up with other spawner so
that this works place is quick what

690
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:31,900
that this works place is quick what
 

691
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,200
that this works place is quick what
would be really cool is if I had a like

692
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,210
would be really cool is if I had a like
 

693
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,690
would be really cool is if I had a like
a cobweb here I could jump in it and

694
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:36,700
a cobweb here I could jump in it and
 

695
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,360
a cobweb here I could jump in it and
then as I fall down I could do critical

696
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,370
then as I fall down I could do critical
 

697
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:42,210
then as I fall down I could do critical
hits every time because you slowly sink

698
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:42,220
hits every time because you slowly sink
 

699
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,049
hits every time because you slowly sink
down and you do a lot extra damage that

700
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:46,059
down and you do a lot extra damage that
 

701
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:48,480
down and you do a lot extra damage that
way but unfortunately you can't place

702
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,490
way but unfortunately you can't place
 

703
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,399
way but unfortunately you can't place
them legitimately

704
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:52,409

 

705
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:56,430

the rooms for these spawner things are I

706
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:56,440
the rooms for these spawner things are I
 

707
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,430
the rooms for these spawner things are I
think I covered that they're 8 by 8 by 4

708
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,440
think I covered that they're 8 by 8 by 4
 

709
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,100
think I covered that they're 8 by 8 by 4
I went I decide to go with bigger rooms

710
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,110
I went I decide to go with bigger rooms
 

711
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:07,890
I went I decide to go with bigger rooms
because there is a an advantage to it at

712
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:07,900
because there is a an advantage to it at
 

713
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,690
because there is a an advantage to it at
first I wanted to use smaller rooms but

714
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:09,700
first I wanted to use smaller rooms but
 

715
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,779
first I wanted to use smaller rooms but
bigger rooms when spiders spawn there's

716
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:12,789
bigger rooms when spiders spawn there's
 

717
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:14,430
bigger rooms when spiders spawn there's
a chance more than one will spawn if

718
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:14,440
a chance more than one will spawn if
 

719
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,520
a chance more than one will spawn if
there's more spawning space and this

720
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:17,530
there's more spawning space and this
 

721
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,570
there's more spawning space and this
maximizes it so every single possible

722
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:21,580
maximizes it so every single possible
 

723
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,750
maximizes it so every single possible
spawning block is available for the

724
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:24,760
spawning block is available for the
 

725
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,580
spawning block is available for the
spiders to spawn in and it's completely

726
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:26,590
spiders to spawn in and it's completely
 

727
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:31,289
spiders to spawn in and it's completely
dark so if light affects it it's perfect

728
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:31,299
dark so if light affects it it's perfect
 

729
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:33,750
dark so if light affects it it's perfect
basically and I also have a lighting

730
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:33,760
basically and I also have a lighting
 

731
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,110
basically and I also have a lighting
system here to disable it but there is a

732
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,120
system here to disable it but there is a
 

733
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,710
system here to disable it but there is a
flaw in it in one of the corners it's

734
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:40,720
flaw in it in one of the corners it's
 

735
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,850
flaw in it in one of the corners it's
too dark and a few spiders are able to

736
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:44,860
too dark and a few spiders are able to
 

737
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,649
too dark and a few spiders are able to
spawn still so I'll have to change this

738
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:46,659
spawn still so I'll have to change this
 

739
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:51,899
spawn still so I'll have to change this
around yet but yeah I think I'm going to

740
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:51,909
around yet but yeah I think I'm going to
 

741
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:56,120
around yet but yeah I think I'm going to
call it an end guys and

742
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,130
