00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:24,900
remember last episode we built this mob
 

15
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,720
remember last episode we built this mob
system right so the problem was we were

16
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:26,730
system right so the problem was we were
 

17
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,950
system right so the problem was we were
getting attacked

18
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:27,960
getting attacked
 

19
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,099
getting attacked
non-stop by the drown mobs and this has

20
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:31,109
non-stop by the drown mobs and this has
 

21
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,260
non-stop by the drown mobs and this has
worked out great you can actually do

22
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:33,270
worked out great you can actually do
 

23
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,729
worked out great you can actually do
some building and stuff now under the

24
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:34,739
some building and stuff now under the
 

25
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,299
some building and stuff now under the
water without having to stop every every

26
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:38,309
water without having to stop every every
 

27
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,000
water without having to stop every every
second to kill something so that's what

28
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,010
second to kill something so that's what
 

29
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:41,959
second to kill something so that's what
I've been doing I was just trying to do

30
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:41,969
I've been doing I was just trying to do
 

31
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,090
I've been doing I was just trying to do
some more building here not really

32
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:44,100
some more building here not really
 

33
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,680
some more building here not really
planning things out or anything just

34
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:45,690
planning things out or anything just
 

35
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,830
planning things out or anything just
just building kind of the von sway way

36
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:48,840
just building kind of the von sway way
 

37
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,760
just building kind of the von sway way
rights and we built like a window last

38
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:52,770
rights and we built like a window last
 

39
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,350
rights and we built like a window last
time and it's like okay let's put

40
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:54,360
time and it's like okay let's put
 

41
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,670
time and it's like okay let's put
another window on the other side maybe

42
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
another window on the other side maybe
 

43
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,049
another window on the other side maybe
something in the middle I was like what

44
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:57,059
something in the middle I was like what
 

45
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,549
something in the middle I was like what
could we put in the middle and I had the

46
00:00:58,549 --> 00:00:58,559
could we put in the middle and I had the
 

47
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,569
could we put in the middle and I had the
idea of let's go not a cola right let's

48
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:02,579
idea of let's go not a cola right let's
 

49
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,670
idea of let's go not a cola right let's
build an anchor so this is my attempt at

50
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:04,680
build an anchor so this is my attempt at
 

51
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,620
build an anchor so this is my attempt at
an anchor hung on the wall very accurate

52
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:09,630
an anchor hung on the wall very accurate
 

53
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,969
an anchor hung on the wall very accurate
rights to scale no not really

54
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:13,979
rights to scale no not really
 

55
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,030
rights to scale no not really
okay I don't know then I experimented

56
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
okay I don't know then I experimented
 

57
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,980
okay I don't know then I experimented
with some different columns here yeah

58
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:21,990
with some different columns here yeah
 

59
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,999
with some different columns here yeah
all right so to get us started here I

60
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:25,009
all right so to get us started here I
 

61
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:27,679
all right so to get us started here I
had an idea for a challenge alright I

62
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:27,689
had an idea for a challenge alright I
 

63
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,420
had an idea for a challenge alright I
think this is gonna be pretty fun

64
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:29,430
think this is gonna be pretty fun
 

65
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,100
think this is gonna be pretty fun
because we're building underwater right

66
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,110
because we're building underwater right
 

67
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,300
because we're building underwater right
so we're gonna have all these fun

68
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:32,310
so we're gonna have all these fun
 

69
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,149
so we're gonna have all these fun
underwater challenges with designing the

70
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:35,159
underwater challenges with designing the
 

71
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,710
underwater challenges with designing the
base and stuff what I want to do of

72
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:39,720
base and stuff what I want to do of
 

73
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,780
base and stuff what I want to do of
course every base should have a tree

74
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:41,790
course every base should have a tree
 

75
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,149
course every base should have a tree
farm right you always need more wood and

76
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
farm right you always need more wood and
 

77
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,999
farm right you always need more wood and
stuff it's really annoying to go go get

78
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:47,009
stuff it's really annoying to go go get
 

79
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,340
stuff it's really annoying to go go get
it's how we're gonna build a tree firm

80
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:49,350
it's how we're gonna build a tree firm
 

81
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,960
it's how we're gonna build a tree firm
that works underwater that's the

82
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:50,970
that works underwater that's the
 

83
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,800
that works underwater that's the
challenge I noticed something I think we

84
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:54,810
challenge I noticed something I think we
 

85
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,550
challenge I noticed something I think we
can use here yes pistons okay so when

86
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
can use here yes pistons okay so when
 

87
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,030
can use here yes pistons okay so when
you use a piston underwater check this

88
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,040
you use a piston underwater check this
 

89
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,690
you use a piston underwater check this
out when it retract

90
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:06,700

 

91
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,059

for a moment there just a very brief

92
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:09,069
for a moment there just a very brief
 

93
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:11,900
for a moment there just a very brief
moment you get like an air pockets right

94
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:11,910
moment you get like an air pockets right
 

95
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,630
moment you get like an air pockets right
and I think we can use that watch a

96
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:15,640
and I think we can use that watch a
 

97
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,630
and I think we can use that watch a
piston head just a brief moment I think

98
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
piston head just a brief moment I think
 

99
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,990
piston head just a brief moment I think
there's an air pockets it takes a moment

100
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
there's an air pockets it takes a moment
 

101
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,030
there's an air pockets it takes a moment
for the water to refill it alright we're

102
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,040
for the water to refill it alright we're
 

103
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,190
for the water to refill it alright we're
gonna try to use that to make a tree

104
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,200
gonna try to use that to make a tree
 

105
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,080
gonna try to use that to make a tree
farm work underwater and that's the plan

106
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,090
farm work underwater and that's the plan
 

107
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:35,280
farm work underwater and that's the plan
so what I think we'll do or do I know

108
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,290
so what I think we'll do or do I know
 

109
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,000
so what I think we'll do or do I know
what I'm doing

110
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,010
what I'm doing
 

111
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,880
what I'm doing
I think we got to set up like a column

112
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:38,890
I think we got to set up like a column
 

113
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,360
I think we got to set up like a column
of Pistons rights kind of like this

114
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,370
of Pistons rights kind of like this
 

115
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,490
of Pistons rights kind of like this
let's not worry about positioning and

116
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:44,500
let's not worry about positioning and
 

117
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,080
let's not worry about positioning and
all that stuff just yet I'll probably

118
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,090
all that stuff just yet I'll probably
 

119
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,330
all that stuff just yet I'll probably
fix it alpha camera I think we'll have

120
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:48,340
fix it alpha camera I think we'll have
 

121
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,009
fix it alpha camera I think we'll have
like a row of Pistons like that and

122
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:50,019
like a row of Pistons like that and
 

123
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,130
like a row of Pistons like that and
we'll try to grow the tree like over

124
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:53,140
we'll try to grow the tree like over
 

125
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,380
we'll try to grow the tree like over
here right now in order to grow a tree

126
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:55,390
here right now in order to grow a tree
 

127
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,900
here right now in order to grow a tree
you don't actually need a place for the

128
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:57,910
you don't actually need a place for the
 

129
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,520
you don't actually need a place for the
leaves to go you just need a place for

130
00:02:59,520 --> 00:02:59,530
leaves to go you just need a place for
 

131
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,680
leaves to go you just need a place for
the the trunk right yeah okay I have to

132
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:04,690
the the trunk right yeah okay I have to
 

133
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,970
the the trunk right yeah okay I have to
go get some stuff and I have to think

134
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:05,980
go get some stuff and I have to think
 

135
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,850
go get some stuff and I have to think
how we're actually gonna do this cuz

136
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:07,860
how we're actually gonna do this cuz
 

137
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,080
how we're actually gonna do this cuz
it's a bit tricky right we got to run

138
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,090
it's a bit tricky right we got to run
 

139
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,080
it's a bit tricky right we got to run
some redstone to all these pistons how

140
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,090
some redstone to all these pistons how
 

141
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,120
some redstone to all these pistons how
do we do that underwater that's that's

142
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,130
do we do that underwater that's that's
 

143
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,599
do we do that underwater that's that's
gonna be fun so I guess we're gonna put

144
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:18,609
gonna be fun so I guess we're gonna put
 

145
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:21,870
gonna be fun so I guess we're gonna put
the sapling here we'll have a dispenser

146
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:21,880
the sapling here we'll have a dispenser
 

147
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,390
the sapling here we'll have a dispenser
with bonemeal in right to grow it and

148
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
with bonemeal in right to grow it and
 

149
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,640
with bonemeal in right to grow it and
then we're gonna need like something to

150
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:26,650
then we're gonna need like something to
 

151
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,470
then we're gonna need like something to
keep the water back so I think these

152
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480
keep the water back so I think these
 

153
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,699
keep the water back so I think these
can't be waterlogged right now the

154
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:29,709
can't be waterlogged right now the
 

155
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,199
can't be waterlogged right now the
pressure plates right then that'll go

156
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:34,209
pressure plates right then that'll go
 

157
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,630
pressure plates right then that'll go
there as long as there's a like a log

158
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
there as long as there's a like a log
 

159
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,199
there as long as there's a like a log
airspace dirt or leaf block above it

160
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,209
airspace dirt or leaf block above it
 

161
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:41,819
airspace dirt or leaf block above it
it'll be able to grow if has enough

162
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:41,829
it'll be able to grow if has enough
 

163
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:44,910
it'll be able to grow if has enough
space so I think if we go like this tall

164
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:44,920
space so I think if we go like this tall
 

165
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,640
space so I think if we go like this tall
should be fine we'll always leave a wood

166
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:47,650
should be fine we'll always leave a wood
 

167
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,930
should be fine we'll always leave a wood
block over here so that the water

168
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:48,940
block over here so that the water
 

169
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,940
block over here so that the water
doesn't pour down on the sapling and

170
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:50,950
doesn't pour down on the sapling and
 

171
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,220
doesn't pour down on the sapling and
destroy its right and then my plan here

172
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:56,230
destroy its right and then my plan here
 

173
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,729
destroy its right and then my plan here
I think we're gonna use redstone blocks

174
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:01,739
I think we're gonna use redstone blocks
 

175
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,420
I think we're gonna use redstone blocks
we run redstone blocks onto this with

176
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:05,430
we run redstone blocks onto this with
 

177
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,599
we run redstone blocks onto this with
slime blocks hopefully running over

178
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:09,609
slime blocks hopefully running over
 

179
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:10,820
slime blocks hopefully running over
there

180
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:10,830
there
 

181
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,770
there
and then probably like a sticky piston

182
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:14,780
and then probably like a sticky piston
 

183
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,160
and then probably like a sticky piston
up over here that we got to control oh

184
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,170
up over here that we got to control oh
 

185
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:23,330
up over here that we got to control oh
right over there right yeah so then we

186
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:23,340
right over there right yeah so then we
 

187
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,780
right over there right yeah so then we
can control the whole column if if this

188
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:26,790
can control the whole column if if this
 

189
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,910
can control the whole column if if this
retracts really hard to do want redstone

190
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:28,920
retracts really hard to do want redstone
 

191
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,970
retracts really hard to do want redstone
under water yeah these are tracks it'll

192
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:31,980
under water yeah these are tracks it'll
 

193
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,250
under water yeah these are tracks it'll
pull the slime blocks back and then

194
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:34,260
pull the slime blocks back and then
 

195
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,940
pull the slime blocks back and then
those all retract to right it'll create

196
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:37,950
those all retract to right it'll create
 

197
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,560
those all retract to right it'll create
a little bit of airspace and in that

198
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:39,570
a little bit of airspace and in that
 

199
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,100
a little bit of airspace and in that
moment we need to activate the dispenser

200
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,110
moment we need to activate the dispenser
 

201
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,160
moment we need to activate the dispenser
to grow the tree yeah okay so I think

202
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,170
to grow the tree yeah okay so I think
 

203
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,170
to grow the tree yeah okay so I think
all we really need to do now is just add

204
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,180
all we really need to do now is just add
 

205
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,570
all we really need to do now is just add
a clock on to this and we're we're gonna

206
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:50,580
a clock on to this and we're we're gonna
 

207
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,960
a clock on to this and we're we're gonna
be able to try it out I know how to do

208
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:53,970
be able to try it out I know how to do
 

209
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,340
be able to try it out I know how to do
the redstone I just don't know how to

210
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,350
the redstone I just don't know how to
 

211
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,140
the redstone I just don't know how to
place the redstone without it washing

212
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,150
place the redstone without it washing
 

213
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,470
place the redstone without it washing
away so that's let's try that so we

214
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:00,480
away so that's let's try that so we
 

215
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,970
away so that's let's try that so we
gotta get like a redstone torch here to

216
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:04,980
gotta get like a redstone torch here to
 

217
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,700
gotta get like a redstone torch here to
slow okay I got a hold shift while I do

218
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:07,710
slow okay I got a hold shift while I do
 

219
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:15,140
slow okay I got a hold shift while I do
this - nope nope got it right I think I

220
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,150
this - nope nope got it right I think I
 

221
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,120
this - nope nope got it right I think I
was quick enough it's extended yeah okay

222
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,130
was quick enough it's extended yeah okay
 

223
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,190
was quick enough it's extended yeah okay
so that's in there good I'm gonna go

224
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:19,200
so that's in there good I'm gonna go
 

225
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,320
so that's in there good I'm gonna go
ahead and just cover this up maybe let's

226
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,330
ahead and just cover this up maybe let's
 

227
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,540
ahead and just cover this up maybe let's
try this put that there put that there

228
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:28,550
try this put that there put that there
 

229
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,540
try this put that there put that there
I'm hoping if we get rid of what I guess

230
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:32,550
I'm hoping if we get rid of what I guess
 

231
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,380
I'm hoping if we get rid of what I guess
we got to swim into here actually okay

232
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:36,390
we got to swim into here actually okay
 

233
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,430
we got to swim into here actually okay
so what I want this is now gonna work is

234
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:40,440
so what I want this is now gonna work is
 

235
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,030
so what I want this is now gonna work is
it we got to put some repeaters here

236
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,040
it we got to put some repeaters here
 

237
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,350
it we got to put some repeaters here
this one's got to be set to at least - I

238
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
this one's got to be set to at least - I
 

239
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,820
this one's got to be set to at least - I
know redstone there hey the waters not

240
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:49,830
know redstone there hey the waters not
 

241
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,440
know redstone there hey the waters not
washing it away actually this is gonna

242
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:51,450
washing it away actually this is gonna
 

243
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,480
washing it away actually this is gonna
work

244
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:52,490
work
 

245
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,170
work
comparator here Oh actually wait a

246
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,180
comparator here Oh actually wait a
 

247
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,530
comparator here Oh actually wait a
second I'm not gonna be able to place

248
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:00,540
second I'm not gonna be able to place
 

249
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:09,310
second I'm not gonna be able to place
the hoppers so we need a hopper facing

250
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:09,320
the hoppers so we need a hopper facing
 

251
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,740
the hoppers so we need a hopper facing
well let's put this here you know hopper

252
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:12,750
well let's put this here you know hopper
 

253
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,840
well let's put this here you know hopper
facing that way and one where that sand

254
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:14,850
facing that way and one where that sand
 

255
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,080
facing that way and one where that sand
is facing the other way if I'm quick

256
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,090
is facing the other way if I'm quick
 

257
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,969
is facing the other way if I'm quick
enough I can do this without it wrecking

258
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:19,979
enough I can do this without it wrecking
 

259
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:20,390
enough I can do this without it wrecking
everything

260
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
everything
 

261
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,010
everything
all right let's let's break that and

262
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,020
all right let's let's break that and
 

263
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,420
all right let's let's break that and
then I don't think the water will flow

264
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:23,430
then I don't think the water will flow
 

265
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,010
then I don't think the water will flow
in

266
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,020
in
 

267
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,640
in
right yeah okay that's the trick let's

268
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:27,650
right yeah okay that's the trick let's
 

269
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,510
right yeah okay that's the trick let's
put this over here facing another hopper

270
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:30,520
put this over here facing another hopper
 

271
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,610
put this over here facing another hopper
and just put one item in it'll bounce

272
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:33,620
and just put one item in it'll bounce
 

273
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,810
and just put one item in it'll bounce
back and forth that activates the

274
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:37,820
back and forth that activates the
 

275
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,190
back and forth that activates the
comparator and we'll want to switch for

276
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,200
comparator and we'll want to switch for
 

277
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,450
comparator and we'll want to switch for
this so it doesn't run all the time

278
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:43,460
this so it doesn't run all the time
 

279
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,550
this so it doesn't run all the time
right

280
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
right
 

281
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,110
right
probably another important thing we'll

282
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
probably another important thing we'll
 

283
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,280
probably another important thing we'll
figure out how to do that later

284
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,290
figure out how to do that later
 

285
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:58,630
figure out how to do that later
oh I washed it away no and that is or

286
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:58,640
oh I washed it away no and that is or
 

287
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:05,590
oh I washed it away no and that is or
did I Oh two items got in oh okay it's

288
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:05,600
did I Oh two items got in oh okay it's
 

289
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,900
did I Oh two items got in oh okay it's
fine okay so is this gonna work I guess

290
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:10,910
fine okay so is this gonna work I guess
 

291
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,880
fine okay so is this gonna work I guess
we got that there so we got to get the

292
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:12,890
we got that there so we got to get the
 

293
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:19,540
we got that there so we got to get the
timing right okay so we got a little

294
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:19,550
timing right okay so we got a little
 

295
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,950
timing right okay so we got a little
problem here it doesn't seem to be

296
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
problem here it doesn't seem to be
 

297
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,780
problem here it doesn't seem to be
working I tried all the possible timing

298
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:22,790
working I tried all the possible timing
 

299
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,810
working I tried all the possible timing
combinations on the repeaters and the

300
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:25,820
combinations on the repeaters and the
 

301
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,030
combinations on the repeaters and the
tree just wouldn't grow I can't get

302
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,040
tree just wouldn't grow I can't get
 

303
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,500
tree just wouldn't grow I can't get
anything so I have a one last possible

304
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:31,510
anything so I have a one last possible
 

305
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,650
anything so I have a one last possible
idea here I think there's not actually

306
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:35,660
idea here I think there's not actually
 

307
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,410
idea here I think there's not actually
an air pockets like when the Pistons are

308
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:38,420
an air pockets like when the Pistons are
 

309
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,620
an air pockets like when the Pistons are
trapped it seems to create an air pocket

310
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:41,630
trapped it seems to create an air pocket
 

311
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,270
trapped it seems to create an air pocket
if just one or Trek's but when you have

312
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
if just one or Trek's but when you have
 

313
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,700
if just one or Trek's but when you have
a whole group of them doing it I don't

314
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:45,710
a whole group of them doing it I don't
 

315
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,860
a whole group of them doing it I don't
know it's like it doesn't it doesn't do

316
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:47,870
know it's like it doesn't it doesn't do
 

317
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,550
know it's like it doesn't it doesn't do
it anymore

318
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
it anymore
 

319
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,660
it anymore
I look at this like you see an air

320
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:52,670
I look at this like you see an air
 

321
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,760
I look at this like you see an air
pocket there air pocket there but not

322
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:54,770
pocket there air pocket there but not
 

323
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,850
pocket there air pocket there but not
like the whole column right I think that

324
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:57,860
like the whole column right I think that
 

325
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,550
like the whole column right I think that
might be the problem

326
00:07:59,550 --> 00:07:59,560
might be the problem
 

327
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,410
might be the problem
so here's my plan a little bit of a

328
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:02,420
so here's my plan a little bit of a
 

329
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,990
so here's my plan a little bit of a
tricky thing we're gonna get rid of all

330
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,000
tricky thing we're gonna get rid of all
 

331
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,320
tricky thing we're gonna get rid of all
these regular Pistons and replace them

332
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,330
these regular Pistons and replace them
 

333
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,850
these regular Pistons and replace them
with sticky pistons and you might be

334
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:09,860
with sticky pistons and you might be
 

335
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,920
with sticky pistons and you might be
like Oh eat all that what's the what's

336
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:11,930
like Oh eat all that what's the what's
 

337
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,940
like Oh eat all that what's the what's
the difference that's not gonna do

338
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:12,950
the difference that's not gonna do
 

339
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,510
the difference that's not gonna do
anything right I think it's gonna trick

340
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:16,520
anything right I think it's gonna trick
 

341
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,030
anything right I think it's gonna trick
it because what we're gonna do these are

342
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,040
it because what we're gonna do these are
 

343
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,520
it because what we're gonna do these are
gonna be sticky pistons will move the

344
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:21,530
gonna be sticky pistons will move the
 

345
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:28,030
gonna be sticky pistons will move the
tree over one block and like Pistons

346
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,040
tree over one block and like Pistons
 

347
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,010
tree over one block and like Pistons
pretty much retract instantly right so

348
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,020
pretty much retract instantly right so
 

349
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,310
pretty much retract instantly right so
it's gonna retract and I'm hoping it's

350
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:33,320
it's gonna retract and I'm hoping it's
 

351
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,410
it's gonna retract and I'm hoping it's
gonna like try to grow the tree it's

352
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:35,420
gonna like try to grow the tree it's
 

353
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,230
gonna like try to grow the tree it's
gonna see the wood above here as gonna

354
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
gonna see the wood above here as gonna
 

355
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,550
gonna see the wood above here as gonna
be like oh I can grow through that no

356
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:39,560
be like oh I can grow through that no
 

357
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,710
be like oh I can grow through that no
problem so it's gonna say yes I can grow

358
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:41,720
problem so it's gonna say yes I can grow
 

359
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,420
problem so it's gonna say yes I can grow
and then in that moment hopefully

360
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:43,430
and then in that moment hopefully
 

361
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,450
and then in that moment hopefully
afterwards these will retract and then

362
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:46,460
afterwards these will retract and then
 

363
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,110
afterwards these will retract and then
the tree will grow I don't know if it's

364
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,120
the tree will grow I don't know if it's
 

365
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,870
the tree will grow I don't know if it's
gonna work I don't know how it goes down

366
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
gonna work I don't know how it goes down
 

367
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
gonna work I don't know how it goes down
in the game code right so I guess we'll

368
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:54,890
in the game code right so I guess we'll
 

369
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,250
in the game code right so I guess we'll
just have to try it and see so I'm gonna

370
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,260
just have to try it and see so I'm gonna
 

371
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,759
just have to try it and see so I'm gonna
move this over

372
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:01,769

 

373
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:08,579

hmm Oh a groove Hey it grew when the

374
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:08,589
hmm Oh a groove Hey it grew when the
 

375
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:14,130
hmm Oh a groove Hey it grew when the
logs were there's no that's special but

376
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,140
logs were there's no that's special but
 

377
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,769
logs were there's no that's special but
if we just got to be a little bit longer

378
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:16,779
if we just got to be a little bit longer
 

379
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:24,210
if we just got to be a little bit longer
than probably at least two ticks stead

380
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:24,220
than probably at least two ticks stead
 

381
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:37,860
than probably at least two ticks stead
of oatmeal oh man oh it works oh my

382
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:37,870
of oatmeal oh man oh it works oh my
 

383
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,759
of oatmeal oh man oh it works oh my
goodness it works it works oh snap

384
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:41,769
goodness it works it works oh snap
 

385
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:46,889
goodness it works it works oh snap
finally got it we're gonna run out of

386
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:46,899
finally got it we're gonna run out of
 

387
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:47,910
finally got it we're gonna run out of
oatmeal but we're gonna try to get one

388
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
oatmeal but we're gonna try to get one
 

389
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,040
oatmeal but we're gonna try to get one
more gross there we go look at that

390
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,050

 

391
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,360

oh-ho okay so the final settings let's

392
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,370
oh-ho okay so the final settings let's
 

393
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,120
oh-ho okay so the final settings let's
shut this thing off

394
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,130
shut this thing off
 

395
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,139
shut this thing off
final settings I had to play with the

396
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:01,149
final settings I had to play with the
 

397
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:02,699
final settings I had to play with the
timing a bunch here so I guess this is

398
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:02,709
timing a bunch here so I guess this is
 

399
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:07,199
timing a bunch here so I guess this is
at 4:00 from the comparator to there and

400
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:07,209
at 4:00 from the comparator to there and
 

401
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:11,400
at 4:00 from the comparator to there and
on this side I doubled up the redstone

402
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,410
on this side I doubled up the redstone
 

403
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,590
on this side I doubled up the redstone
torches so there was one here on this

404
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:16,600
torches so there was one here on this
 

405
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,870
torches so there was one here on this
log like this right and then there's

406
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
log like this right and then there's
 

407
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,850
log like this right and then there's
another one over here right there uh-huh

408
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:23,860
another one over here right there uh-huh
 

409
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,829
another one over here right there uh-huh
so it's not it's not a good tree farm

410
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
so it's not it's not a good tree farm
 

411
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,290
so it's not it's not a good tree farm
it's snow it's doesn't create any leaves

412
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:28,300
it's snow it's doesn't create any leaves
 

413
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,030
it's snow it's doesn't create any leaves
so you don't get any drops or anything

414
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,040
so you don't get any drops or anything
 

415
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,519
so you don't get any drops or anything
but it works underwater and that was the

416
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:32,529
but it works underwater and that was the
 

417
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:35,400
but it works underwater and that was the
challenge so there we go guys we got it

418
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,410
challenge so there we go guys we got it
 

419
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,710
challenge so there we go guys we got it
I was actually pretty worried there for

420
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:37,720
I was actually pretty worried there for
 

421
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,449
I was actually pretty worried there for
a moment I wasn't gonna get it get it

422
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:39,459
a moment I wasn't gonna get it get it
 

423
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:43,680
a moment I wasn't gonna get it get it
working but okay now so we want to add

424
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:43,690
working but okay now so we want to add
 

425
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,110
working but okay now so we want to add
some extra features to our little tree

426
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,120
some extra features to our little tree
 

427
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,259
some extra features to our little tree
from here now so gotten a chest here for

428
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:49,269
from here now so gotten a chest here for
 

429
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:53,100
from here now so gotten a chest here for
extra bone meal feed into the dispenser

430
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,110
extra bone meal feed into the dispenser
 

431
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,990
extra bone meal feed into the dispenser
there right

432
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,000
there right
 

433
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,420
there right
also we want to add an on/off switch to

434
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:57,430
also we want to add an on/off switch to
 

435
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,870
also we want to add an on/off switch to
it so I was thinking probably the way to

436
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
it so I was thinking probably the way to
 

437
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,590
it so I was thinking probably the way to
do that is to get like a sticky piston

438
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:04,600
do that is to get like a sticky piston
 

439
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,900
do that is to get like a sticky piston
here

440
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:05,910
here
 

441
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,079
here
with a redstone block if the redstone

442
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:09,089
with a redstone block if the redstone
 

443
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:10,850
with a redstone block if the redstone
block is under the hopper here it'll

444
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:10,860
block is under the hopper here it'll
 

445
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,740
block is under the hopper here it'll
lock it so that this will stop bouncing

446
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:12,750
lock it so that this will stop bouncing
 

447
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,240
lock it so that this will stop bouncing
back and forth and shuts off the clock

448
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,250
back and forth and shuts off the clock
 

449
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,110
back and forth and shuts off the clock
right and then we'll just add like maybe

450
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,120
right and then we'll just add like maybe
 

451
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,620
right and then we'll just add like maybe
a trapdoor here with a observer

452
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:21,630
a trapdoor here with a observer
 

453
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,900
a trapdoor here with a observer
underneath all right and then redstone

454
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:26,910
underneath all right and then redstone
 

455
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,769
underneath all right and then redstone
dust so when we flip it flips the piston

456
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:30,779
dust so when we flip it flips the piston
 

457
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:35,240
dust so when we flip it flips the piston
right flip it down shuts off on off very

458
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,250
right flip it down shuts off on off very
 

459
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,600
right flip it down shuts off on off very
good that's what we want let's go ahead

460
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:38,610
good that's what we want let's go ahead
 

461
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,610
good that's what we want let's go ahead
and fill this in without destroying the

462
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:40,620
and fill this in without destroying the
 

463
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,040
and fill this in without destroying the
redstone hopefully got to leave a space

464
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,050
redstone hopefully got to leave a space
 

465
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,009
redstone hopefully got to leave a space
there for that so maybe let's just let's

466
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:46,019
there for that so maybe let's just let's
 

467
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,499
there for that so maybe let's just let's
toss that will put sandstone there

468
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:48,509
toss that will put sandstone there
 

469
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:53,090
toss that will put sandstone there
sandstone is the trick here okay and

470
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,100
sandstone is the trick here okay and
 

471
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,930
sandstone is the trick here okay and
then that there good

472
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:57,940
then that there good
 

473
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,240
then that there good
should be good okay so that then over

474
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,250
should be good okay so that then over
 

475
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,250
should be good okay so that then over
here I added a piston to push the log

476
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:03,260
here I added a piston to push the log
 

477
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,780
here I added a piston to push the log

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,660
so I only found I got a zombie head in
my inventory but that's it I was kind of

634
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:47,670
my inventory but that's it I was kind of
 

635
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,010
my inventory but that's it I was kind of
hoping we'd get a whole bunch at once

636
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,020
hoping we'd get a whole bunch at once
 

637
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:54,500
hoping we'd get a whole bunch at once
there with the big explosion but I think

638
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:54,510
there with the big explosion but I think
 

639
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,790
there with the big explosion but I think
it only gives you one at a time I guess

640
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:57,800
it only gives you one at a time I guess
 

641
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,460
it only gives you one at a time I guess

front go down there and before I had a

652
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
front go down there and before I had a
 

653
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,549
front go down there and before I had a
piston translocation elevator to get

654
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
piston translocation elevator to get
 

655
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,309
piston translocation elevator to get
back up but that's been removed from the

656
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:25,319
back up but that's been removed from the
 

657
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,840
back up but that's been removed from the
game for a couple updates now I haven't

658
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:26,850
game for a couple updates now I haven't
 

659
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,730
game for a couple updates now I haven't
fixed it yet I think in our world

660
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:28,740
fixed it yet I think in our world
 

661
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,680
fixed it yet I think in our world
there's two of those I haven't fixed

662
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:30,690
there's two of those I haven't fixed
 

663
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,980
there's two of those I haven't fixed

elevator and now that we got the bubble

666
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
elevator and now that we got the bubble
 

667
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,600
elevator and now that we got the bubble
streams probably just rip this out and

668
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:38,610
streams probably just rip this out and
 

669
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:51,190
streams probably just rip this out and
fill it up with water and and bubbles

670
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200

 

671
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,080

right yeah there we go we got our way

672
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,090
right yeah there we go we got our way
 

673
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,090
right yeah there we go we got our way
back up nice and quick very simple so

674
00:17:59,090 --> 00:17:59,100
back up nice and quick very simple so
 

675
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,399
back up nice and quick very simple so
I'm probably gonna put some doors to

676
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:01,409
I'm probably gonna put some doors to
 

677
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,320
I'm probably gonna put some doors to
keep the water in place here I guess I

678
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:03,330
keep the water in place here I guess I
 

679
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,060
keep the water in place here I guess I
should have done this first right I

680
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,070
should have done this first right I
 

681
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,379
should have done this first right I
think I'm gonna take that water out

682
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:06,389
think I'm gonna take that water out
 

683
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:09,619
think I'm gonna take that water out
there put a block here so I can stand

684
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:09,629
there put a block here so I can stand
 

685
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:12,259
there put a block here so I can stand
here I think we gotta be facing this way

686
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:12,269
here I think we gotta be facing this way
 

687
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:15,820
here I think we gotta be facing this way
to place the doors yeah there we go

688
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:15,830
to place the doors yeah there we go
 

689
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,960
to place the doors yeah there we go
so that'll hold all the water in place

690
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:17,970
so that'll hold all the water in place
 

691
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,600
so that'll hold all the water in place
let's break this put the water back

692
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:20,610
let's break this put the water back
 

693
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:33,980
let's break this put the water back
there we go very simple elevator okay

694
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:33,990
there we go very simple elevator okay
 

695
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,080
there we go very simple elevator okay
and the second elevator I wanted to fix

696
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,090
and the second elevator I wanted to fix
 

697
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,909
and the second elevator I wanted to fix
here is the one hidden behind the

698
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:37,919
here is the one hidden behind the
 

699
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,610
here is the one hidden behind the
waterfall you guys remember we started

700
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:40,620
waterfall you guys remember we started
 

701
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,409
waterfall you guys remember we started
building this when the lighter wings

702
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:42,419
building this when the lighter wings
 

703
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,119
building this when the lighter wings
first came out before you could launch

704
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:44,129
first came out before you could launch
 

705
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:46,879
first came out before you could launch
yourself with the firework fireworks to

706
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:46,889
yourself with the firework fireworks to
 

707
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:49,159
yourself with the firework fireworks to
get a speed burst right so this is as

708
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:49,169
get a speed burst right so this is as
 

709
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,230
get a speed burst right so this is as
far as it could make it before then we

710
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,240
far as it could make it before then we
 

711
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,149
far as it could make it before then we
had the wall here and then we had a

712
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:53,159
had the wall here and then we had a
 

713
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:55,580
had the wall here and then we had a
bunch of piston trans locators pushing a

714
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:55,590
bunch of piston trans locators pushing a
 

715
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,190
bunch of piston trans locators pushing a
sideways through the tunnel here I just

716
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:58,200
sideways through the tunnel here I just
 

717
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,810
sideways through the tunnel here I just
ripped those all out all the Redstone

718
00:18:59,810 --> 00:18:59,820
ripped those all out all the Redstone
 

719
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,820
ripped those all out all the Redstone
with them because it doesn't work

720
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:01,830
with them because it doesn't work
 

721
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,590
with them because it doesn't work
anymore that would take you around the

722
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
anymore that would take you around the
 

723
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,180
anymore that would take you around the
bend here and then we had piston

724
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,190
bend here and then we had piston
 

725
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,950
bend here and then we had piston
translocator elevator to bring us up

726
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:06,960
translocator elevator to bring us up
 

727
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,310
translocator elevator to bring us up
here and I refilled this with water so I

728
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
here and I refilled this with water so I
 

729
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,619
here and I refilled this with water so I
just gotta gotta get something in this

730
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:12,629
just gotta gotta get something in this
 

731
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:16,009
just gotta gotta get something in this
area to replace the tunnel horizontal

732
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:16,019
area to replace the tunnel horizontal
 

733
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:18,980
area to replace the tunnel horizontal
tunnel but we have a way up now might

734
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:18,990
tunnel but we have a way up now might
 

735
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,779
tunnel but we have a way up now might
just flood that area with water and

736
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:20,789
just flood that area with water and
 

737
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:22,999
just flood that area with water and
maybe put a dolphin down there and we

738
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:23,009
maybe put a dolphin down there and we
 

739
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:26,289
maybe put a dolphin down there and we
just swim through that whole section

740
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:26,299
just swim through that whole section
 

741
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:30,169
just swim through that whole section
yeah we have a way back up here now into

742
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:30,179
yeah we have a way back up here now into
 

743
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,700
yeah we have a way back up here now into
the library so that's cool that's all

744
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:31,710
the library so that's cool that's all
 

745
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,539
the library so that's cool that's all
fixed mm-hmm okay guys so we're back at

746
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:35,549
fixed mm-hmm okay guys so we're back at
 

747
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,580
fixed mm-hmm okay guys so we're back at
the base here I got this thing refilled

748
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:37,590
the base here I got this thing refilled
 

749
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,279
the base here I got this thing refilled
with bonemeal kind of I've used a bunch

750
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:40,289
with bonemeal kind of I've used a bunch
 

751
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:41,659
with bonemeal kind of I've used a bunch
up already

752
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:41,669
up already
 

753
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:43,369
up already
so I've been testing it out with other

754
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:43,379
so I've been testing it out with other
 

755
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:46,219
so I've been testing it out with other
types of trees I thought it would work

756
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:46,229
types of trees I thought it would work
 

757
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:48,440
types of trees I thought it would work
with everything except the dark oak and

758
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:48,450
with everything except the dark oak and
 

759
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,949
with everything except the dark oak and
acacia but it seems like it's only

760
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:51,959
acacia but it seems like it's only
 

761
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:54,859
acacia but it seems like it's only
working with oak we have tried to grow

762
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:54,869
working with oak we have tried to grow
 

763
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:56,269
working with oak we have tried to grow
spruce I've tried to jungle I've tried

764
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:56,279
spruce I've tried to jungle I've tried
 

765
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,469
spruce I've tried to jungle I've tried
birch none of them seem to be growing

766
00:19:59,469 --> 00:19:59,479
birch none of them seem to be growing
 

767
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:04,339
birch none of them seem to be growing
and I'm wondering maybe I misunderstand

768
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:04,349
and I'm wondering maybe I misunderstand
 

769
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:07,039
and I'm wondering maybe I misunderstand
something about how trees work so I set

770
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,049
something about how trees work so I set
 

771
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:11,409
something about how trees work so I set
up a test here how did it grow already

772
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:11,419
up a test here how did it grow already
 

773
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,699
up a test here how did it grow already
no it didn't okay I was looking at this

774
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:13,709
no it didn't okay I was looking at this
 

775
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:16,969
no it didn't okay I was looking at this
tree yeah does it have to be a birch log

776
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:16,979
tree yeah does it have to be a birch log
 

777
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:20,930
tree yeah does it have to be a birch log
above this to grow or can it be any type

778
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:20,940
above this to grow or can it be any type
 

779
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,440
above this to grow or can it be any type
of log any type of log okay yeah so I

780
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,450
of log any type of log okay yeah so I
 

781
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,329
of log any type of log okay yeah so I
guess just oak trees work underwater

782
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:26,339
guess just oak trees work underwater
 

783
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:29,869
guess just oak trees work underwater
with our current setup I'm not exactly

784
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:29,879
with our current setup I'm not exactly
 

785
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:33,259
with our current setup I'm not exactly
sure what's the other trees check that

786
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:33,269
sure what's the other trees check that
 

787
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:36,999
sure what's the other trees check that
would prevent them from growing

788
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:37,009

 

789
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:41,029

but yeah I've left this run for so I'm

790
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,039
but yeah I've left this run for so I'm
 

791
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,889

00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:01,289
really so yeah anyways after a tree
 

803
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:03,709
really so yeah anyways after a tree
grows so you step here the piston pushes

804
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:03,719
grows so you step here the piston pushes
 

805
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:06,739
grows so you step here the piston pushes
it sideways activates the dispenser so

806
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:06,749
it sideways activates the dispenser so
 

807
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:11,199
it sideways activates the dispenser so
we did an extra sapling and we plants

808
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:11,209
we did an extra sapling and we plants
 

809
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:13,549

oh yeah this is the idea of how the farm

814
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
oh yeah this is the idea of how the farm
 

815
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,200
oh yeah this is the idea of how the farm
works and then once you get like 12

816
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,210
works and then once you get like 12
 

817
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,350
works and then once you get like 12
grown you go and you get mine this so

818
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,360
grown you go and you get mine this so
 

819
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,540
grown you go and you get mine this so
you mine this out actually you know what

820
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:33,550
you mine this out actually you know what
 

821
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,370
you mine this out actually you know what
I did my challenge for today I got the

822
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:35,380
I did my challenge for today I got the
 

823
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,110
I did my challenge for today I got the
underwater tree farm working right

824
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,120
underwater tree farm working right
 

825
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,030
underwater tree farm working right
that's what I wanted to do I'll leave

826
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,040
that's what I wanted to do I'll leave

this as a challenge for you guys can you
 

829
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,830
this as a challenge for you guys can you
get it to work with other types of trees

830
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:42,840
get it to work with other types of trees
 

831
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,560
get it to work with other types of trees
like birch spruce jungle I'd be

832
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:46,570
like birch spruce jungle I'd be
 

833
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,670
like birch spruce jungle I'd be
surprised if you got it to work with

834
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:47,680
surprised if you got it to work with
 

835
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,320
surprised if you got it to work with
acacia but you could probably get it to

836
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,330
acacia but you could probably get it to
 

837
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,610
acacia but you could probably get it to
work with dark oak even uh-huh

838
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:53,620
work with dark oak even uh-huh
 

839
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,080
work with dark oak even uh-huh
can you figure it out so that's that's

840
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,090
can you figure it out so that's that's

for the rest this episode we might try
 

845
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,420
for the rest this episode we might try
make like a sea pickle farm - its kind

846
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:03,430
make like a sea pickle farm - its kind
 

847
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,210
make like a sea pickle farm - its kind
of curious how how that would work so I

848
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:06,220
of curious how how that would work so I
 

849
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,440
of curious how how that would work so I
think you got to grow them on corals

850
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,450
think you got to grow them on corals
 

851
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,310
think you got to grow them on corals
right is that the idea I keep saying

00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:11,320
right is that the idea I keep saying
 

853
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,980
right is that the idea I keep saying
right today I don't know why you get

854
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:13,990
right today I don't know why you get
 

855
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,930
right today I don't know why you get

would say rats and I had that bad habit

870
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:34,390
would say rats and I had that bad habit
 

871
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,890
would say rats and I had that bad habit
for a long time and I keep beating these

872
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:37,900
for a long time and I keep beating these
 

873
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,570
for a long time and I keep beating these
habits but then I pick up a new word

874
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:39,580
habits but then I pick up a new word
 

875
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,240
habits but then I pick up a new word
that I say constantly I can't get I

876
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,250
that I say constantly I can't get I
 

877
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,540
that I say constantly I can't get I
can't get it's perfect ever uh-huh

878
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:45,550
can't get it's perfect ever uh-huh
 

879
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,840

where's my bow meal guys I'll just I'll

880
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:48,850
where's my bow meal guys I'll just I'll
 

881

more somewhere else so okay so can you

884
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960
more somewhere else so okay so can you
 

885
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,020
more somewhere else so okay so can you
grow them outside of the coral reef so

886
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,030
grow them outside of the coral reef so
 

887
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:03,000
grow them outside of the coral reef so
plant them down here yes you can okay so

888
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,010
plant them down here yes you can okay so
 

889
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,850
plant them down here yes you can okay so
you just got a bow meal at once

890
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:04,860
you just got a bow meal at once
 

891
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,380
you just got a bow meal at once
is that the idea yeah got four again got

892
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:10,390
is that the idea yeah got four again got
 

893
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,790
is that the idea yeah got four again got
four again okay so you just got a bow

894
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:11,800
four again okay so you just got a bow
 

895
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,790
four again okay so you just got a bow
meal at once I thought it would would be

896
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:14,800
meal at once I thought it would would be
 

897
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,060
meal at once I thought it would would be
one for each each pickle all right can't

898
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,070
one for each each pickle all right can't
 

899
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,690
one for each each pickle all right can't
plant these sideways no if it's on sand

900
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:21,700
plant these sideways no if it's on sand
 

901
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:27,300
plant these sideways no if it's on sand
it doesn't work okay right yeah okay

902
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:27,310
it doesn't work okay right yeah okay
 

903
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,620
it doesn't work okay right yeah okay
so let's see if we can figure something

904
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:28,630
so let's see if we can figure something
 

905
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:34,260
so let's see if we can figure something
out here okay can auto plant them wasn't

906
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:34,270
out here okay can auto plant them wasn't
 

907
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,730
out here okay can auto plant them wasn't
expecting to but it's always worth

908
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:35,740
expecting to but it's always worth
 

909
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,380
expecting to but it's always worth
trying

910
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:36,390
trying
 

911
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,750
trying
ah so fill this up with bone meal see if

912
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:39,760
ah so fill this up with bone meal see if
 

913
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,010
ah so fill this up with bone meal see if
we can get an auto grow them with

914
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:41,020
we can get an auto grow them with
 

915
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,820
we can get an auto grow them with
dispensers that you probably can right

916
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:44,830
dispensers that you probably can right
 

917
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,170
dispensers that you probably can right
yeah look at that

918
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:46,180
yeah look at that
 

919
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,660
yeah look at that
okay that's good that's really good so

920
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:48,670
okay that's good that's really good so
 

921
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:53,670
okay that's good that's really good so
can we let's get an observer maybe see

922
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:53,680
can we let's get an observer maybe see
 

923
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,990
can we let's get an observer maybe see
if we can detect the growth snake it

924
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
if we can detect the growth snake it
 

925
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,570
if we can detect the growth snake it
over this way this way that'll make it a

926
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:03,580
over this way this way that'll make it a
 

927
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,450
over this way this way that'll make it a
constant loop though oh well we'll try

928
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:06,460
constant loop though oh well we'll try
 

929
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,520
constant loop though oh well we'll try
it here so I think we gotta replace two

930
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:08,530
it here so I think we gotta replace two
 

931
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,240
it here so I think we gotta replace two
of those blocks with trap doors right

932
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,250
of those blocks with trap doors right
 

933
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,790
of those blocks with trap doors right
there put that there

934
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:14,800
there put that there
 

935
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,430
there put that there
oh oh

936
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440

 

937
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:31,730

J can we stop the jump from going okay

938
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:31,740
J can we stop the jump from going okay
 

939
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,030
J can we stop the jump from going okay
interesting

940
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,040
interesting
 

941
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,980
interesting
I don't want the kelp to grow though

942
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:34,990
I don't want the kelp to grow though
 

943
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,120
I don't want the kelp to grow though
that's it's wasting bone meal let's add

944
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,130
that's it's wasting bone meal let's add
 

945
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:43,160
that's it's wasting bone meal let's add
another trap door here and observer here

946
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,170
another trap door here and observer here
 

947
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,230
another trap door here and observer here
okay

948
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:45,240
okay
 

949
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,370
okay
I'm wondering if we can pick up the

950
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:47,380
I'm wondering if we can pick up the
 

951
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,230
I'm wondering if we can pick up the
water after grows oh it shot out the

952
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,240
water after grows oh it shot out the
 

953
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,600
water after grows oh it shot out the
budget too okay let's try plant this

954
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:56,610

 

955
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,890

okay it's picking up the water but it's

956
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:58,900
okay it's picking up the water but it's
 

957
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:06,800
okay it's picking up the water but it's
not it's not dealing the sea pickle huh

958
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:06,810
not it's not dealing the sea pickle huh
 

959
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:13,020
not it's not dealing the sea pickle huh
so they don't need water interesting I

960
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,030
so they don't need water interesting I
 

961
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,410
so they don't need water interesting I
just make light they do though alright

962
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:16,420
just make light they do though alright
 

963
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,590
just make light they do though alright
take that away yeah okay they need water

964
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:19,600
take that away yeah okay they need water
 

965
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,330
take that away yeah okay they need water
for light okay and they need water to

966
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:24,340
for light okay and they need water to
 

967
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,730
for light okay and they need water to
multiply - uh-huh

968
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:26,740
multiply - uh-huh
 

969
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,770
multiply - uh-huh
okay I don't have it yet here but I feel

970
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:28,780
okay I don't have it yet here but I feel
 

971
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,710
okay I don't have it yet here but I feel
like we might be getting close so I got

972
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:31,720
like we might be getting close so I got
 

973
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,200
like we might be getting close so I got
two coral blocks this is a regular

974
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,210
two coral blocks this is a regular
 

975
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,020
two coral blocks this is a regular
piston this is a sticky piston got two

976
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,030
piston this is a sticky piston got two
 

977
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,200
piston this is a sticky piston got two
observers this one activates this piston

978
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,210
observers this one activates this piston
 

979
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:40,740
observers this one activates this piston
this one

980
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:40,750
this one
 

981
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,200
this one
it's this piston alright dispenser in

982
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,210
it's this piston alright dispenser in
 

983
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,540
it's this piston alright dispenser in
the middle here and then trapdoors

984
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:45,550
the middle here and then trapdoors
 

985
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:48,150
the middle here and then trapdoors
attached to these blocks to activate the

bonemeal basically if we spam

988
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:51,220
bonemeal basically if we spam
 

989
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,890
bonemeal basically if we spam
right-click right now this is what

990
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:52,900
right-click right now this is what
 

991
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:59,550
right-click right now this is what
happens which feels like or maybe it is

992
00:25:59,550 --> 00:25:59,560
happens which feels like or maybe it is

growing I saw it grow a couple times

994
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,030
growing I saw it grow a couple times
 

995
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,070
growing I saw it grow a couple times
there at least I don't know if it's

996
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,080
there at least I don't know if it's
 

997
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,070
there at least I don't know if it's
growing every time I think it might be

998
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,080
growing every time I think it might be
 

999
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,720
growing every time I think it might be
growing one of the times and the other

1000
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:09,730
growing one of the times and the other
 

1001
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,360
growing one of the times and the other
time it doesn't it's really hard to tell

1002
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:12,370
time it doesn't it's really hard to tell
 

1003
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,860
time it doesn't it's really hard to tell
because it's so fast I do have more than

1004
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:16,870
because it's so fast I do have more than
 

1005
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,450
because it's so fast I do have more than
I started with it's okay so it's doing

1006
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:18,460
I started with it's okay so it's doing
 

1007
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,730
I started with it's okay so it's doing
something I don't know if it's perfect

1008
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:20,740
something I don't know if it's perfect
 

1009
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,450
something I don't know if it's perfect
though wait a minute wait a minutes this

1010
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:24,460
though wait a minute wait a minutes this
 

1011
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,660
though wait a minute wait a minutes this
is not kelp this is sea grass and seeing

1012
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:27,670
is not kelp this is sea grass and seeing
 

1013
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,340
is not kelp this is sea grass and seeing
it wrong the whole episode this is kelp

1014
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:29,350
it wrong the whole episode this is kelp
 

1015
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,670
it wrong the whole episode this is kelp
over here aha okay let's see if any of

1016
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:32,680
over here aha okay let's see if any of
 

1017
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,410
over here aha okay let's see if any of
the seed grass grows when we do this

1018
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:34,420
the seed grass grows when we do this
 

1019
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,610
the seed grass grows when we do this
because if it does that means it's

1020
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:35,620
because if it does that means it's
 

1021
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:39,920
because if it does that means it's
missing some of the times yeah okay so

1022
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:39,930
missing some of the times yeah okay so
 

1023
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:43,550
missing some of the times yeah okay so
[Music]

1024
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:43,560

 

1025
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,500

yeah it's it's alternating between

1026
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:46,510
yeah it's it's alternating between
 

1027
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,440
yeah it's it's alternating between
working and not working right now so

1028
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:49,450
working and not working right now so
 

1029
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,570
working and not working right now so
which which ones working which ones not

1030
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:51,580
which which ones working which ones not
 

1031
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,190
which which ones working which ones not
let's try get rid of this side so the

1032
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:56,200
let's try get rid of this side so the
 

1033
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,020
let's try get rid of this side so the
bone meal won't activate when this one

1034
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,030
bone meal won't activate when this one
 

1035
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:02,010
bone meal won't activate when this one
activates see if we only get seagrass or

1036
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:02,020
activates see if we only get seagrass or
 

1037
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:10,480
activates see if we only get seagrass or
if we only get growth

1038
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:10,490

 

1039
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,240

it's really hard to tell okay let's put

1040
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,250
it's really hard to tell okay let's put
 

1041
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,150
it's really hard to tell okay let's put
this one back let's get rid of this one

1042
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:17,160
this one back let's get rid of this one
 

1043
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,730
this one back let's get rid of this one
see if cuz we're getting seagrass still

1044
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:19,740
see if cuz we're getting seagrass still
 

1045
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,350
see if cuz we're getting seagrass still
we don't want to get seagrass because

1046
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
we don't want to get seagrass because
 

1047
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,980
we don't want to get seagrass because
that's wasting bone meal we're still

1048
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:27,990
that's wasting bone meal we're still
 

1049
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,840
that's wasting bone meal we're still
getting cigarettes okay I'm not really

1050
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:29,850
getting cigarettes okay I'm not really
 

1051
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:35,840
getting cigarettes okay I'm not really
sure maybe timing is definitely not

1052
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:35,850
sure maybe timing is definitely not
 

1053
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,850
sure maybe timing is definitely not
right though mm-hmm

1054
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:37,860
right though mm-hmm
 

1055
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,039
right though mm-hmm
okay so if it's working perfectly we

1056
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:40,049
okay so if it's working perfectly we
 

1057
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,110
okay so if it's working perfectly we
should get three stacks of sea pickles

1058
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,120
should get three stacks of sea pickles
 

1059
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,250
should get three stacks of sea pickles
per stack a bone meal which did not get

1060
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:46,260
per stack a bone meal which did not get
 

1061
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,710
per stack a bone meal which did not get
it working perfectly this is probably my

1062
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:48,720
it working perfectly this is probably my
 

1063
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,510
it working perfectly this is probably my
best best version over here right now

1064
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:50,520
best best version over here right now
 

1065
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,730
best best version over here right now
though still fairly compact and

1066
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:54,740
though still fairly compact and
 

1067
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,230
though still fairly compact and
basically I got two dispensers with this

1068
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:57,240
basically I got two dispensers with this
 

1069
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,810
basically I got two dispensers with this
version so I'm gonna split it half in

1070
00:27:59,810 --> 00:27:59,820
version so I'm gonna split it half in
 

1071
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,480
version so I'm gonna split it half in
there half in there works pretty quickly

1072
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:02,490
there half in there works pretty quickly
 

1073
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,630
there half in there works pretty quickly
but it is not perfect here we go all

1074
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:05,640
but it is not perfect here we go all
 

1075
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,530
but it is not perfect here we go all
right hold right click

1076
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:09,540

 

1077
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,900

and it varies between these two on

1078
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:11,910
and it varies between these two on
 

1079
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:19,100
and it varies between these two on
finding the grout okay so we got a stack

1080
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,110
finding the grout okay so we got a stack
 

1081
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,410
finding the grout okay so we got a stack
in seven that we started with eight so

1082
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:21,420
in seven that we started with eight so
 

1083
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,160
in seven that we started with eight so
it's about one-third the efficiency all

1084
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,170
it's about one-third the efficiency all
 

1085
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,440
it's about one-third the efficiency all
right let's do another run just to see

1086
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:27,450
right let's do another run just to see
 

1087
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,550
right let's do another run just to see
how it varies at its best I've gotten

1088
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:31,560
how it varies at its best I've gotten
 

1089
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,770
how it varies at its best I've gotten
like two stacks at its worst like one

1090
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:33,780
like two stacks at its worst like one
 

1091
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:40,910
like two stacks at its worst like one
sack okay let's go again all depends on

1092
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:40,920
sack okay let's go again all depends on
 

1093
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,500
sack okay let's go again all depends on
like when you when you hold right click

1094
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:42,510
like when you when you hold right click
 

1095
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,570
like when you when you hold right click
probably depends on how frequently your

1096
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:44,580
probably depends on how frequently your
 

1097
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,640
probably depends on how frequently your
must updates and stuff to do I don't

1098
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:46,650
must updates and stuff to do I don't
 

1099
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:52,660
must updates and stuff to do I don't
know that time we got a stacked in 25 so

1100
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:52,670

 

1101
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,900

yeah all right

1102
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:55,910
yeah all right
 

1103
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,380
yeah all right
the other version I made here we can

1104
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:00,390
the other version I made here we can
 

1105
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,240
the other version I made here we can
just put in one dispenser as well I

1106
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,250
just put in one dispenser as well I
 

1107
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,030
just put in one dispenser as well I
should say and then I think it's more

1108
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,040
should say and then I think it's more
 

1109
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,410
should say and then I think it's more
efficient but it takes a little bit

1110
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:06,420
efficient but it takes a little bit
 

1111
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:15,180
efficient but it takes a little bit
longer right

1112
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,190

 

1113
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:21,550

3240 yeah I think it's about the same

1114
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:21,560
3240 yeah I think it's about the same
 

1115
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:27,160
3240 yeah I think it's about the same
action how's it out already okay yeah a

1116
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,170
action how's it out already okay yeah a
 

1117
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,140
action how's it out already okay yeah a
little go stacking for there so maybe

1118
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,150
little go stacking for there so maybe
 

1119
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,710
little go stacking for there so maybe
it's not better actually uh-huh anyways

1120
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:32,720
it's not better actually uh-huh anyways
 

1121
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,970
it's not better actually uh-huh anyways
the other version I came up with over

1122
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:33,980
the other version I came up with over
 

1123
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,070
the other version I came up with over
here is a little bit difference so I got

1124
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,080
here is a little bit difference so I got
 

1125
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,570
here is a little bit difference so I got
slime blocks underneath the coral and

1126
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:39,580
slime blocks underneath the coral and
 

1127
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,870
slime blocks underneath the coral and
basically you place the CD pickle here

1128
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880
basically you place the CD pickle here
 

1129
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,490
basically you place the CD pickle here
updates this observer goes around here

1130
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:45,500
updates this observer goes around here
 

1131
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,400
updates this observer goes around here
activates a trapdoor sends power to a

1132
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,410
activates a trapdoor sends power to a
 

1133
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,090
activates a trapdoor sends power to a
dispenser just one dispenser on this one

1134
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,100
dispenser just one dispenser on this one
 

1135
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,830
dispenser just one dispenser on this one
then power passes through the dispenser

1136
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:53,840
then power passes through the dispenser
 

1137
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,440
then power passes through the dispenser
to a trapdoor down to the sticky piston

1138
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:56,450
to a trapdoor down to the sticky piston
 

1139
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,090
to a trapdoor down to the sticky piston
over here only one piston with this

1140
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,100
over here only one piston with this
 

1141
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,630
over here only one piston with this
design instead of two um so you load it

1142
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:01,640
design instead of two um so you load it
 

1143
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,840
design instead of two um so you load it
up here well if you don't have bone meal

1144
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:04,850
up here well if you don't have bone meal
 

1145
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:09,010
up here well if you don't have bone meal
in it basically does that once you add

1146
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:09,020
in it basically does that once you add
 

1147
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:16,190
in it basically does that once you add
the bone meal though

1148
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,200

 

1149
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,609

not working super great problem is if

1150
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:19,619
not working super great problem is if
 

1151
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,799
not working super great problem is if
you hold right click you place more than

1152
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:21,809
you hold right click you place more than
 

1153
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:25,369
you hold right click you place more than
one sometimes that lowers your

1154
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:25,379
one sometimes that lowers your
 

1155
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:30,139
one sometimes that lowers your
efficiency I don't even think we're

1156
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:30,149
efficiency I don't even think we're
 

1157
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:36,769
efficiency I don't even think we're
gonna break a stack here yeah so if you

1158
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:36,779
gonna break a stack here yeah so if you
 

1159
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:38,779
gonna break a stack here yeah so if you
watch it so sometimes when you place it

1160
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:38,789
watch it so sometimes when you place it
 

1161
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:41,629
watch it so sometimes when you place it
you see we just place down three before

1162
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:41,639
you see we just place down three before
 

1163
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,879
you see we just place down three before
it updated yeah so that's kind of the

1164
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:43,889
it updated yeah so that's kind of the
 

1165
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:45,560
it updated yeah so that's kind of the
problem with this design over here like

1166
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:45,570
problem with this design over here like
 

1167
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,109
problem with this design over here like
it takes so long from the time you place

1168
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:48,119
it takes so long from the time you place
 

1169
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:50,810
it takes so long from the time you place
this before the piston finally moves it

1170
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:50,820
this before the piston finally moves it
 

1171
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,580
this before the piston finally moves it
that you usually place down three and

1172
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:52,590
that you usually place down three and
 

1173
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,680
that you usually place down three and
then the bonemeal only will grow one

1174
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:54,690
then the bonemeal only will grow one
 

1175
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,109
then the bonemeal only will grow one
instead of like one turning into four

1176
00:30:57,109 --> 00:30:57,119
instead of like one turning into four
 

1177
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,669
instead of like one turning into four
right it's three into four this design

1178
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:01,679
right it's three into four this design
 

1179
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,139
right it's three into four this design
works a lot better though if you don't

1180
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:03,149
works a lot better though if you don't
 

1181
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:05,029
works a lot better though if you don't
hold right click if you just like tap it

1182
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
hold right click if you just like tap it
 

1183
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,669
hold right click if you just like tap it
like two times the second so let's try

1184
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:07,679
like two times the second so let's try
 

1185
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,960
like two times the second so let's try
that instead I'm gonna ice the kind of

1186
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:11,970
that instead I'm gonna ice the kind of
 

1187
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,039
that instead I'm gonna ice the kind of
place to do that it's right clicking

1188
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:16,049
place to do that it's right clicking
 

1189
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:20,349
place to do that it's right clicking
like once a second maybe twice a second

1190
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:20,359
like once a second maybe twice a second
 

1191
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:24,840
like once a second maybe twice a second
you should get a lot more this way

1192
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:24,850

 

1193
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:31,100

NetWare over a stack almost two stacks

1194
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,110
NetWare over a stack almost two stacks
 

1195
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,160
NetWare over a stack almost two stacks
yeah so we almost got like 60 probably

1196
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,170
yeah so we almost got like 60 probably
 

1197
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:40,500
yeah so we almost got like 60 probably
about 60% efficiency 50 to 60 so yeah I

1198
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:40,510
about 60% efficiency 50 to 60 so yeah I
 

1199
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,720
about 60% efficiency 50 to 60 so yeah I
like I like this design over here though

1200
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:42,730
like I like this design over here though
 

1201
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,740
like I like this design over here though
because I don't have to think when I'm

1202
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,750
because I don't have to think when I'm
 

1203
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,660
because I don't have to think when I'm
doing it and just accept that you're

1204
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:45,670
doing it and just accept that you're
 

1205
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,480
doing it and just accept that you're
only getting about 33% efficiency but

1206
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,490
only getting about 33% efficiency but
 

1207
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,920
only getting about 33% efficiency but
it's pretty quick and bonemeal is

1208
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:49,930
it's pretty quick and bonemeal is
 

1209
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,770
it's pretty quick and bonemeal is
basically free so I don't care right

1210
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:51,780
basically free so I don't care right
 

1211
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:58,250
basically free so I don't care right
uh-huh can be improved a lot though oh

1212
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:58,260

 

1213
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:03,750

there we go there we go I'm gonna get

1214
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:03,760
there we go there we go I'm gonna get
 

1215
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,080
there we go there we go I'm gonna get
rid of that skeleton if we blow up a

1216
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,090
rid of that skeleton if we blow up a
 

1217
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,970
rid of that skeleton if we blow up a
charged creeper with a charged creeper

1218
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:08,980
charged creeper with a charged creeper
 

1219
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,680
charged creeper with a charged creeper
we should still get the creeper head

1220
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:10,690
we should still get the creeper head
 

1221
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:21,750
we should still get the creeper head
right I would think so oh man okay here

1222
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,760
right I would think so oh man okay here
 

1223
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:28,230
right I would think so oh man okay here
we go guys oh okay okay

1224
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:28,240
we go guys oh okay okay
 

1225
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,560
we go guys oh okay okay
did that work yes we got that creeper

1226
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:31,570
did that work yes we got that creeper
 

1227
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:37,710
did that work yes we got that creeper
head awesome okay that's how to do it

1228
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:37,720
head awesome okay that's how to do it
 

1229
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
head awesome okay that's how to do it
get them in the water and it's a lot

1230
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:39,730
get them in the water and it's a lot
 

1231
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:43,950
get them in the water and it's a lot
safer I kind of wish they kept it like

1232
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:43,960
safer I kind of wish they kept it like
 

1233
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,870
safer I kind of wish they kept it like
there was in the past like all mob heads

1234
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:45,880
there was in the past like all mob heads
 

1235
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,240
there was in the past like all mob heads
used to be a lot smaller and my headband

1236
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,250
used to be a lot smaller and my headband
 

1237
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,280
used to be a lot smaller and my headband
would go over the creeper face and it

1238
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,290
would go over the creeper face and it
 

1239
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,660
would go over the creeper face and it
looked really cool the mast and the

1240
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:51,670
looked really cool the mast and the
 

1241
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,950
looked really cool the mast and the
headband like covered over the mob head

1242
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:54,960
headband like covered over the mob head
 

1243
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,390
headband like covered over the mob head
but now it's just that's all you can see

1244
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:57,400
but now it's just that's all you can see
 

1245
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,040
but now it's just that's all you can see
now oh well I want to use this creeper

1246
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,050
now oh well I want to use this creeper
 

1247
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,720
now oh well I want to use this creeper
head for a banner though make thick my

1248
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:03,730
head for a banner though make thick my
 

1249
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,990
head for a banner though make thick my
etho banner finally but we're gonna wrap

1250
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:07,000
etho banner finally but we're gonna wrap
 

1251
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,820
etho banner finally but we're gonna wrap
up here for today guys I think so let's

1252
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:08,830
up here for today guys I think so let's
 

1253
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,250
up here for today guys I think so let's
check out the comment of the day it says

1254
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:11,260
check out the comment of the day it says
 

1255
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,120
check out the comment of the day it says
it's a good question how so you even

1256
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,130
it's a good question how so you even
 

1257
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:18,870
it's a good question how so you even
light em caves how do you find all the

1258
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:18,880
light em caves how do you find all the
 

1259
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,190
light em caves how do you find all the
caves very good question very good

1260
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,200
caves very good question very good
 

1261
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,560
caves very good question very good
question so I said recently that I lit

1262
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:25,570
question so I said recently that I lit
 

1263
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,660
question so I said recently that I lit
up all the caves or a lot of the caves
