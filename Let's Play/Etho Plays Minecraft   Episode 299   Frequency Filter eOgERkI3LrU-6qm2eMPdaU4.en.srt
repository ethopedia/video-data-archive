but yeah a new snapshot the rendering
 

51
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,149
but yeah a new snapshot the rendering
has changed once again and

52
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
has changed once again and
 

53
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,469
has changed once again and
i believe it has been improved or fixed

54
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479

59
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,670

that's all i do for now uh the first

60
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
that's all i do for now uh the first
 

61
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,550
that's all i do for now uh the first
thing i looked at

62
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
thing i looked at
 

63
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,550
thing i looked at
is the leaves the leaves seem like

64
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
is the leaves the leaves seem like
 

65
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,789
is the leaves the leaves seem like
they're back the way they were before

66
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
they're back the way they were before
 

67
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,789
they're back the way they were before
uh before they looked really transparent

68
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
uh before they looked really transparent
 

69
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,630
uh before they looked really transparent
and weird from a distance

70
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
and weird from a distance
 

71
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,270
and weird from a distance
and i i'm thinking maybe what that was

72
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
and i i'm thinking maybe what that was
 

73
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,830
and i i'm thinking maybe what that was
was

74
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
was
 

75
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,230
was
not all the sides were rendering on the

76
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
not all the sides were rendering on the
 

77
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,310
not all the sides were rendering on the
leaves and now they are again

78
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
leaves and now they are again
 

79
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,510
leaves and now they are again
maybe this is with mitt mapping on

80
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
maybe this is with mitt mapping on
 

81
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,190
maybe this is with mitt mapping on
but you can tell even stuff in the

82
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
but you can tell even stuff in the
 

83
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,550
but you can tell even stuff in the
distance like if you look at that tree

84
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
distance like if you look at that tree
 

85
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,350
distance like if you look at that tree
there it's

86
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
there it's
 

87
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,550
there it's
it's transparent um before

88
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
it's transparent um before
 

89
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,830
it's transparent um before
the leaf blocks looked like they were

90
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
the leaf blocks looked like they were
 

91
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,990
the leaf blocks looked like they were
like solid blocks almost like wool

92
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
like solid blocks almost like wool
 

93
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,069
like solid blocks almost like wool
from a distance and now they have the

94
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
from a distance and now they have the
 

95
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,030
from a distance and now they have the
texture back to them it's good

96
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
texture back to them it's good
 

97
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,270
texture back to them it's good
and the sky the sky looks really neat

98
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
and the sky the sky looks really neat
 

99
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,109

worked on this portal network idea i had
 

133
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,470
worked on this portal network idea i had
an idea so crazy it might just work uh

134

an idea so crazy it might just work uh
 

135
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,949
an idea so crazy it might just work uh
and we we got a bit done here we got our

136
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959
and we we got a bit done here we got our
 

137
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,550
and we we got a bit done here we got our
portal set up we have a few of these

138
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
portal set up we have a few of these
 

139
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,509
portal set up we have a few of these
done now

140
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
done now
 

141
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,750
done now
uh where we can light it we can clear it

142
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
uh where we can light it we can clear it
 

143
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,990

148
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
and then we also have our four second
 

149
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,149
and then we also have our four second
timer we put in

150
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
timer we put in
 

151
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,630
timer we put in
which will let us go through and close

152
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
which will let us go through and close
 

153
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,190
which will let us go through and close
the portal behind us

154
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
the portal behind us
 

155
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,430
the portal behind us
and now we're going to connect our

156
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
and now we're going to connect our
 

157
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,509
and now we're going to connect our
portals together today

158
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
portals together today
 

159
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,149
portals together today
and that will let us to transfer between

160
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
and that will let us to transfer between
 

161
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,949
and that will let us to transfer between
them

162
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959

 

163
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,710

we couldn't do that last time because i

164
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
we couldn't do that last time because i
 

165
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,390
we couldn't do that last time because i
had to come up with a

166
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
had to come up with a
 

167
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,830
had to come up with a
filter design redstone pulse length

168
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
filter design redstone pulse length
 

169
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,229
filter design redstone pulse length
filter i guess you could call it

170
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
filter i guess you could call it
 

171
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,149
filter i guess you could call it
i'm not exactly sure the technical

i'm not exactly sure the technical
 

173
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,589
i'm not exactly sure the technical
jargon for it but

174
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
jargon for it but
 

175
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,229
jargon for it but
basically had to come up with a device

176
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
basically had to come up with a device
 

177
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,789
basically had to come up with a device
that would let me

178
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
that would let me
 

179
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,630
that would let me
determine if if it's a

181
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,390
determine if if it's a
short false if it's let me try again

182
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
short false if it's let me try again
 

183
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,670

i i made a device that lets me tell if

i i made a device that lets me tell if
the pulse of a redstone signal is

186
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
the pulse of a redstone signal is
 

187
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,910
the pulse of a redstone signal is
exactly a certain length

188
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
exactly a certain length
 

189
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,990
exactly a certain length
that's what i needed so if it's too

00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
that's what i needed so if it's too
 

191
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,190

195
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,630

this and it can send
 

231
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,430
this and it can send
information through the line to other

and then we're gonna start setting those
 

295
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,710
and then we're gonna start setting those
up and once we've got three of them done

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
up and once we've got three of them done
 

297

complicated and that's it's not too bad
for people out there that don't like

340
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
for people out there that don't like
 

341
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,350
for people out there that don't like
redstone

342
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
redstone
 

343
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,430
redstone
you look at this doesn't make a lot of

344
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
you look at this doesn't make a lot of
 

345
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,469
you look at this doesn't make a lot of
sense

346
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
sense
 

347
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,990
sense
maybe maybe you understand it

348
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
maybe maybe you understand it
 

349
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,990
maybe maybe you understand it
but like when you have a lot of redstone

350
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
but like when you have a lot of redstone
 

351
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,430
but like when you have a lot of redstone
around and there's

352
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
around and there's
 

353
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,270
around and there's
all these little devices in it it looks

354
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
all these little devices in it it looks
 

355
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,710
all these little devices in it it looks
really complicated it's not

356
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
really complicated it's not
 

357
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,870
really complicated it's not
too bad once you understand like all

358
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
too bad once you understand like all
 

359
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,550
too bad once you understand like all
this here is just

360
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
this here is just
 

361
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,110
this here is just
to do a simple function you don't think

362
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
to do a simple function you don't think
 

363
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,230
to do a simple function you don't think
about redstone

364
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
about redstone
 

365
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,990
about redstone
and i need to put a repeater here and

366
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
and i need to put a repeater here and
 

367
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,670
and i need to put a repeater here and
here and here and torch there and

368
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
here and here and torch there and
 

369
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,550
here and here and torch there and
that you just think of it okay i want

370
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
that you just think of it okay i want
 

371
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,150
that you just think of it okay i want
this function to happen

372
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
this function to happen
 

373
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,629
this function to happen
so i need to put this device in and then

374
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
so i need to put this device in and then
 

375
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,150
so i need to put this device in and then
you copy it

376
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
you copy it
 

377
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,870
you copy it
if if you do enough redstone you can

378
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
if if you do enough redstone you can
 

379
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,230
if if you do enough redstone you can
remember how to build stuff from

380
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
remember how to build stuff from
 

381
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,870
remember how to build stuff from
experience and maybe even tweak it

382
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
experience and maybe even tweak it
 

383
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,950
experience and maybe even tweak it
um but otherwise you can just look at

384
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
um but otherwise you can just look at
 

385
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,790
um but otherwise you can just look at
guides and and figure stuff out

386
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
guides and and figure stuff out
 

387
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,270
guides and and figure stuff out
but i will run you through this anyway

388
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
but i will run you through this anyway
 

389
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,950
but i will run you through this anyway
really quick here

390
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960

 

391
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,710

so again what this thing does is it

392
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
so again what this thing does is it
 

393
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,350
so again what this thing does is it
checks if my input signal is exactly

394
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
checks if my input signal is exactly
 

395
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,510
checks if my input signal is exactly
a certain length and if it is it will

396
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
a certain length and if it is it will
 

397
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,950
a certain length and if it is it will
send out

398
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
send out
 

399
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,990
send out
an output over here right and my

400
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
an output over here right and my
 

401
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,430
an output over here right and my
input currently is a stone button which

402
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
input currently is a stone button which
 

403
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,309
input currently is a stone button which
is exactly

404
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
is exactly
 

405
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,350
is exactly
10 ticks or one second

406
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
10 ticks or one second
 

407
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,189
10 ticks or one second
and i have this configured to let the

408
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
and i have this configured to let the
 

409
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,430
and i have this configured to let the
signal through here if it's exactly 10

410
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
signal through here if it's exactly 10
 

411
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,869
signal through here if it's exactly 10
ticks so if i press this

412
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
ticks so if i press this
 

413
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,150
ticks so if i press this
there we go you can ignore this piston

414
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
there we go you can ignore this piston
 

415
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,230
there we go you can ignore this piston
by the way i'm just using that to check

416
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
by the way i'm just using that to check
 

417
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,629
by the way i'm just using that to check
how long the output is if it's one tick

418
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
how long the output is if it's one tick
 

419
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,150
how long the output is if it's one tick
like that

420
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
like that
 

421
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,230
like that
a sticky piston will leave the block

422
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
a sticky piston will leave the block
 

423
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,510
a sticky piston will leave the block
behind so that's that's how

424
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
behind so that's that's how
 

425
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,830
behind so that's that's how
i know it was exactly one tick output um

426
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
i know it was exactly one tick output um
 

427
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,589
i know it was exactly one tick output um
so i can configure this let's uh let's

428
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
so i can configure this let's uh let's
 

429
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,909
so i can configure this let's uh let's
ignore this right side first off

430
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
ignore this right side first off
 

431
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,589
ignore this right side first off
this from here

432
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
this from here
 

433
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,070
this from here
this area here this device is just used

434
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
this area here this device is just used
 

435
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,509
this area here this device is just used
to tell if the signal

436
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
to tell if the signal
 

437
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,190
to tell if the signal
is if my input is

438
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
is if my input is
 

439
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,750
is if my input is
less than something and if it is then

440
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
less than something and if it is then
 

441
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,430
less than something and if it is then
don't let the signal through this

442
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
don't let the signal through this
 

443
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,269
don't let the signal through this
torch so um if i press this

444
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:55,279
torch so um if i press this
 

445
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,430
torch so um if i press this
actually let me get a this is probably a

446
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
actually let me get a this is probably a
 

447
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,790
actually let me get a this is probably a
better way of doing it

448
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
better way of doing it
 

449
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,829
better way of doing it
we're going to go through this quick

450
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
we're going to go through this quick
 

451
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,310
we're going to go through this quick
don't worry i'm just about done um

452
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
don't worry i'm just about done um
 

453
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,750
don't worry i'm just about done um
if i send it a quick pulse that

454
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
if i send it a quick pulse that
 

455
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,150
if i send it a quick pulse that
switch that torch doesn't change if it's

456
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
switch that torch doesn't change if it's
 

457
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,190
switch that torch doesn't change if it's
a long pulse

458
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
a long pulse
 

459
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,829
a long pulse
it does all right and if it's a long

460
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
it does all right and if it's a long
 

461
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,670
it does all right and if it's a long
pulsing i use this right side

462
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
pulsing i use this right side
 

463
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,110
pulsing i use this right side
to tell if it's too long which is if it

464
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
to tell if it's too long which is if it
 

465
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,190
to tell if it's too long which is if it
goes over by one tick

466
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
goes over by one tick
 

467
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,790
goes over by one tick
and then it won't let it through because

468
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
and then it won't let it through because
 

469
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,350
and then it won't let it through because
this piston retracts

470
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360

 

471
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,590

and can't even see it

472
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
and can't even see it
 

473
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,230
and can't even see it
you see this comes right when that gets

474
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
you see this comes right when that gets
 

475
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,150
you see this comes right when that gets
back and you

476
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
back and you
 

477
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,350
back and you
i don't want to hear it from you you go

478
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
i don't want to hear it from you you go
 

479
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,630
i don't want to hear it from you you go
away

480
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
away
 

481
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,590
away
now if i use a long longer pulse like

482
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600
now if i use a long longer pulse like
 

483
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,949
now if i use a long longer pulse like
this would button

484
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
this would button
 

485
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,230
this would button
which is 15 ticks or 1.5 seconds

486
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
which is 15 ticks or 1.5 seconds
 

487
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,990
which is 15 ticks or 1.5 seconds
so time a half longer this powered no

488
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
so time a half longer this powered no
 

489
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,030
so time a half longer this powered no
okay

490
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
okay
 

491
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,550
okay
um you can see it sent the pulse

492
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
um you can see it sent the pulse
 

493
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,030
um you can see it sent the pulse
way before this block came back so

494
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040

 

495
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,630

that's basically how it works and then

496
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
that's basically how it works and then
 

497
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,190
that's basically how it works and then
this device here is a pulse shortener so

498
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
this device here is a pulse shortener so
 

499
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,350
this device here is a pulse shortener so
it takes the 15 ticks from our wood

500
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
it takes the 15 ticks from our wood
 

501
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,750
it takes the 15 ticks from our wood
button here and makes it

502
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
button here and makes it
 

503
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,350
button here and makes it
a shorter amount depending on what we

504
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
a shorter amount depending on what we
 

505
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,590
a shorter amount depending on what we
set these two and we can finally tune it

506
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
set these two and we can finally tune it
 

507
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,030
set these two and we can finally tune it
to the tick

508
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
to the tick
 

509
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,870
to the tick
so this is by the way what i'm going to

510
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
so this is by the way what i'm going to
 

511
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,630
so this is by the way what i'm going to
be putting outside of the portals

512
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
be putting outside of the portals
 

513
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,750
be putting outside of the portals
to communicate which of the portals i

514
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
to communicate which of the portals i
 

515
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,069
to communicate which of the portals i
want

516
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
want
 

517
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,269
want
open and each each of these ticks is

518
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
open and each each of these ticks is
 

519
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,630
open and each each of these ticks is
going to represent a different portal

520
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
going to represent a different portal
 

521
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,990
going to represent a different portal
so right now i have it set for

522
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
so right now i have it set for
 

523
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,350
so right now i have it set for
a 10 tick pulse so it will match

524
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
a 10 tick pulse so it will match
 

525
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,630
a 10 tick pulse so it will match
what we had over there and you saw that

526
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
what we had over there and you saw that
 

527
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,470
what we had over there and you saw that
piston it did its thing

528
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
piston it did its thing
 

529
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,230
piston it did its thing
maybe we'll put the block back just to

530
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
maybe we'll put the block back just to
 

531
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,470
maybe we'll put the block back just to
make sure

532
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
make sure
 

533
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,750
make sure
the output doesn't matter like the

534
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
the output doesn't matter like the
 

535
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,750
the output doesn't matter like the
length of it really

536
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
length of it really
 

537
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,069
length of it really
i'm just curious oops

538
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079

 

539
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,430

button glitch i still don't know why

540
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
button glitch i still don't know why
 

541
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,670
button glitch i still don't know why
that happens it happens once a little

542
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
that happens it happens once a little
 

543
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,269
that happens it happens once a little
while it's rare though

544
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279

 

545
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,069

okay so now if we were to make it one

546
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
okay so now if we were to make it one
 

547
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:04,470
okay so now if we were to make it one
tick

548
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
tick
 

549
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,150
tick
longer

550
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160

 

551
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,389

no go if it was one tick shorter no go

552
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
no go if it was one tick shorter no go
 

553
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:14,790
no go if it was one tick shorter no go
so

554
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
so
 

555
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,389
so
that this is nine ticks let's make it

556
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:16,399
that this is nine ticks let's make it
 

557
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,269
that this is nine ticks let's make it
back to 10.

558
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279

 

559
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,150

there we go so it's very fine tuned and

560
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
there we go so it's very fine tuned and
 

561
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,910
there we go so it's very fine tuned and
we can adjust what length we want

562
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
we can adjust what length we want
 

563
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,949
we can adjust what length we want
based on how many repeaters or what we

564
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:26,959
based on how many repeaters or what we
 

565
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,550
based on how many repeaters or what we
set this to so this would be one tick

566
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
set this to so this would be one tick
 

567
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,350
set this to so this would be one tick
shorter for

568
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
shorter for
 

569
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,350
shorter for
so nine ticks now press it at ten

570
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
so nine ticks now press it at ten
 

571
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,430
so nine ticks now press it at ten
doesn't work anymore shorten it one

572
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
doesn't work anymore shorten it one
 

573
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,710
doesn't work anymore shorten it one
please work there we go it works

574
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
please work there we go it works
 

575
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,269
please work there we go it works
yay so that that's the device that's

576
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
yay so that that's the device that's
 

577
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,630
yay so that that's the device that's
figured out i'm going to start setting

578
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
figured out i'm going to start setting
 

579
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,389
figured out i'm going to start setting
these up at each of the portals

580
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
these up at each of the portals
 

581
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,190
these up at each of the portals
and we should be able to test it so see

582
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
and we should be able to test it so see
 

583
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,110
and we should be able to test it so see
you in a bit

584
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120

 

585
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,870

well quite a bit of time actually passed

586
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:56,880
well quite a bit of time actually passed
 

587
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,069
well quite a bit of time actually passed
but i did get three actually pretty much

588
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
but i did get three actually pretty much
 

589
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,509
but i did get three actually pretty much
four of them done

590
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
four of them done
 

591
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,110
four of them done
uh it's now late at night though and i

592
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
uh it's now late at night though and i
 

593
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,350
uh it's now late at night though and i
might sound a bit tired so we will have

594
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
might sound a bit tired so we will have
 

595
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,350
might sound a bit tired so we will have
to wrap up this episode

596
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,360
to wrap up this episode
 

597
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,670
to wrap up this episode
um probably soon um but yeah we got some

598
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
um probably soon um but yeah we got some
 

599
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,110
um probably soon um but yeah we got some
stuff done here

600
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
stuff done here
 

601
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,230
stuff done here
uh this one's done this one's done

602
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
uh this one's done this one's done
 

603
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,509
uh this one's done this one's done
got all these crazy redstone things

604
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:19,519
got all these crazy redstone things
 

605
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,949
got all these crazy redstone things
going on back here but

606
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
going on back here but
 

607
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,110
going on back here but
again as i said you break it down and

608
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
again as i said you break it down and
 

609
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,790
again as i said you break it down and
it's really not that much it's

610
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
it's really not that much it's
 

611
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,310
it's really not that much it's
uh two or three basic functions we have

612
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
uh two or three basic functions we have
 

613
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,310
uh two or three basic functions we have
the timer for

614
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
the timer for
 

615
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,430
the timer for
uh the portal here and we have the

616
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
uh the portal here and we have the
 

617
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,550
uh the portal here and we have the
the filter over here and that's about it

618
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
the filter over here and that's about it
 

619
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,430
the filter over here and that's about it
back here

620
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
back here
 

621
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,990
back here
it's those two those two things are

622
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
it's those two those two things are
 

623
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,509
it's those two those two things are
taking up most of space

624
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519
taking up most of space
 

625
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,110
taking up most of space
um so

626
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
um so
 

627
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,949
um so
one of these is actually giving me

628
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
one of these is actually giving me
 

629
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,470
one of these is actually giving me
trouble and i'm not sure

630
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
trouble and i'm not sure
 

631
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,509
trouble and i'm not sure
why but we can try this out this is my

632
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
why but we can try this out this is my
 

633
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,389
why but we can try this out this is my
selector panel here and this is just

634
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
selector panel here and this is just
 

635
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,350
selector panel here and this is just
temporary i'm going to

636
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
temporary i'm going to
 

637
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,310
temporary i'm going to
change this up a bit and most likely try

638
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
change this up a bit and most likely try
 

639
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,509
change this up a bit and most likely try
to purify this whole area if we can

640
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
to purify this whole area if we can
 

641
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,509
to purify this whole area if we can
but this one i have set at

642
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
but this one i have set at
 

643
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,190
but this one i have set at
five i think i can go quicker than that

644
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
five i think i can go quicker than that
 

645
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,910
five i think i can go quicker than that
actually

646
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
actually
 

647
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,509
actually
but that's the lowest setting i have

648
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
but that's the lowest setting i have
 

649
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,350
but that's the lowest setting i have
currently this one's at six

650
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
currently this one's at six
 

651
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,710
currently this one's at six
we have another one down there that's

652
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720
we have another one down there that's
 

653
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,949
we have another one down there that's
set at seven

654
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
set at seven
 

655
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,190
set at seven
um it's like setting the frequency on

656
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
um it's like setting the frequency on
 

657
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,069
um it's like setting the frequency on
this so

658
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
this so
 

659
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,069
this so
now when we click the button let's see

660
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
now when we click the button let's see
 

661
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,350
now when we click the button let's see
i think uh

662
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360

 

663
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,470

this is the first one that's going to

664
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
this is the first one that's going to
 

665
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,829
this is the first one that's going to
come on let's see if it comes on with

666
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:32,839
come on let's see if it comes on with
 

667
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,069
come on let's see if it comes on with
this

668
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:34,079
this
 

669
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,310
this
oh let's try this one

670
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320

 

671
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,710

no this one definitely this one

672
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
no this one definitely this one
 

673
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,629
no this one definitely this one
ah so that portal came on now if we go

674
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:48,639
ah so that portal came on now if we go
 

675
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,150
ah so that portal came on now if we go
to

676
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
to
 

677
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,470
to
eights on here well no i guess that

678
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
eights on here well no i guess that
 

679
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,910
eights on here well no i guess that
would be ten

680
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
would be ten
 

681
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,590
would be ten
um that one goes off that one goes on

682
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600

 

683
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,150

and then the one that's giving me

684
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
and then the one that's giving me
 

685
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,509
and then the one that's giving me
trouble here this might not actually

686
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
trouble here this might not actually
 

687
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,870
trouble here this might not actually
work

688
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880

 

689
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,870

but this one down here is supposed to

690
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
but this one down here is supposed to
 

691
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,350
but this one down here is supposed to
turn on

692
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
turn on
 

693
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,949
turn on
let's go check it out

694
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959

 

695
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,430

no it didn't work so what's happening is

696
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,440
no it didn't work so what's happening is
 

697
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,550
no it didn't work so what's happening is
actually why didn't that work that's at

698
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
actually why didn't that work that's at
 

699
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,829
actually why didn't that work that's at
seven

700
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
seven
 

701
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,189
seven
i should have worked it didn't get stuck

702
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
i should have worked it didn't get stuck
 

703
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,750
i should have worked it didn't get stuck
as far as i can tell that's all good

704
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760

 

705
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,269

wait a minute um i don't know if these

706
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
wait a minute um i don't know if these
 

707
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:37,670
wait a minute um i don't know if these
uh

708
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
uh
 

709
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,870
uh
two-way repeaters don't work maybe

710
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
two-way repeaters don't work maybe
 

711
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,829
two-way repeaters don't work maybe
i'm a little concerned

712
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
i'm a little concerned
 

713
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,150
i'm a little concerned
okay let's try this out what did we have

714
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
okay let's try this out what did we have
 

715
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,030
okay let's try this out what did we have
that at

716
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040

 

717
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,710

is this it is what we want

718
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
is this it is what we want
 

719
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,710
is this it is what we want
yeah what is this this is uh four five

720
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
yeah what is this this is uh four five
 

721
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,269
yeah what is this this is uh four five
seven eleven i'm pretty sure that's what

722
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
seven eleven i'm pretty sure that's what
 

723
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:01,910
seven eleven i'm pretty sure that's what
we had that

724
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
we had that
 

725
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,910
we had that
at go back

726
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:05,920
at go back
 

727
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,509
at go back
once it's all set up we will have to run

728
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
once it's all set up we will have to run
 

729
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,350
once it's all set up we will have to run
back and forth like this

730
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
back and forth like this
 

731
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,389
back and forth like this
um eleven four five

732
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399

 

733
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,670

seven eleven

734
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680

 

735
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,790

i don't know

736
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:22,800

 

737
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,949

okay let's clear this if i press it

738
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
okay let's clear this if i press it
 

739
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:25,990
okay let's clear this if i press it
again for the same one

740
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
again for the same one
 

741
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,150
again for the same one
it goes off and on just fine

742
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160

 

743
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,829

11.

744
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839

 

745
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,030

okay let's go back here

746
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
okay let's go back here
 

747
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,269
okay let's go back here
it works if i turn those ones on from

748
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
it works if i turn those ones on from
 

749
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,470
it works if i turn those ones on from
here though

750
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
here though
 

751
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,990
here though
which is weird see those get stuck

752
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
which is weird see those get stuck
 

753
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,590
which is weird see those get stuck
anywhere

754
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
anywhere
 

755
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,350
anywhere
those look fine this didn't turn on

756
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
those look fine this didn't turn on
 

757
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,310
those look fine this didn't turn on
again though

758
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320

 

759
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,509

man what is going on and it doesn't look

760
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
man what is going on and it doesn't look
 

761
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,150
man what is going on and it doesn't look
like they got

762
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
like they got
 

763
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,509
like they got
stuck like they were before

764
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
stuck like they were before
 

765
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,590
stuck like they were before
did any of these get stuck doesn't look

766
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:01,600
did any of these get stuck doesn't look
 

767
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,470
did any of these get stuck doesn't look
like it

768
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480

 

769
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,550

very confusing but anyway maybe we

770
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
very confusing but anyway maybe we
 

771
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,749
very confusing but anyway maybe we
should try out

772
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
should try out
 

773
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,110
should try out
try these out and see if they actually

774
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
try these out and see if they actually
 

775
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,430
try these out and see if they actually
do what i want them to do

776
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
do what i want them to do
 

777
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,710
do what i want them to do
so let's let's try turn one of those

778
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:14,720
so let's let's try turn one of those
 

779
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,670
so let's let's try turn one of those
ones on from

780
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
ones on from
 

781
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,829
ones on from
here um so

782
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839

 

783
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,829

10. was the one for the stronghold i'm

784
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
10. was the one for the stronghold i'm
 

785
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,110
10. was the one for the stronghold i'm
going to put signs

786
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
going to put signs
 

787
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,910
going to put signs
and have a code for each one that way i

788
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
and have a code for each one that way i
 

789
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,430
and have a code for each one that way i
can remember because right now i'm just

790
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
can remember because right now i'm just
 

791
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,150
can remember because right now i'm just
kind of

792
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
kind of
 

793
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,749
kind of
guessing from memory oh wait that didn't

794
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
guessing from memory oh wait that didn't
 

795
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,829
guessing from memory oh wait that didn't
work either

796
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
work either
 

797
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,710
work either
what maybe i'll look in this one one

798
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
what maybe i'll look in this one one
 

799
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,509
what maybe i'll look in this one one
second

800
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519

 

801
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,150

okay i looked into the problem and i'm

802
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
okay i looked into the problem and i'm
 

803
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,670
okay i looked into the problem and i'm
almost positive i know

804
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
almost positive i know
 

805
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,230
almost positive i know
what's going on now so this is what's

806
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240
what's going on now so this is what's
 

807
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,749
what's going on now so this is what's
happening by the way this

808
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
happening by the way this
 

809
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,150
happening by the way this
is getting stuck like it's getting stuck

810
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
is getting stuck like it's getting stuck
 

811
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,509
is getting stuck like it's getting stuck
in the powered state

812
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519
in the powered state
 

813
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,150
in the powered state
these aren't turning off and this

814
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
these aren't turning off and this
 

815
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,710
these aren't turning off and this
happened

816
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
happened
 

817
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,949
happened
when i pressed this button up here

818
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959

 

819
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,429

when it was at this setting so this is

820
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
when it was at this setting so this is
 

821
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,870
when it was at this setting so this is
four

822
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
four
 

823
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,630

exact
 

833
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,590
exact
pulse length i have here but

834
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
pulse length i have here but
 

835
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,150
pulse length i have here but
uh that wire comes down here it goes

836
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
uh that wire comes down here it goes
 

837
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,270
uh that wire comes down here it goes
through one of these

838
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
through one of these
 

839
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,590
through one of these
two of these no problem

840
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
two of these no problem
 

841
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,510
two of these no problem
this one over here is fine it doesn't go

842
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
this one over here is fine it doesn't go
 

843
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,870
this one over here is fine it doesn't go
through there though

844
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
through there though
 

845
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,549
through there though
uh three

846
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559

 

847
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,750

four

848
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:43,760

 

849
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,710

and then finally the fifth one glitches

850
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
and then finally the fifth one glitches
 

851
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,029
and then finally the fifth one glitches
out

852
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
out
 

853
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,789
out
the block gets stuck behind so that

854
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
the block gets stuck behind so that
 

855
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,310
the block gets stuck behind so that
means this only got powered

856
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
means this only got powered
 

857
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,830
means this only got powered
for one tick this piston here

858
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
for one tick this piston here
 

859
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,669
for one tick this piston here
and left the block behind and now it's

860
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
and left the block behind and now it's
 

861
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,110
and left the block behind and now it's
stuck powered

862
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
stuck powered
 

863
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,230
stuck powered
if i hit it again it'll pull it back but

864
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
if i hit it again it'll pull it back but
 

865
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,110
if i hit it again it'll pull it back but
you know we need it to work the way we

866
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
you know we need it to work the way we
 

867
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,750
you know we need it to work the way we
want

868
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:03,760
want
 

869
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,870
want
so that fixes it

870
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880

 

871
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,390

so pretty sure this is the issue

872
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
so pretty sure this is the issue
 

873
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,150
so pretty sure this is the issue
if it's sending

874
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,160
if it's sending
 

875
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,830
if it's sending
i've heard that these pistons take 1.5

876
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
i've heard that these pistons take 1.5
 

877
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,990
i've heard that these pistons take 1.5
ticks to extend i'm i'm not exactly sure

878
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
ticks to extend i'm i'm not exactly sure
 

879
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,950
ticks to extend i'm i'm not exactly sure
what it is

880
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
what it is
 

881
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,990
what it is
in game it's two ticks

882
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
in game it's two ticks
 

883
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,789
in game it's two ticks
but when you combine them like this it

884
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
but when you combine them like this it
 

885
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,430
but when you combine them like this it
might be

886
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
might be
 

887
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,870
might be
less but anyway these are extending

888
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:30,880
less but anyway these are extending
 

889
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,990
less but anyway these are extending
pistons take time to extend

890
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
pistons take time to extend
 

891
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,669
pistons take time to extend
so this one extends that one extends

892
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
so this one extends that one extends
 

893
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,150
so this one extends that one extends
that one that one that one i've

894
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
that one that one that one i've
 

895
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,510
that one that one that one i've
inadvertently

896
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
inadvertently
 

897
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,549
inadvertently
used instant wire here because when this

898
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
used instant wire here because when this
 

899
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,590
used instant wire here because when this
goes off

900
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:45,600
goes off
 

901
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,830
goes off
this instantly retracts this instantly

902
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
this instantly retracts this instantly
 

903
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,190
this instantly retracts this instantly
retracts and

904
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
retracts and
 

905
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,870
retracts and
and all the way down the chain here

906
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
and all the way down the chain here
 

907
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,270
and all the way down the chain here
meanwhile the pulse is still going

908
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
meanwhile the pulse is still going
 

909
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,190
meanwhile the pulse is still going
through this one and then

910
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
through this one and then
 

911
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,230
through this one and then
then that retracts instantly and the

912
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
then that retracts instantly and the
 

913
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,150
then that retracts instantly and the
pulse goes away basically

914
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
pulse goes away basically
 

915
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,230
pulse goes away basically
if i had one more in here it would

916
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
if i had one more in here it would
 

917
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,950
if i had one more in here it would
uh they wouldn't make it to it so

918
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
uh they wouldn't make it to it so
 

919
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,789
uh they wouldn't make it to it so
i have to change these i have to do

920
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
i have to change these i have to do
 

921
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,630
i have to change these i have to do
something with them i can't use instant

922
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640
something with them i can't use instant
 

923
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,310
something with them i can't use instant
wire with this it needs to carry the

924
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
wire with this it needs to carry the
 

925
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,909
wire with this it needs to carry the
signal exactly like i

926
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
signal exactly like i
 

927
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,029
signal exactly like i
had it um so

928
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
had it um so
 

929
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,190
had it um so
a bit of an issue i'm gonna have to work

930
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
a bit of an issue i'm gonna have to work
 

931
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,110
a bit of an issue i'm gonna have to work
that out now

932
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
that out now
 

933
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,350
that out now
but let's see i don't know

934
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360

 

935
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,909

how about we manually test this i wanted

936
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
how about we manually test this i wanted
 

937
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,510
how about we manually test this i wanted
to do an automatic

938
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
to do an automatic
 

939
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,909
to do an automatic
automatic test today but i'm gonna have

940
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:35,919
automatic test today but i'm gonna have
 

941
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,029
automatic test today but i'm gonna have
to figure something out with this

942
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
to figure something out with this
 

943
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,870
to figure something out with this
it's very complicated all these things

944
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:42,880
it's very complicated all these things
 

945
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,510
it's very complicated all these things
and there's lots of ways it can go wrong

946
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
and there's lots of ways it can go wrong
 

947
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,110
and there's lots of ways it can go wrong
how about we turn

948
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,120

 

949
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,510

this on well we might have trouble we'll

950
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,520
this on well we might have trouble we'll
 

951
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,270
this on well we might have trouble we'll
see

952
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
see
 

953
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,190
see
turn this one we manually turned it on

954
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
turn this one we manually turned it on
 

955
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,270
turn this one we manually turned it on
we're gonna go to this one oh man

956
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,280
we're gonna go to this one oh man
 

957
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,990
we're gonna go to this one oh man
i thought i had a spider on my desk it

958
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,000
i thought i had a spider on my desk it
 

959
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,070
i thought i had a spider on my desk it
was uh

960
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
was uh
 

961
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,070
was uh
light from the glass reflecting off of a

962
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
light from the glass reflecting off of a
 

963
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,990
light from the glass reflecting off of a
bottle it scared me though

964
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
bottle it scared me though
 

965
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,990
bottle it scared me though
it was like moving um

966
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000

 

967
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,230

okay so we're gonna go through this one

968
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,240
okay so we're gonna go through this one
 

969
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,510
okay so we're gonna go through this one
on a timer

970
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,520
on a timer
 

971
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,230
on a timer
and we might get sent to the nether hub

972
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
and we might get sent to the nether hub
 

973
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,750
and we might get sent to the nether hub
i'm not sure because we didn't disable

974
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:25,760
i'm not sure because we didn't disable
 

975
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,870
i'm not sure because we didn't disable
that this is my where i get my sand from

976
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
that this is my where i get my sand from
 

977
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,390
that this is my where i get my sand from
and then when we go back hopefully the

978
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400
and then when we go back hopefully the
 

979
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,110
and then when we go back hopefully the
portal closed on us and we should arrive

980
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
portal closed on us and we should arrive
 

981
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,350
portal closed on us and we should arrive
at the stronghold

982
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
at the stronghold
 

983
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,710
at the stronghold
portal oh

984
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:40,720
portal oh
 

985
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,149
portal oh
i guess we had one outside

986
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:44,159
i guess we had one outside
 

987
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,230
i guess we had one outside
we did arrive at a different one though

988
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,240
we did arrive at a different one though
 

989
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,070
we did arrive at a different one though
which is wow look at all the gas

990
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,080

 

991
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,350

so it did kind of work

992
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360

 

993
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,590

we got bugs i'll fix them not today

994
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:57,600
we got bugs i'll fix them not today
 

995
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,190
we got bugs i'll fix them not today
though

996
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,200

 

997
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,830

time to
read the comments and wrap up the

1002
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,320
read the comments and wrap up the
