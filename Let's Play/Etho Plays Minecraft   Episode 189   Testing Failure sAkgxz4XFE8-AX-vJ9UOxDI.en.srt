we're gonna do a bit of testing with

12
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
we're gonna do a bit of testing with
 

13
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,750
we're gonna do a bit of testing with
things uh first of all i put the

14
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
things uh first of all i put the
 

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,990
things uh first of all i put the
water stream back there i i know i

water stream back there i i know i
 

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,349
water stream back there i i know i
removed it last time but

18
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
removed it last time but
 

19
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,870
removed it last time but
without it they just weren't entering

20
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
without it they just weren't entering
 

21
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,390
without it they just weren't entering
the blocks like they

22
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
the blocks like they
 

23
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,830
the blocks like they
were before so put it back

24
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
were before so put it back
 

25
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,150
were before so put it back
um and i'll have to just deal with the

26
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,160
um and i'll have to just deal with the
 

27
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,910
um and i'll have to just deal with the
leg they create when they're jumping up

28
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
leg they create when they're jumping up
 

29
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,110
leg they create when they're jumping up
and down

30
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
and down
 

31
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,950
and down
and hopefully that gets patched sometime

32
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
and hopefully that gets patched sometime
 

33
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,470
and hopefully that gets patched sometime
soon where it doesn't

34
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
soon where it doesn't
 

35
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,510
soon where it doesn't
cause crazy amounts of lag

36
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
cause crazy amounts of lag
 

37
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,549
cause crazy amounts of lag
um yeah we're going to go

38
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
um yeah we're going to go
 

39
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,310
um yeah we're going to go
do something with the turtle first of

40
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
do something with the turtle first of
 

41
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,670
do something with the turtle first of
all

42
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
all
 

43
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,510
all
had it very close to complete last

44
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
had it very close to complete last
 

45
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,350
had it very close to complete last
episode but we never did

46
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
episode but we never did
 

47
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,470
episode but we never did
get the silverfish out

48
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
get the silverfish out
 

49
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,510
get the silverfish out
so what what i need to do first is

50
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
so what what i need to do first is
 

51
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,030
so what what i need to do first is
replace these blocks

52
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
replace these blocks
 

53
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,070
replace these blocks
with either half slabs or stairs a lot

54
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
with either half slabs or stairs a lot
 

55
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,429
with either half slabs or stairs a lot
of people said to wait

56
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
of people said to wait
 

57
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,390
of people said to wait
until the sandstone stairs come out

58
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
until the sandstone stairs come out
 

59
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,070
until the sandstone stairs come out
which is probably what i'll use

60
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
which is probably what i'll use
 

61
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,550
which is probably what i'll use
when this is all done but i want it up

62
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
when this is all done but i want it up
 

63
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,149
when this is all done but i want it up
and working already so i'm just going to

64
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
and working already so i'm just going to
 

65
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,030
and working already so i'm just going to
use

66
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
use
 

67
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,710
use
stone brick or something that does not

68
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
stone brick or something that does not
 

69
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,789
stone brick or something that does not
match at all just to get the function

70
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
match at all just to get the function
 

71
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,910
match at all just to get the function
there

72
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
there
 

73
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,270
there
because i want to see if this works or

74
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
because i want to see if this works or
 

75
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,789
because i want to see if this works or
not

76
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799

 

77
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,469

let's test it out i sort of suspect i

78
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:32,479
let's test it out i sort of suspect i
 

79
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,950
let's test it out i sort of suspect i
messed up there

80
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
messed up there
 

81
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,030
messed up there
but we will see um

82
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
but we will see um
 

83
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,030
but we will see um
yeah silverfish farms running again so

84
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
yeah silverfish farms running again so
 

85
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,630
yeah silverfish farms running again so
we're we're getting new ones in here

86
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
we're we're getting new ones in here
 

87
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,550
we're we're getting new ones in here
this whole we got almost two rows now

88
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
this whole we got almost two rows now
 

89
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,550
this whole we got almost two rows now
okay

90
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560

 

91
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,389

uh let's head down

92
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399

 

93
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,910

get them into the tunnel

94
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920

 

95
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,069

okay so go to the middle let them track

96
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
okay so go to the middle let them track
 

97
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,150
okay so go to the middle let them track
you you can hear they're right above

98
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
you you can hear they're right above
 

99
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,869
you you can hear they're right above
move around a bit to get in the corner

100
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879

 

101
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,080

they should come to

102
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,090
they should come to
 

103
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,190
they should come to
[Music]

104
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200

 

105
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,470

here

106
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480

 

107
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,510

yeah the thing about using stairs

108
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
yeah the thing about using stairs
 

109
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,070
yeah the thing about using stairs
i i realize this afterwards it's going

110
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
i i realize this afterwards it's going
 

111
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,630
i i realize this afterwards it's going
to leave

112
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
to leave
 

113
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,390
to leave
an extra gap that they'll probably be

114
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
an extra gap that they'll probably be
 

115
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,910
an extra gap that they'll probably be
able to fit through

116
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
able to fit through
 

117
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,910
able to fit through
because it no longer this bottom no

118
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
because it no longer this bottom no
 

119
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,589
because it no longer this bottom no
longer connects to the block

120
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
longer connects to the block
 

121
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,430
longer connects to the block
so they can probably yep dang

122
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440

 

123
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,470

all right well you know what i'll do i'm

124
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
all right well you know what i'll do i'm
 

125
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,670
all right well you know what i'll do i'm
just gonna

126
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680

 

127
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,589

i'm gonna replace all the iron bars with

128
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
i'm gonna replace all the iron bars with
 

129
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,030
i'm gonna replace all the iron bars with
glass i think that's

130
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
glass i think that's
 

131
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,710
glass i think that's
that will be a full block no

132
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
that will be a full block no
 

133
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,830
that will be a full block no
complications

134
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840

 

135
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,750

yeah lose a little bit of space but

136
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
yeah lose a little bit of space but
 

137
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,110
yeah lose a little bit of space but
hopefully it's okay

138
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
hopefully it's okay
 

139
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,190
hopefully it's okay
we'll try it again here uh the glass

140
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
we'll try it again here uh the glass
 

141
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,390
we'll try it again here uh the glass
actually looks

142
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
actually looks
 

143
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,430
actually looks
not too bad i thought it would be worse

144
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440

 

145
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,350

but it that is going to lower the amount

146
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
but it that is going to lower the amount
 

147
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,229
but it that is going to lower the amount
of space they have

148
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239

 

149
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,390

okay

150
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400

 

151
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,070

i'm almost positive it'll work this time

152
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
i'm almost positive it'll work this time
 

153
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,190
i'm almost positive it'll work this time
though that's that's the important thing

154
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200

 

155
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,270

come on guys let's go for a little

156
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
come on guys let's go for a little
 

157
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,550
come on guys let's go for a little
journey

158
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560

 

159
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,390

and the point of all this is we're gonna

160
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
and the point of all this is we're gonna
 

161
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,670
and the point of all this is we're gonna
use these guys as digging machines they

162
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
use these guys as digging machines they
 

163
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,270
use these guys as digging machines they
or attempt to anyway they

164
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
or attempt to anyway they
 

165
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,509
or attempt to anyway they
you can dig blocks very quickly if you

166
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
you can dig blocks very quickly if you
 

167
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,630
you can dig blocks very quickly if you
have an army of silverfish

168
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640

 

169
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,910

yes

170
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920

 

171
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,949

here we go oh yeah this is the

172
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
here we go oh yeah this is the
 

173
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,429
here we go oh yeah this is the
glass tunnel it doesn't look bad hey i

174
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
glass tunnel it doesn't look bad hey i
 

175
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,070
glass tunnel it doesn't look bad hey i
don't think it's that bad

176
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080

sand

196
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
sand
 

197
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,230
sand
and i also started working on that

198
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
and i also started working on that
 

199
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,870
and i also started working on that
tunnel

200
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
tunnel
 

201
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,870
tunnel
from the man cave to here

202
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
from the man cave to here
 

203
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,590
from the man cave to here
um which we'll probably check out today

204
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
um which we'll probably check out today
 

205
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,390
um which we'll probably check out today
and maybe

206
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
and maybe
 

207
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,350
and maybe
finish the rest of the blasting on it

208
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360

 

209
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,110

and there's something else i want to try

210
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
and there's something else i want to try
 

211
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,870
and there's something else i want to try
out today too we're going to do some

212
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
out today too we're going to do some
 

213
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,950
out today too we're going to do some
experiments with the bed

214
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960

 

215
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,110

i'm assuming we are you know i always

216
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
i'm assuming we are you know i always
 

217
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,710
i'm assuming we are you know i always
lose track of time when i'm making these

218
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
lose track of time when i'm making these
 

219
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,670
lose track of time when i'm making these
especially

220
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
especially
 

221
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,270
especially
like i should cut recording here because

222
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
like i should cut recording here because
 

223
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,070
like i should cut recording here because
this is taking a long time to do these

224
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
this is taking a long time to do these
 

225
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,310
this is taking a long time to do these
guys are a lot slower than i would like

226
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
guys are a lot slower than i would like
 

227
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,430
guys are a lot slower than i would like
them to be

228
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440

 

229
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,870

and i say that now but in a vex map

230
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
and i say that now but in a vex map
 

231
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,430
and i say that now but in a vex map
they're they're way too fast

232
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440

 

233
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,670

sweet so this is the first group of

234
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
sweet so this is the first group of
 

235
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,710
sweet so this is the first group of
silver fish

236
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
silver fish
 

237
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,990
silver fish
up to the surface and for the most part

238
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
up to the surface and for the most part
 

239
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,790
up to the surface and for the most part
everything above ground is you know it's

240
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
everything above ground is you know it's
 

241
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,950
everything above ground is you know it's
either covered in sand or covered in

242
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
either covered in sand or covered in
 

243
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,150
either covered in sand or covered in
dirt or or whatever grass

245
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,510

so we don't have to worry about them

246
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
so we don't have to worry about them
 

247
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,710
so we don't have to worry about them
getting in places we don't want them

248
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
getting in places we don't want them
 

249
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,469
getting in places we don't want them
for the most part you guys have trouble

250
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
for the most part you guys have trouble
 

251
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,469
for the most part you guys have trouble
swimming

take them to
 

271
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,670
take them to
uh where i harvest my sand which is just

272
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
uh where i harvest my sand which is just
 

273
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,469
uh where i harvest my sand which is just
a little bit further that way

274
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
a little bit further that way
 

275
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,390
a little bit further that way
we got a bunch of stone exposed and

276
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
we got a bunch of stone exposed and
 

277
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,590
we got a bunch of stone exposed and
we're gonna let them

278
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
we're gonna let them
 

279
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,309
we're gonna let them
do their thing and see what happens

280
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319

 

281
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,710

okay so this is going to be the main

282
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
okay so this is going to be the main
 

283
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,230
okay so this is going to be the main
test of all this

284
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
test of all this
 

285
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,830
test of all this
uh let's let's not mess this up

okay that's probably enough that's
that's a lot of silverfish

316
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
that's a lot of silverfish
 

317
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:24,790
that's a lot of silverfish
so i'm gonna get out of here

318

i left the gate open oh
 

323
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,390
i left the gate open oh
where'd they come from

324
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400

 

325
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,869

oh man there was one more i saw there

326
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
oh man there was one more i saw there
 

327
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,869
oh man there was one more i saw there
okay let's not get too far away

328
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
okay let's not get too far away
 

329
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,230
okay let's not get too far away
uh get all these guys together

330
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
uh get all these guys together
 

331
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,990
uh get all these guys together
we'll see how they do in the tu in the

332
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
we'll see how they do in the tu in the
 

333
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,670
we'll see how they do in the tu in the
tunnel see if they have enough space

334
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
tunnel see if they have enough space
 

335
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,430
tunnel see if they have enough space
so when you get a larger load like this

336
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
so when you get a larger load like this
 

337
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,270
so when you get a larger load like this
they're going to spread out a lot more

338
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,280
they're going to spread out a lot more
 

339
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,830
they're going to spread out a lot more
and they might not want to follow us

340
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
and they might not want to follow us
 

341

so we only got like 10

524
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
so we only got like 10
 

525
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,509
so we only got like 10
out of 70 or so wow

526
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:33,519

 

527
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,389

all right well i'm going to take them

528
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
all right well i'm going to take them
 

529
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,350
all right well i'm going to take them
there anyway

530
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360

 

531
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,790

better than nothing

532
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800

 

533
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,949

okay we're here so from our

534
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
okay we're here so from our
 

535
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,110
okay we're here so from our
our 80 silverfish that we started with

536
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
our 80 silverfish that we started with
 

537
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,189
our 80 silverfish that we started with
we got a total of six

538
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:51,199
we got a total of six
 

539
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,990
we got a total of six
all the way over here that's not a good

540
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
all the way over here that's not a good
 

541
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,269
all the way over here that's not a good
rate

542
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
rate
 

543
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,350
rate
um and we might lose a few here

544
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
um and we might lose a few here
 

545
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,269
um and we might lose a few here
yep no oh they knocked me off

546
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
yep no oh they knocked me off
 

547
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,629
yep no oh they knocked me off
great so we got four four here

548
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639
great so we got four four here
 

549
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:14,829
great so we got four four here
i wanted to get like 200. um

550
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839

 

551
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,069

dang

552
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
dang
 

553
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,310
dang
all right well i'll let them disperse

554
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320

 

555
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,030

so i'll have to streamline that thing i

556
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,040
so i'll have to streamline that thing i
 

557
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,509
so i'll have to streamline that thing i
guess

558
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
guess
 

559
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,189
guess
i don't know rethink it so that did not

560
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199
i don't know rethink it so that did not
 

561
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:29,990
i don't know rethink it so that did not
work

562
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
work
 

563
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,430
work
very good at all it was

564
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
very good at all it was
 

565
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,990
very good at all it was
not easy like i had hoped

566
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000

 

567
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,750

but we got four here let's try to get a

568
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
but we got four here let's try to get a
 

569
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,189
but we got four here let's try to get a
few hundred

570
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
few hundred
 

571
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:47,030
few hundred
more and

572
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040

 

573
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,829

yeah it'll be cool if i can get it

574
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
yeah it'll be cool if i can get it
 

575
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,189
yeah it'll be cool if i can get it
figured out

576
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
figured out
 

577
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,310
figured out
and working good but like it is right

578
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,320
and working good but like it is right
 

579
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,269
and working good but like it is right
now that's

580
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:55,279
now that's
 

581
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,189
now that's
not very useful for anything so

582
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
not very useful for anything so
 

583
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,430
not very useful for anything so
i'll think about it for a while and

584
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
i'll think about it for a while and
 

585
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,069
i'll think about it for a while and
most likely change my setup there but

586
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
most likely change my setup there but
 

587
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:06,790
most likely change my setup there but
we'll go

588
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
we'll go
 

589
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,150
we'll go
do something else today

590
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
do something else today
 

591
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,870
do something else today
we'll mess with the bed yeah let's head

592
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
we'll mess with the bed yeah let's head
 

593
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,670
we'll mess with the bed yeah let's head
back to that

594
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
back to that
 

595
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,670
back to that
that area there and do a few tests

596
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680

 

597
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,030

well i've been thinking about it and

598
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
well i've been thinking about it and
 

599
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,430
well i've been thinking about it and
really the way i lost mostly silver fish

600
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
really the way i lost mostly silver fish
 

601
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,790
really the way i lost mostly silver fish
was from this top

602
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
was from this top
 

603
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,550
was from this top
part here not being very good

604
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
part here not being very good
 

605
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,350
part here not being very good
as i was making my way up it they

606
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
as i was making my way up it they
 

607
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,150
as i was making my way up it they
reached the end of their tunnel and

608
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
reached the end of their tunnel and
 

609
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,949
reached the end of their tunnel and
at about this point here a bunch of

610
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
at about this point here a bunch of
 

611
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:39,990
at about this point here a bunch of
silver fish started

612
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
silver fish started
 

613
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,069
silver fish started
just pouring down on my head and started

614
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
just pouring down on my head and started
 

615
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,389
just pouring down on my head and started
pushing me down the water

616
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
pushing me down the water
 

617
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,230
pushing me down the water
now i ender pearled i managed to get out

618
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
now i ender pearled i managed to get out
 

619
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,150
now i ender pearled i managed to get out
uh but then i ran back so that they

620
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
uh but then i ran back so that they
 

621
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,230
uh but then i ran back so that they
wouldn't despawn

622
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
wouldn't despawn
 

623
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,509
wouldn't despawn
and then they pushed me down this tunnel

624
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
and then they pushed me down this tunnel
 

625
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,790
and then they pushed me down this tunnel
and yeah you saw the rest so

626
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800
and yeah you saw the rest so
 

627
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,870
and yeah you saw the rest so
what i should do is just build a little

628
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
what i should do is just build a little
 

629
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,350
what i should do is just build a little
room up here which keeps them separate

630
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
room up here which keeps them separate
 

631
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,110
room up here which keeps them separate
and have a date control on it so i can

632
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
and have a date control on it so i can
 

633
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,550
and have a date control on it so i can
let them out when i want

634
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
let them out when i want
 

635
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,829
let them out when i want
and that should solve the problem really

636
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:11,839
and that should solve the problem really
 

637
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,870
and that should solve the problem really
because that's how i lost at least half

638
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:14,880
because that's how i lost at least half
 

639
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,790
because that's how i lost at least half
of them i'm sure

640
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800

 

641
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,990

and then the rest i lost had a creeper

642
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
and then the rest i lost had a creeper
 

643
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,590
and then the rest i lost had a creeper
explosion on the way and stuff like that

644
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
explosion on the way and stuff like that
 

645
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,110
explosion on the way and stuff like that
so maybe i'll put a bed up

646
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
so maybe i'll put a bed up
 

647
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,710
so maybe i'll put a bed up
top here too and i should widen this

648
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:30,720
top here too and i should widen this
 

649
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,030
top here too and i should widen this
like if it was three blocks i could

650
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
like if it was three blocks i could
 

651
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,350
like if it was three blocks i could
make a lot more fit through here at a

652
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
make a lot more fit through here at a
 

653
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,629
make a lot more fit through here at a
time

654
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
time
 

655
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,230
time
and i'll do the slow sand thing so i

656
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
and i'll do the slow sand thing so i
 

657
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,990
and i'll do the slow sand thing so i
will eat so i'll go up slower and

658
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
will eat so i'll go up slower and
 

659
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,310
will eat so i'll go up slower and
they'll be able to follow me better

660
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
they'll be able to follow me better
 

661
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,629
they'll be able to follow me better
but yeah that's that's the plan with

662
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
but yeah that's that's the plan with
 

663
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,430
but yeah that's that's the plan with
that

664
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440

 

665
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,949

yeah so i got a little trick i want to

666
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
yeah so i got a little trick i want to
 

667
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,030
yeah so i got a little trick i want to
try out today with the beds i think

668
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
try out today with the beds i think
 

669
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,310
try out today with the beds i think
it'll work

670
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
it'll work
 

671
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,230
it'll work
um basically i usually keep my spawn

672
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
um basically i usually keep my spawn
 

673
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,030
um basically i usually keep my spawn
sent

674
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,040
sent
 

675
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,829
sent
my spawn set here

676
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
my spawn set here
 

677
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,390
my spawn set here
um so when i go through

678
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
um so when i go through
 

679
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,990
um so when i go through
the end portal and return i end up here

680
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
the end portal and return i end up here
 

681
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,110
the end portal and return i end up here
so you

682
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
so you
 

683
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,710
so you
there's this will work two ways if you

684
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
there's this will work two ways if you
 

685
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,470
there's this will work two ways if you
if you got your spawn set at a bed

686
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,480
if you got your spawn set at a bed
 

687
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,029
if you got your spawn set at a bed
you'll return at your bed

688
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
you'll return at your bed
 

689
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,870
you'll return at your bed
if if you don't have your spawn set at a

690
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:22,880
if if you don't have your spawn set at a
 

691
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,150
if if you don't have your spawn set at a
bed or your bed is obstructed

692
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
bed or your bed is obstructed
 

693
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,350
bed or your bed is obstructed
intent you will get sent back to

694
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
intent you will get sent back to
 

695
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,710
intent you will get sent back to
your the original spawn of the world

696
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
your the original spawn of the world
 

697
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,830
your the original spawn of the world
which it so happens is right

698
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
which it so happens is right
 

699
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,950
which it so happens is right
next to the man cave which is

700
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
next to the man cave which is
 

701
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,669
next to the man cave which is
a nice 800 block teleport or so from

702
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
a nice 800 block teleport or so from
 

703
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,789
a nice 800 block teleport or so from
here

704
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:42,799
here
 

705
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,190
here
um that would be pretty convenient to

706
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
um that would be pretty convenient to
 

707
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,150
um that would be pretty convenient to
take advantage of

708
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160
take advantage of
 

709
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,150
take advantage of
so that's what we're going to try to do

710
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
so that's what we're going to try to do
 

711
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,110
so that's what we're going to try to do
we got to figure out

712
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120

 

713
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,270

how to obstruct the bed i looked at the

714
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
how to obstruct the bed i looked at the
 

715
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,110
how to obstruct the bed i looked at the
wiki and there wasn't really a lot of

716
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
wiki and there wasn't really a lot of
 

717
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,310
wiki and there wasn't really a lot of
information about

718
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
information about
 

719
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,750
information about
how how the bed gets obstructed so we'll

720
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
how how the bed gets obstructed so we'll
 

721
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,190
how how the bed gets obstructed so we'll
have to do some tests ourselves

722
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200

 

723
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,950

so we'll put a bed down here we'll set

724
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
so we'll put a bed down here we'll set
 

725
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,110
so we'll put a bed down here we'll set
our spawn and then we'll just keep

726
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,120
our spawn and then we'll just keep
 

727
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,830
our spawn and then we'll just keep
placing blocks around it until

728
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:13,840
placing blocks around it until
 

729
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,549
placing blocks around it until
it says our bed is obstructed and it's

730
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
it says our bed is obstructed and it's
 

731
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,990
it says our bed is obstructed and it's
it

732
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
it
 

733
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,029
it
spawns it spawns us at the original

734
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:21,039
spawns it spawns us at the original
 

735
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,150
spawns it spawns us at the original
spawn point in the world

736
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
spawn point in the world
 

737
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,750
spawn point in the world
so i'm gonna have to wait till night and

738
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
so i'm gonna have to wait till night and
 

739
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,029
so i'm gonna have to wait till night and
then i'll begin

740
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039

 

741
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,430

yeah so i set my spawn down here that

742
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440
yeah so i set my spawn down here that
 

743
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,470
yeah so i set my spawn down here that
other spot

744
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:34,480
other spot
 

745
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,710
other spot
did not work i was too close to the

746
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
did not work i was too close to the
 

747
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,270
did not work i was too close to the
silver fish and i wasn't able to sleep

748
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280
silver fish and i wasn't able to sleep
 

749
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,830
silver fish and i wasn't able to sleep
so we're going to do it down here and

750
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:41,840
so we're going to do it down here and
 

751
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,350
so we're going to do it down here and
we'll this is gonna take a bit of trial

752
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
we'll this is gonna take a bit of trial
 

753
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,029
we'll this is gonna take a bit of trial
and error we'll just keep putting blocks

754
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
and error we'll just keep putting blocks
 

755
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,390
and error we'll just keep putting blocks
around it until

756
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
around it until
 

757
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,430
around it until
we get obstructed and we'll try that

758
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440
we get obstructed and we'll try that
 

759
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,190
we get obstructed and we'll try that
first

760
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
first
 

761
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,710
first
uh i'm guessing it's gonna be like a

762
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
uh i'm guessing it's gonna be like a
 

763
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,270
uh i'm guessing it's gonna be like a
five by five area around it'll check but

764
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
five by five area around it'll check but
 

765
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,789
five by five area around it'll check but
who knows and

766
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:00,799

 

767
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,310

we'll just keep going through the end

768
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,320
we'll just keep going through the end
 

769
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,549
we'll just keep going through the end
portal and back again

770
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
portal and back again
 

771
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,789
portal and back again
over and over

772
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799

 

773
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,830

so this is cool because what i could do

774
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840

 

775
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,029

is set up like a lever right next to

776
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
is set up like a lever right next to
 

777
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,230
is set up like a lever right next to
our portal here that will

778
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
our portal here that will
 

779
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,789
our portal here that will
say either send spawn us back at our bed

780
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
say either send spawn us back at our bed
 

781
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,390
say either send spawn us back at our bed
or spawn us

782
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
or spawn us
 

783
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,350
or spawn us
back to the original spawn um because a

784
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
back to the original spawn um because a
 

785
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,549
back to the original spawn um because a
lot of times i'll be

786
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
lot of times i'll be
 

787
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,549
lot of times i'll be
the man cave and i'll

788
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:32,559
the man cave and i'll
 

789
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,470
the man cave and i'll
need to enchant a tool or something did

790
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:34,480
need to enchant a tool or something did
 

791
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,549
need to enchant a tool or something did
i look at him no

792
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:36,559
i look at him no
 

793
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,750
i look at him no
and i run i run here which is like 800

794
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
and i run i run here which is like 800
 

795
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,710
and i run i run here which is like 800
blocks

796
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:40,720
blocks
 

797
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,150
blocks
and then i gotta run back which

798
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
and then i gotta run back which
 

799
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,909
and then i gotta run back which

takes a takes a long time when you have
 

801
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,510
takes a takes a long time when you have
to do that a few times

802
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:47,520

holy smokes

806
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559

 

807
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,990

i gotta do something with this portal

808
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,000
i gotta do something with this portal
 

809
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,830
i gotta do something with this portal
too i don't like to

810
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
too i don't like to
 

811
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,270
too i don't like to
just have it floating in the air like

812
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
just have it floating in the air like
 

813
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,909
just have it floating in the air like
this

814
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919

 

815
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,710

every so often there'll be like an epic

816
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:04,720
every so often there'll be like an epic
 

817
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,149
every so often there'll be like an epic
battle between these snowmen

818
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
battle between these snowmen
 

819
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,149
battle between these snowmen
and these endermen because as soon as

820
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
and these endermen because as soon as
 

821
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,590
and these endermen because as soon as
they hit throw a snowball at the

822
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600
they hit throw a snowball at the
 

823
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,950
they hit throw a snowball at the
enderman that the enderman teleports

824
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:12,960
enderman that the enderman teleports
 

825
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,070
enderman that the enderman teleports
and get de-egg road so they're just

826
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
and get de-egg road so they're just
 

827
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,350
and get de-egg road so they're just
a never-ending battle between them

828
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
a never-ending battle between them
 

829
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,909
a never-ending battle between them
okay

830
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919

 

831
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,669

that was enough so this is where it

832
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
that was enough so this is where it
 

833
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,029
that was enough so this is where it
sends us

834
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:27,039
sends us
 

835
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:34,549
sends us
right by the the mine shaft

836
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
right by the the mine shaft
 

837
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,950
right by the the mine shaft
so i'm going to try to remove one block

838
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
so i'm going to try to remove one block
 

839
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,870
so i'm going to try to remove one block
and do it again

840
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
and do it again
 

841
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,070
and do it again
and see see what happens sadly i have to

842
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
and see see what happens sadly i have to
 

843
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,549
and see see what happens sadly i have to
run back

844
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
run back
 

845
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,029
run back
800 blocks now

846
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039

 

847
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,430

so now my new guess is that if any of

848
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440
so now my new guess is that if any of
 

849
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,870
so now my new guess is that if any of
these blocks get

850
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:50,880
these blocks get
 

851
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,470
these blocks get
removed the spawning will work

852
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
removed the spawning will work
 

853
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,470
removed the spawning will work
around the bed so let's try let's just

854
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
around the bed so let's try let's just
 

855
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,909
around the bed so let's try let's just
try to remove this one first

856
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:57,919
try to remove this one first
 

857
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,669
try to remove this one first
do it again um

858
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:01,679
do it again um
 

859

the blocks
towards the bed using pistons to

864
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:08,799
towards the bed using pistons to
 

865
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,070
towards the bed using pistons to
obstruct it

866
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
obstruct it
 

867
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,470
obstruct it
or remove them type thing and just hook

868
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
or remove them type thing and just hook
 

869
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,510
or remove them type thing and just hook
that to a lever or button

870
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,520
that to a lever or button
 

871
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,029
that to a lever or button
i'm curious like if you hooked it to a

872
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:17,039
i'm curious like if you hooked it to a
 

873
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,350
i'm curious like if you hooked it to a
button if

874
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
button if
 

875
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,230
button if
when you return like when you load the

876
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,240
when you return like when you load the
 

877
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,430
when you return like when you load the
chunk again if the piston will retract

878
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
chunk again if the piston will retract
 

879
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,830
chunk again if the piston will retract
on its own or if it will get stuck like

880
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:28,840
on its own or if it will get stuck like
 

881
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,710
on its own or if it will get stuck like
that

882
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,720

um this time let's do this let's
get rid of all the corners

908
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480

 

909
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,470

and we'll get rid of this one

910
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480

 

911
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,710

and i suppose this one whoops

912
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:28,720
and i suppose this one whoops
 

913
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,669
and i suppose this one whoops
and just leave the sides blocked

914
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:35,679

 

915
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,270

and

916
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280

 

917
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,270

there's a chance that might work i don't

918
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,280
there's a chance that might work i don't
 

919
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,990
there's a chance that might work i don't
know

920
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000

 

921
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,390

what i should have probably done is just

922
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,400
what i should have probably done is just
 

923
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,669
what i should have probably done is just
set up a bed near

924
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
set up a bed near
 

925
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,230
set up a bed near
the original spawn point and just kept

926
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
the original spawn point and just kept
 

927
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,430
the original spawn point and just kept
killing myself that would have been a

928
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:51,440
killing myself that would have been a
 

929
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,669
killing myself that would have been a
lot quicker

930
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:57,679

 

931
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:06,710

okay here we are again

932
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720

 

933
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,270

look mad so i'm guessing this

934
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,280
look mad so i'm guessing this
 

935
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,950
look mad so i'm guessing this
won't work let's see

936
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:14,960

 

937
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,990

yeah won't work so now

938
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
yeah won't work so now
 

939
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,590
yeah won't work so now
that leaves it down to four blocks i'm

940
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:25,600

 

941
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,070

well i'll head back again

942
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,080

 

943
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,830

let's take out this one this one

944
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:33,840
let's take out this one this one
 

945
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,510
let's take out this one this one
and this one and

946
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
and this one and
 

947
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,950
and this one and
that should work i'm pretty sure that's

948
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:40,960
that should work i'm pretty sure that's
 

949
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,149
that should work i'm pretty sure that's
gonna work

950
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
gonna work
 

951
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,430
gonna work
and if it does we will put one block

952
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
and if it does we will put one block
 

953
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,669
and if it does we will put one block
next to it and i think that'll obstruct

954
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:47,679
next to it and i think that'll obstruct
 

955
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,510
next to it and i think that'll obstruct
it again so

956
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:49,520
it again so
 

957
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,990
it again so
we'll know for sure then

958
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000

 

959
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,430

let's go let's go let's go episodes

960

okay now it's gonna work
 

1019
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,750
okay now it's gonna work
that was the problem but

1020
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:47,760
that was the problem but
 

1021
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,430
that was the problem but
sadly that means this idea doesn't

1022
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:49,440
sadly that means this idea doesn't
 

1023
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,190
sadly that means this idea doesn't
really work because i'll have to

1024
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200
really work because i'll have to
 

1025
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,310
really work because i'll have to
sleep in it if i ever obstruct it which

1026
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:56,320
sleep in it if i ever obstruct it which
 

1027
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,630
sleep in it if i ever obstruct it which
isn't exactly convenient like i was

1028
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
isn't exactly convenient like i was
 

1029
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,710
isn't exactly convenient like i was
hoping

1030
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720

 

1031
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,070

that's the whole point of this to make

1032
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,080
that's the whole point of this to make
 

1033
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,950
that's the whole point of this to make
it make moving around more convenient

1034
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:08,960
it make moving around more convenient
 

1035
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,630
it make moving around more convenient
but that's

1036
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:10,640
but that's
 

1037
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,190
but that's
that's not really good

1038
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,200

 

1039
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,110

so we'll just try it out to make sure

1040
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,120
so we'll just try it out to make sure
 

1041
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,350
so we'll just try it out to make sure
that was the problem

1042
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,360

 

1043
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,669

yep okay so if you ever obstruct your

1044
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:25,679
yep okay so if you ever obstruct your
 

1045
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,150
yep okay so if you ever obstruct your
bed you have to sleep in it again

1046
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:28,160
bed you have to sleep in it again
 

1047
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,750
bed you have to sleep in it again

idea is a bust oh well

1050
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,520
idea is a bust oh well
 

1051
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,269
idea is a bust oh well
so we'll do one more thing and then

1052
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:35,279
so we'll do one more thing and then
 

1053
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,029
so we'll do one more thing and then
we'll call it an end i'm going to take

1054
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
we'll call it an end i'm going to take
 

1055
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,070
we'll call it an end i'm going to take
you to the tunnel that i was working on

1056
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
you to the tunnel that i was working on
 

1057
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,230
you to the tunnel that i was working on
uh it's not much to see but

1058
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,240

 

1059
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,630

it's something i actually gotta obstruct

1060
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:46,640
it's something i actually gotta obstruct
 

1061
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,950
it's something i actually gotta obstruct
my

1062
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960

 

1063
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,310

i do have a way like i i do have a

1064
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
i do have a way like i i do have a
 

1065
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,310
i do have a way like i i do have a
sort of a way of saving time i go

1066
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
sort of a way of saving time i go
 

1067
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,870
sort of a way of saving time i go
through the nether portal here

1068
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
through the nether portal here
 

1069
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,310
through the nether portal here
and that's because we're at like

1070
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
and that's because we're at like
 

1071
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,070
and that's because we're at like
negative 400

1072
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,080
negative 400
 

1073
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:08,950
negative 400
800 go through here

1074
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:08,960

 

1075
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,510

and go through again and that will get

1076
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:11,520
and go through again and that will get
 

1077
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,390
and go through again and that will get
us

1078
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,400
us
 

1079
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,789
us
a fair bit closer

1080
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799

 

1081
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,830

now we're at negative 400 and zed like

1082
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:19,840
now we're at negative 400 and zed like
 

1083
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,470
now we're at negative 400 and zed like
three

1084
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:20,480
three
 

1085
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,990
three
three hundred or so so that saved us

1086
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,000
three hundred or so so that saved us
 

1087
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,470
three hundred or so so that saved us
like 400 blocks of walking

1088
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
like 400 blocks of walking
 

1089
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,110
like 400 blocks of walking
but i was hoping i was i could have

1090
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,120
but i was hoping i was i could have
 

1091
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,149
but i was hoping i was i could have
reversed that

1092
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:28,159
reversed that
 

1093
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,510
reversed that
and used the end portal will go one way

1094
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:31,520
and used the end portal will go one way
 

1095
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,269
and used the end portal will go one way
and then the nether port will go back

1096
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
and then the nether port will go back
 

1097
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:39,190
and then the nether port will go back
the other way but i guess not

1098
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200

 

1099
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,630

okay so the new tunnel is over

1100
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640
okay so the new tunnel is over
 

1101
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,909
okay so the new tunnel is over
down here

1102
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:45,919

 

1103
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,630

oh i heard a slime

1104
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:50,640

 

1105
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,070

there he goes hasn't jammed up yet so

1106
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
there he goes hasn't jammed up yet so
 

1107
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,630
there he goes hasn't jammed up yet so
that thing's working great

1108
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:56,640
that thing's working great
 

1109
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,470
that thing's working great
yeah over here is our new tunnel it's

1110
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,480
yeah over here is our new tunnel it's
 

1111
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,389
yeah over here is our new tunnel it's
much like the mine shaft we're gonna run

1112
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:02,399
much like the mine shaft we're gonna run
 

1113
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,510
much like the mine shaft we're gonna run
a track

1114
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:03,520
a track
 

1115
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,149
a track
all the way down here or two

1116
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159

 

1117
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,110

1137
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,830

and there's the end so we'll have to

1138
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:45,840
and there's the end so we'll have to
 

1139
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,510
and there's the end so we'll have to
continue the tunnel sometime

1140
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520
continue the tunnel sometime
 

1141
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:54,149
continue the tunnel sometime
it's got to go another 400 blocks or so

1142
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,159

 

1143
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,830
