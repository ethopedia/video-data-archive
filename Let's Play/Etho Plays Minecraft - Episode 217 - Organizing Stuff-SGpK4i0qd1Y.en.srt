flint and steel fishing rods that kind
of stuff so we would have five chests

162
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,280
of stuff so we would have five chests
 

163
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,060
of stuff so we would have five chests
four tools four chests four armor and

four tools four chests four armor and
then food some of this stuff gets is

166
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:20,700
then food some of this stuff gets is
 

167
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,420
then food some of this stuff gets is
going to be doubled up oh you scared me

168
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:23,430
going to be doubled up oh you scared me
 

169
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,550
going to be doubled up oh you scared me
some stuffs going to get doubled up it's

170
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:25,560
some stuffs going to get doubled up it's
 

171
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,300
some stuffs going to get doubled up it's
it's going to be like a large store

172
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,310
it's going to be like a large store
 

173
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,940
it's going to be like a large store
but not like SuperDuper large where

174
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:29,950
but not like SuperDuper large where
 

175
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,730
but not like SuperDuper large where
every single unique item gets its own

176
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:32,740
every single unique item gets its own
 

177
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,580
every single unique item gets its own
Ches like golden apples and regular

178
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:35,590
Ches like golden apples and regular
 

179
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,420
Ches like golden apples and regular
apples are going to share a chest you

00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:39,430
apples are going to share a chest you
 

181
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,940
apples are going to share a chest you
know just but in general just about

182
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:41,950
know just but in general just about
 

183
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,080
know just but in general just about
everything is going to get its own chest

184
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,090
everything is going to get its own chest
 

185
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,670
everything is going to get its own chest
like I'll even have an old chest for

186
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
like I'll even have an old chest for
 

187

gasps tears really don't need one

188
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:49,810
gasps tears really don't need one
 

189
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,270
gasps tears really don't need one
because you don't get too many in the

190
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280
because you don't get too many in the
 

191
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,080
because you don't get too many in the
world but yeah so that's what I'm going

192
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,090
world but yeah so that's what I'm going
 

193
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,460
world but yeah so that's what I'm going
to do and I want to play around with my

194
00:04:59,460 --> 00:04:59,470
to do and I want to play around with my
 

195
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,890
to do and I want to play around with my
storage design again because we have to

196
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:01,900
storage design again because we have to
 

197
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,330
storage design again because we have to
change it we sort of planned it out

198
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:03,340
change it we sort of planned it out
 

199
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,909
change it we sort of planned it out
before but now that we got the item

200
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
before but now that we got the item
 

201
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,550
before but now that we got the item
frames I want to change it up again to

202
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
frames I want to change it up again to
 

203
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,770
frames I want to change it up again to
include them oh right right something

204
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:13,780
include them oh right right something
 

205
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,500
include them oh right right something

else important I discovered while doing
 

207
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,980
else important I discovered while doing
this the item frames they have a limit

208
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:19,990
this the item frames they have a limit
 

209
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,280
this the item frames they have a limit
on how far you can see them you see them

loading as I walk closer so I worked it

212
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:25,870
loading as I walk closer so I worked it
 

213
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,379
loading as I walk closer so I worked it
out and it's 20 blocks exactly I'm

214
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:28,389
out and it's 20 blocks exactly I'm
 

215
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:33,090
out and it's 20 blocks exactly I'm
pretty sure which sort of sucks because

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:33,100
pretty sure which sort of sucks because

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:35,500
our storage rooms over 40 blocks across
 

219
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,190
our storage rooms over 40 blocks across
so if we're for over half way away from

220
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:38,200
so if we're for over half way away from
 

221
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,640
so if we're for over half way away from
the wall we won't be able to see what's

222
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:41,650
the wall we won't be able to see what's
 

223
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:48,210
the wall we won't be able to see what's
in the chess kind of sex I might know a

224
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:48,220
in the chess kind of sex I might know a
 

225
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,200
in the chess kind of sex I might know a
way of dealing with that because I do

226
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,210
way of dealing with that because I do
 

227
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,900
way of dealing with that because I do
really want to use them just I would

228
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:54,910
really want to use them just I would
 

229
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,580
really want to use them just I would
have I would have liked to be able to

230
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:56,590
have I would have liked to be able to
 

231
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,380
have I would have liked to be able to
see the item frames from the other side

232
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:58,390
see the item frames from the other side
 

233
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,540
see the item frames from the other side
of my my room though it's too bad

234
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:00,550
of my my room though it's too bad
 

235
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:06,330
of my my room though it's too bad
there's a limit like that um where we

236
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:06,340
there's a limit like that um where we
 

237
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,230
there's a limit like that um where we
going oh yeah nope not here still

238
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
going oh yeah nope not here still
 

239
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,820
going oh yeah nope not here still
getting used to my changes I because I

240
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:11,830
getting used to my changes I because I
 

241
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,680
getting used to my changes I because I
didn't have this staircase here before

242
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:13,690
didn't have this staircase here before
 

243
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,760
didn't have this staircase here before
and it's just temporary so before the

244
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:17,770
and it's just temporary so before the
 

245
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,400
and it's just temporary so before the
way we did it

246
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,410
way we did it
 

247
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,710
way we did it
we were planning something like this

248
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
we were planning something like this
 

249
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,469
we were planning something like this
where we would have double chests sort

250
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:25,479
where we would have double chests sort
 

251
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,779
where we would have double chests sort
of staggered in a checkered format like

252
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:27,789
of staggered in a checkered format like
 

253
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,130
of staggered in a checkered format like
that and then we're going to have

254
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,140
that and then we're going to have
 

255
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,880
that and then we're going to have
buttons below of the block type and then

256
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:32,890
buttons below of the block type and then
 

257
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,510
buttons below of the block type and then
a dispenser on the ground and then I

258
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:36,520
a dispenser on the ground and then I
 

259
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,070
a dispenser on the ground and then I
think we were going to do signs on these

260
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
think we were going to do signs on these
 

261
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,140
think we were going to do signs on these
on these stairs here

262
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,150
on these stairs here
 

263
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,950
on these stairs here
but yeah we got to redesign this so I'm

264
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:45,960
but yeah we got to redesign this so I'm
 

265
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,900
but yeah we got to redesign this so I'm
going to get my stuff together I think

266
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:47,910
going to get my stuff together I think
 

267
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,700
going to get my stuff together I think
I'm going to just skip doing dispensers

268
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:49,710
I'm going to just skip doing dispensers
 

269
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,020
I'm going to just skip doing dispensers
all together because it takes quite a

270
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,030
all together because it takes quite a
 

271
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,440
all together because it takes quite a
bit of space so yeah I'm gonna get

272
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,450
bit of space so yeah I'm gonna get
 

273
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,270
bit of space so yeah I'm gonna get
blocks together we'll try work out a

274
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,280
blocks together we'll try work out a
 

275
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,810
blocks together we'll try work out a
different design that will work with the

276
00:06:59,810 --> 00:06:59,820
different design that will work with the
 

277
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:07,520
different design that will work with the
new item frames whoo-hoo oh and by the

278
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:07,530
new item frames whoo-hoo oh and by the
 

279
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,050
new item frames whoo-hoo oh and by the
way I didn't really explain this too

280
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:09,060
way I didn't really explain this too
 

281
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,450
way I didn't really explain this too
clearly but the whole point of these

282
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:11,460
clearly but the whole point of these
 

283
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,790
clearly but the whole point of these
item frames here is to organize them so

284
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:13,800
item frames here is to organize them so
 

285
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,870
item frames here is to organize them so
instead of doing it in a Word document

286
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
instead of doing it in a Word document
 

287
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,410
instead of doing it in a Word document
I'm doing it visually in Minecraft where

288
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:18,420
I'm doing it visually in Minecraft where
 

289
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,900
I'm doing it visually in Minecraft where
you guys can see it too

290
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:19,910
you guys can see it too
 

291
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,430
you guys can see it too
and then once I get it all organized I'm

292
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:22,440
and then once I get it all organized I'm
 

293
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,980
and then once I get it all organized I'm
I'll have everything here because I kind

294
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:24,990
I'll have everything here because I kind
 

295
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,210
I'll have everything here because I kind
of have to collect one of every item

296
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:26,220
of have to collect one of every item
 

297
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,220
of have to collect one of every item
which is going to take a while too but

298
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,230
which is going to take a while too but
 

299
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,930
which is going to take a while too but
basically when I get the spot set up for

300
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:32,940
basically when I get the spot set up for
 

301
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,940
basically when I get the spot set up for
them I'll just come up here and move

302
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:34,950
them I'll just come up here and move
 

303
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,650
them I'll just come up here and move
each of these item frames to where they

304
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:36,660
each of these item frames to where they
 

305
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,270
each of these item frames to where they
belong and this way I it's easier to

306
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
belong and this way I it's easier to
 

307
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,890
belong and this way I it's easier to
group them together because I can see

308
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:42,900
group them together because I can see
 

309
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,310
group them together because I can see
what stuff I want to go next to what you

310
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:46,320
what stuff I want to go next to what you
 

311
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,530
what stuff I want to go next to what you
know like for example I want tools next

312
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:48,540
know like for example I want tools next
 

313
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:55,370
know like for example I want tools next
to armor and yeah anyway let us design a

314
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:55,380
to armor and yeah anyway let us design a
 

315
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,810
to armor and yeah anyway let us design a
new storage area here's a good working

316
00:07:59,810 --> 00:07:59,820
new storage area here's a good working
 

317
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,770
new storage area here's a good working
area I'm probably going to do it mostly

318
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:03,780
area I'm probably going to do it mostly
 

319
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,630
area I'm probably going to do it mostly
out of wood because just have that wood

320
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:05,640
out of wood because just have that wood
 

321
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,260
out of wood because just have that wood
color to them I think storage rooms

322
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,270
color to them I think storage rooms
 

323
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,900
color to them I think storage rooms
should be made of wood because of that

324
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:13,910

 

325
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,860

so we're going to go with darker color

326
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:18,870
so we're going to go with darker color
 

327
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:24,170
so we're going to go with darker color
too so yeah my idea is to have two like

328
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,180
too so yeah my idea is to have two like
 

329
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,430
too so yeah my idea is to have two like
two chests below then a beam with the

330
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,440
two chests below then a beam with the
 

331
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,770
two chests below then a beam with the
item frame on and then two chests above

332
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:30,780
item frame on and then two chests above
 

333
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,950
item frame on and then two chests above
because and still do the checker pattern

334
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:33,960
because and still do the checker pattern
 

335
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,880
because and still do the checker pattern
so let's just try to put that together

336
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:37,890
so let's just try to put that together
 

337
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:45,970
so let's just try to put that together
here something like this and then

338
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:45,980

 

339
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,740

we'll just use full blocks we're

340
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:47,750
we'll just use full blocks we're
 

341
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,300
we'll just use full blocks we're
actually supposed to use stairs for this

342
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,310
actually supposed to use stairs for this
 

343
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,580
actually supposed to use stairs for this
so we can open the chest because you

344
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:51,590
so we can open the chest because you
 

345
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,050
so we can open the chest because you
can't open the chest if there's a block

346
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,060
can't open the chest if there's a block
 

347
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,160
can't open the chest if there's a block
above it but we can if it's a stair and

348
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,170
above it but we can if it's a stair and
 

349
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,630
above it but we can if it's a stair and
the stair looks the same because I want

350
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:01,640
the stair looks the same because I want
 

351
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,380
the stair looks the same because I want
to undo yeah I think so right yeah okay

352
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:08,390
to undo yeah I think so right yeah okay
 

353
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:15,150
to undo yeah I think so right yeah okay
so you do that then chess and then the

354
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,160
so you do that then chess and then the
 

355
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,640
so you do that then chess and then the
next thing would be where we would have

356
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:18,650
next thing would be where we would have
 

357
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:24,220
next thing would be where we would have
the item frames so at that level going

358
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:24,230
the item frames so at that level going
 

359
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,190
the item frames so at that level going
all across and each vertical row is a

360
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
all across and each vertical row is a
 

361
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,490
all across and each vertical row is a
group and then we do two chests above

362
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:30,500
group and then we do two chests above
 

363
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:43,630
group and then we do two chests above
that something like this yeah I love how

364
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:43,640
that something like this yeah I love how
 

365
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,100
that something like this yeah I love how
the block kind of sticks out of the

366
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,110
the block kind of sticks out of the
 

367
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:51,280
the block kind of sticks out of the
frame that's really cool so yeah

368
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,290
frame that's really cool so yeah
 

369
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,090
frame that's really cool so yeah
something like this we could probably

370
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:55,100
something like this we could probably
 

371
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,480
something like this we could probably
improve this plate a bit though how's it

372
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,490
improve this plate a bit though how's it
 

373
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,020
improve this plate a bit though how's it
look if we do this I'll probably yeah

374
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,030
look if we do this I'll probably yeah
 

375
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,480
look if we do this I'll probably yeah
I'll probably want to use dark wood

376
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:03,490
I'll probably want to use dark wood
 

377
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,880
I'll probably want to use dark wood
because the overall scene of the storage

378
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:06,890
because the overall scene of the storage
 

379
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,230
because the overall scene of the storage
area is kind of dark so could do that on

380
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,240
area is kind of dark so could do that on
 

381
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,130
area is kind of dark so could do that on
our walls

382
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:12,140
our walls
 

383
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:17,350
our walls
it's hmm is pretty high up to reach

384
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
it's hmm is pretty high up to reach
 

385
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,230
it's hmm is pretty high up to reach
these so each item yet would yet two

386
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
these so each item yet would yet two
 

387
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,820
these so each item yet would yet two
double chests basically with this um you

388
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:27,830
double chests basically with this um you
 

389
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,120
double chests basically with this um you
know what we could do though actually we

390
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,130
know what we could do though actually we
 

391
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,160
know what we could do though actually we
could use half slabs in front like this

392
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,170
could use half slabs in front like this
 

393
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,280
could use half slabs in front like this
and go up like half half a block and

394
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,290
and go up like half half a block and
 

395
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,840
and go up like half half a block and
we'd still be able to open the chests

396
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:42,850

 

397
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,670

that could be cool and then do the same

398
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
that could be cool and then do the same
 

399
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,000
that could be cool and then do the same
for above make it look a little smaller

400
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,010
for above make it look a little smaller
 

401
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,500
for above make it look a little smaller
you know

402
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:52,510

 

403
00:10:52,510 --> 00:11:02,819

maybe maybe come out another block like

404
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:02,829
maybe maybe come out another block like
 

405
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:09,300
maybe maybe come out another block like
that oh I think we are onto something

406
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:09,310
that oh I think we are onto something
 

407
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,240
that oh I think we are onto something
here now I really like this instead of

408
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,250
here now I really like this instead of
 

409
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,569
here now I really like this instead of
half slabs I did stairs right at the at

410
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:15,579
half slabs I did stairs right at the at
 

411
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:17,970
half slabs I did stairs right at the at
the edge here next to the chess you can

412
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:17,980
the edge here next to the chess you can
 

413
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,370
the edge here next to the chess you can
still open them but it gives us a full

414
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:23,380
still open them but it gives us a full
 

415
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,220
still open them but it gives us a full
block height here and above so this is a

416
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,230
block height here and above so this is a
 

417
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,960
block height here and above so this is a
great part about though the item frames

418
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:30,970
great part about though the item frames
 

419
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,689
great part about though the item frames
are at eye level now which I really like

420
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:35,699

 

421
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:40,079

what I would like to try - we're going

422
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,089
what I would like to try - we're going
 

423
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:41,730
what I would like to try - we're going
to perfect this and I'm going to be

424
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:41,740
to perfect this and I'm going to be
 

425
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,370
to perfect this and I'm going to be
really happy with it that's my goal we

426
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:46,380
really happy with it that's my goal we
 

427
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:53,310
really happy with it that's my goal we
if we were to do ah only problem if you

428
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:53,320
if we were to do ah only problem if you
 

429
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,870
if we were to do ah only problem if you
drop stuff in stairs like this you're

430
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
drop stuff in stairs like this you're
 

431
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,730
drop stuff in stairs like this you're
never get in the back unless you break

432
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:56,740
never get in the back unless you break
 

433
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:04,559
never get in the back unless you break
them that's pretty cool oh but we know

434
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:04,569
them that's pretty cool oh but we know
 

435
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:09,540
them that's pretty cool oh but we know
that won't work because we won't be able

436
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:09,550
that won't work because we won't be able
 

437
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,379
that won't work because we won't be able
to open the chests like these ones but

438
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:13,389
to open the chests like these ones but
 

439
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:18,889
to open the chests like these ones but
we could we could use spruce wood stairs

440
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:18,899
we could we could use spruce wood stairs
 

441
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,150
we could we could use spruce wood stairs
yeah let's just try this out we'll use

442
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,160
yeah let's just try this out we'll use
 

443
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,100
yeah let's just try this out we'll use
we'll use full blocks just to see what

444
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,110
we'll use full blocks just to see what
 

445
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,769
we'll use full blocks just to see what
it looks like but we could we could do

446
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:25,779
it looks like but we could we could do
 

447
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:33,210
it looks like but we could we could do
this with stairs later just to give it a

448
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:33,220
this with stairs later just to give it a
 

449
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:40,110
this with stairs later just to give it a
bit more color OOP that works alright

450
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:40,120
bit more color OOP that works alright
 

451
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,090
bit more color OOP that works alright
and maybe instead of like staggering the

452
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:45,100
and maybe instead of like staggering the
 

453
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,879
and maybe instead of like staggering the
chest like this I'll just do a flipped

454
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:47,889
chest like this I'll just do a flipped
 

455
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:53,699
chest like this I'll just do a flipped
image so the chest for the top part

456
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:53,709
image so the chest for the top part
 

457
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:57,210
image so the chest for the top part
would be here and just for this one

458
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:57,220
would be here and just for this one
 

459
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,750
would be here and just for this one
would be up here so reversed of what it

460
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:00,760
would be up here so reversed of what it
 

461
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,880
would be up here so reversed of what it
is

462
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:02,890
is
 

463
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,290
is
oh yeah I love it it's perfect this is

464
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:07,300
oh yeah I love it it's perfect this is
 

465
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,830
oh yeah I love it it's perfect this is
what we're doing I'm pretty sure that

466
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:10,840
what we're doing I'm pretty sure that
 

467
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,140
what we're doing I'm pretty sure that
looks really good very efficient like

468
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,150
looks really good very efficient like
 

469
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,590
looks really good very efficient like
space usage able to store a lot of stuff

470
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:16,600
space usage able to store a lot of stuff
 

471
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,770
space usage able to store a lot of stuff
a good visual on it really happy that

472
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:19,780
a good visual on it really happy that
 

473
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,110
a good visual on it really happy that
the item frames are at I hat eye level

474
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,120
the item frames are at I hat eye level
 

475
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,850
the item frames are at I hat eye level
here and they kind of stand out with the

476
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:23,860
here and they kind of stand out with the
 

477
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:30,810
here and they kind of stand out with the
darker wood yeah very good I liked it so

478
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:30,820
darker wood yeah very good I liked it so

480
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:33,640
I flipped it it's more symmetrical
 

481
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,270
I flipped it it's more symmetrical
looking now with my groups I think I'm

482
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:36,280
looking now with my groups I think I'm
 

483
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,530
looking now with my groups I think I'm
going to always have to make sure I use

484
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:37,540
going to always have to make sure I use
 

485
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:43,050
going to always have to make sure I use
an odd number of stuff so that's this

486
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:43,060
an odd number of stuff so that's this
 

487
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,450
an odd number of stuff so that's this
side and this side are the same because

488
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:45,460
side and this side are the same because
 

489
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,940
side and this side are the same because
if you if you do an even number it looks

490
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:47,950
if you if you do an even number it looks
 

491
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,210
if you if you do an even number it looks
weird it's like that way and then that

492
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:51,220
weird it's like that way and then that
 

493
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,480
weird it's like that way and then that
way you know what I mean so odd numbers

494
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,490
way you know what I mean so odd numbers
 

495
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:00,140
way you know what I mean so odd numbers
either threes 5 7 9 11 s you know

496
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,150
either threes 5 7 9 11 s you know
 

497
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:04,350
either threes 5 7 9 11 s you know
vertical columns now I did have an idea

498
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:04,360
vertical columns now I did have an idea
 

499
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,480
vertical columns now I did have an idea
here though like we could do our walls

500
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,490
here though like we could do our walls
 

501
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,290
here though like we could do our walls

like this have have little sections like
 

503
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,990
like this have have little sections like
this where we separate our groups with

504
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,000
this where we separate our groups with
 

505
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,780
this where we separate our groups with
the with the wood there or I'm thinking

506
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:18,790
the with the wood there or I'm thinking
 

507
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,210

to finish organizing this once we do

570
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:52,529
to finish organizing this once we do
 

571
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:55,160
to finish organizing this once we do
that we can start building because we'll

572
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,170
that we can start building because we'll
 

573
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:00,759
that we can start building because we'll
know how many sections we need like this

574
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:00,769

 

575
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,669

each of these would hold 15 different

576

each of these would hold 15 different
 

577
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,490
each of these would hold 15 different
items let's go down below let's just go

578
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:07,500
items let's go down below let's just go
 

579
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:14,630
items let's go down below let's just go
down below for a sec 15 items yeah we

580
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
down below for a sec 15 items yeah we
 

581
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,179
down below for a sec 15 items yeah we
really can't plan too much ahead until

see what it would look like three high

636
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:37,740
see what it would look like three high
 

637
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,450
see what it would look like three high
and then I have it sloping inward and I

638
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:41,460
and then I have it sloping inward and I
 

639
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,310
and then I have it sloping inward and I
have it all connected together like the

640
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,320
have it all connected together like the
 

641
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,350
have it all connected together like the
stairs connect together which is pretty

642
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
stairs connect together which is pretty
 

643
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,570
stairs connect together which is pretty
cool getting these lighting glitches

644
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:47,580
cool getting these lighting glitches
 

645
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,450
cool getting these lighting glitches
with them like these dark spots here can

646
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:50,460
with them like these dark spots here can
 

647
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,540
with them like these dark spots here can
fix those and I will just by breaking

648
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:53,550
fix those and I will just by breaking
 

649
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:58,570
fix those and I will just by breaking
the block above there we go

650
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:58,580
the block above there we go
 

651
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,830
the block above there we go
one thing though I'm noticing with these

652
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:00,840
one thing though I'm noticing with these
 

653
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,110
one thing though I'm noticing with these
sandstone stairs they still have a line

654
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
sandstone stairs they still have a line
 

655
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,280
sandstone stairs they still have a line
here like where they connect right there

656
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,290

 

657
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,450

but I guess it's not terrible

658
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:11,460
but I guess it's not terrible
 

659
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,850
but I guess it's not terrible
then what over and these things I'm

660
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:13,860
then what over and these things I'm
 

661
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,190
then what over and these things I'm
going to have like a little display

662
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,200
going to have like a little display
 

663
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,150
going to have like a little display
probably like I might put a wheat or

664
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
probably like I might put a wheat or
 

665
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,420
probably like I might put a wheat or
flowers or something in them just for a

666
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:23,430
flowers or something in them just for a
 

667
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,680
flowers or something in them just for a
little something extra and I also missed

668
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:27,690
little something extra and I also missed
 

669
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,320
little something extra and I also missed
around with the hidden wire access door

670
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:30,330
around with the hidden wire access door
 

671
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,630
around with the hidden wire access door
order here so I might do them all like

672
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640
order here so I might do them all like
 

673
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,380
order here so I might do them all like
this but like this

674
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:35,390
this but like this
 

675
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,620
this but like this
just retracts the Pistons

676
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:38,630
just retracts the Pistons
 

677
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:44,350
just retracts the Pistons
and we have a nice little room here and

678
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:44,360
and we have a nice little room here and
 

679
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,150
and we have a nice little room here and
pretty much get to everything this is

680
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
pretty much get to everything this is
 

681
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:55,000
pretty much get to everything this is
the wiring below and I might make most

682
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,010
the wiring below and I might make most
 

683
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,680
the wiring below and I might make most
the room out of stone brick or I might

684
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:56,690
the room out of stone brick or I might
 

685
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,600
the room out of stone brick or I might
leave it another netherrack I'm not sure

686
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:58,610
leave it another netherrack I'm not sure
 

687
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,360
leave it another netherrack I'm not sure
not too worried about gas blowing it up

688
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,370
not too worried about gas blowing it up
 

689
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,940
not too worried about gas blowing it up
because I know there's a lot of

690
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:03,950
because I know there's a lot of
 

691
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,130
because I know there's a lot of
netherrack here in the way also I never

692
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:09,140
netherrack here in the way also I never
 

693
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,000
netherrack here in the way also I never
showed my cart launching system so when

694
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,010
showed my cart launching system so when
 

695
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,820
showed my cart launching system so when
you press a button piston goes up and it

696
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:15,830
you press a button piston goes up and it
 

697
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,180
you press a button piston goes up and it
powers the track so you take off then on

698
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,190
powers the track so you take off then on
 

699
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,950
powers the track so you take off then on
the way back there's this detector rail

700
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:20,960
the way back there's this detector rail
 

701
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,919
the way back there's this detector rail
when it goes over that the piston goes

702
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:23,929
when it goes over that the piston goes
 

703
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:25,779
when it goes over that the piston goes
up again but it doesn't power the rail

704
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:25,789
up again but it doesn't power the rail
 

705
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:28,980
up again but it doesn't power the rail
so if the cart should hit the the block

706
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:28,990
so if the cart should hit the the block
 

707
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,289
so if the cart should hit the the block
before it goes down and they'll align it

708
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:32,299
before it goes down and they'll align it
 

709
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,409
before it goes down and they'll align it
perfectly where it needs to be and

710
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:34,419
perfectly where it needs to be and
 

711
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:37,360
perfectly where it needs to be and
that's how I plan on doing that and then

712
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,370
that's how I plan on doing that and then
 

713
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,799
that's how I plan on doing that and then
I started digging out this tunnel which

714
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:38,809
I started digging out this tunnel which
 

715
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:44,830
I started digging out this tunnel which
goes as stronghold I think with my track

716
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:44,840
goes as stronghold I think with my track
 

717
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,180
goes as stronghold I think with my track
system I'm going to make it go straight

718
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,190
system I'm going to make it go straight
 

719
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:50,110
system I'm going to make it go straight
and then it'll branch off to the right

720
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,120
and then it'll branch off to the right
 

721
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,669
and then it'll branch off to the right
here for one destination it's really not

722
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:54,679
here for one destination it's really not
 

723
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:57,330
here for one destination it's really not
that far this is a stronghold portal I

724
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:57,340
that far this is a stronghold portal I
 

725
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,980
that far this is a stronghold portal I
also went a little further here and this

726
00:20:59,980 --> 00:20:59,990
also went a little further here and this
 

727
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,299
also went a little further here and this
goes all the way to my sand quarry which

728
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:04,309
goes all the way to my sand quarry which
 

729
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:05,560
goes all the way to my sand quarry which
is where I would like to move the

730
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:05,570
is where I would like to move the
 

731
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,529
is where I would like to move the
silverfish that portal takes us there

732
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:08,539
silverfish that portal takes us there
 

733
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:14,610
silverfish that portal takes us there
and yeah that's about it for the nether

734
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:14,620

 

735
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,980

never did fix that silverfish problem

736
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:17,990
never did fix that silverfish problem
 

737
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:26,009
never did fix that silverfish problem
though too bad all right

738
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:26,019

 

739
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,509

alright let's end the episode with a

740
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:28,519
alright let's end the episode with a
 

741
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:32,110
alright let's end the episode with a
comment etho zombie villagers either

742
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,120
comment etho zombie villagers either
 

743
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,810
comment etho zombie villagers either
randomly spawn or become infected by

744
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:34,820

when I found one I had no idea that they

758
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:54,200
when I found one I had no idea that they
 

759
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,799
when I found one I had no idea that they
spawned randomly the zombie villagers I

760
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:56,809
spawned randomly the zombie villagers I
 

761
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:59,710
spawned randomly the zombie villagers I
thought they only could be created by

762
00:21:59,710 --> 00:21:59,720
thought they only could be created by
 

763
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,590
thought they only could be created by
getting infected so that was a surprise

764
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:02,600
getting infected so that was a surprise
 

765
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
getting infected so that was a surprise
to me

766
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:03,610
to me
 

767
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,799
to me
just another joy of playing the

768
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:05,809
just another joy of playing the
 

769
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:10,110
just another joy of playing the
snapshots without giving the spoilers

770
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,120
snapshots without giving the spoilers
 

771
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,810
snapshots without giving the spoilers
but yeah turns out I think it's like 10%

772
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:13,820
but yeah turns out I think it's like 10%
 

773
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,149
but yeah turns out I think it's like 10%
or something chance that when a zombie

774
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
or something chance that when a zombie
 

775
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,990
or something chance that when a zombie
spawns they can become a zombie villager

776
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:19,000
spawns they can become a zombie villager
 

777
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,909
spawns they can become a zombie villager
and the other day I went out looking for

778
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
and the other day I went out looking for

him i lured a Samba villager into one of
 

785
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,700
him i lured a Samba villager into one of
the houses blocked it off and I was

786
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:33,710
the houses blocked it off and I was
 

787
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,029
the houses blocked it off and I was
going to enter pearl out but he cornered

788
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
going to enter pearl out but he cornered
 

789
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,539
going to enter pearl out but he cornered
me and killed me and when I came back to

790
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:40,549
me and killed me and when I came back to
 

791
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:45,879
me and killed me and when I came back to
my stuff since they D spawn he was gone

792
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:45,889
my stuff since they D spawn he was gone
 

793
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:49,019
my stuff since they D spawn he was gone
I went because I was out of range and

794
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:49,029
I went because I was out of range and
 

795
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:51,940
I went because I was out of range and
when I came back for my stuff my armor
