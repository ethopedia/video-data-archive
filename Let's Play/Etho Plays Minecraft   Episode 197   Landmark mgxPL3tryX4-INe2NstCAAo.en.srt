into making one
 

577

into making one
myself and went and bought a mic

578
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
myself and went and bought a mic
 

579
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,829
myself and went and bought a mic
and recorded my first episode

580
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839

 

581
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,350

yeah there's going to be a lot of

582
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
yeah there's going to be a lot of
 

583
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,269
yeah there's going to be a lot of
tweaking and playing around with

584
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
tweaking and playing around with
 

585
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,110
tweaking and playing around with
different types of blocks until i get my

586
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
different types of blocks until i get my
 

587
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,269
different types of blocks until i get my
style figured out here

588
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
style figured out here
 

589
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:54,829
style figured out here
we got to choose between a

590
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:54,839

 

591
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,389

b

592
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
b
 

593
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,230
b
c

594
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240

 

595
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,670

or

596
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680

 

597
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:11,269

d or e none of the above

598
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
d or e none of the above
 

599
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,910
d or e none of the above
and also the plan with this part was to

600
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
and also the plan with this part was to
 

601
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,069
and also the plan with this part was to
make it ice when we can

602
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,079
make it ice when we can
 

603
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,629
make it ice when we can
we can't do that though until 1.3 comes

604
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
we can't do that though until 1.3 comes
 

605
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,350
we can't do that though until 1.3 comes
out

606
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
out
 

607
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,509
out
when we can pick up ice with silk touch

608
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
when we can pick up ice with silk touch
 

609
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,710
when we can pick up ice with silk touch
again

610
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
again
 

611
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,190
again
so i think in the meantime what i'll do

612
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
so i think in the meantime what i'll do
 

613
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,110
so i think in the meantime what i'll do
is just change it to grass so it looks

614
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
is just change it to grass so it looks
 

615
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,750
is just change it to grass so it looks
better

616
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760
better
 

617
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,670
better
until we actually make the change um

618
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
until we actually make the change um
 

619
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,750
until we actually make the change um
and who knows we might become attached

620
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
and who knows we might become attached
 

621
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,750
and who knows we might become attached
to the grass or

622
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
to the grass or
 

623
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,269
to the grass or
we will switch it to ice when we can

624
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
we will switch it to ice when we can
 

625
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,910
we will switch it to ice when we can
um with changing this to a circle

626
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:41,920
um with changing this to a circle
 

627
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,550
um with changing this to a circle
instead of the octagon

628
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560
instead of the octagon
 

629
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,550
instead of the octagon
it seems to be okay up here like the

630
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
it seems to be okay up here like the
 

631
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,710
it seems to be okay up here like the
only place it really got narrower

632
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
only place it really got narrower
 

633
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,269
only place it really got narrower
is at these parts here and

634
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
is at these parts here and
 

635
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,670
is at these parts here and
it it still seems wide enough as i go by

636
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
it it still seems wide enough as i go by
 

637
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,110
it it still seems wide enough as i go by
here

638
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
here
 

639
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,550
here
the thing i was worried about is these

640
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
the thing i was worried about is these
 

641
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,230
the thing i was worried about is these
fronts being too

642
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
fronts being too
 

643
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,949
fronts being too
too narrow if we made a circle but it's

644
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
too narrow if we made a circle but it's
 

645
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,190
too narrow if we made a circle but it's
it's about the same

646
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
it's about the same
 

647
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,389
it's about the same
even with it so that's good

648
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
even with it so that's good
 

649
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,629
even with it so that's good
um so i'll switch this out and then we

650
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639
um so i'll switch this out and then we
 

651
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,670
um so i'll switch this out and then we
will

652
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
will
 

653
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,870

and it would play an audio tune

680
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
and it would play an audio tune
 

681
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,350
and it would play an audio tune
zelda tune that would tell me it's time

682
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
zelda tune that would tell me it's time
 

683
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,150
zelda tune that would tell me it's time
to pick them up

684
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
to pick them up
 

685
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,069
to pick them up
otherwise they're i'm going to start

686
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
otherwise they're i'm going to start
 

687
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,470
otherwise they're i'm going to start
losing them type thing

688
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
losing them type thing
 

689
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,829
losing them type thing
the way i did it before we're going to

690
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:55,839
the way i did it before we're going to
 

691
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,189
the way i did it before we're going to
have to figure this out

692
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
have to figure this out
 

693
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,829
have to figure this out
i had two pressure plates and a

694
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839
i had two pressure plates and a
 

695
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,110
i had two pressure plates and a
dispenser

696
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
dispenser
 

697
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,750
dispenser
like we'll just set it up like this

698
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
like we'll just set it up like this
 

699
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,310
like we'll just set it up like this
basically

700
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
basically
 

701
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,750
basically
when the mobs would land on the pressure

702
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
when the mobs would land on the pressure
 

703
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,590
when the mobs would land on the pressure
plates or when their loot would it would

704
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
plates or when their loot would it would
 

705
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,030
plates or when their loot would it would
go down

706
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
go down
 

707
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,269
go down
that would trigger this telling it to

708
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
that would trigger this telling it to
 

709
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,550
that would trigger this telling it to
shoot out one so

710
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
shoot out one so
 

711
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,269
shoot out one so
it would also be on and then when i

712
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279
it would also be on and then when i
 

713
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,389
it would also be on and then when i
would go pick up

714
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
would go pick up
 

715
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,870
would go pick up
the stuff i would grab it off of both of

716
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
the stuff i would grab it off of both of
 

717
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,470
the stuff i would grab it off of both of
them

718
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
them
 

719
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,150
them
and that would reset the thing

720
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
and that would reset the thing
 

721
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,310
and that would reset the thing
it would cause this to shoot again and

722
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
it would cause this to shoot again and
 

723
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,230
it would cause this to shoot again and
also

724
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
also
 

725
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,629
also
it would play the tune when i did that

726
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
it would play the tune when i did that
 

727
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,269
it would play the tune when i did that
or

728
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
or
 

729
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,670
or
the other thing that would happen if

730
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
the other thing that would happen if
 

731
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,269
the other thing that would happen if
there was loot on this one

732
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
there was loot on this one
 

733
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,509
there was loot on this one
and this one despawned after the five

734
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519
and this one despawned after the five
 

735
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,069
and this one despawned after the five
minute timer

736
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
minute timer
 

737
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,069
minute timer
that was on and that was off then it

738
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,079
that was on and that was off then it
 

739
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,750
that was on and that was off then it
would also play the tune

740
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
would also play the tune
 

741
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,470
would also play the tune
and tell me it's time to pick this up so

742
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
and tell me it's time to pick this up so
 

743
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,829
and tell me it's time to pick this up so
that's what we're going to try mimic the

744
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
that's what we're going to try mimic the
 

745
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,110
that's what we're going to try mimic the
thing i

746
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
thing i
 

747
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,350
thing i
don't want though like with this setup

748
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
don't want though like with this setup
 

749
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,150
don't want though like with this setup
uh we only got one block here right so

750
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
uh we only got one block here right so
 

751
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,189
uh we only got one block here right so
we can't do it

752
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
we can't do it
 

753
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,910
we can't do it
like we had before because before we had

754
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
like we had before because before we had
 

755
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,710
like we had before because before we had
two pressure plates side by side

756
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
two pressure plates side by side
 

757
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,150
two pressure plates side by side
and when you grab it you would get both

758
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
and when you grab it you would get both
 

759
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,750
and when you grab it you would get both
i want to try hook this up so it works

760
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
i want to try hook this up so it works
 

761
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,590
i want to try hook this up so it works
on one

762
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
on one
 

763
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,790
on one
and we got to figure out how to do that

764
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
and we got to figure out how to do that
 

765
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,829
and we got to figure out how to do that
so basically one

766
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
so basically one
 

767
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,430
so basically one
visible one we'll have we'll still need

768
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
visible one we'll have we'll still need
 

769
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,110
visible one we'll have we'll still need
the two but one of them will be hidden

770
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
the two but one of them will be hidden
 

771
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,150
the two but one of them will be hidden
underground

772
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
underground
 

773
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,150
underground
out of sight out of mind um

774
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
out of sight out of mind um
 

775
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,430
out of sight out of mind um
so i'm going to play with the redstone a

776
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
so i'm going to play with the redstone a
 

777
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,790
so i'm going to play with the redstone a
little bit and see if we can figure this

778
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
little bit and see if we can figure this
 

779
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,069
little bit and see if we can figure this
out

780
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079

 

781
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,550

so before we do the redstone we should

782
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,560
so before we do the redstone we should
 

783
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,350
so before we do the redstone we should
really figure out

784
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
really figure out
 

785
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,350
really figure out
the logic behind this thing what we want

786
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
the logic behind this thing what we want
 

787
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,350
the logic behind this thing what we want
it to do exactly

788
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
it to do exactly
 

789
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,030
it to do exactly
and then we'll figure out the and gates

790
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
and then we'll figure out the and gates
 

791
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,590
and then we'll figure out the and gates
and how that all needs to be set up

792
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
and how that all needs to be set up
 

793
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,509
and how that all needs to be set up
so i got a indicator light here when

794
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
so i got a indicator light here when
 

795
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,749
so i got a indicator light here when
there's something on this pressure plate

796
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759

 

797
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,470

turned on we can pick it up from over

798
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,480
turned on we can pick it up from over
 

799
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:54,870
turned on we can pick it up from over
here

800
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
here
 

801
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,990
here
while we test it uh

802
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
while we test it uh
 

803
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,269
while we test it uh
i think what we want for sure if

804
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
i think what we want for sure if
 

805
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,550
i think what we want for sure if
if a mob drop falls on

806
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
if a mob drop falls on
 

807
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,430
if a mob drop falls on
the pressure plate that would be the one

808
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,440
the pressure plate that would be the one
 

809
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,670
the pressure plate that would be the one
we're going to put over here

810
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
we're going to put over here
 

811
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,590
we're going to put over here
uh the pressure plate over here is going

812
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
uh the pressure plate over here is going
 

813
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,710
uh the pressure plate over here is going
to be hidden underground

814
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
to be hidden underground
 

815
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,949
to be hidden underground
this one but this is the one the stuff

816
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
this one but this is the one the stuff
 

817
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,310
this one but this is the one the stuff
will fall on

818
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
will fall on
 

819
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,470
will fall on
i think when that goes down we always

820
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
i think when that goes down we always
 

821
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,910
i think when that goes down we always
want it to shoot

822
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:19,920
want it to shoot
 

823
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,949
want it to shoot
the five minute timer and get that going

824
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
the five minute timer and get that going
 

825
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,269
the five minute timer and get that going
if an item another item falls like if

826
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
if an item another item falls like if
 

827
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,550
if an item another item falls like if
another mob falls down

828
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
another mob falls down
 

829
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,910
another mob falls down
while this is on here doesn't matter it

830
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
while this is on here doesn't matter it
 

831
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,470
while this is on here doesn't matter it
doesn't press it again

832
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
doesn't press it again
 

833
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,949
doesn't press it again
if we pick up the items before the five

834
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
if we pick up the items before the five
 

835
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:35,590
if we pick up the items before the five
minutes are

836
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
minutes are
 

837
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,430
minutes are
up

838
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,440

 

839
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,710

that goes up and we can

840
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
that goes up and we can
 

841
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,949
that goes up and we can
like mobs can fall on it again and that

842
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:44,959
like mobs can fall on it again and that
 

843
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:45,910
like mobs can fall on it again and that
will

844
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
will
 

845
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,749
will
shoot out another item and it resets the

846
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
shoot out another item and it resets the
 

847
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,069
shoot out another item and it resets the
five minute timer anyway

848
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
five minute timer anyway
 

849
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,629
five minute timer anyway
so it keeps working

850
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639

 

851
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,790

let's see i think this is simpler than i

852
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
let's see i think this is simpler than i
 

853
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,670
let's see i think this is simpler than i
thought it was going to be

854
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
thought it was going to be
 

855
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,870
thought it was going to be
if yeah so

856
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
if yeah so
 

857
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,549
if yeah so
if there's items on that if that

858
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
if there's items on that if that
 

859
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,350
if there's items on that if that
pressure plate is down and this one

860
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,360
pressure plate is down and this one
 

861
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,630
pressure plate is down and this one
go it was down but goes up i think

862
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
go it was down but goes up i think
 

863
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,829
go it was down but goes up i think
that's what we want to trigger the tune

864
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839

 

865
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,350

uh

866
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
uh
 

867
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,429
uh
like the way i had it before i think i

868
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
like the way i had it before i think i
 

869
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,029
like the way i had it before i think i
also had to play the tune when i picked

870
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
also had to play the tune when i picked
 

871
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,510
also had to play the tune when i picked
up the items

872
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
up the items
 

873
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,189
up the items
the question is if we wanted to do that

874
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
the question is if we wanted to do that
 

875
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,110
the question is if we wanted to do that
or not if we do we need to do something

876
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120
or not if we do we need to do something
 

877
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,990
or not if we do we need to do something
else as well

878
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
else as well
 

879
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,549
else as well
otherwise it's really simple

880
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,559

 

881
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,470

okay here's what we'll do we'll just

882
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,480
okay here's what we'll do we'll just
 

883
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,909
okay here's what we'll do we'll just
make a very

884
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
make a very
 

885
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,630
make a very
simple and gate here to see what happens

886
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
simple and gate here to see what happens
 

887
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,470
simple and gate here to see what happens
if we

888
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
if we
 

889
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,669
if we
have that there um

890
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679

 

891
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,950

oh wait actually no run that over to

892
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:52,960
oh wait actually no run that over to
 

893
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,310
oh wait actually no run that over to
here

894
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
here
 

895
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,830
here
there i made a note block put that next

896
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
there i made a note block put that next
 

897
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,870
there i made a note block put that next
to it

898
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
to it
 

899
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,549
to it
so right now it's off

900
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559

 

901
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,630

so this is going to check if if one is

902
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
so this is going to check if if one is
 

903
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,070
so this is going to check if if one is
doing something another is doing

904
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
doing something another is doing
 

905
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,270
doing something another is doing
something

906
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
something
 

907
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,070
something
if if it's going to let power through

908
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080

 

909
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,470

okay so it played once an item landed on

910
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,480
okay so it played once an item landed on
 

911
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,710
okay so it played once an item landed on
there that's not good

912
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
there that's not good
 

913
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,350
there that's not good
um if we pick it up

914
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
um if we pick it up
 

915
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,230
um if we pick it up
it doesn't play we don't want it to when

916
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
it doesn't play we don't want it to when
 

917
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,150
it doesn't play we don't want it to when
we pick it up

918
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
we pick it up
 

919
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,710
we pick it up
well we might i'm not sure if we should

920
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720

 

921
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,909

okay that's shooting those if we pick

922
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
okay that's shooting those if we pick
 

923
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,789
okay that's shooting those if we pick
this up

924
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:36,799

 

925
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,310

then it plays that's what we want when

926
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
then it plays that's what we want when
 

927
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,710
then it plays that's what we want when
we pick that up

928
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
we pick that up
 

929
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,549
we pick that up
and if there's nothing on both right

930
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
and if there's nothing on both right
 

931
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,150
and if there's nothing on both right
so this is pretty much all we need

932
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
so this is pretty much all we need
 

933
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,590
so this is pretty much all we need
actually

934
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
actually
 

935
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,110
actually
we just need to figure out how to get

936
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120
we just need to figure out how to get
 

937
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,830
we just need to figure out how to get
rid of that initial

938
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
rid of that initial
 

939
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,029
rid of that initial
play and i think it's because we have a

940
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
play and i think it's because we have a
 

941
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,430
play and i think it's because we have a
delay that it's doing that

942
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,440
delay that it's doing that
 

943
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,310
delay that it's doing that
let us

944
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,320

 

945
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,830

just change this real quick

946
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:08,840

 

947
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,669

um we'll put the torch

948
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
um we'll put the torch
 

949
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,150
um we'll put the torch
above here i guess

950
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,160

 

951
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,549

we'll have to move that this is really

952
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
we'll have to move that this is really
 

953
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,070
we'll have to move that this is really
sloppy i know

954
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
sloppy i know
 

955
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,830
sloppy i know
it's okay as long as it does what it's

956
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
it's okay as long as it does what it's
 

957
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,110
it's okay as long as it does what it's
supposed to so now

958
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
supposed to so now
 

959
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,950
supposed to so now
now they have the same delay let's see

960
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
now they have the same delay let's see
 

961
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,549
now they have the same delay let's see
if it'll play it

962
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
if it'll play it
 

963
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,710
if it'll play it
on the startup

964
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:30,720

 

965
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:45,590

it does hmm

966
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600

 

967
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:53,430

did i change something here

968
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,440
did i change something here
 

969
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,470
did i change something here
oh

970
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480

 

971
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,190

wait a minute i think it's because this

972
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
wait a minute i think it's because this
 

973
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,870
wait a minute i think it's because this
is inverted now

974
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,880
is inverted now
 

975
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:16,230
is inverted now
okay well if we do this

976
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,240

 

977
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,870

this is falling apart now

978
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
this is falling apart now
 

979
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,789
this is falling apart now
do that

980
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799

 

981
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:32,830

this is why we do redstone off camera

982
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:32,840

 

983
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,470

okay

984
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480

 

985
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,669

pick this up it shouldn't play

986
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
pick this up it shouldn't play
 

987
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,270
pick this up it shouldn't play
good and if we pick this up

988
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
good and if we pick this up
 

989
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,390
good and if we pick this up
it should now right so we're just going

990
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:46,400
it should now right so we're just going
 

991
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,510
it should now right so we're just going
to figure out how to get rid of the

992
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
to figure out how to get rid of the
 

993
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,430
to figure out how to get rid of the
startup tune

994
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440

 

995
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,590

and oh that's what it is it's the delay

996
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,600
and oh that's what it is it's the delay
 

997
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,350
and oh that's what it is it's the delay
from this shooting out and landing on

998
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
from this shooting out and landing on
 

999
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,310
from this shooting out and landing on
the pressure plates

1000
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,320
the pressure plates
 

1001
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,070
the pressure plates
that's causing it so if we delay this

1002
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
that's causing it so if we delay this
 

1003
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,510
that's causing it so if we delay this
one

1004
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
one
 

1005
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,669
one
that should fix it

1006
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:03,679
that should fix it
 

1007
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,909
that should fix it
yep so all i did is i added a delay

1008
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:05,919
yep so all i did is i added a delay
 

1009
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,029
yep so all i did is i added a delay
before

1010
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:07,039
before
 

1011
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,789
before
the and gate here and that seems to do

1012
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:08,799
the and gate here and that seems to do
 

1013
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,070
the and gate here and that seems to do
the trick

1014
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
the trick
 

1015
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,990
the trick
it gives the five minute timer enough

1016
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
it gives the five minute timer enough
 

1017
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,390
it gives the five minute timer enough
time for the item to fall down to the

1018
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
time for the item to fall down to the
 

1019
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,950
time for the item to fall down to the
pressure plates

1020
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:16,960
pressure plates
 

1021
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,070
pressure plates
so let's check it out mob loot falls on

1022
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080
so let's check it out mob loot falls on
 

1023
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,750
so let's check it out mob loot falls on
there

1024
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:21,760
there
 

1025
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,669
there
didn't hear this go off like we did

1026
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
didn't hear this go off like we did
 

1027
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,950
didn't hear this go off like we did
before

1028
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
before
 

1029
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,149
before
and if we pick this up

1030
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,159

 

1031
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,070

we hear the sound so after the five

1032
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
we hear the sound so after the five
 

1033
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,350
we hear the sound so after the five
minutes and

1034
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
minutes and
 

1035
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,750
minutes and
loot starts despawning it gives us our

1036
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
loot starts despawning it gives us our
 

1037
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,110
loot starts despawning it gives us our
warning signal

1038
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
warning signal
 

1039
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,870
warning signal
through the note block to come pick

1040
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
through the note block to come pick
 

1041
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,950
through the note block to come pick
stuff up

1042
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
stuff up
 

1043
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,950
stuff up
um

1044
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960

 

1045
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,230

and it won't play sound if we pick that

1046
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,240
and it won't play sound if we pick that
 

1047
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,630
and it won't play sound if we pick that
up and

1048
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640

 

1049
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,310

let's see what other conditions would

1050
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,320
let's see what other conditions would
 

1051
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,270
let's see what other conditions would
there be

1052
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280

 

1053
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,110

yeah well i guess that's it so if we

1054
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,120
yeah well i guess that's it so if we
 

1055
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,710
yeah well i guess that's it so if we
wanted it to play sound

1056
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:58,720
wanted it to play sound
 

1057
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,549
wanted it to play sound
when we picked up the items like every

1058
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
when we picked up the items like every
 

1059
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,029
when we picked up the items like every
time we do all we would need to do

1060
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,039
time we do all we would need to do
 

1061
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,990
time we do all we would need to do
is also connect this pressure plate

1062
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
is also connect this pressure plate
 

1063
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,029
is also connect this pressure plate
directly to

1064
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
directly to
 

1065
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,149
directly to
our noteblock sequence that way

1066
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
our noteblock sequence that way
 

1067
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,950
our noteblock sequence that way
inverted uh connect it inverted so that

1068
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:12,960
inverted uh connect it inverted so that
 

1069
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,470
inverted uh connect it inverted so that
when the pressure plate goes up

1070
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,480
when the pressure plate goes up
 

1071
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,310
when the pressure plate goes up
it will go through the note blocks um

1072
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,320
it will go through the note blocks um
 

1073
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,230
it will go through the note blocks um
so i'm not sure if i want to play it

1074
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
so i'm not sure if i want to play it
 

1075
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,190
so i'm not sure if i want to play it
every time i think i'll just keep it to

1076
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,200
every time i think i'll just keep it to
 

1077
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,430
every time i think i'll just keep it to
uh the five minute d spawn that it would

1078
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,440
uh the five minute d spawn that it would
 

1079
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,630
uh the five minute d spawn that it would
play

1080
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640

 

1081
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,110

all right very good very good so we know

1082
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,120
all right very good very good so we know
 

1083
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,390
all right very good very good so we know
how to build it now

1084
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
how to build it now
 

1085
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,549
how to build it now
this is going to be hidden underneath

1086
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
this is going to be hidden underneath
 

1087
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,830
this is going to be hidden underneath
these emp units out of sight

1088
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
these emp units out of sight
 

1089
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,270
these emp units out of sight
i guess where stuff drops i'm going to

1090
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,280
i guess where stuff drops i'm going to
 

1091
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,510
i guess where stuff drops i'm going to
put a lamp

1092
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520
put a lamp
 

1093
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,510
put a lamp
and the pressure plate above that so

1094
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
and the pressure plate above that so
 

1095
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,789
and the pressure plate above that so
it'll light up when there's

1096
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:46,799
it'll light up when there's
 

1097
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:53,190
it'll light up when there's
loot on it

1098
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,200

 

1099
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,470

yeah i think i'll wait though maybe a

1100
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,480
yeah i think i'll wait though maybe a
 

1101
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,230
yeah i think i'll wait though maybe a
little bit we got to wire up the emp

1102
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,240
little bit we got to wire up the emp
 

1103
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,029
little bit we got to wire up the emp
units is what we got to do first

1104
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
units is what we got to do first
 

1105
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,470
units is what we got to do first
uh how do i get down

1106
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480
uh how do i get down
 

1107
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,190
uh how do i get down
over here because there's not a lot of

1108
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,200
over here because there's not a lot of
 

1109
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,149
over here because there's not a lot of
space around

1110
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
space around
 

1111
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,950
space around
underneath them i'll have to be pretty

1112
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
underneath them i'll have to be pretty
 

1113
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,669
underneath them i'll have to be pretty
compact the way i do it so i may either

1114
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
compact the way i do it so i may either
 

1115
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,510
compact the way i do it so i may either
have to

1116
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
have to
 

1117
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,430
have to
um i'll know when i do the emp units but

1118
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
um i'll know when i do the emp units but
 

1119
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,750
um i'll know when i do the emp units but
i i suspect i'm going to have to put

1120
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,760
i i suspect i'm going to have to put
 

1121
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,549
i i suspect i'm going to have to put
the dispenser in that a little ways away

1122
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:26,559
the dispenser in that a little ways away
 

1123
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,990
the dispenser in that a little ways away
from

1124
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
from
 

1125
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,909
from
from where they are and i'm only going

1126
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
from where they are and i'm only going
 

1127
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,830
from where they are and i'm only going
to hook it up to

1128
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
to hook it up to
 

1129
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,270
to hook it up to
the general mob dropper not the

1130
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,280
the general mob dropper not the
 

1131
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,549
the general mob dropper not the
the ones i plan on sorting so just this

1132
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
the ones i plan on sorting so just this
 

1133
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,270
the ones i plan on sorting so just this
main one

1134
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,280
main one
 

1135
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,470
main one
this main tube over here

1136
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
this main tube over here
 

1137
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,510
this main tube over here
and also what i would like to do because

1138
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520
and also what i would like to do because
 

1139
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,029
and also what i would like to do because
in my old one i had

1140
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,039
in my old one i had
 

1141
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,110
in my old one i had
lights that would blink when it was time

1142
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,120
lights that would blink when it was time
 

1143
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,830
lights that would blink when it was time
to harvest the stuff

1144
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
to harvest the stuff
 

1145
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,029
to harvest the stuff
it would be cool to maybe have lamps

1146
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
it would be cool to maybe have lamps
 

1147
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,789
it would be cool to maybe have lamps
around my place here every

1148
00:23:58,789 --> 00:23:58,799

 

1149
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,669

like maybe just a few around the area so

1150
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:01,679
like maybe just a few around the area so
 

1151
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,430
like maybe just a few around the area so
if i miss the

1152
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,440
if i miss the
 

1153
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,669
if i miss the
audio chime the zelda tune i can

1154
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:07,679
audio chime the zelda tune i can
 

1155
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,149
audio chime the zelda tune i can
have a visual indicator as well that i

1156
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
have a visual indicator as well that i
 

1157
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,149
have a visual indicator as well that i
need to pick up the stuff

1158
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:12,159
need to pick up the stuff
 

1159
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,990
need to pick up the stuff
like if i'm out of the area out of the

1160
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
like if i'm out of the area out of the
 

1161
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,830
like if i'm out of the area out of the
range of the noteblocks

1162
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:15,840
range of the noteblocks
 

1163
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,149
range of the noteblocks
that's that could be useful um

1164
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
that's that could be useful um
 

1165
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,909
that's that could be useful um
that guy's been there this whole episode

1166
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919
that guy's been there this whole episode
 

1167
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,549
