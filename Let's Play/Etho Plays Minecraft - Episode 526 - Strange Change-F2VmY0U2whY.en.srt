processor now we went from a I think i7

128
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:53,220
processor now we went from a I think i7
 

129
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:59,920
processor now we went from a I think i7
4770k to a i7 9700 at 3 gigahertz here

130
00:02:59,920 --> 00:02:59,930

131
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,020
4770k to a i7 9700 at 3 gigahertz here
that's a little bit faster and we also

132
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,030
that's a little bit faster and we also
 

133
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,009
that's a little bit faster and we also

it's just a cheapo $50 headset but the

340
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:55,220
it's just a cheapo $50 headset but the
 

341
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,450
it's just a cheapo $50 headset but the
microphone on it is amazing right I

342
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:58,460

sound different in the early videos

344
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,140
sound different in the early videos
 

345
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,020
sound different in the early videos
though because like my voice was

346
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,030
though because like my voice was
 

347
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,360
though because like my voice was
probably different my speaking style and

348
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,370
probably different my speaking style and
 

349
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,690
probably different my speaking style and
also my settings did change over time

350
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:07,700
also my settings did change over time
 

351
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,430
also my settings did change over time
because I used to whisper in the videos

352
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
because I used to whisper in the videos
 

353
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,400
because I used to whisper in the videos
and but then I figured out how to change

354
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:12,410
and but then I figured out how to change
 

355
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,910
and but then I figured out how to change
it properly but anyways always had the

356
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:15,920
it properly but anyways always had the
 

357
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,460
it properly but anyways always had the
same exact headset right I plug it into

358
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:18,470
same exact headset right I plug it into
 

359
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,580
same exact headset right I plug it into
the new computer and it doesn't sound as

361
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,490
the new computer and it doesn't sound as
good for some reason I'm guessing

362
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:23,500
good for some reason I'm guessing
 

363
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,840
good for some reason I'm guessing
because the sound card is different

364
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:25,850
because the sound card is different
 

365
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,780
because the sound card is different

might not like it just because it's a

412
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:36,260
might not like it just because it's a
 

413
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,520

it's different I guess

420
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:45,560
it's different I guess
 

421
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,890
it's different I guess
yeah I don't know anyways I'm gonna

422
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:47,900
yeah I don't know anyways I'm gonna
 

423
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,360
yeah I don't know anyways I'm gonna
hopefully keep using this microphone

424
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,370
hopefully keep using this microphone
 

425
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,050
hopefully keep using this microphone
from now on because those old g3 30s

426
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,060
from now on because those old g3 30s
 

427
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,250
from now on because those old g3 30s
they don't sound as good on this new

428
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:54,260
they don't sound as good on this new
 

429
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,020
they don't sound as good on this new
computer and also they're trashed like

430
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,030
computer and also they're trashed like
 

431
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,720
computer and also they're trashed like
they are gone I've talked about this

432
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:58,730
they are gone I've talked about this
 

433
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,390
they are gone I've talked about this
before like the frame broke on them a

434
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:01,400
before like the frame broke on them a
 

435
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,750
before like the frame broke on them a
long time ago the padding is all falling

436
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:04,760
long time ago the padding is all falling
 

437
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,760
long time ago the padding is all falling
off of the headset so I think we went

438
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:09,770
off of the headset so I think we went
 

439
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,730
off of the headset so I think we went
down there already so it's like super

440
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:12,740
down there already so it's like super
 

441
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,830
down there already so it's like super
uncomfortable to wear them the mute

442
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:14,840
uncomfortable to wear them the mute
 

443
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,890
uncomfortable to wear them the mute
button doesn't work and because the

444
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:17,900
button doesn't work and because the
 

445
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,630
button doesn't work and because the
frame has been broken for so long even

446
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:19,640
frame has been broken for so long even
 

447
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,519
frame has been broken for so long even
the wiring

448
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:21,529
the wiring
 

449
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:23,439
the wiring
is starting to fray like crazy like

450
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:23,449
is starting to fray like crazy like
 

451
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:25,239
is starting to fray like crazy like
they're gonna eventually totally snap in

452
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:25,249
they're gonna eventually totally snap in
 

453
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,519
they're gonna eventually totally snap in
half and the electronic part of its

454
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:27,529
half and the electronic part of its
 

455
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,949
half and the electronic part of its
gonna be broken so they're almost

456
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:29,959
gonna be broken so they're almost
 

457
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,869
gonna be broken so they're almost
reduced down to just being a microphone

458
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:31,879
reduced down to just being a microphone
 

459
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:34,720
reduced down to just being a microphone
at this point so I really need to change

460
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:34,730
at this point so I really need to change

693
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:39,660
like 20 blocks below this but again like
most of it's cleared out around just a

694
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:39,670
most of it's cleared out around just a
 

695
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,129
most of it's cleared out around just a
little bit of the mountain will have to

696
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:41,139
little bit of the mountain will have to
 

697
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:43,350
little bit of the mountain will have to
go away and we can we can have ourselves

698
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
go away and we can we can have ourselves
 

699
