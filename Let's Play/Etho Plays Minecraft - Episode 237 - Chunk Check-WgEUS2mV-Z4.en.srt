completions completing completionists

164
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,080
completions completing completionists
 

165
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,950
completions completing completionists
sake or whatever the word is there's

166
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:51,960
sake or whatever the word is there's
 

167
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,989
sake or whatever the word is there's
about nine nine farms nine times

168
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:53,999
about nine nine farms nine times
 

169
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:59,929
about nine nine farms nine times
twenty-eight is about 250 Pistons sticky

170
00:04:59,929 --> 00:04:59,939
twenty-eight is about 250 Pistons sticky
 

171
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:03,140
twenty-eight is about 250 Pistons sticky
pistons so yeah it took a little while

172
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,150
pistons so yeah it took a little while
 

173
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,249
pistons so yeah it took a little while
to do but I think it's a cool addition

174
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:07,259
to do but I think it's a cool addition
 

175
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,670
to do but I think it's a cool addition
to the village the way I wired these I

176
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:10,680
to the village the way I wired these I
 

177
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:18,709
to the village the way I wired these I
guess I'll show you fix it after for a

178
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:18,719
guess I'll show you fix it after for a
 

179
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,360
guess I'll show you fix it after for a
lot of the Pistons it's really easy you

180
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,370
lot of the Pistons it's really easy you
 

181
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,610
lot of the Pistons it's really easy you
can just run a line next to them but the

182
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:22,620
can just run a line next to them but the
 

183
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,029
can just run a line next to them but the
places where the water is it's a bit

184
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:26,039
places where the water is it's a bit
 

185
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,089
places where the water is it's a bit
it's a little bit more challenging

186
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:28,099
it's a little bit more challenging
 

187
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:32,869
it's a little bit more challenging
because the waters in the way so you

188
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:32,879
because the waters in the way so you
 

189
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,490
because the waters in the way so you
have to go waste or at least the way I

190
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:37,500
have to go waste or at least the way I
 

191
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,320
have to go waste or at least the way I
did it is that went along here and

192
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,330
did it is that went along here and
 

193
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,019
did it is that went along here and
actually I can't exactly show you but

194
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:47,029
actually I can't exactly show you but
 

195
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:50,510
actually I can't exactly show you but
where the water is it goes down here it

196
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:50,520
where the water is it goes down here it
 

197
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,159
where the water is it goes down here it
goes to a repeater then it goes to the

198
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:52,169
goes to a repeater then it goes to the
 

199
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,439
goes to a repeater then it goes to the
block there's a redstone dust above that

200
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:54,449
block there's a redstone dust above that
 

201
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:56,959
block there's a redstone dust above that
and that points to that block and that

202
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:56,969
and that points to that block and that
 

203
00:05:56,969 --> 00:05:59,719
and that points to that block and that
block so it powers the Pistons on the

204
00:05:59,719 --> 00:05:59,729
block so it powers the Pistons on the
 

205
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:03,800
block so it powers the Pistons on the
sides and it runs to the back so not too

206
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:03,810
sides and it runs to the back so not too
 

207
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,189
sides and it runs to the back so not too
not too difficult the main expense of

208
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
not too difficult the main expense of
 

209
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,010
not too difficult the main expense of
course is that all the Pistons just way

210
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,020
course is that all the Pistons just way
 

211
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,230
course is that all the Pistons just way
it's laid out it's not a very efficient

212
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
it's laid out it's not a very efficient
 

213
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,809
it's laid out it's not a very efficient
farm but it's for the cool factor all

214
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:17,819
farm but it's for the cool factor all
 

215
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,459
farm but it's for the cool factor all
right so I'm gonna fix this up we'll go

216
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:19,469
right so I'm gonna fix this up we'll go
 

217
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:25,730
right so I'm gonna fix this up we'll go
do something okay guys so there's

218
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:25,740
do something okay guys so there's
 

219
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,969
do something okay guys so there's
something I want to try out today or

220
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:27,979
something I want to try out today or
 

221
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:31,100
something I want to try out today or
figure out today I should say with this

222
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,110
figure out today I should say with this
 

223
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,909
figure out today I should say with this
mob trap it's been running a long time

224
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
mob trap it's been running a long time
 

225
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,219
mob trap it's been running a long time
so we should get a lot of items when we

226
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:37,229
so we should get a lot of items when we
 

227
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,010
so we should get a lot of items when we
go to the end here but then don't

228
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,020
go to the end here but then don't
 

229
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:46,360
go to the end here but then don't
we are going to what we get we did get a

230
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,370
we are going to what we get we did get a
 

231
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:56,070
we are going to what we get we did get a
fair bit okay maybe maybe it is okay

232
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080

 

233
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,780

let's see two stacks of gunpowder it

234
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:58,790
let's see two stacks of gunpowder it
 

235
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:11,100
let's see two stacks of gunpowder it
still seems like it should be more 30 mm

236
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,110
still seems like it should be more 30 mm
 

237
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,420
still seems like it should be more 30 mm
well regardless I want to setup

238
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,430
well regardless I want to setup
 

239
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:20,730
well regardless I want to setup
experiment here what I'm gonna do see

240
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:20,740
experiment here what I'm gonna do see
 

241
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,870
experiment here what I'm gonna do see
what do I toss I'm going to I want my

242
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:25,880
what do I toss I'm going to I want my
 

243
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,730
what do I toss I'm going to I want my
gun powder that's what I want

244
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:29,740

 

245
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,520

there it is okay so I kind of have this

246
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:33,530
there it is okay so I kind of have this
 

247
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,030
there it is okay so I kind of have this
idea that maybe like you know how you

248
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,040
idea that maybe like you know how you
 

249
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,130
idea that maybe like you know how you
can enter the end very quickly there

250
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:39,140
can enter the end very quickly there
 

251
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,890
can enter the end very quickly there
might be because some chunks are always

252
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:41,900
might be because some chunks are always
 

253
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,220
might be because some chunks are always
loaded in its rounds where you come in

254
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,230
loaded in its rounds where you come in
 

255
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,680
loaded in its rounds where you come in
here possibly that's one idea the other

256
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:47,690
here possibly that's one idea the other
 

257
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,620
here possibly that's one idea the other
idea is maybe every time an item enters

258
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:50,630
idea is maybe every time an item enters
 

259
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:56,080
idea is maybe every time an item enters
the end its it causes it to load for you

260
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,090
the end its it causes it to load for you
 

261
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,740
the end its it causes it to load for you
know a second or two and as that

262
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:58,750
know a second or two and as that
 

263
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,850
know a second or two and as that
accumulates eventually five minutes goes

264
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:00,860
accumulates eventually five minutes goes
 

265
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,820
accumulates eventually five minutes goes
by and items starting spawning so those

266
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:03,830
by and items starting spawning so those
 

267
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,700
by and items starting spawning so those
are the two two main ideas I have why I

268
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:06,710
are the two two main ideas I have why I
 

269
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,500
are the two two main ideas I have why I
don't seem to be getting as many items

270
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:08,510
don't seem to be getting as many items
 

271
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,080
don't seem to be getting as many items
as they expect because even though I got

272
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,090
as they expect because even though I got
 

273
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,500
as they expect because even though I got
two and a half stacks it has been

274
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:13,510
two and a half stacks it has been
 

275
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,650
two and a half stacks it has been
running for a very long time so what I'm

276
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:17,660
running for a very long time so what I'm
 

277
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,540
running for a very long time so what I'm
going to do is set up this line of dirts

278
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:22,550
going to do is set up this line of dirts
 

279
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,030
going to do is set up this line of dirts
and plant wheat on it and see if there

280
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,040
and plant wheat on it and see if there
 

281
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,620
and plant wheat on it and see if there
there's a line somewhere where it stops

282
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:29,630
there's a line somewhere where it stops
 

283
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:35,710
there's a line somewhere where it stops
growing when I'm not in the end or or

284
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:35,720
growing when I'm not in the end or or
 

285
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,690
growing when I'm not in the end or or
check if it even grows at all if it

286
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:37,700
check if it even grows at all if it
 

287
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,150
check if it even grows at all if it
doesn't grow at all it's that means the

288
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:40,160
doesn't grow at all it's that means the
 

289
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:52,499
doesn't grow at all it's that means the
area is not loaded

290
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:52,509

 

291
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:56,439

my theme sounds I know how loud that was

292
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:56,449
my theme sounds I know how loud that was
 

293
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:58,509
my theme sounds I know how loud that was
for you guys my finger sounds like Frank

294
00:08:58,509 --> 00:08:58,519
for you guys my finger sounds like Frank
 

295
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,309
for you guys my finger sounds like Frank
great now that almost busted my eardrums

296
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:02,319
great now that almost busted my eardrums
 

297
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:05,259
great now that almost busted my eardrums
okay so yeah I'm gonna plant two lines

298
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:05,269
okay so yeah I'm gonna plant two lines
 

299
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:07,059
okay so yeah I'm gonna plant two lines
of wheats and we'll see if we can notice

300
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:07,069
of wheats and we'll see if we can notice
 

301
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:10,870
of wheats and we'll see if we can notice
any lines forming in its growth pattern

302
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
any lines forming in its growth pattern
 

303
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,850
any lines forming in its growth pattern
or anything like that and from that we

304
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:12,860
or anything like that and from that we
 

305
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,290
or anything like that and from that we
should be able to figure out exactly

306
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:14,300
should be able to figure out exactly
 

307
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,650
should be able to figure out exactly
what's going on

308
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:18,660

 

309
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,190

okay there we go guys we have our wheat

310
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,200
okay there we go guys we have our wheat
 

311
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,270
okay there we go guys we have our wheat
all planted

312
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:23,280
all planted
 

313
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,330
all planted
I accidentally updated the elevator dang

314
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:26,340
I accidentally updated the elevator dang
 

315
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,020
I accidentally updated the elevator dang
it

316
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,030
it
 

317
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,290
it
when I put the seeds next to it it's not

318
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:30,300
when I put the seeds next to it it's not
 

319
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,550
when I put the seeds next to it it's not
a super perfect test like it's not

320
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:33,560
a super perfect test like it's not
 

321
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,020
a super perfect test like it's not
exactly evenly lit or anything like that

322
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,030
exactly evenly lit or anything like that
 

323
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,150
exactly evenly lit or anything like that
but it's it'll do the trick for what I

324
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
but it's it'll do the trick for what I
 

325
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,650
but it's it'll do the trick for what I
wanted to do so we're gonna leave now

326
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:39,660
wanted to do so we're gonna leave now
 

327
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,970
wanted to do so we're gonna leave now
all the land is hydrated I think and lit

328
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:43,980
all the land is hydrated I think and lit
 

329
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,740
all the land is hydrated I think and lit
swell enough for it to grow so either

330
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:47,750
swell enough for it to grow so either
 

331
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,030
swell enough for it to grow so either
either it's not gonna grow or it's gonna

332
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,040
either it's not gonna grow or it's gonna
 

333
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,620
either it's not gonna grow or it's gonna
grow with a line in it somewhere

334
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:51,630
grow with a line in it somewhere
 

335
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,880
grow with a line in it somewhere
or who knows maybe it'll all grow we'll

336
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:55,890
or who knows maybe it'll all grow we'll
 

337
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,440
or who knows maybe it'll all grow we'll
find out we'll check that later in the

338
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,450
find out we'll check that later in the
 

339
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:04,460
find out we'll check that later in the
episode don't ask so yeah I think we're

340
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:04,470
episode don't ask so yeah I think we're
 

341
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,290
episode don't ask so yeah I think we're
gonna hang out around this part of my

342
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:06,300
gonna hang out around this part of my
 

343
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,570
gonna hang out around this part of my
world for like 30 minutes or so because

344
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:11,580
world for like 30 minutes or so because
 

345
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,270
world for like 30 minutes or so because
the idea is there's a creeper by the way

346
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:14,280
the idea is there's a creeper by the way
 

347
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,400
the idea is there's a creeper by the way
the idea is with the the wheat there in

348
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:19,410
the idea is with the the wheat there in
 

349
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,110
the idea is with the the wheat there in
the end it should be growing right now

350
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
the end it should be growing right now
 

351
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,720
the end it should be growing right now
if those chunks are loaded so we'll be

352
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:23,730
if those chunks are loaded so we'll be
 

353
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,510
if those chunks are loaded so we'll be
able to see definitely if we stay here

354
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:26,520
able to see definitely if we stay here
 

355
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,660
able to see definitely if we stay here
for about 30 minutes or so my time not

356
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:29,670
for about 30 minutes or so my time not
 

357
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,640
for about 30 minutes or so my time not
your time don't worry it's gonna be much

358
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:31,650
your time don't worry it's gonna be much
 

359
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:39,790
your time don't worry it's gonna be much
faster for you yeah what was I gonna say

360
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:39,800
faster for you yeah what was I gonna say
 

361
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,100
faster for you yeah what was I gonna say
because yeah the idea is in this light

362
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,110
because yeah the idea is in this light
 

363
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,590
because yeah the idea is in this light
even in this part of the world there's a

364
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
even in this part of the world there's a
 

365
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,780
even in this part of the world there's a
few chunks my spawn in this world's

366
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:47,790
few chunks my spawn in this world's
 

367
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,630
few chunks my spawn in this world's
around there and there's a few chunks

368
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
around there and there's a few chunks
 

369
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,460
around there and there's a few chunks
around that area that are always loaded

370
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:52,470
around that area that are always loaded
 

371
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,890
around that area that are always loaded
no matter where I am in the world so I

372
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:54,900
no matter where I am in the world so I
 

373
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,230
no matter where I am in the world so I
think possibly that might be happening

374
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,240
think possibly that might be happening
 

375
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,330
think possibly that might be happening
in the end as well because when you go

376
00:10:59,330 --> 00:10:59,340
in the end as well because when you go
 

377
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,760
in the end as well because when you go
through the portal it's very quick and I

378
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:01,770
through the portal it's very quick and I
 

379
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,520
through the portal it's very quick and I
think those chunks were already loaded

380
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:04,530
think those chunks were already loaded
 

381
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,350
think those chunks were already loaded
but we'll find out we'll find out and

382
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
but we'll find out we'll find out and
 

383
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,490
but we'll find out we'll find out and
that sucks I'd died maybe while we're

384
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:13,500
that sucks I'd died maybe while we're
 

385
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,870
that sucks I'd died maybe while we're
here I'll show you the waterfall because

386
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
here I'll show you the waterfall because
 

387
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,490
here I'll show you the waterfall because
I did do that took care of that there it

388
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:19,500
I did do that took care of that there it
 

389
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,850
I did do that took care of that there it
is I still want to modify it a little

390
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:22,860
is I still want to modify it a little
 

391
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,079
is I still want to modify it a little
bit but I think that's pretty cool

392
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,089
bit but I think that's pretty cool
 

393
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:29,090
bit but I think that's pretty cool
nice waterfalls some people were worried

394
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,100
nice waterfalls some people were worried
 

395
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,710
nice waterfalls some people were worried
I was just gonna have like a water

stream up at the top but no I
 

399
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,850
stream up at the top but no I
I made an artificial lake here that's

400
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:37,860
I made an artificial lake here that's
 

401
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,610
I made an artificial lake here that's
actually ice down there if you're

402
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:40,620
actually ice down there if you're
 

403
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,350
actually ice down there if you're
wondering why there's why I'm not

404
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:42,360
wondering why there's why I'm not
 

405
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,960
wondering why there's why I'm not
sinking because I'm on I'm on ice right

406
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:44,970
sinking because I'm on I'm on ice right
 

407
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,100
sinking because I'm on I'm on ice right
now so yeah I got a I made a fake fake

408
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,110
now so yeah I got a I made a fake fake
 

409
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,740
now so yeah I got a I made a fake fake
Lake here with flowers around then a

410

Lake here with flowers around then a
 

411
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,269
Lake here with flowers around then a
stream that comes from the top of the

412
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
stream that comes from the top of the
 

413
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,000
stream that comes from the top of the
mountain flows into that this I haven't

414
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,010
mountain flows into that this I haven't
 

415
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,000
mountain flows into that this I haven't
connected to anything it's just a stupid

water bucket stream and it looks like I

418
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:02,850
water bucket stream and it looks like I
 

419
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,389
water bucket stream and it looks like I
got a spill here which I don't want I

420

522
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:29,100
redstone update then it sounds like they
 

523
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,160
redstone update then it sounds like they
might do a biome update which would be

524
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,170
might do a biome update which would be
 

525
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,870
might do a biome update which would be
awesome but I don't think mods really

526
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:35,880
awesome but I don't think mods really

00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,250
this is the I don't know if I ever
showed this this is a setup for the

636
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:24,260
showed this this is a setup for the
 

637
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,039
showed this this is a setup for the
crafting table the block switcher blocks

638
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,049
crafting table the block switcher blocks
 

639
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:31,330

better doesn't make much sense but I

766
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:05,260
better doesn't make much sense but I
 

767
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,310
better doesn't make much sense but I
think it looks better

768
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:07,320
think it looks better
 

769
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,340
think it looks better
all right cool I think 30 minutes may be

770
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:11,350
all right cool I think 30 minutes may be
 

771
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,520
all right cool I think 30 minutes may be
up by now so let's go check out the end

772
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:14,530
up by now so let's go check out the end
 

773
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,920
up by now so let's go check out the end
again depending on the results we might

774
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:16,930
again depending on the results we might
 

775
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,390
again depending on the results we might
have to do one more test

776
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,400
have to do one more test
 

777
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,180
have to do one more test
I realize this is what we've been

778
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,190
I realize this is what we've been
 

779
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,440
I realize this is what we've been
looking for

780
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:26,450

 

781
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:34,509

i I don't know what to expect so it

782
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:34,519
i I don't know what to expect so it
 

783
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,509
i I don't know what to expect so it
didn't grow okay so these chunks are not

784
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:37,519
didn't grow okay so these chunks are not
 

785
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,729
didn't grow okay so these chunks are not
loaded so what I'm guessing it is then

786
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:39,739
loaded so what I'm guessing it is then
 

787
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:42,279
loaded so what I'm guessing it is then
when an item goes through maybe the

788
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:42,289
when an item goes through maybe the
 

789
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:47,859
when an item goes through maybe the
wheat is or maybe chunks load a little

790
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:47,869
wheat is or maybe chunks load a little
 

791
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:50,499
wheat is or maybe chunks load a little
bits every time and the items might be

792
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:50,509
bits every time and the items might be
 

793
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:54,609
bits every time and the items might be
the spotting from that over time so what

794
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:54,619
the spotting from that over time so what
 

795
00:22:54,619 --> 00:23:00,039
the spotting from that over time so what
I'm gonna do now is afk around my
