supposed to be a mushroom farm it's not
 

321
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,140
supposed to be a mushroom farm it's not
really set up the main thing it's

322
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,150
really set up the main thing it's
 

323
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,029
really set up the main thing it's
lacking right now it needs to be made

324
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
lacking right now it needs to be made
 

325
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,939
lacking right now it needs to be made
more streamlined because I've I wanted

326
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:55,949
more streamlined because I've I wanted
 

327
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:58,010
more streamlined because I've I wanted
to use this a few times and when I go to

328
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,020
to use this a few times and when I go to
 

329
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,110
to use this a few times and when I go to
use it it's like well I don't have

330
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,120
use it it's like well I don't have
 

331
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,990
use it it's like well I don't have
anything here there's no bone meal

332
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,000
anything here there's no bone meal
 

333
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,920
anything here there's no bone meal
dispensers or there tools or mushrooms

334
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:06,930
dispensers or there tools or mushrooms
 

335
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,330
dispensers or there tools or mushrooms
to sling around so I think what we'll do

336
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:11,340
to sling around so I think what we'll do
 

337
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,540
to sling around so I think what we'll do
we're gonna take out this wall and we're

338
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:14,550
we're gonna take out this wall and we're
 

339
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,839
we're gonna take out this wall and we're
gonna just set up like chests and some

340
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:16,849
gonna just set up like chests and some
 

341
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:19,189
gonna just set up like chests and some
bonemeal dispensers that kind of stuff

342
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
bonemeal dispensers that kind of stuff
 

343
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,749
bonemeal dispensers that kind of stuff
just so that we can actually use this

344
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:20,759
just so that we can actually use this
 

345
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,790
just so that we can actually use this
and have everything here that we need to

346
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
and have everything here that we need to
 

347
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,869
and have everything here that we need to
operate it okay

348
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
operate it okay
 

349
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,119
operate it okay
so I've just been staring at it here for

350
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:29,129
so I've just been staring at it here for
 

351
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:30,320
so I've just been staring at it here for
a little while trying to figure out what

352
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,330
a little while trying to figure out what
 

353
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,120
a little while trying to figure out what
what we're actually doing with it I

354
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,130
what we're actually doing with it I
 

355
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,100
what we're actually doing with it I
guess I'm a break first ask questions

356
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,110
guess I'm a break first ask questions
 

357
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,860
guess I'm a break first ask questions
later type of guy should have planned it

358
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:36,870
later type of guy should have planned it
 

359
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,290
later type of guy should have planned it
first maybe I never liked how narrow

360
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:39,300
first maybe I never liked how narrow
 

361
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,319
first maybe I never liked how narrow
this door is even over there it feels a

362
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:42,329
this door is even over there it feels a
 

363
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:45,710
this door is even over there it feels a
little strange but it's it's acceptable

364
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:45,720
little strange but it's it's acceptable
 

365
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,329
little strange but it's it's acceptable
here I think cuz this path is too wide

366
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:47,339
here I think cuz this path is too wide
 

367
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,639
here I think cuz this path is too wide
but if we're gonna continue this like

368
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:49,649
but if we're gonna continue this like
 

369
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:51,260
but if we're gonna continue this like
this is not supposed to be the end of

370
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,270
this is not supposed to be the end of
 

371
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,420
this is not supposed to be the end of
the building there's a lot of free space

372
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:53,430
the building there's a lot of free space
 

373
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,500
the building there's a lot of free space
here I believe

374
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:54,510
here I believe
 

375
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,420
here I believe
the wall that if we want to build

376
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:56,430
the wall that if we want to build
 

377
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,210
the wall that if we want to build
something further on here we can so if

378
00:08:59,210 --> 00:08:59,220
something further on here we can so if
 

379
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,160
something further on here we can so if
there's gonna be a door here I think I

380
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,170
there's gonna be a door here I think I
 

381
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,550
there's gonna be a door here I think I
want to make this wider just so it

382
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
want to make this wider just so it
 

383
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,010
want to make this wider just so it
doesn't feel quite so claustrophobic I

384
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,020
doesn't feel quite so claustrophobic I
 

385
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,980
doesn't feel quite so claustrophobic I
guess so we'll make this go up to the

386
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:12,990
guess so we'll make this go up to the
 

387
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,840
guess so we'll make this go up to the
top there yeah like that's okay move

388
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:17,850
top there yeah like that's okay move
 

389
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,910
top there yeah like that's okay move
this over a little bit I think we will

390
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
this over a little bit I think we will
 

391
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,350
this over a little bit I think we will
keep the yellow walls I do like the

392
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
keep the yellow walls I do like the
 

393
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,460
keep the yellow walls I do like the
yellow walls in here and we'll just set

394
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:25,470
yellow walls in here and we'll just set
 

395
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,890
yellow walls in here and we'll just set
up a few chests no dispensers not this

396
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:27,900
up a few chests no dispensers not this
 

397
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:33,950
up a few chests no dispensers not this
time okay so let's just lay out the wall

398
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:33,960
time okay so let's just lay out the wall
 

399
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,870
time okay so let's just lay out the wall
again why did I rip it down if I'm

400
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:35,880
again why did I rip it down if I'm
 

401
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,760
again why did I rip it down if I'm
putting it back we will do it

402
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:39,770
putting it back we will do it
 

403
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:47,710
putting it back we will do it
like Oh actually that might be okay to

404
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:47,720
like Oh actually that might be okay to
 

405
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,870
like Oh actually that might be okay to
bring it forward maybe like that and

406
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
bring it forward maybe like that and
 

407
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,860
bring it forward maybe like that and
then let's move this in one I probably

408
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:54,870
then let's move this in one I probably
 

409
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,970
then let's move this in one I probably
actually didn't need to tear it down

410
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:55,980
actually didn't need to tear it down
 

411
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,550
actually didn't need to tear it down
because I just rebuilt it all right and

412
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
because I just rebuilt it all right and
 

413
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,960
because I just rebuilt it all right and
then we'll just put a bunch of chests

414
00:09:59,960 --> 00:09:59,970
then we'll just put a bunch of chests
 

415
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,740
then we'll just put a bunch of chests
here oops

416
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:02,750
here oops
 

417
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,590
here oops
like so and maybe yellow glass up here

418
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:06,600
like so and maybe yellow glass up here
 

419
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,240
like so and maybe yellow glass up here
so we can open our chests and it'll

420
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,250
so we can open our chests and it'll
 

421
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,360
so we can open our chests and it'll
still look pretty good against the clay

422
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,370
still look pretty good against the clay
 

423
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:19,070
still look pretty good against the clay
and then something like this whoa how's

424
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,080
and then something like this whoa how's
 

425
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:25,150
and then something like this whoa how's
that look okay I think it'll be fine and

426
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,160
that look okay I think it'll be fine and
 

427
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,500
that look okay I think it'll be fine and
there we go so I just set up on both

428
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:27,510
there we go so I just set up on both
 

429
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,470
there we go so I just set up on both
sides here it's very similar to what we

430
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
sides here it's very similar to what we
 

431
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,510
sides here it's very similar to what we
had but just a simple change now it's

432
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:32,520
had but just a simple change now it's
 

433
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,280
had but just a simple change now it's
actually functional we have stuff here

434
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,290
actually functional we have stuff here
 

435
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,370
actually functional we have stuff here
so for double chests in total this one's

436
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:37,380
so for double chests in total this one's
 

437
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,020
so for double chests in total this one's
gonna be for the red mushroom blocks

438
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,030
gonna be for the red mushroom blocks
 

439
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,690
gonna be for the red mushroom blocks
this one over the brown ones then we

440
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:41,700
this one over the brown ones then we
 

441
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,930
this one over the brown ones then we
have bonemeal down here so when I come

442
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:44,940
have bonemeal down here so when I come
 

443
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,870
have bonemeal down here so when I come
to the farm I can actually grow stuff

444
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
to the farm I can actually grow stuff
 

445
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,820
to the farm I can actually grow stuff
kind of important and then this final

446
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:49,830
kind of important and then this final
 

447
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,660
kind of important and then this final
chest is for the raw mushrooms and maybe

448
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:53,670
chest is for the raw mushrooms and maybe
 

449
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,450
chest is for the raw mushrooms and maybe
some axes we really need to get a silk

450
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:56,460
some axes we really need to get a silk
 

451
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,610
some axes we really need to get a silk
touch axe in here but I have one on me

452
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:58,620
touch axe in here but I have one on me
 

453
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,120
touch axe in here but I have one on me
right now

454
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,130
right now
 

455
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,660
right now
so it's fine so we basically come here

456
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:02,670
so it's fine so we basically come here
 

457
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,300
so it's fine so we basically come here
grab some bonemeal and whatever mushroom

458
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:05,310
grab some bonemeal and whatever mushroom
 

459
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,090
grab some bonemeal and whatever mushroom
you want to grow oh and I hit a and

460
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,100
you want to grow oh and I hit a and
 

461
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,540
you want to grow oh and I hit a and
just down here and some crafting tables

462
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:11,550
just down here and some crafting tables
 

463
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:16,040
just down here and some crafting tables
as well down here as well got the yellow

464
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,050
as well down here as well got the yellow
 

465
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,720
as well down here as well got the yellow
glass up there I think it's a nice

466
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:17,730
glass up there I think it's a nice
 

467
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,780
glass up there I think it's a nice
subtle thing now I never actually did

468
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:20,790
subtle thing now I never actually did
 

469
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,550
subtle thing now I never actually did
try growing red mushrooms here that's

470
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
try growing red mushrooms here that's
 

471
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,030
try growing red mushrooms here that's
not really what the farm was for for

472
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,040
not really what the farm was for for
 

473
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,860
not really what the farm was for for
some reason that they grow good but they

474
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:30,870
some reason that they grow good but they
 

475
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,600
some reason that they grow good but they
don't actually activate these detectors

476
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:34,610
don't actually activate these detectors
 

477
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,730
don't actually activate these detectors
but it's fine

478
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:37,740
but it's fine
 

479
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,430
but it's fine
yeah when I made this you couldn't get

480
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:40,440
yeah when I made this you couldn't get
 

481
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,009
yeah when I made this you couldn't get
these blocks before but I find they look

482
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:43,019
these blocks before but I find they look
 

483
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,749
these blocks before but I find they look
really good these blocks so I'm glad I

484
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:44,759
really good these blocks so I'm glad I
 

485
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,470
really good these blocks so I'm glad I
have a farm for them but I think the

486
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
have a farm for them but I think the
 

487
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,210
have a farm for them but I think the
main idea was just to get brown

488
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,220
main idea was just to get brown
 

489
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,550
main idea was just to get brown
mushrooms for fermented spider eyes when

490
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
mushrooms for fermented spider eyes when
 

491
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,040
mushrooms for fermented spider eyes when
I first made this so that's why it's

492
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,050
I first made this so that's why it's
 

493
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:02,660
I first made this so that's why it's
brown mushroom specific I forgot about

494
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:02,670
brown mushroom specific I forgot about
 

495
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,999
brown mushroom specific I forgot about
that I don't think I actually hooked up

496
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:05,009
that I don't think I actually hooked up
 

497
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:06,769
that I don't think I actually hooked up
the rest of the no blocks now that I

498
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:06,779
the rest of the no blocks now that I
 

499
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:12,590
the rest of the no blocks now that I
think of it do the lights change I can't

500
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:12,600
think of it do the lights change I can't
 

501
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,389
think of it do the lights change I can't
remember if I did that oh this this

502
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
remember if I did that oh this this
 

503
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,800
remember if I did that oh this this
light turns on that's right let's maybe

504
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:18,810
light turns on that's right let's maybe
 

505
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,990
light turns on that's right let's maybe
just take a look down below here I think

506
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,000
just take a look down below here I think
 

507
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,780
just take a look down below here I think
I have some stuff to do with the music

508
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:23,790
I have some stuff to do with the music
 

509
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:28,809
I have some stuff to do with the music
blocks oh snap not a good place to be

510
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:28,819
blocks oh snap not a good place to be
 

511
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:32,990
blocks oh snap not a good place to be
I've got some note blocks and it's

512
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,000
I've got some note blocks and it's
 

513
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,480
I've got some note blocks and it's
pretty much empty under all these so I

514
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:35,490
pretty much empty under all these so I
 

515
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,069
pretty much empty under all these so I
might want to add those in as well for

516
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:37,079
might want to add those in as well for
 

517
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:41,389
might want to add those in as well for
for the rest of them okay anyway just a

518
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:41,399
for the rest of them okay anyway just a
 

519
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,379
for the rest of them okay anyway just a
small little fix on this farm should be

520
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:44,389
small little fix on this farm should be
 

521
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:49,040
small little fix on this farm should be
operational now all right guys so next

522
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,050
operational now all right guys so next
 

523
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,780
operational now all right guys so next
up we're gonna head over to another part

524
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:50,790
up we're gonna head over to another part
 

525
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,170
up we're gonna head over to another part
of the man cave up at the mob farm here

526
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:53,180
of the man cave up at the mob farm here
 

527
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,629
of the man cave up at the mob farm here
I've been debating building arena for a

528
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
I've been debating building arena for a
 

529
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,730
I've been debating building arena for a
while here somewheres some where you

530
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:58,740
while here somewheres some where you
 

531
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,699
while here somewheres some where you
fight mobs you know it would be fairly

532
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:01,709
fight mobs you know it would be fairly
 

533
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,360
fight mobs you know it would be fairly
easy to set up because the number of

534
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,370
easy to set up because the number of
 

535
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,650
easy to set up because the number of
mobs we get from this thing is actually

536
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:06,660
mobs we get from this thing is actually
 

537
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,949
mobs we get from this thing is actually
pretty crazy I've made very little

538
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:09,959
pretty crazy I've made very little
 

539
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,769
pretty crazy I've made very little
effort to try to improve the efficiency

540
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:12,779
effort to try to improve the efficiency
 

541
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,439
effort to try to improve the efficiency
on it of course I say that in and under

542
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:15,449
on it of course I say that in and under
 

543
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:16,210
on it of course I say that in and under
falling right now

544
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:16,220
falling right now
 

545
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,049
falling right now
it was just nighttime I think ya might

546
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:20,059
it was just nighttime I think ya might
 

547
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:21,980
it was just nighttime I think ya might
take a little while to get going

548
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:21,990
take a little while to get going
 

549
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,250
take a little while to get going
here but we could for example just have

550
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:25,260
here but we could for example just have
 

551
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,320
here but we could for example just have
dispensers with water buckets in and a

552
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,330
dispensers with water buckets in and a
 

553
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,570
dispensers with water buckets in and a
bunch of signs running along here you

554
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:29,580
bunch of signs running along here you
 

555
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,490
bunch of signs running along here you
press a button the water will get

556
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:31,500
press a button the water will get
 

557
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,940
press a button the water will get
released and then we have a way of

558
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:34,950
released and then we have a way of
 

559
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,889
released and then we have a way of
preventing them from dying when they

560
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:36,899
preventing them from dying when they
 

561
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,990
preventing them from dying when they
fall here I also was curious about

562
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,000
fall here I also was curious about
 

563
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,199
fall here I also was curious about
something that I wanted to try you can

564
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:42,209
something that I wanted to try you can
 

565
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:45,769
something that I wanted to try you can
like jump off a building and right-click

566
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:45,779
like jump off a building and right-click
 

567
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,480
like jump off a building and right-click
on a horse and you won't take fall

568
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:47,490
on a horse and you won't take fall
 

569
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,030
on a horse and you won't take fall
damage I'm wondering if the same thing

570
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,040
damage I'm wondering if the same thing
 

571
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,170
damage I'm wondering if the same thing
applies to mobs like if they enter a

572
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,180
applies to mobs like if they enter a
 

573
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,490
applies to mobs like if they enter a
minecarts if the fall damage gets

574
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:58,500
minecarts if the fall damage gets
 

575
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,710
minecarts if the fall damage gets
ignored like if this catches and as

576
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
ignored like if this catches and as
 

577
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,000
ignored like if this catches and as
they're falling off that's possible

578
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,010
they're falling off that's possible
 

579
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,079
they're falling off that's possible
it might Oh drop them when he was dead I

580
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:08,089
it might Oh drop them when he was dead I
 

581
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:10,760
it might Oh drop them when he was dead I
didn't know it would do that that's

582
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:10,770
didn't know it would do that that's
 

583
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,210
didn't know it would do that that's
interesting might take a little while to

584
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,220
interesting might take a little while to
 

585
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,820
interesting might take a little while to
see it happen if it does happen and even

586
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:19,830
see it happen if it does happen and even
 

587
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,310
see it happen if it does happen and even
I'm not sure I'm trying to catch one and

588
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
I'm not sure I'm trying to catch one and
 

589
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,639
I'm not sure I'm trying to catch one and
have it not die basically oh I got it

590
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:28,649
have it not die basically oh I got it
 

591
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:33,139
have it not die basically oh I got it
nice very nice so it is possible I was

592
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:33,149
nice very nice so it is possible I was
 

593
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:34,790
nice very nice so it is possible I was
considering using this as a way of

594
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:34,800
considering using this as a way of
 

595
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,889
considering using this as a way of
catching them and like moving them off

596
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:36,899
catching them and like moving them off
 

597
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,449
catching them and like moving them off
somewhere but it doesn't seem like it

598
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:38,459
somewhere but it doesn't seem like it
 

599
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,000
somewhere but it doesn't seem like it
happens too often it's pretty rare that

600
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,010
happens too often it's pretty rare that
 

601
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,150
happens too often it's pretty rare that
actually catches them that's cool I was

602
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
actually catches them that's cool I was
 

603
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,800
actually catches them that's cool I was
curious about that okay so if we were to

604
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:48,810
curious about that okay so if we were to
 

605
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,079
curious about that okay so if we were to
build an arena we would collect the mobs

606
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:51,089
build an arena we would collect the mobs
 

607
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:52,990
build an arena we would collect the mobs
here you can see we get quite a few

608
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,000
here you can see we get quite a few
 

609
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,740
here you can see we get quite a few
probably wouldn't take too long to

610
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:54,750
probably wouldn't take too long to
 

611
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,980
probably wouldn't take too long to
collect a bunch of them and we would

612
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:57,990
collect a bunch of them and we would
 

613
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,949
collect a bunch of them and we would
have to build the arena nearby

614
00:14:59,949 --> 00:14:59,959
have to build the arena nearby
 

615
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:02,540
have to build the arena nearby
accessorize they would be spawn so

616
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:02,550
accessorize they would be spawn so
 

617
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,620
accessorize they would be spawn so
probably behind this wall which has two

618
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:06,630
probably behind this wall which has two
 

619
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,810
probably behind this wall which has two
concerns for me basically this project

620
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:08,820
concerns for me basically this project
 

621
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,819
concerns for me basically this project
if we were to go ahead with it first one

622
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:10,829
if we were to go ahead with it first one
 

623
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:13,610
if we were to go ahead with it first one
is is there anything actually back here

624
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:13,620
is is there anything actually back here
 

625
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,980
is is there anything actually back here
that would get in the way of our

626
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:15,990
that would get in the way of our
 

627
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,889
that would get in the way of our
building so let's just check that out

628
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:17,899
building so let's just check that out
 

629
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:22,460
building so let's just check that out
the other thing though I'm worried if I

630
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:22,470
the other thing though I'm worried if I
 

631
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,639
the other thing though I'm worried if I
build an arena and spend all this time

632
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:24,649
build an arena and spend all this time
 

633
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:26,810
build an arena and spend all this time
trying to make a game out of it it's

634
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:26,820
trying to make a game out of it it's
 

635
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,319
trying to make a game out of it it's
gonna be boring

636
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:28,329
gonna be boring
 

637
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:30,600
gonna be boring
how can we make it interesting guys I

638
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:30,610
how can we make it interesting guys I
 

639
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,569
how can we make it interesting guys I
want to bring that to you how can we

640
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:33,579
want to bring that to you how can we
 

641
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:36,900
want to bring that to you how can we
make it fun to play how can we make it

642
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:36,910
make it fun to play how can we make it
 

643
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,579
make it fun to play how can we make it
difficult so that's it's actually

644
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:38,589
difficult so that's it's actually
 

645
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,329
difficult so that's it's actually
challenging what are your ideas I want I

646
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:42,339
challenging what are your ideas I want I
 

647
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:44,160
challenging what are your ideas I want I
want to know what you have to say it

648
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,170
want to know what you have to say it
 

649
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,960
want to know what you have to say it
looks like we have a lot of clear space

650
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:45,970
looks like we have a lot of clear space
 

651
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,429
looks like we have a lot of clear space
here for building not running into

652
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:50,439
here for building not running into
 

653
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:54,749
here for building not running into
anything so that's a good sign so you

654
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:54,759
anything so that's a good sign so you
 

655
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,400
anything so that's a good sign so you
could potentially build something fairly

656
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,410
could potentially build something fairly
 

657
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:02,009
could potentially build something fairly
large here it looks like so again if you

658
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:02,019
large here it looks like so again if you
 

659
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:03,989
large here it looks like so again if you
have ideas on how to make it cool arena

660
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:03,999
have ideas on how to make it cool arena
 

661
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:06,139
have ideas on how to make it cool arena
I want to hear it okay

662
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:06,149
I want to hear it okay
 

663
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:09,269
I want to hear it okay
all right everybody so next up we're

664
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
all right everybody so next up we're
 

665
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,340
all right everybody so next up we're
gonna do another quick experiment here

666
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:11,350
gonna do another quick experiment here
 

667
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,009
gonna do another quick experiment here
I've been considering ideas for that

668
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:14,019
I've been considering ideas for that
 

669
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:16,769
I've been considering ideas for that
rude goldberg machine that we might

670
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:16,779
rude goldberg machine that we might
 

671
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:19,769
rude goldberg machine that we might
build for episode number 400 we would

672
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:19,779
build for episode number 400 we would
 

673
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,389
build for episode number 400 we would
probably want to start it before episode

674
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:21,399
probably want to start it before episode
 

675
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,280
probably want to start it before episode
400 uh because it might take a little

676
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,290
400 uh because it might take a little
 

677
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,799
400 uh because it might take a little
while to build so probably right away

678
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:25,809
while to build so probably right away
 

679
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:30,509
while to build so probably right away
actually we need a good trigger block

680
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:30,519
actually we need a good trigger block
 

681
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,799
actually we need a good trigger block
though something that's visually

682
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:31,809
though something that's visually
 

683
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:35,549
though something that's visually
appealing and I think falling sand is

684
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:35,559
appealing and I think falling sand is
 

685
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,919
appealing and I think falling sand is
the winner for that everybody loves

686
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:37,929
the winner for that everybody loves
 

687
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:41,009
the winner for that everybody loves
falling sand right and I believe this

688
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:41,019
falling sand right and I believe this
 

689
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,840
falling sand right and I believe this
trick still works actually tell you what

690
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:42,850
trick still works actually tell you what
 

691
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,869
trick still works actually tell you what
let's do it like this I think this still

692
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:45,879
let's do it like this I think this still
 

693
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,659
let's do it like this I think this still
works but I just want to make sure this

694
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:48,669
works but I just want to make sure this
 

695
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:50,909
works but I just want to make sure this
is not a very well-known trick I don't

696
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:50,919
is not a very well-known trick I don't
 

697
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:55,009
is not a very well-known trick I don't
think but you can have two tall flowers

698
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:55,019
think but you can have two tall flowers
 

699
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,720
think but you can have two tall flowers
like so and then I think you can put

700
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:57,730
like so and then I think you can put
 

701
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,989
like so and then I think you can put
sand on top I haven't tried this in a

702
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:00,999
sand on top I haven't tried this in a
 

703
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:04,559
sand on top I haven't tried this in a
while so I'm very much hoping it still

704
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:04,569
while so I'm very much hoping it still
 

705
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:10,110
while so I'm very much hoping it still
works like so all right and now we're

706
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,120
works like so all right and now we're
 

707
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,149
works like so all right and now we're
gonna line a sand and I think you can

708
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:12,159
gonna line a sand and I think you can
 

709
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:15,289
gonna line a sand and I think you can
break the dirts

710
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:15,299
break the dirts
 

711
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:22,529
break the dirts
no no they fixed it just terrible

712
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:22,539
no no they fixed it just terrible
 

713
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:26,309
no no they fixed it just terrible
oh why why did you fix it Mojang it was

714
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
oh why why did you fix it Mojang it was
 

715
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,899
oh why why did you fix it Mojang it was
such a good trick you used to be able to

716
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:27,909
such a good trick you used to be able to
 

717
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:31,759
such a good trick you used to be able to
make sand floats not too long ago ah

718
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:31,769
make sand floats not too long ago ah
 

719
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:36,960
make sand floats not too long ago ah
maybe I'm doing it wrong I thought

720
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:36,970
maybe I'm doing it wrong I thought
 

721
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,490
maybe I'm doing it wrong I thought
that's how you did it though maybe just

722
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:38,500
that's how you did it though maybe just
 

723
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
that's how you did it though maybe just
let me try something here

724
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:40,510
let me try something here
 

725
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,080
let me try something here
can we update it with water I think any

726
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,090
can we update it with water I think any
 

727
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,150
can we update it with water I think any
updates gonna do that does the problem

728
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:45,160
updates gonna do that does the problem
 

729
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,630
updates gonna do that does the problem
oh that would have been so perfect if we

730
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
oh that would have been so perfect if we
 

731
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,580
oh that would have been so perfect if we
could make falling sand oh wait a second

732
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:55,590
could make falling sand oh wait a second
 

733
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:02,780
could make falling sand oh wait a second
okay if we do this nope

734
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:02,790
okay if we do this nope
 

735
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,650
okay if we do this nope
darn it

736
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:07,660

 

737
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,750

now I'm sad I was really hoping that

738
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
now I'm sad I was really hoping that
 

739
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,130
now I'm sad I was really hoping that
would work okay well it used to work

740
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:14,140
would work okay well it used to work
 

741
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,080
would work okay well it used to work
with lily pads as well let's just double

742
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,090
with lily pads as well let's just double
 

743
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,490
with lily pads as well let's just double
check I think they fixed that as well

744
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:19,500
check I think they fixed that as well
 

745
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,870
check I think they fixed that as well
it's something like this I think you

746
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:21,880
it's something like this I think you
 

747
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,440
it's something like this I think you
either put the block units nope

748
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,450
either put the block units nope
 

749
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,630
either put the block units nope
not looking good you either put the

750
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:27,640
not looking good you either put the
 

751
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,070
not looking good you either put the
block in it or you just broke the lily

752
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,080
block in it or you just broke the lily
 

753
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,490
block in it or you just broke the lily
pad I can't remember

754
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:31,500
pad I can't remember
 

755
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,460
pad I can't remember
that's nope

756
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:35,470
that's nope
 

757
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:42,090
that's nope
maybe a torch would do it now all right

758
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:42,100
maybe a torch would do it now all right
 

759
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,830
maybe a torch would do it now all right
so we're not totally out of Hope here

760
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
so we're not totally out of Hope here
 

761
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,690
so we're not totally out of Hope here
there's a couple other options they're

762
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:45,700
there's a couple other options they're
 

763
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,570
there's a couple other options they're
not quite as good though you can for

764
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:48,580
not quite as good though you can for
 

765
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:55,740
not quite as good though you can for
example do signs like so and signs on

766
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:55,750
example do signs like so and signs on
 

767
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,650
example do signs like so and signs on
signs the only downside with this is

768
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:58,660
signs the only downside with this is
 

769
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,770
signs the only downside with this is
they all break instantly and with the

770
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:01,780
they all break instantly and with the
 

771
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,470
they all break instantly and with the
falling sand it's fun to watch it sort

772
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
falling sand it's fun to watch it sort
 

773
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,799
falling sand it's fun to watch it sort
of cascade you know that's not quite as

774
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:07,809
of cascade you know that's not quite as
 

775
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:12,030
of cascade you know that's not quite as
good you do get the Cascade effect oops

776
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,040
good you do get the Cascade effect oops
 

777
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,940
good you do get the Cascade effect oops
as it breaks upward though so it's kind

778
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:14,950
as it breaks upward though so it's kind
 

779
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,890
as it breaks upward though so it's kind
of like a wick

780
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:15,900
of like a wick
 

781
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,150
of like a wick
but then when it hits that they all go

782
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
but then when it hits that they all go
 

783
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,510
but then when it hits that they all go
at once so that's kind of okay not as

784
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
at once so that's kind of okay not as
 

785
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,500
at once so that's kind of okay not as
cool though the other thing there is

786
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:24,510
cool though the other thing there is
 

787
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,990
cool though the other thing there is
there's a trick you can do with vines as

788
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
there's a trick you can do with vines as
 

789
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,650
there's a trick you can do with vines as
well let me see if I can figure that out

790
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:33,660

 

791
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,070

maybe not go so high here actually let's

792
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
maybe not go so high here actually let's
 

793
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,600
maybe not go so high here actually let's
do it like this I think if you have a

794
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:39,610
do it like this I think if you have a
 

795
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,789
do it like this I think if you have a
