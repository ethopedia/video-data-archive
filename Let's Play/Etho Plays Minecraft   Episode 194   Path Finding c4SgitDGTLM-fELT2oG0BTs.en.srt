13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,310

smoothed out the walls put some pumpkin

14
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320

00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480

 

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,430

it's a little bit more uniform and

18
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
it's a little bit more uniform and
 

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,630
it's a little bit more uniform and
whatnot

20
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
whatnot
 

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,830
whatnot
um so that's that's all done

22
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
um so that's that's all done
 

23
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,790
um so that's that's all done
there's did not really make a proper way

24
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
there's did not really make a proper way
 

25
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,630
there's did not really make a proper way
of getting in but i can get in and out

26
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
of getting in but i can get in and out
 

27
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,190
of getting in but i can get in and out
through

28
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
through
 

29
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,910
through
here with ender pearls real easy

30
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:53,920

 

31
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,430

so that's that's probably the way i'll

32
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
so that's that's probably the way i'll
 

33
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,630
so that's that's probably the way i'll
do it

34
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640
do it
 

35
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,189
do it
um tried this out it's working okay

36
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
um tried this out it's working okay
 

37
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,030
um tried this out it's working okay
there's a few cows roaming around there

there's a few cows roaming around there
from before before i had this

40
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
from before before i had this
 

41
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,990
from before before i had this
fence here and i guess we could do a

42
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
fence here and i guess we could do a
 

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,870
fence here and i guess we could do a
harvest

44
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880

 

45
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,510

harvest time again

46
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520

 

47
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,310

uh today i'm mostly planning on doing

48
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
uh today i'm mostly planning on doing
 

49
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,190
uh today i'm mostly planning on doing
stuff around

50
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
stuff around
 

51
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,310
stuff around
uh the other base the stronghold base i

52
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
uh the other base the stronghold base i
 

53
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,030
uh the other base the stronghold base i
gotta do some stuff with the the mob

54
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
gotta do some stuff with the the mob
 

55
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,390
gotta do some stuff with the the mob
system

56
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
system
 

57
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,109
system
and maybe some stuff with the storage

58
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
and maybe some stuff with the storage
 

59
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,590
and maybe some stuff with the storage
room we'll see

60
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
room we'll see
 

61
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,950
room we'll see
but that's where we're gonna head to

62
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
but that's where we're gonna head to
 

63

and the guy got a lot of flack for it a

82
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
and the guy got a lot of flack for it a
 

83
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,270
and the guy got a lot of flack for it a
lot of people told him it was impossible

84
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
lot of people told him it was impossible
 

85
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,070
lot of people told him it was impossible
uh it's a stupid idea but i love the

86
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
uh it's a stupid idea but i love the
 

87
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,990
uh it's a stupid idea but i love the
idea and i've been planning on building

88
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
idea and i've been planning on building
 

89
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,390
idea and i've been planning on building
it

90
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
it
 

91
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,190
it
ever since i read that comment um and

92
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
ever since i read that comment um and
 

93
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,990
ever since i read that comment um and
i've also seen

94
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
i've also seen
 

95
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,110
i've also seen
a few other people make attempts at it

96
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
a few other people make attempts at it
 

97
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,710
a few other people make attempts at it
and have done some pretty cool things

98
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
and have done some pretty cool things
 

99
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,190
and have done some pretty cool things
with ideas well

100
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
with ideas well
 

101
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,110
with ideas well
but about two three weeks ago i took a

102
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
but about two three weeks ago i took a
 

103
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,070
but about two three weeks ago i took a
shot at it

104
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
shot at it
 

105
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,550
shot at it
in creative mode and figured out the

106
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
in creative mode and figured out the
 

107
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,030
in creative mode and figured out the
most difficult parts of making it work

108
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
most difficult parts of making it work
 

109
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,589
most difficult parts of making it work
so i'm not going to tell you what it is

110
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
so i'm not going to tell you what it is
 

111
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,390
so i'm not going to tell you what it is
yet

112
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
yet
 

113
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,670
yet
i don't know if you guys like that if

114
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
i don't know if you guys like that if
 

115
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,670
i don't know if you guys like that if
i'm sick when i'm secretive about things

116
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
i'm sick when i'm secretive about things
 

117
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,550
i'm sick when i'm secretive about things
but

118
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
but
 

119
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,949
but
i kind of like you to figure it out as

120
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
i kind of like you to figure it out as
 

121
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,229
i kind of like you to figure it out as
we go along so

122
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
we go along so
 

123
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,350
we go along so
i keep you thinking but i don't if you

124
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
i keep you thinking but i don't if you
 

125
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,110
i keep you thinking but i don't if you
don't like that let me know

126
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
don't like that let me know
 

127
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,869
don't like that let me know
um but we're gonna we gotta lean towards

128
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
um but we're gonna we gotta lean towards
 

129
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,670
um but we're gonna we gotta lean towards
that direction

130
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
that direction
 

131
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,229
that direction
towards making that project and before

132
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
towards making that project and before
 

133
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,869
towards making that project and before
we can do it we need to make

134
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
we can do it we need to make
 

135
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,990
we can do it we need to make
a few improvements to this mob system we

136
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
a few improvements to this mob system we
 

137
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,509
a few improvements to this mob system we
need to make

138
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
need to make
 

139
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,229
need to make
most importantly we need a mob separator

140
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239

 

141
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,869

which is something we're going to play

142
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
which is something we're going to play
 

143
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,470
which is something we're going to play
around with today we'll probably go over

144
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
around with today we'll probably go over
 

145
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,509
around with today we'll probably go over
to creative world

146
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
to creative world
 

147
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,270
to creative world
and and do some experiments there

148
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
and and do some experiments there
 

149
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,910
and and do some experiments there
when i made this i had it with this

150
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
when i made this i had it with this
 

151
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,670
when i made this i had it with this
project in mind and i thought it was

152
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
project in mind and i thought it was
 

153
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,750
project in mind and i thought it was
going to be real easy to make a mob

154
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
going to be real easy to make a mob
 

155
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,470
going to be real easy to make a mob
separator because you just need

156
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
separator because you just need
 

157
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,869
separator because you just need
villagers to separate zombies you need

158
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
villagers to separate zombies you need
 

159
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,949
villagers to separate zombies you need
ocelots to separate creepers

160
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
ocelots to separate creepers
 

161
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,670
ocelots to separate creepers
and then you're left with skeletons and

162
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
and then you're left with skeletons and
 

163
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,910
and then you're left with skeletons and
you can easily divide them up that way

164
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
you can easily divide them up that way
 

165
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,910
you can easily divide them up that way
but apparently there's other problems

166
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
but apparently there's other problems
 

167
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,030
but apparently there's other problems
involved so we're going to go to a

168
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
involved so we're going to go to a
 

169
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,949
involved so we're going to go to a
creative world and just see how it works

170
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
creative world and just see how it works
 

171
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,869
creative world and just see how it works
we'll we'll create a little mock-up of

172
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
we'll we'll create a little mock-up of
 

173
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,710
we'll we'll create a little mock-up of
the idea

174
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720

 

175
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,350

yeah so i loaded up a creative world i

176
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
yeah so i loaded up a creative world i
 

177
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,910
yeah so i loaded up a creative world i
had

178
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
had
 

179
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,309
had
and i think this was a creative world i

180
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
and i think this was a creative world i
 

181
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,350
and i think this was a creative world i
made in 1.3 because i was right by

182
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
made in 1.3 because i was right by
 

183
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,309
made in 1.3 because i was right by
one of these villages and there's no

184
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
one of these villages and there's no
 

185
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,390
one of these villages and there's no
stairs on the roofs

186
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
stairs on the roofs
 

187
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,470
stairs on the roofs
got dark spots where they were check

188
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
got dark spots where they were check
 

189
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,070
got dark spots where they were check
this mountain out

190
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
this mountain out
 

191
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,990
this mountain out
that's pretty cool too

192
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
that's pretty cool too
 

193
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,910
that's pretty cool too
but yeah we're gonna do some mob tests

194
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
but yeah we're gonna do some mob tests
 

195
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,590
but yeah we're gonna do some mob tests
here it's gonna take a lot of trial and

196
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
here it's gonna take a lot of trial and
 

197
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,590
here it's gonna take a lot of trial and
error to figure it out

198
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
error to figure it out
 

199
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,030
error to figure it out
and little by little we will figure out

200
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
and little by little we will figure out
 

201
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,710
and little by little we will figure out
what we need to do to make a mob

202
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
what we need to do to make a mob
 

203
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,230
what we need to do to make a mob
separator

204
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
separator
 

205
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,670
separator
the the issue the main issue i think

206
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
the the issue the main issue i think
 

207
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,710
the the issue the main issue i think
uh with this idea at the moment

208
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
uh with this idea at the moment
 

209
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,230
uh with this idea at the moment
is that the ocelots will randomly

210
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
is that the ocelots will randomly
 

211
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,350
is that the ocelots will randomly
teleport like dogs and the dogs and the

212
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
teleport like dogs and the dogs and the
 

213
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,430
teleport like dogs and the dogs and the
cats they randomly teleports

214
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
cats they randomly teleports
 

215
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,390
cats they randomly teleports
when they're not supposed to with the

216
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:43,400
when they're not supposed to with the
 

217
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,030
when they're not supposed to with the
1.2.5 patch

218
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
1.2.5 patch
 

219
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,310
1.2.5 patch
so i think that's the main issue

220
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
so i think that's the main issue
 

221
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,790
so i think that's the main issue
but we'll we'll see if we can if we have

222
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
but we'll we'll see if we can if we have
 

223
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,270
but we'll we'll see if we can if we have
any other problems so

224
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
any other problems so
 

225
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,950
any other problems so
we're going to pretend the mob system is

226
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
we're going to pretend the mob system is
 

227
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,270
we're going to pretend the mob system is
right above here mobs are falling down

228
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
right above here mobs are falling down
 

229
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,909
right above here mobs are falling down
into here

230
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
into here
 

231
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,189
into here
safely

232
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199

 

233
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,550

so if we spawn a creeper

234
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
so if we spawn a creeper
 

235
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,350
so if we spawn a creeper
you will just go to the end so let's see

236
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
you will just go to the end so let's see
 

237
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,790
you will just go to the end so let's see
what happens if we were to put

238
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
what happens if we were to put
 

239
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,510
what happens if we were to put
a villager here i guess

240
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520

 

241
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,430

just a lot of trial and error to figure

242
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
just a lot of trial and error to figure
 

243
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,830
just a lot of trial and error to figure
out their behavior

244
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
out their behavior
 

245
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,350
out their behavior
maybe move it back a bit more

246
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
maybe move it back a bit more
 

247
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,270
maybe move it back a bit more
and i have seen other uh separators

248
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
and i have seen other uh separators
 

249
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,189
and i have seen other uh separators
of course there's my really old one i

250
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
of course there's my really old one i
 

251
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,550
of course there's my really old one i
made that one's

252
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
made that one's
 

253
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,270
made that one's
never been very practical though i saw

254
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
never been very practical though i saw
 

255
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,189
never been very practical though i saw
somebody make one using snowmen that was

256
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
somebody make one using snowmen that was
 

257
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:37,990
somebody make one using snowmen that was
pretty cool but

258
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
pretty cool but
 

259
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,110
pretty cool but
it was very large also so

260
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
it was very large also so
 

261
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,270
it was very large also so
i'm gonna have to keep this as simple as

262
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
i'm gonna have to keep this as simple as
 

263
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,909
i'm gonna have to keep this as simple as
possible

264
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919

 

265
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,629

okay let's get a sign to hold the water

266
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
okay let's get a sign to hold the water
 

267
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,070
okay let's get a sign to hold the water
sign yes actually we don't need one

268
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
sign yes actually we don't need one
 

269
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:04,070
sign yes actually we don't need one
okay so what will the zombie do now

270
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080

 

271
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,469

okay he tried to go but he couldn't

272
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479

 

273
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:18,830

that time he made it

274
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840

 

275
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,469

okay

276
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
okay
 

277
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,510
okay
so i put a cover over top here so that

278
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
so i put a cover over top here so that
 

279
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,830
so i put a cover over top here so that
uh the sunlight won't affect their

280
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
uh the sunlight won't affect their
 

281
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,230
uh the sunlight won't affect their
pathfinding we don't want that happening

282
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
pathfinding we don't want that happening
 

283
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,430
pathfinding we don't want that happening
also i said uh creeper instead of zombie

284
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
also i said uh creeper instead of zombie
 

285
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,550
also i said uh creeper instead of zombie
before

286
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
before
 

287
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,469
before
i know i know you don't need to correct

288
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
i know i know you don't need to correct
 

289
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,790
i know i know you don't need to correct
me i know the difference

290
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
me i know the difference
 

291
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,189
me i know the difference
sometimes i say the wrong thing though

292
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
sometimes i say the wrong thing though
 

293
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,749
sometimes i say the wrong thing though
um

294
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759

 

295
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,590

so the main issue right now is we can't

296
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
so the main issue right now is we can't
 

297
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,350
so the main issue right now is we can't
reliably make them go follow the

298
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
reliably make them go follow the
 

299
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,110
reliably make them go follow the
villager so we could either try

300
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
villager so we could either try
 

301
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,790
villager so we could either try
widen this or what i want to do first

302
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
widen this or what i want to do first
 

303
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,070
widen this or what i want to do first
is raise this water stream up one block

304
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
is raise this water stream up one block
 

305
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,790
is raise this water stream up one block
and see how that affects things so it's

306
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
and see how that affects things so it's
 

307
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,150
and see how that affects things so it's
going to put signs all along

308
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
going to put signs all along
 

309
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,110
going to put signs all along
bottom then we'll put the water on top

310
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
bottom then we'll put the water on top
 

311
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,790
bottom then we'll put the water on top
of them

312
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
of them
 

313
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,309
of them
because this forces them to have their

314
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
because this forces them to have their
 

315
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,070
because this forces them to have their
head right against the ceiling so

316
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
head right against the ceiling so
 

317
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,110
head right against the ceiling so
there's no

318
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
there's no
 

319
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,469
there's no
there's no gap we'll also have to put a

320
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
there's no gap we'll also have to put a
 

321
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,469
there's no gap we'll also have to put a
sign here probably

322
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
sign here probably
 

323
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,550
sign here probably
water doesn't feel that way

324
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560

 

325
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,790

okay now let's see what happens here

326
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
okay now let's see what happens here
 

327
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,830
okay now let's see what happens here
actually let's raise this up a bit too

328
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840

 

329
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,230

okay single

330
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
okay single
 

331
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,790
okay single
you got it no problem

332
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800

 

333
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:46,550

no still had trouble

334
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560

 

335
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:58,070

hmm maybe i should try slow sand

336
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
hmm maybe i should try slow sand
 

337
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,589
hmm maybe i should try slow sand
curious to see what that will do

338
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599

 

339
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,869

that's a creeper that's a creeper

340
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
that's a creeper that's a creeper
 

341
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,070
that's a creeper that's a creeper
okay there

342
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
okay there
 

343
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,589
okay there
well now that their heads against the

344
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
well now that their heads against the
 

345
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,950
well now that their heads against the
ceiling they're probably not on the slow

346
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
ceiling they're probably not on the slow
 

347
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,070
ceiling they're probably not on the slow
stand look how fast they're going

348
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080
stand look how fast they're going
 

349
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,189
stand look how fast they're going
through

350
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199

 

351
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,670

so i'll undo that and try again

352
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
so i'll undo that and try again
 

353
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,510
so i'll undo that and try again
uh let's try it again here

354
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520

 

355
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,550

water's down again

356
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
water's down again
 

357
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,990
water's down again
nothing

358
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000

 

359
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,509

nothing

360
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519

 

361
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,670

nope can't see the villager now

362
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680

 

363
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:53,190

weird

364
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200

 

365
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,550

yeah slow sand does nothing because

366
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
yeah slow sand does nothing because
 

367
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,269
yeah slow sand does nothing because
they're swimming up anyway

368
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279

 

369
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,190

yeah i changed something here so they

370
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
yeah i changed something here so they
 

371
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,630
yeah i changed something here so they
can't see the villager anymore they're

372
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
can't see the villager anymore they're
 

373
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,910
can't see the villager anymore they're
making

374
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
making
 

375
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,150
making
no attempt to get them

376
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
no attempt to get them
 

377
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,949
no attempt to get them
i'm guessing it's because i put this top

378
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
i'm guessing it's because i put this top
 

379
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,389
i'm guessing it's because i put this top
on

380
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
on
 

381
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,710
on
here

382
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720

 

383
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:25,990

let's try that

384
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000

 

385
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,190

there we go that one block was doing it

386
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200

 

387
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,150

yeah he tried but wasn't able to go in

388
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
yeah he tried but wasn't able to go in
 

389
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,230
yeah he tried but wasn't able to go in
but at least he tried

390
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
but at least he tried
 

391
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,630
but at least he tried
i'm curious if it was just the one block

392
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
i'm curious if it was just the one block
 

393
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,750
i'm curious if it was just the one block
or

394
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
or
 

395
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,870
or
if it's other blocks too

396
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880

 

397
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,070

let's cover up everything except that

398
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
let's cover up everything except that
 

399
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,190
let's cover up everything except that
one

400
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
one
 

401
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,590
one
see what happens

402
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600

 

403
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,949

yeah just the one block weird

404
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959

 

405
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,829

okay what i want to try then is

406
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:02,839

 

407
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:11,590

um half slabs we're the half slabs

408
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600

 

409
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,670

come on come on

410
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680

 

411
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,990

okay we'll put a half slab

412
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000

 

413
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,430

there he tried to run

414
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
there he tried to run
 

415
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,290
there he tried to run
why would you run into the zombie

416
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:25,300
why would you run into the zombie
 

417
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,230
why would you run into the zombie
[Laughter]

418
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
[Laughter]
 

419
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,110
[Laughter]
oh man that's weird okay we'll put the

420
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
oh man that's weird okay we'll put the
 

421
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,230
oh man that's weird okay we'll put the
villager behind that

422
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
villager behind that
 

423
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,790
villager behind that
and see what happens

424
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800

 

425
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,150

okay i've been running them through here

426
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
okay i've been running them through here
 

427
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,150
okay i've been running them through here
a few times and there's some interesting

428
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
a few times and there's some interesting
 

429
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,550
a few times and there's some interesting
stuff

430
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
stuff
 

431
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,910
stuff
at me i also punched a hole here

432
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
at me i also punched a hole here
 

433
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,269
at me i also punched a hole here
now so they can fall down because that's

434
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
now so they can fall down because that's
 

435
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,870
now so they can fall down because that's
the other thing we need to have some way

436
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
the other thing we need to have some way
 

437
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,150
the other thing we need to have some way
of getting them into

438
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
of getting them into
 

439
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,630
of getting them into
another stream

440
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640

 

441
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,550

but what has me really interested is

442
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
but what has me really interested is
 

443
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,670
but what has me really interested is
they do this little hop here

444
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
they do this little hop here
 

445
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,230
they do this little hop here
when they get out of the water i want to

446
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
when they get out of the water i want to
 

447
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,509
when they get out of the water i want to
see what happens if we get rid of that

448
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
see what happens if we get rid of that
 

449
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,670
see what happens if we get rid of that
blocked yet

450
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680

 

451
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:22,550

tries to go this way that's weird

452
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560

 

453
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,829

okay what happens if we put water above

454
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839
okay what happens if we put water above
 

455
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,110
okay what happens if we put water above
there

456
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
there
 

457
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,630
there
because we got to build this with the

458
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
because we got to build this with the
 

459
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,910
because we got to build this with the
thought in mind that we're going to have

460
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
thought in mind that we're going to have
 

461
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,670
thought in mind that we're going to have
a lot of mobs going through here too

462
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
a lot of mobs going through here too
 

463
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,470
a lot of mobs going through here too
not just one at a time

464
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
not just one at a time
 

465
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,389
not just one at a time
oh that updated the water so it flew

466
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
oh that updated the water so it flew
 

467
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,030
oh that updated the water so it flew
down there

468
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040

 

469
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,550

yeah i tried out the water idea but

470
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
yeah i tried out the water idea but
 

471
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,069
yeah i tried out the water idea but
didn't really work

472
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
didn't really work
 

473
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,670
didn't really work
all the mobs went up it so

474
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
all the mobs went up it so
 

475
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,030
all the mobs went up it so
what we should try to do now is increase

476
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
what we should try to do now is increase
 

477
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,389
what we should try to do now is increase
visibility because

478
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
visibility because
 

479
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,949
visibility because
by the time the zombies see the villager

480
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
by the time the zombies see the villager
 

481
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:03,509
by the time the zombies see the villager
they're

482
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
they're
 

483
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,269
they're
they're like over here and then they

484
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
they're like over here and then they
 

485
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,670
they're like over here and then they
start going towards them and

486
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
start going towards them and
 

487
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,190
start going towards them and
then they try to swim back but they

488
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
then they try to swim back but they
 

489
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,389
then they try to swim back but they
can't usually

490
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399

 

491
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,310

so we will cut out over here

492
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
so we will cut out over here
 

493
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,710
so we will cut out over here
so they'll see them one block in advance

494
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
so they'll see them one block in advance
 

495
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,030
so they'll see them one block in advance
but still not be able to go

496
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
but still not be able to go
 

497
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,710
but still not be able to go
this is simpler if you can keep it down

498
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
this is simpler if you can keep it down
 

499
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,470
this is simpler if you can keep it down
to one wide tube

500
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480

 

501
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,389

even though we sort of need a two wide

502
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
even though we sort of need a two wide
 

503
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,750
even though we sort of need a two wide
one here we just don't want them to be

504
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
one here we just don't want them to be
 

505
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,910
one here we just don't want them to be
able to walk

506
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
able to walk
 

507
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,910
able to walk
in the two wide area so if we do that

508
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:37,920
in the two wide area so if we do that
 

509
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,629
in the two wide area so if we do that
how's this look

510
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639

 

511
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,150

so now they should be able to see the

512
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
so now they should be able to see the
 

513
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,509
so now they should be able to see the
villager from here

514
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
villager from here
 

515
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,310
villager from here
right maybe we'll get rid of one more

516
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
right maybe we'll get rid of one more
 

517
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,750
right maybe we'll get rid of one more
block there

518
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
block there
 

519
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,829
block there
whoa that must have fell

520
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839

 

521
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,509

yeah we'll we'll do this

522
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
yeah we'll we'll do this
 

523
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:10,150
yeah we'll we'll do this
that and that let's see what happens

524
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160

 

525
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,590

oh yeah saw him way earlier

526
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
oh yeah saw him way earlier
 

527
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,310
oh yeah saw him way earlier
yeah that's the key there

528
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
yeah that's the key there
 

529
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:29,430
yeah that's the key there
oh nope didn't make it still not good

530
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440

 

531
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,829

so we may have to make this wider after

532
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
so we may have to make this wider after
 

533
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,110
so we may have to make this wider after
all at least

534
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
all at least
 

535
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:40,550
all at least
one block

536
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560

 

537
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,509

yeah that's what we'll do so we'll

538
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519

 

539
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:52,150

take it out there do something like that

540
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160

 

541
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,509

and then have them converge into one

542
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519
and then have them converge into one
 

543
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,150
and then have them converge into one
wide

544
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
wide
 

545
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,949
wide
stream if possible

546
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959

 

547
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,269

even with those changes it's still not

548
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
even with those changes it's still not
 

549
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,030
even with those changes it's still not
working 100

550
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
working 100
 

551
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,189
working 100
and i'm starting to see why

552
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199

 

553
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,230

there's two major factors that

554
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,240
there's two major factors that
 

555
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,189
there's two major factors that
determine whether or not they make it in

556
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199
determine whether or not they make it in
 

557
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:21,509
determine whether or not they make it in
or not

558
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519

 

559
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,810

he won't make it

560
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:23,820
he won't make it
 

561
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,389
he won't make it
[Music]

562
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,399
[Music]
 

563
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,230
[Music]
he will

564
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
he will
 

565
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,430
he will
so what it is first of all if we go in

566
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
so what it is first of all if we go in
 

567
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,430
so what it is first of all if we go in
here

568
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
here
 

569
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,990
here
um if you look at our z coordinate you

570
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
um if you look at our z coordinate you
 

571
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,910
um if you look at our z coordinate you
see it's at .69

572
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
see it's at .69
 

573
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,189
see it's at .69
or 0.7 basically um if we go to the

574
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
or 0.7 basically um if we go to the
 

575
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,870
or 0.7 basically um if we go to the
right side it's at point three

576
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
right side it's at point three
 

577
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,750
right side it's at point three
so there's a point what is it point four

578
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
so there's a point what is it point four
 

579
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,870
so there's a point what is it point four
yeah point four blocks leeway where we

580
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,880
yeah point four blocks leeway where we
 

581
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,230
yeah point four blocks leeway where we
can move around here if they're right

582
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
can move around here if they're right
 

583
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,069
can move around here if they're right
against this left wall

584
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
against this left wall
 

585
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,710
against this left wall
they have to travel 0.4 blocks to get

586
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
they have to travel 0.4 blocks to get
 

587
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,470
they have to travel 0.4 blocks to get
out of the stream

588
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,480
out of the stream
 

589
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,750
out of the stream
or to get to this wall so there's a

590
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
or to get to this wall so there's a
 

591
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,430
or to get to this wall so there's a
little bit of leeway there which

592
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
little bit of leeway there which
 

593
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,030
little bit of leeway there which
influences them but the main thing is

594
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,040
influences them but the main thing is
 

595
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,590
influences them but the main thing is
uh their rotation because they have to

596
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
uh their rotation because they have to
 

597
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,750
uh their rotation because they have to
turn around before they start walking

598
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
turn around before they start walking
 

599
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,750
turn around before they start walking
towards the villager

600
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760

 

601
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,590

so pay attention to their rotation that

602
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
so pay attention to their rotation that
 

603
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,949
so pay attention to their rotation that
guy made it because he was almost

604
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959
guy made it because he was almost
 

605
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,470
guy made it because he was almost
looking at the villager that guy was all

606
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
looking at the villager that guy was all
 

607
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,069
looking at the villager that guy was all
the way turned around like he was like

608
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
the way turned around like he was like
 

609
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,110
the way turned around like he was like
this

610
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
this
 

611
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,110
this
he had to go like this and then by the

612
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
he had to go like this and then by the
 

613
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,790
he had to go like this and then by the
time he turned around

614
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
time he turned around
 

615
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,069
time he turned around
it was too late so basically

616
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
it was too late so basically
 

617
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,230
it was too late so basically
it comes down to us needing to give them

618
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
it comes down to us needing to give them
 

619
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,030
it comes down to us needing to give them
more time

620
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040

 

621
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,150

he won't make it he will

622
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160

 

623
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,509

he will he will

624
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
he will he will
 

625
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,670
he will he will
he won't that's weird how they do that

626
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
he won't that's weird how they do that
 

627
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,990
he won't that's weird how they do that
too like he was

628
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
too like he was
 

629
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,189
too like he was
i think like this it would have been

630
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
i think like this it would have been
 

631
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,949
i think like this it would have been
quicker for him to turn this way but he

632
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
quicker for him to turn this way but he
 

633
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,990
quicker for him to turn this way but he
turns

634
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
turns
 

635
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,350
turns
to his right and it's a long

636
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
to his right and it's a long
 

637
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,990
to his right and it's a long
like over 180 degree turn he does there

638
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
like over 180 degree turn he does there
 

639
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,790
like over 180 degree turn he does there
um so he won't make it

640
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
um so he won't make it
 

641
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,550
um so he won't make it
what i'm gonna do is take out another

642
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
what i'm gonna do is take out another
 

643
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,710
what i'm gonna do is take out another
block i don't think we actually

644
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
block i don't think we actually
 

645
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,550
block i don't think we actually
need it too wide i don't think that has

646
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560
need it too wide i don't think that has
 

647
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,389
need it too wide i don't think that has
any influence

648
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
any influence
 

649
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,269
any influence
um i might extend this water stream to

650
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
um i might extend this water stream to
 

651
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,269
um i might extend this water stream to
give us some more space to work with

652
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279

 

653
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,150

seemed to take him a while

654
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160

 

655
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,590

yeah i think that's helping he'll make

656
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
yeah i think that's helping he'll make
 

657
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:33,910
yeah i think that's helping he'll make
it

658
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
it
 

659
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,629
it
he'll make it he'll make it i want one

660
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
he'll make it he'll make it i want one
 

661
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,590
he'll make it he'll make it i want one
that's turned around

662
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600

 

663
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,430

oh did no they didn't make it i think

664
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
oh did no they didn't make it i think
 

665
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,350
oh did no they didn't make it i think
they were in their way

666
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360

 

667
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,790

i'll have to rewatch it they i think

668
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
i'll have to rewatch it they i think
 

669
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,829
i'll have to rewatch it they i think
they were in their way and that's why

670
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:49,839
they were in their way and that's why
 

671
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,110
they were in their way and that's why
they didn't make it but

672
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
they didn't make it but
 

673
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,670
they didn't make it but
maybe not

674
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680

 

675
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,310

i rewatched that and i spotted the

676
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
i rewatched that and i spotted the
 

677
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,670
i rewatched that and i spotted the
problem

678
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
problem
 

679
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,870
problem
the way i had it set up i had

680
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:02,880
the way i had it set up i had
 

681
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,029
the way i had it set up i had
two blocks wide line of sight to the

682
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
two blocks wide line of sight to the
 

683
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,549
two blocks wide line of sight to the
villager for the zombie

684
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
villager for the zombie
 

685
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,510
villager for the zombie
and a one wide block walkway to get to

686
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:09,520
and a one wide block walkway to get to
 

687
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,470
and a one wide block walkway to get to
them

688
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
them
 

689
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,029
them
uh i noticed the zombies did not

690
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:13,039
uh i noticed the zombies did not
 

691
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,390
uh i noticed the zombies did not
actually start turning around

692
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400
actually start turning around
 

693
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,029
actually start turning around
until they came to the one wide walkway

694
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039
until they came to the one wide walkway
 

695
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,870
until they came to the one wide walkway
though the line of sight didn't really

696
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:18,880
though the line of sight didn't really
 

697
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,470
though the line of sight didn't really
do anything

698
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
do anything
 

699
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,669
do anything
so since it was only one wide it didn't

700
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:23,679
so since it was only one wide it didn't
 

701
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,750
so since it was only one wide it didn't
give them enough time to turn around

702
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:25,760
give them enough time to turn around
 

703
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,070
give them enough time to turn around
and go into it i've changed this back to

704
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
and go into it i've changed this back to
 

705
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,549
and go into it i've changed this back to
the two wide thing

706
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
the two wide thing
 

707
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,270
the two wide thing
and that should work out just fine now

708
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
and that should work out just fine now
 

709
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,270
and that should work out just fine now
i'm used to the old mob ai you know

710
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280
i'm used to the old mob ai you know
 

711
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,310
i'm used to the old mob ai you know
where path

712
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
where path
 

713
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,230
where path
or a direct line of sight was really

714
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
or a direct line of sight was really
 

715
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,230
or a direct line of sight was really
important to them but i don't think that

716
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
important to them but i don't think that
 

717
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,350
important to them but i don't think that
matters so much anymore or at all

718
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,360
matters so much anymore or at all
 

719
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,909
matters so much anymore or at all
possibly um because they

720
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919

 

721
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,470

they figure things out differently now

722
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
they figure things out differently now
 

723
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,390
they figure things out differently now
but as it is right now we're still going

724
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
but as it is right now we're still going
 

725
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,870
but as it is right now we're still going
to have the problem

726
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
to have the problem
 

727
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,710
to have the problem
do you know why

728
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720

 

729
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,549

after everything we've learned today do

730
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
after everything we've learned today do
 

731
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,390
after everything we've learned today do
you know why it's still not working

732
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400

 

733
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,350

100 that guy will go in

734
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360

 

735
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,029

that guy will go in

736
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,039

 

737
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,549

he'll go in

738
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559

 

739
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,710

he'll go in he won't

740
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720
he'll go in he won't
 

741
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,310
he'll go in he won't
why won't he go in

742
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,320
why won't he go in
 

743
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,909
why won't he go in
do you know it's because it's still only

744
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
do you know it's because it's still only
 

745
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,750
do you know it's because it's still only
registering as a one wide block way

746
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:33,760
registering as a one wide block way
 

747
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,070
registering as a one wide block way
because we have this block

748
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
because we have this block
 

749
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,390
because we have this block
over top now it will work 100 percent

750
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
over top now it will work 100 percent
 

751
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,150
over top now it will work 100 percent
i think i hope

752
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160

 

753
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,789

see he had to do a major turnaround

754
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
see he had to do a major turnaround
 

755
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,150
see he had to do a major turnaround
there and he still made it with plenty

756
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
there and he still made it with plenty
 

757
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,070
there and he still made it with plenty
of time to spare

758
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
of time to spare
 

759
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,190
of time to spare
uh now what i want to see is how other

760
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
uh now what i want to see is how other
 

761
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,909
uh now what i want to see is how other
mobs will react to this

762
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:57,919
mobs will react to this
 

763
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,710
mobs will react to this
if they will attempt to walk that way

764
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720
if they will attempt to walk that way
 

765
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,150
if they will attempt to walk that way
because if they do

766
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
because if they do
 

767
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,549
because if they do
this is all for nothing we want them to

768
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
this is all for nothing we want them to
 

769
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,590
this is all for nothing we want them to
go straight

770
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600

 

771
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,950

he went straight

772
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
he went straight
 

773
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,830
he went straight
so i'm gonna send probably hundreds of

774
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
so i'm gonna send probably hundreds of
 

775
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,669
so i'm gonna send probably hundreds of
creepers through here oh he's attempting

776
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:15,679
creepers through here oh he's attempting
 

777
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,230
creepers through here oh he's attempting
to go

778
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240

 

779
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,830

and see if any of them try to walk this

780
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840
and see if any of them try to walk this
 

781
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,710
and see if any of them try to walk this
way

782
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
way
 

783
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,230
way
yeah i've been sending them through and

784
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240
yeah i've been sending them through and
 

785
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,510
yeah i've been sending them through and
i've seen a couple attempt it

786
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
i've seen a couple attempt it
 

787
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,070
i've seen a couple attempt it
it's rare but it does happen and the

788
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
it's rare but it does happen and the
 

789
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,950
it's rare but it does happen and the
longer the stretch before

790
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:34,960
longer the stretch before
 

791
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,789
longer the stretch before
the villager the more likely it's going

792
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
the villager the more likely it's going
 

793
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,070
the villager the more likely it's going
to happen because they'll have more

794
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
to happen because they'll have more
 

795
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:45,190
to happen because they'll have more
time to see that path

796
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200

 

797
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,950

oh there he goes see

798
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:48,960

 

799
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,390

ding guy so

800
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:52,400
ding guy so
 

801
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,310
ding guy so
to stop that from happening we need to

802
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,320
to stop that from happening we need to
 

803
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,070
to stop that from happening we need to
make it so they don't

804
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
make it so they don't
 

805
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,909
make it so they don't
their pathfinding can't see this as a

806
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
their pathfinding can't see this as a
 

807
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,590
their pathfinding can't see this as a
viable path

808
00:19:59,590 --> 00:19:59,600
viable path
 

809
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,830
viable path
uh which we can do by lowering the

810
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:01,840
uh which we can do by lowering the
 

811
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,750
uh which we can do by lowering the
ground

812
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
ground
 

813
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,110
ground
by four four blocks so

814
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
by four four blocks so
 

815
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,710
by four four blocks so
that they would get fall damage if they

816
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
that they would get fall damage if they
 

817
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,830
that they would get fall damage if they
did

818
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840

 

819
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,590

the question is if the zombies will

820
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
the question is if the zombies will
 

821
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,590
the question is if the zombies will
still attempt to go that way after we do

822
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
still attempt to go that way after we do
 

823
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:15,990
still attempt to go that way after we do
that

824
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
that
 

825
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,190
that
which is what we'll have to check out

826
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
which is what we'll have to check out
 

827
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,870
which is what we'll have to check out
yeah there's no floor there now let's

828
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
yeah there's no floor there now let's
 

829
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,789
yeah there's no floor there now let's
see if they'll kamikaze to try to get

830
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
see if they'll kamikaze to try to get
 

831
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,470
see if they'll kamikaze to try to get
the villager

832
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480

 

833
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,190

no they don't that is a major problem

834
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
no they don't that is a major problem
 

835
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,230
no they don't that is a major problem
huh

836
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240

 

837
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,470

yeah that competes things a lot i'll

838
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
yeah that competes things a lot i'll
 

839
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,990
yeah that competes things a lot i'll
have to mess with this a bit

840
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,000
have to mess with this a bit
 

841
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,470
have to mess with this a bit
and see if we can figure something out

842
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
and see if we can figure something out
 

843
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,830
and see if we can figure something out
well um no major breakthrough yet

844
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
well um no major breakthrough yet
 

845
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,230
well um no major breakthrough yet
i've been learning a few new things but

846
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,240
i've been learning a few new things but
 

847
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,750
i've been learning a few new things but
nothing

848

00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:02,159
uh i checked out that video again the
 

853
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,070
uh i checked out that video again the
other mobs order i saw

854
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
other mobs order i saw
 

855
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,669
other mobs order i saw
it's by captain walnut and he uses

856
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679

it's by captain walnut and he uses
snowmen to do it

858
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,360
snowmen to do it

he's trying to spot any tricks he might

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
he's trying to spot any tricks he might
 

861

he's trying to spot any tricks he might
have been using that i'm

862
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
have been using that i'm
 

863
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,950
have been using that i'm
overlooking but nothing stood out

864
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:16,960
overlooking but nothing stood out
 

865
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,630
overlooking but nothing stood out
it's just because he's using snowmen

866
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:18,640
it's just because he's using snowmen
 

867
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,510
it's just because he's using snowmen
they are guaranteed to walk

868
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
they are guaranteed to walk
 

869
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,270
they are guaranteed to walk
towards the snowmen when they're agro

870
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,280
towards the snowmen when they're agro
 

871
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,190
towards the snowmen when they're agro
which i don't have the luxury of with

872
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
which i don't have the luxury of with
 

873
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,590
which i don't have the luxury of with
this method

874
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:29,600
this method
 

875
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,990
this method
although with what i want to build i

876
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
although with what i want to build i
 

877
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,830
although with what i want to build i
don't think i can have them aggro at a

878
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
don't think i can have them aggro at a
 

879
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,750
don't think i can have them aggro at a
snowman i think it'll mess up the

880
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
snowman i think it'll mess up the
 

881
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,390
snowman i think it'll mess up the
the plans i have so i have to do it this

882
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,400
the plans i have so i have to do it this
 

883
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,710
the plans i have so i have to do it this
way

884
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720

 

885
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,950

and i think i think the way i'm doing it

886
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
and i think i think the way i'm doing it
 

887
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,870
and i think i think the way i'm doing it
here is okay

888
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
here is okay
 

889
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,909
here is okay
i just can't get it to 100 percent

890
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
i just can't get it to 100 percent
 

891
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,430
i just can't get it to 100 percent
because if if

892
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440
because if if
 

893
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,149
because if if
a zombie can go there a creeper can go

894
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:54,159
a zombie can go there a creeper can go
 

895
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,270
a zombie can go there a creeper can go
there or a skeleton

896
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
there or a skeleton
 

897
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,950
there or a skeleton
can go there just unlikely they will but

898
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
can go there just unlikely they will but
 

899
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,669
can go there just unlikely they will but
it's

900
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
it's
 

901
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,149
it's
it's always going to be possible um

902
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:04,159
it's always going to be possible um
 

903
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,149
it's always going to be possible um
unless i figure out some trick i'm

904
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:08,159

 

905
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,830

not realizing like for the most part

906
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:09,840
not realizing like for the most part
 

907
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,350
not realizing like for the most part
it's okay

908
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
it's okay
 

909
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,350
it's okay
what i could do is have another setup

910
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
what i could do is have another setup
 

911
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,750
what i could do is have another setup
like this and it will

912
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:15,760
like this and it will
 

913
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,870
like this and it will
decrease the chances even more like it

914
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:18,880
decrease the chances even more like it
 

915
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,549
decrease the chances even more like it
right now it's probably one in thirty

916
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
right now it's probably one in thirty
 

917
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,630
right now it's probably one in thirty
one and forty

918
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:22,640
one and forty
 

919
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,070
one and forty
chance that they'll go in where they're

920
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080
chance that they'll go in where they're
 

921
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,870
chance that they'll go in where they're
not supposed to

922
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880

 

923
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,470

if i was to have another of these it

924
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:30,480
if i was to have another of these it
 

925
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,710
if i was to have another of these it
would be like one in thirty times one

926
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
would be like one in thirty times one
 

927
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,390
would be like one in thirty times one
and thirty a very very

928
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
and thirty a very very
 

929
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,830
and thirty a very very
small number getting messed up

930
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
small number getting messed up
 

931
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,669
small number getting messed up
which should be okay for most of the

932
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
which should be okay for most of the
 

933
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,149
which should be okay for most of the
things i want to do

934
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:44,159

 

935
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,990

like we haven't had one go there yet if

936
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,000
like we haven't had one go there yet if
 

937
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,149
like we haven't had one go there yet if
we go use a zombie he'll go there every

938
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:48,159
we go use a zombie he'll go there every
 

939
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,390
we go use a zombie he'll go there every
time

940
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
time
 

941
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,390
time
this is a new trick i figured out you

942
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
this is a new trick i figured out you
 

943
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,990
this is a new trick i figured out you
know how we have to have the block open

944
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
know how we have to have the block open
 

945
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,430
know how we have to have the block open
above here the downside of that

946
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
above here the downside of that
 

947
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,750
above here the downside of that
is it slows them down and causes jams in

948
00:22:59,750 --> 00:22:59,760
is it slows them down and causes jams in
 

949
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,190
is it slows them down and causes jams in
the streams

950
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,200
the streams
 

951
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,870
the streams
because they it takes them a while to

952
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
because they it takes them a while to
 

953
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,510
because they it takes them a while to
move from here but we can have

954
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
move from here but we can have
 

955
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,830
move from here but we can have
trapdoors apparently have them down and

956
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:07,840
trapdoors apparently have them down and
 

957
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,310
trapdoors apparently have them down and
they still view it as an empty block

958
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:10,320
they still view it as an empty block
 

959
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,710
they still view it as an empty block
but they're not able to jump up when

960
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:12,720
but they're not able to jump up when
 

961
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,710
but they're not able to jump up when
they enter here so

962
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
they enter here so
 

963
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,710
they enter here so
they just smoothly move through like we

964
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,720
they just smoothly move through like we
 

965
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,750
they just smoothly move through like we
want

966
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:17,760
want
 

967
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:26,230
want
nice and quick get them out of the way

968
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,240

 

969
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,909

and then i just have a stream up in the

970
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:27,919
and then i just have a stream up in the
 

971
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,149
and then i just have a stream up in the
air like this so that helps to pull them

972
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
air like this so that helps to pull them
 

973
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:30,710
air like this so that helps to pull them
out as well

974
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:30,720
out as well
 

975
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,590
out as well
get them out of the way quick

976
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:35,600

 

977
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,549

uh but i think i'm gonna mess up or mess

978
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
uh but i think i'm gonna mess up or mess
 

979
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,029
uh but i think i'm gonna mess up or mess
with

980
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:39,039
with
 

981
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,630
with
the creeper separation now

982
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:42,640
the creeper separation now
 

983
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,669
the creeper separation now
i'm fairly happy with this as it is so

984
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
i'm fairly happy with this as it is so
 

985
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,230
i'm fairly happy with this as it is so
we gotta

986
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
we gotta
 

987
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,549
we gotta
try do something with ocelots

988
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:52,559

 

989
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,630

gonna figure out how big they are first

990
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
gonna figure out how big they are first
 

991
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,310
gonna figure out how big they are first
what's their size

992
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,320

 

993
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,990

uh they're taller than half a block but

994
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
uh they're taller than half a block but
 

995
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,950
uh they're taller than half a block but
shorter than one

996
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
shorter than one
 

997
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,789
shorter than one
they won't go through there

998
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:08,799

 

999
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,390

and it seems like the creeper can see

1000
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,400
and it seems like the creeper can see
 

1001
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,990
and it seems like the creeper can see
them if that just the top of their head

1002
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
them if that just the top of their head
 

1003
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,510
them if that just the top of their head
is poking out like this too

1004
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,520
is poking out like this too
 

1005
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,669
is poking out like this too
they take off

1006
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679

 

1007
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,149

and it seems like the creepers won't see

1008
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
and it seems like the creepers won't see
 

1009
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:20,710
and it seems like the creepers won't see
them

1010
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
them
 

1011
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,710
them
if they're enclosed like this they don't

1012
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:22,720
if they're enclosed like this they don't
 

1013
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,470
if they're enclosed like this they don't
run

1014
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:26,480

 

1015
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,390

you can try

1016
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,400

 

1017
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,750

they take off oh that's a cat that's not

1018
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
they take off oh that's a cat that's not
 

1019
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,190
they take off oh that's a cat that's not
what i want

1020
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
what i want
 

1021
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,390
what i want

1023
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,430

there's a reason they run ah yeah

1024
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440
there's a reason they run ah yeah
 

1025

00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:48,159
even though the line of sight isn't
 

1031
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,230
even though the line of sight isn't
there

1032

nope nope that guy did
line of sight is important with this

1038
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520
line of sight is important with this
 

1039
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,909
line of sight is important with this
he took off right when he got about here

1040
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:05,919

 

1041
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,430

okay

1042
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,440

 

1043
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,110

what we want to do here is make the

1044
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,120
what we want to do here is make the
 

1045
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,029
what we want to do here is make the
zombies go to the right

1046
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:13,039
zombies go to the right
 

1047
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,350
zombies go to the right
skeletons go straight and then creepers

1048
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
skeletons go straight and then creepers
 

1049
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,750
skeletons go straight and then creepers
go to the left so we're gonna

1050
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,760
go to the left so we're gonna
 

1051
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,669
go to the left so we're gonna
make a duplicate of this on the other

1052
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:19,679
make a duplicate of this on the other
 

1053
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,350
make a duplicate of this on the other
side

1054
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,360
side
 

1055
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,230
side
but the difference is zombies are

1056
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240
but the difference is zombies are
 

1057
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,310
but the difference is zombies are
attracted to the villager while

1058
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,320
attracted to the villager while
 

1059
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,510
attracted to the villager while
creepers are repelled by the ocelots so

1060
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
creepers are repelled by the ocelots so
 

1061
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,510
creepers are repelled by the ocelots so
we don't put the ocelot on the other

1062
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:31,520
we don't put the ocelot on the other
 

1063
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,269
we don't put the ocelot on the other
side we need it

1064
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:33,279
side we need it
 

1065
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,950
side we need it
over here by the villager so i'm going

1066
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:34,960
over here by the villager so i'm going
 

1067
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,070
over here by the villager so i'm going
to try to put him

1068
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,080

 

1069
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,710

right here diagonally

1070
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
right here diagonally
 

1071
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,430
right here diagonally
and then open this up

1072
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,440

 

1073
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,070

so they have a line of sight i'll clean

1074
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
so they have a line of sight i'll clean
 

1075
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,630
so they have a line of sight i'll clean
this up

1076
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:52,640

 

1077
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,789

and just put our villager or not a

1078
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:54,799
and just put our villager or not a
 

1079
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,230
and just put our villager or not a
villager ocelot

1080
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:56,240
villager ocelot
 

1081
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,909
villager ocelot
right over here

1082
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919

 

1083
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,789

oh boy well there's another problem now

1084
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:04,799
oh boy well there's another problem now
 

1085
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,750
oh boy well there's another problem now
these cats don't do a very good job

1086
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:07,760
these cats don't do a very good job
 

1087
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,510
these cats don't do a very good job
at what they're supposed to do most the

1088
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:09,520
at what they're supposed to do most the
 

1089
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,110
at what they're supposed to do most the
time

1090
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,120
time
 

1091
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,630
time
the creepers don't even notice them

1092
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:16,640

 

1093
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,950

i've tried positioning the ocelot in

1094
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960
i've tried positioning the ocelot in
 

1095
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,149
i've tried positioning the ocelot in
many different ways

1096
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
many different ways
 

1097
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,430
many different ways
it doesn't matter

1098
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,440
it doesn't matter
 

1099
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,830
it doesn't matter
like they have a direct line of sight

1100
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840
like they have a direct line of sight
 

1101
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,870
like they have a direct line of sight
that time where

1102
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880
that time where
 

1103
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,190
that time where
they went when they do go they want to

1104
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,200
they went when they do go they want to
 

1105
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,870
they went when they do go they want to
fight the current as well for some

1106
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:32,880
fight the current as well for some
 

1107
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,630
fight the current as well for some
reason

1108
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,640
reason
 

1109
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,870
reason
you can see the ocelots right there

1110
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:36,880
you can see the ocelots right there
 

1111
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,669
you can see the ocelots right there
direct line

1112
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:43,679

 

1113
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,750

i think i know why it's happening

1114
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
i think i know why it's happening
 

1115
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:57,590
i think i know why it's happening
there's no real good solution to it

1116
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600

 

1117
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,870

zombies still work

1118
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:04,880

 

1119
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,549

here let's sleep and i'll show you what

1120
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:06,559
here let's sleep and i'll show you what
 

1121
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,549
here let's sleep and i'll show you what
i found out here

1122
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:10,559

 

1123
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,310

um if we have

1124
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,320
um if we have
 

1125
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,470
um if we have
let's go way up here it's doing a little

1126
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,480
let's go way up here it's doing a little
 

1127
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,990
let's go way up here it's doing a little
test

1128
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,000
test
 

1129
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,269
test
if we put an ocelot on here

1130
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:21,279
if we put an ocelot on here
 

1131
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,029
if we put an ocelot on here
and a creeper right next to him

1132
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:25,039

 

1133
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:31,510

they don't run right

1134
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:31,520

 

1135
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,870

like they don't see the cat

1136
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
like they don't see the cat
 

1137
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,669
like they don't see the cat
they just killed the cat well you live

1138
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:37,679
they just killed the cat well you live
 

1139
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,230
they just killed the cat well you live
but

1140
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
but
 

1141
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,830
but
they owned them um

1142
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
they owned them um
 

1143
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,669
they owned them um
they will run occasionally

1144
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:45,679
they will run occasionally
 

1145
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,669
they will run occasionally
haven't seen it happen yet but they

1146
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:47,679
haven't seen it happen yet but they
 

1147
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,950
haven't seen it happen yet but they
should

1148
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:50,960

 

1149
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,750

there he goes lost another cat

1150
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:57,760

 

1151
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,510

the creepers seem to need a lot of space

1152
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:01,520
the creepers seem to need a lot of space
 

1153
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,669
the creepers seem to need a lot of space
for them to run

1154
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:05,679

 

1155
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,350

because if you do it where there's a lot

1156
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,360
because if you do it where there's a lot
 

1157
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,789
because if you do it where there's a lot
of ground around

1158
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:08,799
of ground around
 

1159
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:16,870
of ground around
i think the creepers run right away

1160
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:16,880

 

1161
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,029

over here they have a very small amount

1162
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039
over here they have a very small amount
 

1163
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,070
over here they have a very small amount
of space to

1164
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,080
of space to
 

1165
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,470
of space to
to work with so if they they have to

1166
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:22,480
to work with so if they they have to
 

1167
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,470
to work with so if they they have to
pick

1168
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
pick
 

1169
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,870
pick
a spot to run to and there's very little

1170
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:26,880
a spot to run to and there's very little
 

1171
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,549
a spot to run to and there's very little
choices

1172
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:28,559
choices
 

1173
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,190
choices
so most of the time their pathfinding

1174
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,200
so most of the time their pathfinding
 

1175
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,070
so most of the time their pathfinding
cancels out

1176
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,080
cancels out
 

1177
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,750
cancels out
because they don't pick a valid spot

1178
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:35,760
because they don't pick a valid spot
 

1179
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,470
because they don't pick a valid spot
when they check a big area but if

1180
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:38,480
when they check a big area but if
 

1181
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,830
when they check a big area but if
there's lots of valid spots then they

1182
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:42,840

 

1183
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,630

run

1184
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640

 

1185
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,149

all right guys that's all we're gonna do

1186
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
all right guys that's all we're gonna do
 

1187
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,750
all right guys that's all we're gonna do
with this today uh

1188
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:49,760
with this today uh
 

1189
