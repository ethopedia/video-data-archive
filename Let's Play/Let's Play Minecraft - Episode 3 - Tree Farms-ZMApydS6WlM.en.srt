anyway this episode I am going to
 

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,600
anyway this episode I am going to
dedicate to three parts we are going to

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:32,610
dedicate to three parts we are going to
 

31
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,630
dedicate to three parts we are going to
build a tree bar and talk about tree

32
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:35,640
build a tree bar and talk about tree
 

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,929
build a tree bar and talk about tree
farms

34
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:41,939

 

35
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,249

so the tree farm is going to go over

36
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:44,259
so the tree farm is going to go over
 

37
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:53,630
so the tree farm is going to go over
here ah of course

38
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:53,640

 

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,070

at least our spawn is closed because

40
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,080
at least our spawn is closed because
 

41
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:03,539
at least our spawn is closed because
that really sucked but I guess I deserve

42
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:03,549
that really sucked but I guess I deserve
 

43
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:27,199
that really sucked but I guess I deserve
that doing right no harm no foul

44
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:27,209

 

45
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:29,550

okay so our tree farm is going to go

46
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:29,560
okay so our tree farm is going to go
 

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:41,309
okay so our tree farm is going to go
over here still and so trees they take

48
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:41,319
over here still and so trees they take
 

49
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:47,460
over here still and so trees they take
about a five by five space each and I

50
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,470
about a five by five space each and I
 

51
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,770
about a five by five space each and I
usually make my tree farms the same way

52
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:49,780
usually make my tree farms the same way
 

53
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:56,220
usually make my tree farms the same way
every time we're very similar um this is

54
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,230
every time we're very similar um this is
 

55
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:11,670
every time we're very similar um this is
the pattern I do something like this

56
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
the pattern I do something like this
 

57
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,310
the pattern I do something like this
oops it's a lot easier when there's

58
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:17,320
oops it's a lot easier when there's
 

59
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:27,550
oops it's a lot easier when there's
ground underneath

60
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:27,560

 

61
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,220

oh wait I'm doing this wrong I think

62
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:33,230
oh wait I'm doing this wrong I think
 

63
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:45,190
oh wait I'm doing this wrong I think
yeah yeah so I have like a ring on the

64
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
yeah yeah so I have like a ring on the
 

65
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,630
yeah yeah so I have like a ring on the
outside of the half steps and then with

66
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:49,640
outside of the half steps and then with
 

67
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:58,479
outside of the half steps and then with
cobblestone I'll do that then I'll put a

68
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:58,489
cobblestone I'll do that then I'll put a
 

69
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:04,840
cobblestone I'll do that then I'll put a
soil block in the middle and torches on

70
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:04,850
soil block in the middle and torches on
 

71
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,979
soil block in the middle and torches on
the four corners for light and then the

72
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:08,989
the four corners for light and then the
 

73
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:13,750
the four corners for light and then the
tree sapling goes here and basically you

74
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
tree sapling goes here and basically you
 

75
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,210
tree sapling goes here and basically you
repeat that for however many trees you

76
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:16,220
repeat that for however many trees you
 

77
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,280
repeat that for however many trees you
want so I'm going to get some more

78
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,290
want so I'm going to get some more
 

79
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:26,740
want so I'm going to get some more
resources so if you don't want your

80
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:26,750
resources so if you don't want your
 

81
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,690
resources so if you don't want your
trees to grow too tall

82
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:28,700
trees to grow too tall
 

83
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,210
trees to grow too tall
like I don't like it when you get the

84
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:31,220
like I don't like it when you get the
 

85
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,570
like I don't like it when you get the
big trees all you need to do five six

86
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:36,580
big trees all you need to do five six
 

87
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,960
big trees all you need to do five six
seven is place a glass block above the

88
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:40,970
seven is place a glass block above the
 

89
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:51,040
seven is place a glass block above the
tree about seven blocks high and then

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,050
tree about seven blocks high and then
 

91
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:59,740
tree about seven blocks high and then
the tree won't grow too big

92
00:04:59,740 --> 00:04:59,750

 

93
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,820

just like that use a glass box so that

94
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:04,830
just like that use a glass box so that
 

95
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:12,830
just like that use a glass box so that
light can still reach the tree so even

96
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:12,840
light can still reach the tree so even
 

97
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,100
light can still reach the tree so even
if there's leaves above the tree here

98
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,110
if there's leaves above the tree here
 

99
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,930
if there's leaves above the tree here
these torches will allow you to plant

100
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:17,940
these torches will allow you to plant
 

101
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,290
these torches will allow you to plant
the sapling and allowed to continue

102
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:21,300
the sapling and allowed to continue
 

103
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,510
the sapling and allowed to continue
growing even though there's no sunlight

104
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
growing even though there's no sunlight
 

105
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,790
growing even though there's no sunlight
above and so I'm going to repeat that

106
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
above and so I'm going to repeat that
 

107
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,130
above and so I'm going to repeat that
pattern a few times and I'll be back

108
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:33,140
pattern a few times and I'll be back
 

109
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,060
pattern a few times and I'll be back
okay so to make a long story short I

110
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,070
okay so to make a long story short I
 

111
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,320
okay so to make a long story short I
tried to stay out all night working on

112
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,330
tried to stay out all night working on
 

113
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,400
tried to stay out all night working on
the tree farm I thought I could and then

114
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,410
the tree farm I thought I could and then
 

115
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:49,240
the tree farm I thought I could and then
I ran and then I panicked and Here I am

116
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,250

 

117
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,030

and yes I am aware of the irony of all

118
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,040
and yes I am aware of the irony of all
 

119
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:13,330
and yes I am aware of the irony of all
this oh I got him right where I want him

120
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:13,340

right we're down here at the road it's a
 

133
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,270
right we're down here at the road it's a
still dark out so I'm going to actually

134
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
still dark out so I'm going to actually
 

135
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:57,440
still dark out so I'm going to actually
make some stairs

136
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,450

 

137
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:07,350

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:23,560
that was a dumb idea and there's
 

141
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,680
that was a dumb idea and there's
probably a bunch of guys out there okay

142
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:28,690

 

143
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:35,070

now I'm going to built the wall a little

144
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,080
now I'm going to built the wall a little
 

145
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:56,760
now I'm going to built the wall a little
bit and they'll be a wall here and the

146
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:56,770
bit and they'll be a wall here and the
 

147
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:15,630
bit and they'll be a wall here and the
wall here and yeah that's a dispenser

148
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:15,640
wall here and yeah that's a dispenser
 

149
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,810
wall here and yeah that's a dispenser
that's the return system the return

150
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:18,820
that's the return system the return
 

151
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,070
that's the return system the return
system links to the dispenser and it

152
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,080
system links to the dispenser and it
 

153
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,480
system links to the dispenser and it
makes a loop I'll show more how to do

154
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:27,490
makes a loop I'll show more how to do
 

155
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:33,360
makes a loop I'll show more how to do
that another video might be day yes okay

156
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,370
that another video might be day yes okay
 

157
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,400
that another video might be day yes okay
I'm going to head up to the truth on I

158
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,410
I'm going to head up to the truth on I
 

159
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:45,610
I'm going to head up to the truth on I
think

160
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:45,620

 

161
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:54,590

and fairly safe oh and of course I get

162
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:54,600
and fairly safe oh and of course I get
 

163
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:02,270
and fairly safe oh and of course I get
no more meat now we're going to catch

164
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:02,280

169
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,870

there seems to be an issue with the mob

170
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:47,880
there seems to be an issue with the mob
 

171
00:09:47,880 --> 00:10:00,640
there seems to be an issue with the mob
trap they get stuck on the doors um yeah

172
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:00,650

 

173
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:23,440

anyway I'll even blew it up that's great

174
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,450

 

175
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,710

do a little repairs oh there's all my
stuff it is new so we're back here at

178
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
stuff it is new so we're back here at
 

179
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,949
stuff it is new so we're back here at
the tree farm I've made spots for nine

180
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
the tree farm I've made spots for nine
 

181
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,949
the tree farm I've made spots for nine
trees I think we have enough torches to

182
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:03,959
trees I think we have enough torches to
 

183
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,380
trees I think we have enough torches to
finish it but it should be good to go

184
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:06,390
finish it but it should be good to go
 

185
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:11,240
finish it but it should be good to go
anyways I put glass stoppers it above

186
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,250
anyways I put glass stoppers it above
 

187
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,180
anyways I put glass stoppers it above
every tree so the trees will stay small

188
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,190
every tree so the trees will stay small
 

189
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:22,430
every tree so the trees will stay small
and easy to harvest and so I should

190
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:22,440
and easy to harvest and so I should
 

191
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,139
and easy to harvest and so I should
probably explain a little bit about how

192
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:24,149
probably explain a little bit about how
 

193
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:28,240
probably explain a little bit about how
trees work in case you don't know

194
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,250

 

195
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,290

basically you need to be within a

196
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:30,300
basically you need to be within a
 

197
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,850
basically you need to be within a
certain range of the trees otherwise

198
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:31,860
certain range of the trees otherwise
 

199
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,280
certain range of the trees otherwise
they won't update and they won't grow I

200
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,290
they won't update and they won't grow I
 

201
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,819
they won't update and they won't grow I
think you need to be within sixty four

202
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:37,829
think you need to be within sixty four
 

203
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:41,480
think you need to be within sixty four
blocks correct me if I'm wrong of the

204
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:41,490
blocks correct me if I'm wrong of the
 

205
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,750
blocks correct me if I'm wrong of the
trees so that they'll grow so building

206
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:44,760
trees so that they'll grow so building
 

207
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,100
trees so that they'll grow so building
the tree farm in the middle of the

208
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,110
the tree farm in the middle of the
 

209
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,990
the tree farm in the middle of the
island is a good idea because I can be

210
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
island is a good idea because I can be
 

211
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,060
island is a good idea because I can be
off over there doing stuff in the trees

212
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,070
off over there doing stuff in the trees
 

213
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,650
off over there doing stuff in the trees
over here will still be growing if I

214
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:54,660
over here will still be growing if I
 

215
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,000
over here will still be growing if I
move to another Island I might make

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,010
move to another Island I might make
 

217
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,380
move to another Island I might make
another tree firm on the other Island

218
00:11:59,380 --> 00:11:59,390
another tree firm on the other Island
 

219
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:08,790
another tree firm on the other Island
but yeah what else

220
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800

 

221
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,859

you can grow trees underground if you

222
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:10,869
you can grow trees underground if you
 

223
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:14,090
you can grow trees underground if you
want as long as you have enough lighting

224
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,100
want as long as you have enough lighting
 

225
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,129
want as long as you have enough lighting
having these four torches is more than

226
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:17,139
having these four torches is more than
 

227
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:19,790
having these four torches is more than
enough light to make them grow and

228
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:19,800
enough light to make them grow and
 

229
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,049
enough light to make them grow and
you'll need it you'll need enough space

230
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:22,059
you'll need it you'll need enough space
 

231
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:26,519
you'll need it you'll need enough space
above each tree to at least I think 4

232
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:26,529
above each tree to at least I think 4
 

233
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:31,039
above each tree to at least I think 4
maybe 5 blocks is the minimum you need

234
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,049
maybe 5 blocks is the minimum you need
 

235
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:35,970
maybe 5 blocks is the minimum you need
these I have there's a seven blocks

236
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:35,980
these I have there's a seven blocks
 

237
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,939
these I have there's a seven blocks
above each tree so that's plenty of room

238
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:38,949
above each tree so that's plenty of room
 

239
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:44,579
above each tree so that's plenty of room
and they'll spread 2 blocks each so this

240
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:44,589
and they'll spread 2 blocks each so this
 

241
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,199
and they'll spread 2 blocks each so this
will be solid green when they're all

242
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:46,209
will be solid green when they're all
 

243
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:53,809
will be solid green when they're all
grown I'm hungry

244
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:53,819
grown I'm hungry
 

245
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:57,179
grown I'm hungry
come on come on give me some meat yes

246
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:57,189
come on come on give me some meat yes
 

247
00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:02,989
come on come on give me some meat yes
finally um what else

248
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:02,999
finally um what else
 

249
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:07,379
finally um what else
trees won't grow as fast if if there's

250
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:07,389
trees won't grow as fast if if there's
 

251
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:13,829
trees won't grow as fast if if there's
not enough space and I'm just doing a

252
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
not enough space and I'm just doing a
 

253
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,519
not enough space and I'm just doing a
test here I'm pretty sure trees ignore

254
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:19,529
test here I'm pretty sure trees ignore
 

255
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:23,850
test here I'm pretty sure trees ignore
half-steps so when this tree grows I

256
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:23,860
half-steps so when this tree grows I
 

257
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,139
half-steps so when this tree grows I
think it's going to destroy this half

258
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:25,149
think it's going to destroy this half
 

259
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,949
think it's going to destroy this half
step that's what I want to check out and

260
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:27,959
step that's what I want to check out and
 

261
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,530
step that's what I want to check out and
I might I'm going to place one above a

262
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:31,540
I might I'm going to place one above a
 

263
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:39,980
I might I'm going to place one above a
tree to just as a experiment

264
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:39,990

 

265
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:46,530

it's happened to me before so yeah I

266
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:46,540
it's happened to me before so yeah I
 

267
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,780
it's happened to me before so yeah I
recommend building tree farms in your

268
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:48,790
recommend building tree farms in your
 

269
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,369
recommend building tree farms in your

weird normally they grow straight and

274
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:58,860
weird normally they grow straight and
 

275
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,169
weird normally they grow straight and
you should put a fence around your tree

276
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:01,179
you should put a fence around your tree
 

277
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:04,909
you should put a fence around your tree
farm I'll do that some other time and

00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:08,709
it's good to have an entrance the place
 

281
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:15,989
it's good to have an entrance the place
to store tree saplings and oh boy and a
