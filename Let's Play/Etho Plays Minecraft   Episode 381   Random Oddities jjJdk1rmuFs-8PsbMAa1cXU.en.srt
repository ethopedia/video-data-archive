shepard fletcher

600
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200

 

601
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,509

um so between the classes i think it's

602
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
um so between the classes i think it's
 

603
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,030
um so between the classes i think it's
probably equal probability

604
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
probably equal probability
 

605
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,030
probably equal probability
but then when you have like this the

606
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
but then when you have like this the
 

607
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,790
but then when you have like this the
brown coat class there's four different

608
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
brown coat class there's four different
 

609
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,750
brown coat class there's four different
ones in that

610
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
ones in that
 

611
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,790
ones in that
so it's probably really rare

612
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
so it's probably really rare
 

613
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,509
so it's probably really rare
to get one one specifically in that but

614
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519
to get one one specifically in that but
 

615
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,870
to get one one specifically in that but
also

616
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
also
 

617
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,910
also
i think it's favored more

618
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
i think it's favored more
 

619
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,710
i think it's favored more
towards the other three than farmer

620
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
towards the other three than farmer
 

621
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,389

but uh
maybe just a little bit let's

710
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
maybe just a little bit let's
 

711
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,910
maybe just a little bit let's
let's see i gotta mirror this onto this

712
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:35,920
let's see i gotta mirror this onto this
 

713
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,030
let's see i gotta mirror this onto this
side obviously

714
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
side obviously
 

715
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,430
side obviously
but i also wanted to try

716
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
but i also wanted to try
 

717
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,829
but i also wanted to try
mirror this to the left side of this

718
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
mirror this to the left side of this
 

719
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,269
mirror this to the left side of this
um not not identically but sort of the

720
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
um not not identically but sort of the
 

721
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,550
um not not identically but sort of the
same thing

722
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
same thing
 

723
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,629
same thing
let's make more of these compartments

724
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
let's make more of these compartments
 

725
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,430
let's make more of these compartments
down here perhaps

726
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
down here perhaps
 

727
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,790
down here perhaps
oh yeah and i brought some flower pots

728
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
oh yeah and i brought some flower pots
 

729

oh yeah and i brought some flower pots
let's let's set these up just gonna put

730
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
let's let's set these up just gonna put
 

731
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,189
let's let's set these up just gonna put
these just in the corners

732
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
these just in the corners
 

733
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,150
these just in the corners
like that uh i looked at the comments on

734
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
like that uh i looked at the comments on
 

735
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,910
like that uh i looked at the comments on
last episode

736
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920
last episode
 

737
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,230
last episode
i asked for suggestions on the windows

738
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,240
i asked for suggestions on the windows
 

739
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,990
i asked for suggestions on the windows
here and uh somebody said

740
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
here and uh somebody said
 

741
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,110
here and uh somebody said
bricks like normal uh

742
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
bricks like normal uh
 

743
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,189
bricks like normal uh
the red bricks you know yeah i think

744
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
the red bricks you know yeah i think
 

745
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,230
the red bricks you know yeah i think
that might be cool

746
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
that might be cool
 

747
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,150
that might be cool
i'll try that out i don't have any uh

748
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
i'll try that out i don't have any uh
 

749
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,150
i'll try that out i don't have any uh
right now though i'll have to go make

750
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,160
right now though i'll have to go make
 

751
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,430
right now though i'll have to go make
some

752
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
some
 

753
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,590
some
um maybe another another episode

754
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
um maybe another another episode
 

755
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,470
um maybe another another episode
actually because uh

756
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
actually because uh
 

757
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,509
actually because uh
i'll have to go farm some clay and stuff

758
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:29,519
i'll have to go farm some clay and stuff
 

759
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,629
i'll have to go farm some clay and stuff
but maybe

760
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:32,639
but maybe
 

761
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,670
but maybe
we will start it here

762
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:35,680
we will start it here
 

763
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,590
we will start it here
no no this has to go in one

764
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600

 

765
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,350

let's see those are four wide if i

766
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
let's see those are four wide if i
 

767
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,790
let's see those are four wide if i
if i remember correctly yeah four wide

768
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
if i remember correctly yeah four wide
 

769
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,990
if i remember correctly yeah four wide
so this will be oak

770
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
so this will be oak
 

771
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,749
so this will be oak
and i'm just going to try to figure this

772
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
and i'm just going to try to figure this
 

773
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,350
and i'm just going to try to figure this
out and then i will do it off

774
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
out and then i will do it off
 

775
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,350
out and then i will do it off
camera but maybe like this

776
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
camera but maybe like this
 

777
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,389
camera but maybe like this
and it goes three high right

778
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:02,399

 

779
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,949

is that gonna work out so the beam i

780
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
is that gonna work out so the beam i
 

781
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,029
is that gonna work out so the beam i
guess would be down here

782
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039
guess would be down here
 

783
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,909
guess would be down here
that might not be good

784
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:11,919

 

785
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,350

ah oh and this is raised here too so how

786
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
ah oh and this is raised here too so how
 

787
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,549
ah oh and this is raised here too so how
would that work out

788
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:16,559
would that work out
 

789
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,789
would that work out
because this would come over and then it

790
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
because this would come over and then it
 

791
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,909
because this would come over and then it
goes down that

792
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
goes down that
 

793
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,549
goes down that
actually might be cool

794
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559

 

795
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,429

if it's like this we could put carpet

796
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
if it's like this we could put carpet
 

797
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,350
if it's like this we could put carpet
here

798
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
here
 

799
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,350
here
give it some more color

800
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
give it some more color
 

801
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,950
give it some more color
ah this might be okay so here it is

802
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:36,960
ah this might be okay so here it is
 

803
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,870
ah this might be okay so here it is
with all those changes in place this is

804
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
with all those changes in place this is
 

805
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,470
with all those changes in place this is
what the library is looking like

806
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
what the library is looking like
 

807
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,070
what the library is looking like
now i think that's pretty good right

808
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
now i think that's pretty good right
 

809
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,630
now i think that's pretty good right
we got some walls going on it's like

810
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
we got some walls going on it's like
 

811
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,830
we got some walls going on it's like
enclosed

812
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:47,840
enclosed
 

813
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,909
enclosed
enclosing us trapping us inside

814
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
enclosing us trapping us inside
 

815
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,150
enclosing us trapping us inside
like a proper building should i think

816
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
like a proper building should i think
 

817
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,150
like a proper building should i think
that's i think that's pretty good

818
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
that's i think that's pretty good
 

819
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,750
that's i think that's pretty good
so i need to decide what to do with this

820
00:17:59,750 --> 00:17:59,760
so i need to decide what to do with this
 

821
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,070
so i need to decide what to do with this
section here yeah i was originally

822
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
section here yeah i was originally
 

823
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,549
section here yeah i was originally
planning on putting a window there

824
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
planning on putting a window there
 

825
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,990
planning on putting a window there
like you come up the stairs and there's

826
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
like you come up the stairs and there's
 

827
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,909
like you come up the stairs and there's
a window that's not really going to work

828
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:07,919
a window that's not really going to work
 

829
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,590
a window that's not really going to work
now i don't think cause

830
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:09,600
now i don't think cause
 

831
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,950
now i don't think cause
for one thing we we got these

832
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
for one thing we we got these
 

833
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,430
for one thing we we got these
bookshelves here

834
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
bookshelves here
 

835
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,510
bookshelves here
um which we can't really cover

836
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
um which we can't really cover
 

837
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,549
um which we can't really cover
if this is a window um the

838
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559
if this is a window um the
 

839
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,750
if this is a window um the
other thing is we probably need to put a

840
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
other thing is we probably need to put a
 

841
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,830
other thing is we probably need to put a
staircase back here somewhere

842
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
staircase back here somewhere
 

843
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,510
staircase back here somewhere
because like look at the shape this is

844
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:27,520
because like look at the shape this is
 

845
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,510
because like look at the shape this is
making um

846
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
making um
 

847

yeah this section here is lower than
that one so there'll probably be a

852
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
that one so there'll probably be a
 

853
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,870
that one so there'll probably be a
staircase
