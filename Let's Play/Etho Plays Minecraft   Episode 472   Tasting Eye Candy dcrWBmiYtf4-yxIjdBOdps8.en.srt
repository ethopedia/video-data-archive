brought up the idea last episode of
 

35
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,150
brought up the idea last episode of
maybe trying out a texture pack

36
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
maybe trying out a texture pack
 

37
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,830
maybe trying out a texture pack
just to see the world from a different

39
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,470

different here with the texture pack

48
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
different here with the texture pack
 

49
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,910
different here with the texture pack
and i brought it up last time you guys

50
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
and i brought it up last time you guys
 

51
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,590
and i brought it up last time you guys
seemed okay with it

52
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600

00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
if you are you missed your chance you
 

59
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,870

check out
 

65
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,789
check out
shaders so we're going to be doing that

66
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
shaders so we're going to be doing that
 

67
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,830

or much of our world uh checking out
 

79
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,310
or much of our world uh checking out
shaders checking out texture packs

80
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
shaders checking out texture packs
 

81
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,350
shaders checking out texture packs
it's gonna be hard to to really see much

82
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
it's gonna be hard to to really see much

thing
 

177
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,749
thing
fun thing to do here so this is the

178
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
fun thing to do here so this is the
 

179
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,270
fun thing to do here so this is the
silders

180
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
silders
 

181
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,749
silders
vibrant shaders that's what i recorded

182
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
vibrant shaders that's what i recorded
 

183
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,790
vibrant shaders that's what i recorded
the video in and

184
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
the video in and
 

185
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,710
the video in and
that's what we're on right now i've

186
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
that's what we're on right now i've
 

187
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,550
that's what we're on right now i've
tried a few different shaders i'm not

188
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
tried a few different shaders i'm not
 

189
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,189
tried a few different shaders i'm not
super accustomed to them but of all the

190
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
super accustomed to them but of all the
 

191
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,790
super accustomed to them but of all the
ones i've tried this one's definitely my

192
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
ones i've tried this one's definitely my
 

193
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,670
ones i've tried this one's definitely my
favorite

194
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
favorite
 

195
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,150
favorite
it gives it uh it like boosts the

196
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
it gives it uh it like boosts the
 

197
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,510
it gives it uh it like boosts the
saturation of all the

198
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
saturation of all the
 

199
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,990
saturation of all the
all the colors which gives it more of a

200
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
all the colors which gives it more of a
 

201
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,029
all the colors which gives it more of a
cartoony look

202
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
cartoony look
 

203
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,710
cartoony look
instead of a realistic look i would say

204
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
instead of a realistic look i would say
 

205
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,749
instead of a realistic look i would say
and in my opinion maybe we'll talk about

206
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
and in my opinion maybe we'll talk about
 

207
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,629
and in my opinion maybe we'll talk about
some of the high

208
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
some of the high
 

209
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,430
some of the high
high points and low points of shaders so

210
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
high points and low points of shaders so
 

211
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,310
high points and low points of shaders so
in my opinion

212
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320

 

213
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,430

everything above ground in the sunlight

214
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
everything above ground in the sunlight
 

215
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,909
everything above ground in the sunlight
like where we are right now looks pretty

216
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
like where we are right now looks pretty
 

217
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,909
like where we are right now looks pretty
incredible i would say

218
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
incredible i would say
 

219
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,590
incredible i would say
i i like it a lot uh personally um

220
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
i i like it a lot uh personally um
 

221
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,870
i i like it a lot uh personally um
especially like when you look at the

222
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
especially like when you look at the
 

223
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,830
especially like when you look at the
windmill here it's it's just incredible

224
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
windmill here it's it's just incredible
 

225
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,790
windmill here it's it's just incredible
like the

226
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
like the
 

227
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,870
like the
the amount of colors and stuff and the

228
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
the amount of colors and stuff and the
 

229
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,550
the amount of colors and stuff and the
brightness to it it's just

230
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
brightness to it it's just
 

231
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,950
brightness to it it's just
looks pretty good but now there's a lot

232
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
looks pretty good but now there's a lot
 

233
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,150
looks pretty good but now there's a lot
of down

234
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
of down
 

235
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,830
of down
downsides to shaders like you can see on

236
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
downsides to shaders like you can see on
 

237
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,430
downsides to shaders like you can see on
the windmill there there's a weird

238
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
the windmill there there's a weird
 

239
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,230
the windmill there there's a weird
shadow

240
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
shadow
 

241
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,629
shadow
jumping around that's from the beacon

242
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
jumping around that's from the beacon
 

243
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,230
jumping around that's from the beacon
over there which you can't really see

244
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
over there which you can't really see
 

245
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,749
over there which you can't really see
because the sun's too bright

246
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
because the sun's too bright
 

247
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,870
because the sun's too bright
and there's a couple issues

248
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
and there's a couple issues
 

249
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,150
and there's a couple issues
um i have with shaders um

250
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
um i have with shaders um
 

251
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,150
um i have with shaders um
especially when you go underground

252
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
especially when you go underground
 

253
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,430
especially when you go underground
things get really

254
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
things get really
 

255
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,189
things get really
dark but in the trees here for example

256
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
dark but in the trees here for example
 

257
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,670
dark but in the trees here for example
oh man this looks beautiful

258
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
oh man this looks beautiful
 

259
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,390
oh man this looks beautiful
absolutely gorgeous i don't use that

260
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
absolutely gorgeous i don't use that
 

261
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,350
absolutely gorgeous i don't use that
word too often

262
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
word too often
 

263
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,590
word too often
but i would use it here and i couldn't

264
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
but i would use it here and i couldn't
 

265
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,550
but i would use it here and i couldn't
believe like i was

266
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
believe like i was
 

267
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,150
believe like i was
just looking at the course fruit here

268
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
just looking at the course fruit here
 

269
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,390
just looking at the course fruit here
for example like that

270
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
for example like that
 

271
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,070
for example like that
i just stared at it and it's like man

272
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
i just stared at it and it's like man
 

273
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,550
i just stared at it and it's like man
that looks incredible for some reason

274
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
that looks incredible for some reason
 

275
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,749
that looks incredible for some reason
i don't know how they do it but yeah

276
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
i don't know how they do it but yeah
 

277
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,189
i don't know how they do it but yeah
something as simple as course fruit even

278
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
something as simple as course fruit even
 

279
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,469
something as simple as course fruit even
looks amazing

280
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
looks amazing
 

281
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,390
looks amazing
or if you stare at a block it just seems

282
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
or if you stare at a block it just seems
 

283
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,670
or if you stare at a block it just seems
like so much more detailed

284
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
like so much more detailed
 

285
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,270
like so much more detailed
so yeah that that's the good to it

286
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
so yeah that that's the good to it
 

287
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,710
so yeah that that's the good to it
the bad is like weird shadows

288
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
the bad is like weird shadows
 

289
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,230
the bad is like weird shadows
uh darkness underground if you use

290
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
uh darkness underground if you use
 

291
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,990
uh darkness underground if you use
shaders you kind of have to start your

292
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
shaders you kind of have to start your
 

293
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,749
shaders you kind of have to start your
world using shaders you can't just

294
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
world using shaders you can't just
 

295
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,870
world using shaders you can't just
convert to them because then

296
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
convert to them because then
 

297
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,990
convert to them because then
certain things aren't going to look

298
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
certain things aren't going to look
 

299
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,870
certain things aren't going to look
right i would say

300
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
right i would say
 

301
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,189
right i would say
but like anything in the man cave i

302
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
but like anything in the man cave i
 

303
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,870
but like anything in the man cave i
thought looked pretty bad

304
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
thought looked pretty bad
 

305
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,230
thought looked pretty bad
anything underground

306
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240

 

307
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,150

but here let's check out some of these

308
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
but here let's check out some of these
 

309
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,749
but here let's check out some of these
other shaders as well i got two more

310
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
other shaders as well i got two more
 

311
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,230
other shaders as well i got two more
loaded up soos and mr meeps

312
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
loaded up soos and mr meeps
 

313
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,270
loaded up soos and mr meeps
this is the seuss one and this

314
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
this is the seuss one and this
 

315
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,950
this is the seuss one and this
i believe is made by the guy that

316
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
i believe is made by the guy that
 

317
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,550
i believe is made by the guy that
actually made the shaders mod

318
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560

 

319
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,670

and it's a pretty pretty high-tech one

320
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
and it's a pretty pretty high-tech one
 

321
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,950
and it's a pretty pretty high-tech one
as well like i think it's the one that

322
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
as well like i think it's the one that
 

323
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,589
as well like i think it's the one that
leads all the super fancy technical

324
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
leads all the super fancy technical
 

325
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,510
leads all the super fancy technical
stuff with reflections and water

326
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
stuff with reflections and water
 

327
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,390
stuff with reflections and water
and advanced technique i don't know what

328
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
and advanced technique i don't know what
 

329
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,070
and advanced technique i don't know what
i'm talking about

330
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
i'm talking about
 

331
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,150
i'm talking about
uh but uh for me

332
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160

 

333
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,309

it looks it looks okay i like the sky in

334
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
it looks it looks okay i like the sky in
 

335
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,950
it looks it looks okay i like the sky in
it the sky looks very realistic

336
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
it the sky looks very realistic
 

337
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,830
it the sky looks very realistic
uh but i find uh there's like a haze in

338
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
uh but i find uh there's like a haze in
 

339
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,270
uh but i find uh there's like a haze in
front of you at all times i played with

340
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
front of you at all times i played with
 

341
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,710
front of you at all times i played with
the settings a lot and i just can't seem

342

longer work correctly well we'll try it

520
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
longer work correctly well we'll try it
 

521
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,710
longer work correctly well we'll try it
hopefully it's good oh

522
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
hopefully it's good oh
 

523
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,829
hopefully it's good oh
whoa okay

524
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
whoa okay
 

525
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,590
whoa okay
uh that made a bigger bigger difference

526
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
uh that made a bigger bigger difference
 

527
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,949
uh that made a bigger bigger difference
than i expected actually

528
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959

 

529
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,069

so so yeah it tries to retain

530
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079
so so yeah it tries to retain
 

531
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,870
so so yeah it tries to retain
the texture it's just a 32 by 32 instead

532
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
the texture it's just a 32 by 32 instead
 

533
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,630
the texture it's just a 32 by 32 instead
of 16 by 16.

534
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
of 16 by 16.
 

535
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,110
of 16 by 16.
so it has to fill in uh all these extra

536
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
so it has to fill in uh all these extra
 

537
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,350
so it has to fill in uh all these extra
pixels and it smooths out the

538
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
pixels and it smooths out the
 

539
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,470
pixels and it smooths out the
the textures idea i believe so the wood

540
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
the textures idea i believe so the wood
 

541
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,990
the textures idea i believe so the wood

there it is resource pack
 

655
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,030
there it is resource pack
so that's the faithful texture pack uh

656
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
so that's the faithful texture pack uh
 

657
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,710
so that's the faithful texture pack uh
it definitely has some high points and

658
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
it definitely has some high points and
 

659
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,310
it definitely has some high points and
some low points i would say

660
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
some low points i would say
 

661
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,629
some low points i would say
i think i would prefer using vanilla

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,790
try b dubs let's see this one
triton 128 so this is a high

672
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
triton 128 so this is a high
 

673
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,470
triton 128 so this is a high
super high detailed one hopefully it

674
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
super high detailed one hopefully it
 

675
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,910
super high detailed one hopefully it
works and it's for 1.9

676
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
works and it's for 1.9
 

677
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,030
works and it's for 1.9
whoa

678
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040

 

679
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,110

okay now this is this is pretty major

680
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
okay now this is this is pretty major
 

681
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,430
okay now this is this is pretty major
oh even the sound's different too

682
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440

 

683
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,350

okay okay

684
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
okay okay
 

685
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,310
okay okay
i'm lost for words now i got nothing um

686
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,320

 

687
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,389

see this looks pretty well

688
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399

 

689
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,629

i'm not sure like i love i love this

690
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
i'm not sure like i love i love this
 

691
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,910
i'm not sure like i love i love this
texture

692
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
texture
 

693
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,990
texture
but it doesn't work with this uh spruce

694
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
but it doesn't work with this uh spruce
 

695
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,350
but it doesn't work with this uh spruce
wood right like

696
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
wood right like
 

697
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,110
wood right like
you can build things but then when you

698
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,120
you can build things but then when you
 

699
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,710
you can build things but then when you
change texture packs it

700
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
change texture packs it
 

701
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,509
change texture packs it
it just doesn't work anymore because

702
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
it just doesn't work anymore because
 

703
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,430
it just doesn't work anymore because
it's

704
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
it's
 

705
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,069
it's
yeah like if i built something with this

706
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
yeah like if i built something with this
 

707
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,350
yeah like if i built something with this
texture pack it would probably look

708
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:11,360
texture pack it would probably look
 

709
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,750
texture pack it would probably look
really good

710
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
really good
 

711
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,150
really good
but to take an existing build none of

712
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
but to take an existing build none of
 

713
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,509
but to take an existing build none of
the blocks are going to really work

714
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
the blocks are going to really work
 

715
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,670
the blocks are going to really work
together like they do in vanilla

716
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
together like they do in vanilla
 

717
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,030
together like they do in vanilla
and i think that's a problem you have

718
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
and i think that's a problem you have
 

719
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,030
and i think that's a problem you have
with most texture packs

720
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
with most texture packs
 

721
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,710
with most texture packs
like this room this looks crazy

722
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
like this room this looks crazy
 

723
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,470
like this room this looks crazy
not that any of these are really bad

724
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
not that any of these are really bad
 

725
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,030
not that any of these are really bad
textures it just looks weird right

726
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
textures it just looks weird right
 

727
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,030
textures it just looks weird right
okay that's that's pretty fancy the

728
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
okay that's that's pretty fancy the
 

729
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,430
okay that's that's pretty fancy the
glowstone

730
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
glowstone
 

731
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,550
glowstone
i like that a lot

732
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560

 

733
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,629

uh we got like droopy leaves hanging

734
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
uh we got like droopy leaves hanging
 

735
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,910
uh we got like droopy leaves hanging
down here

736
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
down here
 

737
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,150
down here
uh the water is nice and blue

738
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160

 

739
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,389

uh-huh as we go through the texture

740
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
uh-huh as we go through the texture
 

741
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,230
uh-huh as we go through the texture
packs here let me know what you guys

742

say you like vanilla more and then say
what what which of the texture packs do

750
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
what what which of the texture packs do
 

751
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,590
what what which of the texture packs do
you like

752
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600

um this one's interesting it's
definitely interesting

760
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
definitely interesting
 

761
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,790
definitely interesting
but we will we will try a new one here

762
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
but we will we will try a new one here
 

763
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,870
but we will we will try a new one here
should we go for b-dubs let's do b-dubs

764
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:14,880
should we go for b-dubs let's do b-dubs
 

765

b-dubs
 

769
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,990
b-dubs
i am worried it's not going to work with

770
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000
i am worried it's not going to work with
 

771
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,150
i am worried it's not going to work with
our existing builds but we will

772
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,160
our existing builds but we will
 

773
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,430
our existing builds but we will
see

774
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440

 

775
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,310

oh hey actually you know that that
 

777
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,030
oh hey actually you know that that
turned out better than i expected

00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040
turned out better than i expected
 

779
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,710
turned out better than i expected

00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
stone looks good um our lamps here don't
 

783
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,670
stone looks good um our lamps here don't
really work though because they're

784
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
really work though because they're
 

785
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,430
really work though because they're
totally covered up with his uh

786
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
totally covered up with his uh
 

787
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,550
totally covered up with his uh
different trap doors but like

788
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
different trap doors but like
 

789
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,870
different trap doors but like
these work very well if you build with

790
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:46,880
these work very well if you build with
 

791
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,670
these work very well if you build with
them

792
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
them
 

793
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,470
them
um and let's see

794
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
um and let's see
 

795
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,230
um and let's see
yeah he's got like variations in the

796
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,240
yeah he's got like variations in the
 

797
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,230
yeah he's got like variations in the
grass

798
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,240
grass
 

799
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,269
grass
his water looks really good i do like

800
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
his water looks really good i do like
 

801
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,110
his water looks really good i do like
his water if there was one texture i

802
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
his water if there was one texture i
 

803
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,870
his water if there was one texture i
could change in the main game

804
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:02,880
could change in the main game
 

805
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,710
could change in the main game
it would be the water i hate the blue

806
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
it would be the water i hate the blue
 

807
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,990
it would be the water i hate the blue
water

808
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000
water
 

809
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,150
water
like i really don't like it i keep

810
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,160
like i really don't like it i keep
 

811
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,150
like i really don't like it i keep
hoping like they changed the lava

812
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
hoping like they changed the lava
 

813
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,510
hoping like they changed the lava
texture

814
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,520
texture
 

815
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,630
texture
uh not super long ago they made it the

816
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
uh not super long ago they made it the
 

817
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,829
uh not super long ago they made it the
the cheese i keep hoping they'll do the

818
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839
the cheese i keep hoping they'll do the
 

819
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,470
the cheese i keep hoping they'll do the
same with

820
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
same with
 

821
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,110
same with
the water they'll change it to something

822
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,120
the water they'll change it to something
 

823
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,549
the water they'll change it to something
better looking

824
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
better looking
 

825
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,949
better looking
that looks nice that's pretty good right

826
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
that looks nice that's pretty good right
 

827
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,549
that looks nice that's pretty good right
i like this one now i am a little bit

828
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
i like this one now i am a little bit
 

829
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,549
i like this one now i am a little bit
impartial on this one because b dubs is

830
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
impartial on this one because b dubs is
 

831
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,230
impartial on this one because b dubs is
my buddy

832
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
my buddy
 

833
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,070
my buddy
but i do actually think it looks good

834
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,080
but i do actually think it looks good
 

835
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,950
but i do actually think it looks good
right i think you did a good job on it

836
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
right i think you did a good job on it
 

837
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,190
right i think you did a good job on it
uh it actually works pretty well with

838
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,200
uh it actually works pretty well with
 

839
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,029
uh it actually works pretty well with
our existing build here even

840

that is we should go look at

854
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
that is we should go look at
 

855
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,270
that is we should go look at
sandy city up above um

856
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
sandy city up above um
 

857
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,270
sandy city up above um
probably the highlights of his pack

858

oh yeah that's so you have to build a

878
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
oh yeah that's so you have to build a
 

879
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,830
oh yeah that's so you have to build a
width

880

width
 

881
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,510

with these textures otherwise if you

882
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
with these textures otherwise if you
 

883
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,510
with these textures otherwise if you
take an existing build like our

884
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
take an existing build like our
 

885
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,830

i saw one episode of his where he talked
 

893
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,270
i saw one episode of his where he talked
about the wheat texture here how it was

about the wheat texture here how it was
 

895
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,990
about the wheat texture here how it was
too bright

896

too neon yellow it could be he
 

899
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,669
too neon yellow it could be he
he updated it for himself and not for

you've changed it already
you should change it again uh-huh or

910
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
you should change it again uh-huh or
 

911
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,190
you should change it again uh-huh or
update your pack

912
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
update your pack
 

913

this is uh too gray i would say

918
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,200
this is uh too gray i would say
 

919
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,669
this is uh too gray i would say
otherwise uh looks pretty good

920

939
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,190

oh is it not supported most of these

940
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
oh is it not supported most of these
 

941
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,870
oh is it not supported most of these
actually look like normal

942
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
actually look like normal
 

943
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,190
actually look like normal
next normal textures except for the

944
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
next normal textures except for the
 

945
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,230

smith it says legacy models so maybe

956
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
smith it says legacy models so maybe
 

957
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,029
smith it says legacy models so maybe
it's just like a model pack

958
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
it's just like a model pack
 

959
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,029
it's just like a model pack
i don't know i might not have grabbed

960
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
i don't know i might not have grabbed
 

961
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,549
i don't know i might not have grabbed
the right thing though

962
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
the right thing though
 

963
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,510
the right thing though
so we're going to try ozo craft here now

964
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,520
so we're going to try ozo craft here now
 

965
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,070
so we're going to try ozo craft here now
and

966
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,080
and
 

967
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,430
and
this one i believe is a 32 by 32

968
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,440
this one i believe is a 32 by 32
 

969
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,190
this one i believe is a 32 by 32
it looks kind of uh interesting

970
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
it looks kind of uh interesting
 

971
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,149
it looks kind of uh interesting
maybe we will uh talk objectively about

972
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
maybe we will uh talk objectively about
 

973
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,230
maybe we will uh talk objectively about
texture packs for a moment here so what

974
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
texture packs for a moment here so what
 

975
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,950
texture packs for a moment here so what
what i think they should all strive to

976
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:12,960
what i think they should all strive to
 

977
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,270
what i think they should all strive to
do

978
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,280
do
 

979
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,549
do
including the vanilla textures is you

980
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
including the vanilla textures is you
 

981
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,029
including the vanilla textures is you
want

982
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
want
 

983
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,710
want
you want textures that work well with

984
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
you want textures that work well with
 

985
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,310
you want textures that work well with
each other that kind of blend

986
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:20,320
each other that kind of blend
 

987
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,950
each other that kind of blend
blend together so for example the past

988
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:22,960
blend together so for example the past
 

989
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,830

we had here was

990
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
we had here was
 

991
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,430
we had here was
three very similar textures

992
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,440
three very similar textures
 

993
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,830
three very similar textures
in the vanilla texture pack in this one

994
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840
in the vanilla texture pack in this one
 

995
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,830
in the vanilla texture pack in this one
they're like all over the place

996
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
they're like all over the place
 

997
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,310
they're like all over the place
so we got like different textures uh

998
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
so we got like different textures uh
 

999
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,630
so we got like different textures uh
these two colors are about the same

1000
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:36,640
these two colors are about the same
 

1001
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,390
these two colors are about the same
textures are widely different this color

1002
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
textures are widely different this color
 

1003
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,149
textures are widely different this color
is different uh certain things

1004
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,159
is different uh certain things
 

1005
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,590
is different uh certain things
do work pretty good with this one like

1006
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:41,600
do work pretty good with this one like
 

1007
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,430
do work pretty good with this one like
the wood and the grass are nice together

1008
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,440
