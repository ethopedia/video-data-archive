let's just take a quick look through

152
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
let's just take a quick look through
 

153
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,910
let's just take a quick look through
here my concern is

154
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
here my concern is
 

155
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,030
here my concern is
like they nerfed the bows

156
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
like they nerfed the bows
 

157
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,430
like they nerfed the bows
uh people probably won't be flying with

158
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
uh people probably won't be flying with
 

159
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,670
uh people probably won't be flying with
bows anymore because the fireworks are

160
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
bows anymore because the fireworks are
 

161
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,750
bows anymore because the fireworks are
way better for flying

162
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
way better for flying
 

163
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,869
way better for flying
but they might decide that hey we gotta

164
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
but they might decide that hey we gotta
 

165
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,550
but they might decide that hey we gotta
nerf this as well

166
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
nerf this as well
 

167
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,149
nerf this as well
and if they do that they'll have nerfed

168
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
and if they do that they'll have nerfed

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
them here is the tree farm
 

195
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,350
them here is the tree farm
so this is what it looks like with no

196
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
so this is what it looks like with no
 

197
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,869
so this is what it looks like with no
trees in here

198
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
trees in here
 

199
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,589
trees in here
it's kind of crazy uh for the longest

200
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
it's kind of crazy uh for the longest
 

201
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,270
it's kind of crazy uh for the longest
time i wanted to

202
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
time i wanted to
 

203
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,190
time i wanted to
finish the roof in here so we had like a

204

finish the roof in here so we had like a
 

205
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,430
finish the roof in here so we had like a
section of about like that done

206
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
section of about like that done
 

207
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,350
section of about like that done
uh and i wanted to copy this pattern

208
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
uh and i wanted to copy this pattern
 

209
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,789
uh and i wanted to copy this pattern
over to the rest of it and i

210
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
over to the rest of it and i
 

211
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,190
over to the rest of it and i
finally did it and i think it looks

212
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
finally did it and i think it looks
 

213
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,990
finally did it and i think it looks
pretty cool right

214
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
pretty cool right
 

215
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,750
pretty cool right

217
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,509
i tried to do it as random as i could
and i really like that pattern i might

218
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
and i really like that pattern i might
 

219
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,830
and i really like that pattern i might
do it more in the future

220
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
do it more in the future
 

221
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,670
do it more in the future
before it was just these little squares

222
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
before it was just these little squares
 

223
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,750

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
i changed this over to path blocks
 

293
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,629
i changed this over to path blocks
instead of the grass

294
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
instead of the grass
 

295
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,590
instead of the grass
it's much better right i think that's

296
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
it's much better right i think that's
 

297
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,189
it's much better right i think that's
what we should do so i'm gonna

298
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
what we should do so i'm gonna
 

299
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,950

switch it over it's

302
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
switch it over it's
 

303
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,110
switch it over it's
it it doesn't uh stand out quite as much

304
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
it it doesn't uh stand out quite as much
 

305
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,230
it it doesn't uh stand out quite as much
that way it's more

306
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
that way it's more
 

307
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,749
that way it's more
within line of the colors we've used

308
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
within line of the colors we've used
 

309
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,430
within line of the colors we've used
yeah there we go that's a lot better i

310
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
yeah there we go that's a lot better i
 

311
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,790
yeah there we go that's a lot better i
think

312

think
 

313
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,510
think
we'll go with that for now also let's

314
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
we'll go with that for now also let's
 

315
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,029
we'll go with that for now also let's
try to change out the glass here

316
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
try to change out the glass here
 

317
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,870
try to change out the glass here
since we got rid of the green the green

grass let's change the green glass
we'll turn it either yellow or orange

322
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
we'll turn it either yellow or orange
 

323
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,670
we'll turn it either yellow or orange
probably look good um

324
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
probably look good um
 

325
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,950
probably look good um
yellow versus

326
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
yellow versus
 

327
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,790
yellow versus
orange i'm thinking orange is gonna be

328
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
orange i'm thinking orange is gonna be
 

329
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,710
orange i'm thinking orange is gonna be
the one because we have all these magma

330
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
the one because we have all these magma
 

331
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,950
the one because we have all these magma
blocks right

332
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960

up to us in the middle here stand on a
 

381
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,150
up to us in the middle here stand on a
trapdoor and you can pick it up through

382
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
trapdoor and you can pick it up through
 

383
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,189
trapdoor and you can pick it up through
it

384
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
it
 

385
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,670
it
and i just let's hop down below

386
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680

 

387
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,870

you see that we have oh totally missed

388
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
you see that we have oh totally missed
 

389
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,510
you see that we have oh totally missed
everything

390
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
everything
 

391
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,110
everything
let's go back up now it's not perfect

392
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
let's go back up now it's not perfect
 

393
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,070
let's go back up now it's not perfect
you see all the xp

394
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
you see all the xp
 

395
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,270
you see all the xp
on the on the ice here

396
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
on the on the ice here
 

397
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,469
on the on the ice here
might do something about that still uh

398
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
might do something about that still uh
 

399
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,309
might do something about that still uh
it's because it's shooting the zombie

400
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
it's because it's shooting the zombie
 

401
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,790
it's because it's shooting the zombie
pigman with the slime launchers before

402
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
pigman with the slime launchers before
 

403
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,350
pigman with the slime launchers before
everything

404
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
everything
 

405
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,110
everything
settles i believe and when it does that

406
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
settles i believe and when it does that
 

407
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,029
settles i believe and when it does that
the xp doesn't always travel the same

408
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
the xp doesn't always travel the same
 

409
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,150
the xp doesn't always travel the same
distance

410
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
distance
 

411
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,070
distance
so you got to let xd settle before you

412
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
so you got to let xd settle before you
 

413
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,909
so you got to let xd settle before you
push it you see how it pushes it like

414
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
push it you see how it pushes it like
 

415
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:24,390
push it you see how it pushes it like
that

416
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
that
 

417
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,469
that
right to the middle usually it's fine

418
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
right to the middle usually it's fine
 

419
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,230
right to the middle usually it's fine
but over time

420
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
but over time
 

421
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,270
but over time
a lot of it does end up on the ice here

422
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
a lot of it does end up on the ice here
 

423
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,390
a lot of it does end up on the ice here
but i'm okay with that and then the rest

424
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
but i'm okay with that and then the rest
 

425
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,150
but i'm okay with that and then the rest
of it it goes up like that

426
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
of it it goes up like that
 

427
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,629
of it it goes up like that
we got two launchers on the way um

428
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
we got two launchers on the way um
 

429
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,230
we got two launchers on the way um
you see there's no wires connected to

430
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
you see there's no wires connected to
 

431
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,309
you see there's no wires connected to
them they're they're independent

432
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
them they're they're independent
 

433
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,749
them they're they're independent
from things and there's a lot of items

434
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
from things and there's a lot of items
 

435
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,430
from things and there's a lot of items
here you can see that

436
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
here you can see that
 

437
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,710
here you can see that
it's just because the hoppers aren't

438
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
it's just because the hoppers aren't
 

439
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,270
it's just because the hoppers aren't
fast enough to pick up all the items

440
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
fast enough to pick up all the items
 

441
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,550
fast enough to pick up all the items
um another issue with it but i'm fine

442
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
um another issue with it but i'm fine
 

443
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,950
um another issue with it but i'm fine
with it

444
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
with it
 

445
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,270
with it
uh because to get around that we have to

446
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,280
uh because to get around that we have to
 

447
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,469
uh because to get around that we have to
have two filters

448
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
have two filters
 

449
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,029
have two filters
double the filters and the farm's gonna

450
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
double the filters and the farm's gonna
 

451
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,869
double the filters and the farm's gonna
get way bigger

452
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
get way bigger
 

453
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,270
get way bigger
and there's not that many items there

454
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
and there's not that many items there
 

455
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,070
and there's not that many items there
compared to what we're getting i think

456
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
compared to what we're getting i think
 

457
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,270
compared to what we're getting i think
anyways ramble ramble so uh

458
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
anyways ramble ramble so uh
 

459
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,990
anyways ramble ramble so uh
over here is where the item filters up

460
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
over here is where the item filters up
 

461
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,309
over here is where the item filters up
over there

462
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
over there
 

463
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,150
over there
maybe we'll settle down and just take a

464
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
maybe we'll settle down and just take a
 

465
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,390
maybe we'll settle down and just take a
look at it real quick here

466
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
look at it real quick here
 

467
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,309
look at it real quick here
so the items funnel down from these

468
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
so the items funnel down from these
 

469
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,909
so the items funnel down from these
hopper mine carts there's two hopper

470
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
hopper mine carts there's two hopper
 

471
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,990
hopper mine carts there's two hopper
mine carts and

472
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
mine carts and
 

473
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,670
mine carts and
like together in each of these things

474
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
like together in each of these things
 

475
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,110
like together in each of these things
because

476
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
because
 

477
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,709
because
they fill up so quickly when items go by

478
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
they fill up so quickly when items go by
 

479
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,829
they fill up so quickly when items go by
a funnel down here we got our item

480
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839
a funnel down here we got our item
 

481
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,230
a funnel down here we got our item
filters

482
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
filters
 

483
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,990
filters
items pass through along here anything

484
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
items pass through along here anything
 

485
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,670
items pass through along here anything
that doesn't get filtered out goes over

486
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
that doesn't get filtered out goes over
 

487
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,230
that doesn't get filtered out goes over
there and gets shot out

488
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
there and gets shot out
 

489
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,710
there and gets shot out
like all the golden swords and stuff

490
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
like all the golden swords and stuff
 

491
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,430
like all the golden swords and stuff

everything else
 

493
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,710
everything else
goes to these droppers here

494

goes to these droppers here
 

495
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,230
goes to these droppers here
you see we got gold knight it's falling

496
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
you see we got gold knight it's falling
 

497
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,630
you see we got gold knight it's falling

falls down the tubes tubes don't need to

500
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
falls down the tubes tubes don't need to
 

501
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,310
falls down the tubes tubes don't need to
be that

502
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
be that
 

503
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,150
be that
like all the way to the ground but i did

504
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
like all the way to the ground but i did
 

505
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,509
like all the way to the ground but i did
it anyways

506
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
it anyways
 

507
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,269
it anyways
this is all the gold swords and the

508
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
this is all the gold swords and the
 

509
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,350
this is all the gold swords and the
garbage for some reason

510
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
garbage for some reason
 

511
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,870
garbage for some reason
i think just because item filters aren't

512
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
i think just because item filters aren't
 

513
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,550
i think just because item filters aren't
fast enough the hoppers aren't aren't

514
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
fast enough the hoppers aren't aren't
 

515
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,509
fast enough the hoppers aren't aren't
quick enough

516
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
quick enough
 

517
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,350
quick enough
some zombie flesh is getting mixed in

518
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
some zombie flesh is getting mixed in
 

519
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,550
some zombie flesh is getting mixed in
here but

520
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
here but
 

521
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,230
here but
again not a big deal as long as we're

522
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
again not a big deal as long as we're
 

523
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,750
again not a big deal as long as we're
eating the gold

524
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
eating the gold
 

525
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,230
eating the gold
and then it gets sorted into our shulker

526
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
and then it gets sorted into our shulker
 

527
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,110
and then it gets sorted into our shulker
box system here

528
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
box system here
 

529
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,949
box system here
and when they fill up they go up in

530
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
and when they fill up they go up in
 

531
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,630
and when they fill up they go up in
these chests here

532
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
these chests here
 

533
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,550
these chests here
so every three of these shocker boxes is

534
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
so every three of these shocker boxes is
 

535
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,150
so every three of these shocker boxes is
i think one stack of gold blocks

536
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
i think one stack of gold blocks
 

537
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,829
i think one stack of gold blocks
so we have like two stacks of gold locks

538
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
so we have like two stacks of gold locks
 

539
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,590
so we have like two stacks of gold locks
in here so that's pretty cool

540
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
in here so that's pretty cool
 

541
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,949
in here so that's pretty cool
plus we have these and zombie flesh we

542
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
plus we have these and zombie flesh we
 

543
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,550
plus we have these and zombie flesh we
can trade for emeralds

544
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
can trade for emeralds
 

545
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,870
can trade for emeralds
pretty easily

546
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880

 

547
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,550

but we're going to move on here guys

548
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
but we're going to move on here guys
 

549
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,710
but we're going to move on here guys
there is an idea i really want to try

550
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
there is an idea i really want to try
 

551
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,750
there is an idea i really want to try
out today

552
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
out today
 

553
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,670
out today
i had this stupid idea for a tree farm

554
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
i had this stupid idea for a tree farm
 

555
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,949
i had this stupid idea for a tree farm
a dark oak tree farm and if we

556
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
a dark oak tree farm and if we
 

557
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,790
a dark oak tree farm and if we
if we do build this if it works out

558
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
if we do build this if it works out
 

559
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,550
if we do build this if it works out
we're gonna build it uh probably over

560
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
we're gonna build it uh probably over
 

561
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,430
we're gonna build it uh probably over
here at the blaze farm area

562
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
here at the blaze farm area
 

563
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,870
here at the blaze farm area
um it it was a stupid idea but i tried

564
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
um it it was a stupid idea but i tried
 

565
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,389
um it it was a stupid idea but i tried
it out for a little bit and it seemed

566
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
it out for a little bit and it seemed
 

567
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,150
it out for a little bit and it seemed
like there might actually be something

568
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
like there might actually be something
 

569
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,269
like there might actually be something
to it so we're gonna investigate and get

570
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
to it so we're gonna investigate and get
 

571
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,630
to it so we're gonna investigate and get
some actual numbers here because i

572
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
some actual numbers here because i
 

573
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,110
some actual numbers here because i
haven't

574
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
haven't
 

575
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,829
haven't
figured out the numbers to this just yet

576
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
figured out the numbers to this just yet
 

577
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,910
figured out the numbers to this just yet
uh but what we're gonna do is set up

578
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
uh but what we're gonna do is set up
 

579
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,310
uh but what we're gonna do is set up
some

580
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
some
 

581
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,790
some
dirt it's gotta be a two by two with the

582
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
dirt it's gotta be a two by two with the
 

583
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,550
dirt it's gotta be a two by two with the
dark oak trees

584
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
dark oak trees
 

585
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,150
dark oak trees
uh if you don't know these are one of

586
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
uh if you don't know these are one of
 

587
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,069
uh if you don't know these are one of
the hardest trees to farm

588
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
the hardest trees to farm
 

589
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,110
the hardest trees to farm
in the game because they they

590
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
in the game because they they
 

591
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,230
in the game because they they
have to be two by two they grow branches

592
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
have to be two by two they grow branches
 

593
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,990
have to be two by two they grow branches
and stuff so it makes it

594
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
and stuff so it makes it
 

595
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,829
and stuff so it makes it
like uh all crazy shaped

596
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
like uh all crazy shaped
 

597
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,310
like uh all crazy shaped
and then also actually let's do it like

598
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
and then also actually let's do it like
 

599
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,269
and then also actually let's do it like
this

600
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
this
 

601
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,870
this
i'm just going to set it up like this

602
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
i'm just going to set it up like this
 

603
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,470
i'm just going to set it up like this
and then remove some of these hoppers i

604
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
and then remove some of these hoppers i
 

605
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,590
and then remove some of these hoppers i
think

606
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
think
 

607
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,069
think
and also they seem to have the worst

608
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
and also they seem to have the worst
 

609
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,269
and also they seem to have the worst
sapling droppage

610
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
sapling droppage
 

611
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,990
sapling droppage
of all the trees in the game like you

612
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
of all the trees in the game like you
 

613
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,470
of all the trees in the game like you
have to

614
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
have to
 

615
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,910
have to
pretty much break every leaf on the tree

616
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
pretty much break every leaf on the tree
 

617
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,389
pretty much break every leaf on the tree
to get your saplings back you might get

618
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
to get your saplings back you might get
 

619
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,829
to get your saplings back you might get
a few extra

620
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
a few extra
 

621
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,750
a few extra
but it's pretty brutal let's put these

622
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
but it's pretty brutal let's put these
 

623
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,230
but it's pretty brutal let's put these
back

624
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240

 

625
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,310

okay so here's the plan i'm gonna drop

626
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
okay so here's the plan i'm gonna drop
 

627
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,310
okay so here's the plan i'm gonna drop
off anything important i have on me that

628
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
off anything important i have on me that
 

629
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,870
off anything important i have on me that
i don't

630
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
i don't
 

631
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,949
i don't
necessarily need right now my punchbow

632
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
necessarily need right now my punchbow
 

633
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,030
necessarily need right now my punchbow
don't really need my picks and my shovel

634
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
don't really need my picks and my shovel
 

635
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,389
don't really need my picks and my shovel
and the sword

636
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399
and the sword
 

637
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,430
and the sword
we do need the axe though uh

638
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
we do need the axe though uh
 

639
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,230
we do need the axe though uh
we have our hopper net set up so any

640
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
we have our hopper net set up so any
 

641
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,150
we have our hopper net set up so any
saplings and logs that drop

642
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
saplings and logs that drop
 

643
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,110
saplings and logs that drop
should get picked up by that and the

644
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
should get picked up by that and the
 

645
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,710
should get picked up by that and the
idea is we're gonna use

646
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
idea is we're gonna use
 

647
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,150
idea is we're gonna use
beds we're gonna sleep our trees away

648
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
beds we're gonna sleep our trees away
 

649
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,389
beds we're gonna sleep our trees away
is the plan all the drops should end up

650
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:40,399
is the plan all the drops should end up
 

651
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,150
is the plan all the drops should end up
in this hopper right there

652
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
in this hopper right there
 

653
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,590
in this hopper right there
that's where i got them all pointing and

654
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
that's where i got them all pointing and
 

655
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,230
that's where i got them all pointing and
i think we're about ready here hopefully

656
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
i think we're about ready here hopefully
 

657
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,230
i think we're about ready here hopefully
we have enough headroom

658
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
we have enough headroom
 

659
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,509
we have enough headroom
uh if not it's about to get bigger so

660
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
uh if not it's about to get bigger so
 

661
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,230
uh if not it's about to get bigger so
we grow the tree oh come on

662
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
we grow the tree oh come on
 

663
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,949
we grow the tree oh come on
ah we might need more headspace darn it

664
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959

 

665
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,870

how many is that one two three four

some more blocks
that should be good now so we grow our

672
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
that should be good now so we grow our
 

673
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,629
that should be good now so we grow our
tree

674
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:16,639
tree
 

675
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,069
tree
please yes right away good grow our tree

676
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
please yes right away good grow our tree
 

677
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:20,710
please yes right away good grow our tree
and then

678
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:20,720
and then
 

679
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,790
and then
this is kind of a semi-automatic way of

680
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
this is kind of a semi-automatic way of
 

681
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,310
this is kind of a semi-automatic way of
doing it

682
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
doing it
 

683
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,509
doing it
these hoppers have two functions they

684
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
these hoppers have two functions they
 

685
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,750
these hoppers have two functions they
collect our saplings and our wood they

686
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
collect our saplings and our wood they
 

687
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,949
collect our saplings and our wood they
also

688
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
also
 

689
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,110
also
prevent fire which is important here

690
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
prevent fire which is important here
 

691
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,310
prevent fire which is important here
because we're going to be blowing up the

692
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
because we're going to be blowing up the
 

693
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,150
because we're going to be blowing up the
tree with beds

694
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
tree with beds
 

695
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,949
tree with beds
in the nether now if you don't know beds

696
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
in the nether now if you don't know beds
 

697
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,670
in the nether now if you don't know beds
have a special thing that if you

698
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
have a special thing that if you
 

699
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,590
have a special thing that if you
well any explosion if you're out of the

700
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
well any explosion if you're out of the
 

701
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,310
well any explosion if you're out of the
line of the sight of the explosion

702
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
line of the sight of the explosion
 

703
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,990
line of the sight of the explosion
uh it doesn't really damage you so i'm

704
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
uh it doesn't really damage you so i'm
 

705

00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,200
gonna stand here
 

707
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,190
gonna stand here
and that didn't work at all what

708
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
and that didn't work at all what
 

709
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,550
and that didn't work at all what
oh no and

710
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
oh no and
 

711
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,829
oh no and
there we go guys so that's how you

712
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
there we go guys so that's how you
 

713
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,990
there we go guys so that's how you
destroy two stacks of iron in less than

714
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,000
destroy two stacks of iron in less than
 

715
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,590
destroy two stacks of iron in less than
a second

716
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
a second
 

717
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,269
a second
i've lowered the hoppers by three blocks

718
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
i've lowered the hoppers by three blocks
 

719
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,949
i've lowered the hoppers by three blocks
covered them over with slabs just in

720
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
covered them over with slabs just in
 

721
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:09,910
covered them over with slabs just in
case

722
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
case
 

723
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,069
case
uh hopefully they're far enough away now

724
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
uh hopefully they're far enough away now
 

725
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,269
uh hopefully they're far enough away now
so we got 27

726
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
so we got 27
 

727
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,150
so we got 27
saplings let's put our dark oak and

728
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
saplings let's put our dark oak and
 

729
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,829
saplings let's put our dark oak and
chest here

730
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
chest here
 

731
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,509
chest here
this chest is empty okay

732
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
this chest is empty okay
 

733
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,509
this chest is empty okay
so we got to do this in two steps two

734
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
so we got to do this in two steps two
 

735
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,150
so we got to do this in two steps two
beds per tree

736
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
beds per tree
 

737
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,509
beds per tree
grow another tree i made this room a

738
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
grow another tree i made this room a
 

739
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,590
grow another tree i made this room a
little bit bigger again so

740
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
little bit bigger again so
 

741
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,829
little bit bigger again so
two blocks up is where we put the first

742
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
two blocks up is where we put the first
 

743
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,990
two blocks up is where we put the first
bed always and i've tried this a few

744
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
bed always and i've tried this a few
 

745
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,190
bed always and i've tried this a few
times it never destroys the dirt below

746
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
times it never destroys the dirt below
 

747
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,790
times it never destroys the dirt below
that i've had happen anyways

748
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
that i've had happen anyways
 

749
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,470
that i've had happen anyways
oh this is why i didn't want to put

750
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
oh this is why i didn't want to put
 

751
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,550
oh this is why i didn't want to put
these here

752
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
these here
 

753
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,910
these here
what else could i use instead of

754
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:45,920
what else could i use instead of
 

755
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,300
what else could i use instead of
obsidian hmm

756
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:49,310
obsidian hmm
 

757
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,629
obsidian hmm
[Music]

758
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
[Music]
 

759
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,030
[Music]
oh and we lost the slab uh oh okay

760
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
oh and we lost the slab uh oh okay
 

761
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,710
oh and we lost the slab uh oh okay
how are we doing right now so we got six

762
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
how are we doing right now so we got six
 

763
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,790
how are we doing right now so we got six
and three so we're getting our saplings

764
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
and three so we're getting our saplings
 

765
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,550
and three so we're getting our saplings
back right and look at all the leaves up

766
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
back right and look at all the leaves up
 

767
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,590
back right and look at all the leaves up
there still

768
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600
there still
 

769
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,670
there still
then you would have to do the rest of

770
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
then you would have to do the rest of
 

771
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,350
then you would have to do the rest of
the tree

772
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
the tree
 

773
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,430
the tree
with another bed and hopefully have some

774
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:07,440
with another bed and hopefully have some
 

775
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,629
with another bed and hopefully have some
way of like getting up here

776
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
way of like getting up here
 

777
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,990
way of like getting up here
actually there's not much left to this

778
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
actually there's not much left to this
 

779
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,030
actually there's not much left to this
tree sometimes they're a little bit

780
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
tree sometimes they're a little bit
 

781
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,269
tree sometimes they're a little bit
bigger than others

782
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
bigger than others
 

783
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,310
bigger than others
okay i should probably grab

784
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320
okay i should probably grab
 

785
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:26,230
okay i should probably grab
my shovel where's my shoulder

786
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240

 

787
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,590

oh it was purple i couldn't see it

788
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
oh it was purple i couldn't see it
 

789
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,110
oh it was purple i couldn't see it
it blended in too well okay

790
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
it blended in too well okay
 

791
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,350
it blended in too well okay
and then to get the second bed somehow

792
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
and then to get the second bed somehow
 

793
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,949
and then to get the second bed somehow
have a way of placing it up there i

794
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:36,959
have a way of placing it up there i
 

795
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,870
have a way of placing it up there i
haven't figured out how to do that yet

796
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880
haven't figured out how to do that yet
 

797
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,990
haven't figured out how to do that yet
jump and then activate it and that's the

798
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
jump and then activate it and that's the
 

799
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,949
jump and then activate it and that's the
whole tree

800
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
whole tree
 

801
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,310
whole tree
so from that one tree we have six on us

802
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
so from that one tree we have six on us
 

803
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,189
so from that one tree we have six on us
it's only 12 logs four saplings

804
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199

 

805
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,430

okay so that is not looking too good to

806
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
okay so that is not looking too good to
 

807
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,870
okay so that is not looking too good to
be honest i was hoping for better

808
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
be honest i was hoping for better
 

809
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,230
be honest i was hoping for better
numbers but we'll try a couple more

810
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
numbers but we'll try a couple more
 

811
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,430
numbers but we'll try a couple more
trees

812
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
trees
 

813
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,590
trees
we could use ender chests instead of

814
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
we could use ender chests instead of
 

815
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,189
we could use ender chests instead of
obsidian i just realized so these would

816
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
obsidian i just realized so these would
 

817
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,949
obsidian i just realized so these would
be blast proof

818
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
be blast proof
 

819
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,069
be blast proof
but they won't catch on fire so that

820
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
but they won't catch on fire so that
 

821
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,269
but they won't catch on fire so that
that's an idea

822
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279
that's an idea
 

823
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,829
that's an idea
if this is if there's any merit to this

824
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
if this is if there's any merit to this
 

825
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,310
if this is if there's any merit to this
this is

826
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
this is
 

827
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,710
this is
i'll use enter chests this is the plan

828
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
i'll use enter chests this is the plan
 

829
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,389
i'll use enter chests this is the plan
let's let's try a few more though just

830
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
let's let's try a few more though just
 

831
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,430
let's let's try a few more though just

997
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:25,510
done time lapse from the fat rat so here
it is

998
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520

 

999
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,510

pretty cool right and i got a special

1000
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:27,520
pretty cool right and i got a special
 

1001
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,669
pretty cool right and i got a special
circuit here so it kind of reuses

1002
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
circuit here so it kind of reuses
 

1003
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,430
circuit here so it kind of reuses
some of the note blocks because at the

1004
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
some of the note blocks because at the
 

1005
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,270
some of the note blocks because at the
end of the tune only uh

1006
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
end of the tune only uh
 

1007
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,909
end of the tune only uh
either splits this way to these two

1008
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
either splits this way to these two
 

1009
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:36,549
either splits this way to these two
notes

1010
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
notes
 

1011
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,230
notes
or else it splits this way to these two

1012
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
or else it splits this way to these two
 

1013
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,789
or else it splits this way to these two
notes so rather than doubling the size

1014
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:40,799
notes so rather than doubling the size
 

1015
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,990
notes so rather than doubling the size
of all this we have a

1016
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
of all this we have a
 

1017
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,390
of all this we have a
specialty flip-flop here which

1018
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
specialty flip-flop here which
 

1019
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,990
specialty flip-flop here which
alternates the output

1020
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
alternates the output
 

1021
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,150
alternates the output
every time it activates so it changes

1022
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
every time it activates so it changes
 

1023
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,669
every time it activates so it changes
from locking that repeater to locking

1024
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:49,679
from locking that repeater to locking
 

1025
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,710
from locking that repeater to locking
that one

1026
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
that one
 

1027
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,150
that one
as it goes through the thing

1028
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160

 

1029
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,710

you see that one's locked now that one's

1030
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:56,720
you see that one's locked now that one's
 

1031
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,549
you see that one's locked now that one's
locked

1032
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
locked
 

1033
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,230
locked
pretty cool right and we could we could

1034
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
pretty cool right and we could we could
 

1035
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,150
pretty cool right and we could we could
keep it going on a loop if we wanted to

1036
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
keep it going on a loop if we wanted to
 

1037
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,070
keep it going on a loop if we wanted to
so whenever a mushroom grows we want to

1038
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080
so whenever a mushroom grows we want to
 

1039
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,430
so whenever a mushroom grows we want to
connect it to the circuits

1040
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
connect it to the circuits
 

1041
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,029
connect it to the circuits
whenever the bud switch on the mushroom

1042
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
whenever the bud switch on the mushroom
 

1043
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,190
whenever the bud switch on the mushroom
grower activates connect it right over

1044
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,200
grower activates connect it right over
 

1045
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,270
grower activates connect it right over
here and that's all we got to do

1046
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,280
here and that's all we got to do
 

1047
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,710
here and that's all we got to do
all all eight of the mushrooms will

1048
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
all all eight of the mushrooms will
 

1049
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,350
all all eight of the mushrooms will
share the same uh tune here

1050
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
share the same uh tune here
 

1051
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,789
share the same uh tune here
oh yeah and here's the tuning so the

1052
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
oh yeah and here's the tuning so the
 

1053
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,590
oh yeah and here's the tuning so the
first we have a group 13 20 this is the

1054
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
first we have a group 13 20 this is the
 

1055
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,630
first we have a group 13 20 this is the
number of clicks

1056
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:20,640
number of clicks
 

1057
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,950
number of clicks
to tune the note block then we have 18

1058
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
to tune the note block then we have 18
 

1059
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,549
to tune the note block then we have 18
16 18

1060
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
16 18
 

1061
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,830
16 18
16 13 11 13

1062
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:27,840
16 13 11 13
 

1063
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,350
16 13 11 13
13 11

1064
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
13 11
 

1065
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,430
13 11
13 and then at the split here at first

1066
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440
13 and then at the split here at first
 

1067
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,630
13 and then at the split here at first
it goes this way

1068
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
it goes this way
 

1069
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,750
it goes this way
16 13 and then it goes this way

1070
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:37,760
16 13 and then it goes this way
 

1071
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:52,470
16 13 and then it goes this way
eleven eight

1072
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480
eleven eight
 

1073
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:03,270
eleven eight
emeralds

1074
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,280

 

1075
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,190

very cool so we're going to finish up

1076
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
very cool so we're going to finish up
 

1077
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,110
very cool so we're going to finish up
our episode today checking out the new

1078
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
our episode today checking out the new
 

1079
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,750
our episode today checking out the new
updates so we're in 1.11.1

1080
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
updates so we're in 1.11.1
 

1081
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,310
updates so we're in 1.11.1
trying out the new uh the flying with

1082
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
trying out the new uh the flying with
 

1083
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,430
trying out the new uh the flying with
the fireworks

1084
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
the fireworks
 

1085
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,190
the fireworks
before i updated though i did get the

1086
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200
before i updated though i did get the
 

1087
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,110
before i updated though i did get the
bose done so we got a few flying bows

1088
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
bose done so we got a few flying bows
 

1089
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,470
bose done so we got a few flying bows
here

1090
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
here
 

1091
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,789
here
and we also got a few combat bows

1092
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:20,799
and we also got a few combat bows
 

1093
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,390
and we also got a few combat bows
they're not finished but uh

1094
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400
they're not finished but uh
 

1095
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,630
they're not finished but uh
i think we can still work on them after

1096
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:24,640
i think we can still work on them after
 

1097
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,630
i think we can still work on them after
afterwards hopefully without it breaking

1098
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
afterwards hopefully without it breaking
 

1099
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,909
afterwards hopefully without it breaking
so this is the last time i'm gonna be

1100
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:27,919
so this is the last time i'm gonna be
 

1101
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,549
so this is the last time i'm gonna be
able to combine infinity with mending

1102
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:30,559
able to combine infinity with mending
 

1103
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,950
able to combine infinity with mending
infinity doesn't last right

1104
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:34,960
infinity doesn't last right
 

1105
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,750
infinity doesn't last right
uh-huh you can still add infinity but

1106
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:37,760
uh-huh you can still add infinity but
 

1107
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,190
uh-huh you can still add infinity but
not with mending

1108
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
not with mending
 

1109
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,510
not with mending
anyways so let's uh let's go above

1110
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,520
anyways so let's uh let's go above
 

1111
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,390
anyways so let's uh let's go above
ground i guess i

1112
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
ground i guess i
 

1113
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,870
ground i guess i
got a few fireworks here from the

1114
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
got a few fireworks here from the
 

1115
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,270
got a few fireworks here from the
firework room they have stars on them

1116
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
firework room they have stars on them
 

1117
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,590
firework room they have stars on them
i think they should still explode when

1118
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
i think they should still explode when
 

1119
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,870
i think they should still explode when
you're using them for flight that might

1120
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:50,880
you're using them for flight that might
 

1121
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,990
you're using them for flight that might
look cool

1122
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
look cool
 

1123
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,190
look cool
and we'll also try it out this way

1124
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
and we'll also try it out this way
 

1125
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,710
and we'll also try it out this way
all right oh yeah and you get three

1126
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:56,720
all right oh yeah and you get three
 

1127
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,029
all right oh yeah and you get three
that's right oh that's actually not a

1128
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
that's right oh that's actually not a
 

1129
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,710
that's right oh that's actually not a
bad deal then

1130
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,720
bad deal then
 

1131
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,510
bad deal then
um let's deposit some of these i wanted

1132
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:03,520
um let's deposit some of these i wanted
 

1133
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,870
um let's deposit some of these i wanted
to try out

1134
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
to try out
 

1135
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,870
to try out
the ones with more gunpowder i heard

1136
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:06,880
the ones with more gunpowder i heard
 

1137
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,909
the ones with more gunpowder i heard
they make you fly

1138
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
they make you fly
 

1139
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,710
they make you fly
longer i don't think they're faster

1140
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,720
longer i don't think they're faster
 

1141
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,149
longer i don't think they're faster
though i could be wrong

1142
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
though i could be wrong
 

1143
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,190
though i could be wrong
actually let's split it then

1144
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
actually let's split it then
 

1145
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,310
actually let's split it then
yeah okay so we got some

1146
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320
yeah okay so we got some
 

1147
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,190
yeah okay so we got some
longer duration ones oh it says flight

1148
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,200
longer duration ones oh it says flight
 

1149
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,110
longer duration ones oh it says flight
duration on it

1150
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120

 

1151
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,830

oh that's cool so it actually takes into

1152
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:28,840
oh that's cool so it actually takes into
 

1153
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,990
oh that's cool so it actually takes into
consideration

1154
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
consideration
 

1155
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,870
consideration
right well i didn't try out the snapshot

1156
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
right well i didn't try out the snapshot
 

1157
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,190
right well i didn't try out the snapshot
so

1158
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
so
 

1159
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,549
so
this is my first time flying this way

this is my first time flying this way
i've just seen some videos of it

1162
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480
i've just seen some videos of it
 

1163
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,909
i've just seen some videos of it
let's grab our duration ones

1164
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
let's grab our duration ones
 

1165
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,990
let's grab our duration ones
and i think you can just fly by jumping

1166
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
and i think you can just fly by jumping
 

1167
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,990
and i think you can just fly by jumping
right you don't need the launchers

1168
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,000

 

1169
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,270

yeah look at that oh man that is

1170
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280
yeah look at that oh man that is
 

1171
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,510
yeah look at that oh man that is
fast how long does that last for let's

1172
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:53,520
fast how long does that last for let's
 

1173
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:53,830
fast how long does that last for let's
look

1174
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
look
 

1175
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,870
look
let's go into this view

1176
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:56,880
let's go into this view
 

1177
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,270
let's go into this view
okay so that's like one second right

1178
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
okay so that's like one second right
 

1179
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,390
okay so that's like one second right
let's try out

1180
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:00,400
let's try out
 

1181
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,110
let's try out
the the threes

1182
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120

 

1183
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,190

yeah that's like three seconds i i think

1184
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,200
yeah that's like three seconds i i think
 

1185
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,470
yeah that's like three seconds i i think
that's what it means

1186
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
that's what it means
 

1187
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,110
that's what it means
one two or three seconds okay let's try

1188
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
one two or three seconds okay let's try
 

1189
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,510
one two or three seconds okay let's try
out

1190
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,520
out
 

1191
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,789
out
one with a star oh

1192
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:16,799

 

1193

so maybe and this is crazy

1198
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
so maybe and this is crazy
 

1199

because i'm launching this i'm launching
 

1205
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,590
because i'm launching this i'm launching
these and they should be far away from

1206
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
these and they should be far away from
 

1207
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,669
these and they should be far away from
me right

1208
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679

00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
and you can probably combine the flight
 

1223
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,149
and you can probably combine the flight
bow with the fireworks right that's the

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,190
oh but if you touch the ground that's it
you're gonna jump off the lily pad

1234
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,200
you're gonna jump off the lily pad
 

1235
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,590
you're gonna jump off the lily pad
though

1236
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:17,600

 

1237
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,029

dude now i kind of want to make a water

1238
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
dude now i kind of want to make a water
 

1239
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,909
dude now i kind of want to make a water
base if you can do that

1240
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:23,919
base if you can do that
 

1241
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,870
base if you can do that
that is pretty sick you can fly straight

1242
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:26,880
that is pretty sick you can fly straight
 

1243
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,549
that is pretty sick you can fly straight
up right

1244
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:28,559
up right
 

1245
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,549
up right
yeah we're going straight up

1246
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:32,559

 

1247
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,310

oh you can hear the wind stop when the

1248
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
oh you can hear the wind stop when the
 

1249

oh you can hear the wind stop when the
firework runs out too

1250
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:37,760
firework runs out too
 

1251
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,990
firework runs out too
dude this is this is a game changer for

1252
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
dude this is this is a game changer for
 

1253
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,029
dude this is this is a game changer for
sure

1254
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
sure
 

1255
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,710
sure
i'm lost i haven't been paying attention

1256
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
i'm lost i haven't been paying attention
 

1257
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,669
i'm lost i haven't been paying attention
where i'm going

1258
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679

 

1259
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,350

uh what else can we do yeah let's try it

1260
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,360
uh what else can we do yeah let's try it
 

1261
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,950
uh what else can we do yeah let's try it
out with the punch bow

1262
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:48,960
out with the punch bow
 

1263
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,710
out with the punch bow
because you can get the boost effect

1264
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
because you can get the boost effect
 

1265
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,230
because you can get the boost effect
while getting the bow effect because it

1266
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240
while getting the bow effect because it
 

1267
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,630
while getting the bow effect because it
kind of lasts for a few seconds right

1268
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640

 

1269
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,510

ah it's not really no it's not really

1270
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
ah it's not really no it's not really
 

1271
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,950
ah it's not really no it's not really
doing anything

1272
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
doing anything
 

1273
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,470
doing anything
it's not like you go super sonic or

1274
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
it's not like you go super sonic or
 

1275
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,830
it's not like you go super sonic or
anything

1276
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:07,840

 

1277
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,310

okay okay i just realized something you

1278
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
okay okay i just realized something you
 

1279
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,110
okay okay i just realized something you
can do stuff

1280
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,120
can do stuff
 

1281
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,630
can do stuff
you you can't do with a punch bow with

1282
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:12,640
you you can't do with a punch bow with
 

1283
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,470
you you can't do with a punch bow with
this because that the flight is like

1284
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
this because that the flight is like
 

1285
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,669
this because that the flight is like
constant right

1286
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:15,679
constant right
 

1287
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,310
constant right
so you can do like loopity loops almost

1288
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320

 

1289
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,430

oh wait a second like you would never be

1290
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,440
oh wait a second like you would never be
 

1291
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,470
oh wait a second like you would never be
able to do that with a punchbowl that

1292
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,480
able to do that with a punchbowl that
 

1293
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,549
able to do that with a punchbowl that
would be so difficult

1294
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559

 

1295
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,630

uh it's great yeah i'm gonna convert

1296
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
uh it's great yeah i'm gonna convert
 

1297
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,549
uh it's great yeah i'm gonna convert
over to using these i wasn't sure but

1298
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
over to using these i wasn't sure but
 

1299
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:34,950
over to using these i wasn't sure but
after

1300
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
after
 

1301
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,230
after
after trying it for sure definitely tops

1302
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,240
after trying it for sure definitely tops
 

1303
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,990
after trying it for sure definitely tops
the bow

1304
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,000
the bow
 

1305
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,750
the bow
and uh let's just double check something

1306
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
and uh let's just double check something
 

1307
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,669
and uh let's just double check something
here i'm pretty sure frostwalker only

1308
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
here i'm pretty sure frostwalker only
 

1309
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,110
here i'm pretty sure frostwalker only
works when you're watching

1310
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,120
works when you're watching
 

1311
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,870
works when you're watching
but just in case it works when you're

1312
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
but just in case it works when you're
 

1313
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,390
but just in case it works when you're
flying that would be pretty crazy

1314
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400

 

1315
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,909

okay here we go

1316
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:55,919

 

1317
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,590

no no ice trail

00:24:59,590 --> 00:24:59,600

 

1319
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,789

well i think we're gonna call it here

1320
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
well i think we're gonna call it here
 

1321
