00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,869
in tiger biomes at least at ground level
i think maybe if you go higher up they

174
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
i think maybe if you go higher up they
 

175
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,270
i think maybe if you go higher up they
will

176
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
will
 

177
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,910
will
it will but i never tested that um

178
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
it will but i never tested that um
 

179
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,509
it will but i never tested that um
so yeah i i can't just fix this it's

180
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
so yeah i i can't just fix this it's
 

181
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,149
so yeah i i can't just fix this it's
done

182
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
done
 

183
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,390
done
so we need a new ice farm i'm running

184
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
so we need a new ice farm i'm running
 

185
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,229
so we need a new ice farm i'm running
really low on ice and it's one of those

186
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
really low on ice and it's one of those
 

187
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,110
really low on ice and it's one of those
things i use a fair bit of

188
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
things i use a fair bit of
 

189
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,870
things i use a fair bit of
so let's get to that today i just like

190
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
so let's get to that today i just like
 

191
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,230
so let's get to that today i just like
doing this it looks so cool

192
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240

 

193
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,350

oh man

194
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360

 

195
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,189

yeah so we're gonna build it out by the

196
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
yeah so we're gonna build it out by the
 

197
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,469
yeah so we're gonna build it out by the
man cave actually because

198
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
man cave actually because
 

199
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,270
man cave actually because
mountains uh they get snow and water

200
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
mountains uh they get snow and water
 

201
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,469
mountains uh they get snow and water
freezes on

202
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
freezes on
 

203
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,710
freezes on
on them like at the high altitude which

204
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
on them like at the high altitude which
 

205
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,390
on them like at the high altitude which
they didn't do that before which is why

206
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
they didn't do that before which is why
 

207
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,790
they didn't do that before which is why
i built this one out here

208
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
i built this one out here
 

209
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,629
i built this one out here
long ago because this was the only snow

210
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
long ago because this was the only snow
 

211
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,189
long ago because this was the only snow
biome i had

212
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
biome i had
 

213
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,710
biome i had
but i can build it right by the man tave

214
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
but i can build it right by the man tave
 

215
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,350
but i can build it right by the man tave
now which is kind of cool actually

216
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
now which is kind of cool actually
 

217
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,110
now which is kind of cool actually
so let's get to it

218
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120

00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
lasted longer than bunny one
 

227
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,270
lasted longer than bunny one
i'm impressed

228
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280

 

229
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,430

all right guys so i found a spot here up

230
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
all right guys so i found a spot here up
 

231
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,310
all right guys so i found a spot here up
in the mountains

232
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
in the mountains
 

233
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,550
in the mountains
i think we're gonna build the ice farm

234
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
i think we're gonna build the ice farm
 

235
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,310
i think we're gonna build the ice farm
just over here

236
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
just over here
 

237
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,469
just over here
there's like this a decent size flat

238
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
there's like this a decent size flat
 

239
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,710
there's like this a decent size flat
spot for us to work in

240
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
spot for us to work in
 

241
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,870
spot for us to work in
i think i'm gonna go for about a 16 by

242
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
i think i'm gonna go for about a 16 by
 

243
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,150
i think i'm gonna go for about a 16 by
16 area

244
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
16 area
 

245
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,790
16 area
for the for the ice farm shouldn't take

246
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
for the for the ice farm shouldn't take
 

247
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,550
for the for the ice farm shouldn't take
up a lot of space

248
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
up a lot of space
 

249
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,230
up a lot of space
i tried pouring water on the ground too

250
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
i tried pouring water on the ground too
 

251
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,909
i tried pouring water on the ground too
and making sure it turns to ice and it

252
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
and making sure it turns to ice and it
 

253
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:30,469
and making sure it turns to ice and it
does

254
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
does
 

255
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,150
does
which is very good same with up here

256
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
which is very good same with up here
 

257
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,950
which is very good same with up here
and in relation to the man cave the man

258
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
and in relation to the man cave the man
 

259
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,990
and in relation to the man cave the man
cave is just

260
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
cave is just
 

261
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,070
cave is just
over there you can see the bridge got

262
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
over there you can see the bridge got
 

263
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,150
over there you can see the bridge got
the snowflake there the mob system there

264
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
the snowflake there the mob system there
 

265
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,350
the snowflake there the mob system there
so it's not too far away i'm hoping

266
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
so it's not too far away i'm hoping
 

267
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,270
so it's not too far away i'm hoping
uh the ice farm will be able to run

268
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
uh the ice farm will be able to run
 

269
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,870
uh the ice farm will be able to run
automatically while we're in the man

270
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
automatically while we're in the man
 

271
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,350
automatically while we're in the man
cave because with that other one

272
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
cave because with that other one
 

273
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,909
cave because with that other one
i would have to like dig a hole and hide

274
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
i would have to like dig a hole and hide
 

275
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,830
i would have to like dig a hole and hide
in it for 30 minutes for the ice to be

276
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
in it for 30 minutes for the ice to be
 

277
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,629
in it for 30 minutes for the ice to be
made and

278
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
made and
 

279
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,029
made and
it was kind of annoying i would like to

280
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
it was kind of annoying i would like to
 

281
00:05:59,039 --> 00:05:59,670
it was kind of annoying i would like to
just like

just like
 

283
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,189
just like
be able to come here and harvest it

284
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
be able to come here and harvest it
 

285
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,749
be able to come here and harvest it
without having to wait

286
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
without having to wait
 

287
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,629
without having to wait
i think i used to have water here and it

288
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
i think i used to have water here and it
 

289
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,469
i think i used to have water here and it
froze

290
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
froze
 

291
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,230
froze
yeah i like specially shaped this so it

292
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
yeah i like specially shaped this so it
 

293
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,029
yeah i like specially shaped this so it
would flow nicely down too

294
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
would flow nicely down too
 

295
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,430
would flow nicely down too
oh and it froze again darn it i'm gonna

296
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
oh and it froze again darn it i'm gonna
 

297
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,430
oh and it froze again darn it i'm gonna
put a torch here

298
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440

 

299
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,150

yeah yeah i want that back

300
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
yeah yeah i want that back
 

301
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,510
yeah yeah i want that back
it's supposed to be water there it looks

302
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
it's supposed to be water there it looks
 

303
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,629
it's supposed to be water there it looks
like it's coming off the top of the

304
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
like it's coming off the top of the
 

305
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,670
like it's coming off the top of the
mountain that way

306
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
mountain that way
 

307
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,710
mountain that way
and filling the lake down below there uh

308
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
and filling the lake down below there uh
 

309
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,749
and filling the lake down below there uh
so i'm going to lay down

310
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759

 

311
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,510

words words i'm gonna lay some

312
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
words words i'm gonna lay some
 

313
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,790
words words i'm gonna lay some
groundwork

314
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
groundwork
 

315
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,350
groundwork
to the project uh gotta do a bit of

316
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
to the project uh gotta do a bit of
 

317
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,070
to the project uh gotta do a bit of
digging and

318
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
digging and
 

319
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,670
digging and
preparation and then we'll start

320
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
preparation and then we'll start
 

321
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,150
preparation and then we'll start
building it

322
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
building it
 

323
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,150
building it
excellent we are ready to go here so

324
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
excellent we are ready to go here so
 

325
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,070
excellent we are ready to go here so
let's get to building the thing

326
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
let's get to building the thing
 

327
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,749
let's get to building the thing
and as i place down some rails here i'm

328
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
and as i place down some rails here i'm
 

329
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,710
and as i place down some rails here i'm
going to try to tell you about the

330
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
going to try to tell you about the
 

331
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,070
going to try to tell you about the
design

332
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
design
 

333
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,430
design
that i came up with so

334
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
that i came up with so
 

335
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,990
that i came up with so
i wanted to make an ice farm where the

336
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
i wanted to make an ice farm where the
 

337
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,110
i wanted to make an ice farm where the
ice gets pushed

338
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
ice gets pushed
 

339
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,110
ice gets pushed
upward like it so it looks like it's

340
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
upward like it so it looks like it's
 

341
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,710
upward like it so it looks like it's
growing out of the ground and then when

342
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
growing out of the ground and then when
 

343
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,990
growing out of the ground and then when
you harvest it

344
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
you harvest it
 

345
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,029
you harvest it
you have like no machinery or stuff

346
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
you have like no machinery or stuff
 

347
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,589
you have like no machinery or stuff
beside you or in in the way in any form

348
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
beside you or in in the way in any form
 

349
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,029
beside you or in in the way in any form
it's just coming out of the ground

350
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
it's just coming out of the ground
 

351
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,909
it's just coming out of the ground
and i i want to make like a giant ice

352
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
and i i want to make like a giant ice
 

353
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,550
and i i want to make like a giant ice
cube

354
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
cube
 

355
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,830
cube
that grows out of the ground um

356
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
that grows out of the ground um
 

357
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,670
that grows out of the ground um
and i think we are going to be able to

358
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
and i think we are going to be able to
 

359
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,469
and i think we are going to be able to
do it here so

360
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
do it here so
 

361
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,990
do it here so
it's tough to do that though because

362
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
it's tough to do that though because
 

363
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,350
it's tough to do that though because
let's see which way do we want to start

364
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
let's see which way do we want to start
 

365
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,230
let's see which way do we want to start
i think we're going to start this way

366
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
i think we're going to start this way
 

367
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,870
i think we're going to start this way
so it'll go left and zigzag right left

368
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
so it'll go left and zigzag right left
 

369
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,670
so it'll go left and zigzag right left
right

370
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
right
 

371
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,990
right
it's tough to make a like a vertical ice

372
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
it's tough to make a like a vertical ice
 

373
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,909
it's tough to make a like a vertical ice
farm though because

374
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
farm though because
 

375
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,589
farm though because
you need the water exposed to the sky

376
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
you need the water exposed to the sky
 

377
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,350
you need the water exposed to the sky
for to create ice if you don't have that

378
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
for to create ice if you don't have that
 

379
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,629
for to create ice if you don't have that
it doesn't

380
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
it doesn't
 

381
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,710
it doesn't
um so it can't the way i'm doing it i'm

382
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
um so it can't the way i'm doing it i'm
 

383
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,150
um so it can't the way i'm doing it i'm
going to make it push it sideways and

384
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
going to make it push it sideways and
 

385
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,230
going to make it push it sideways and
then push it upward

386
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
then push it upward
 

387
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,749
then push it upward
um and we're going to cheat

388
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
um and we're going to cheat
 

389
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,430
um and we're going to cheat
quite a bit here on the redstone instead

390
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
quite a bit here on the redstone instead
 

391
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,629
quite a bit here on the redstone instead
of using redstone we're going to be

392
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
of using redstone we're going to be
 

393
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,270
of using redstone we're going to be
using detector rails

394
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
using detector rails
 

395
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,869
using detector rails
oh you know what i need i didn't grab

396
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
oh you know what i need i didn't grab
 

397
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,589
oh you know what i need i didn't grab
regular rails are you kidding

398
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
regular rails are you kidding
 

399
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,629
regular rails are you kidding
oh preparation

400
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
oh preparation
 

401
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,230
oh preparation
well done let me let me lay down the

402
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
well done let me let me lay down the
 

403
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,990
well done let me let me lay down the
rails basically i'm just

404
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
rails basically i'm just
 

405
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,309
rails basically i'm just
filling in detector rails all along the

406
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
filling in detector rails all along the
 

407
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,670
filling in detector rails all along the
pad here

408
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
pad here
 

409
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,670
pad here
and it's going to zigzag throughout the

410
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
and it's going to zigzag throughout the
 

411
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,790
and it's going to zigzag throughout the
whole thing

412
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800

 

413
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,390

yeah it'll look something like this when

414
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
yeah it'll look something like this when
 

415
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,070
yeah it'll look something like this when
i get all the rails down

416
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
i get all the rails down
 

417
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,469
i get all the rails down
pretty much exactly like that all right

418
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
pretty much exactly like that all right
 

419
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,430
pretty much exactly like that all right
let's try it out

420
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
let's try it out
 

421
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,909
let's try it out
so the detector rails here are a 10 by

422
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
so the detector rails here are a 10 by
 

423
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,869
so the detector rails here are a 10 by
10 area

424
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
10 area
 

425
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,589
10 area
so it's a hundred uh i can make it

426
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
so it's a hundred uh i can make it
 

427
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,190
so it's a hundred uh i can make it
bigger if i want it or smaller it

428
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
bigger if i want it or smaller it
 

429
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,750
bigger if i want it or smaller it
doesn't really matter

430
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:37,760
doesn't really matter
 

431
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,990
doesn't really matter
i think up to 24 blocks maybe a little

432
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
i think up to 24 blocks maybe a little
 

433
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,790
i think up to 24 blocks maybe a little
less

434
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800

 

435
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,030

although my card slows down quite a bit

436
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
although my card slows down quite a bit
 

437
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,630
although my card slows down quite a bit
maybe 10 blocks is

438
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
maybe 10 blocks is
 

439
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,949
maybe 10 blocks is
pretty close to the limit it has to be

440
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
pretty close to the limit it has to be
 

441
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,630
pretty close to the limit it has to be
able to make it all the way across

442
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640

 

443
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,070

from the power rails without any gaps

444
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
from the power rails without any gaps
 

445
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,790
from the power rails without any gaps
all right so that's good uh next up

446
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
all right so that's good uh next up
 

447
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,590
all right so that's good uh next up
we're gonna be

448
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
we're gonna be
 

449
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,590
we're gonna be
put putting down a layer of pistons over

450
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
put putting down a layer of pistons over
 

451
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,110
put putting down a layer of pistons over
top all of these

452
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
top all of these
 

453
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,630
top all of these
these uh detector rails like this

454
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
these uh detector rails like this
 

455
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,070
these uh detector rails like this
and these are what are going to push the

456
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
and these are what are going to push the
 

457
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,110
and these are what are going to push the
ice blocks up

458
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120

 

459
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,190

and i'm only going to do a few here

460
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
and i'm only going to do a few here
 

461
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,509
and i'm only going to do a few here
because otherwise it could take a while

462
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
because otherwise it could take a while
 

463
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,710
because otherwise it could take a while
i don't think i have enough pistons on

464
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
i don't think i have enough pistons on
 

465
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,190
i don't think i have enough pistons on
me even all right

466
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
me even all right
 

467
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,230
me even all right
so pretend i did the whole thing next

468
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
so pretend i did the whole thing next
 

469
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,550
so pretend i did the whole thing next
up let's see how does this work

470
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
up let's see how does this work
 

471
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,670
up let's see how does this work
i hope i figured this all out right

472
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
i hope i figured this all out right
 

473
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,190
i hope i figured this all out right
um

474
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:30,200
um
 

475
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,269
um
[Music]

476
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279

 

477
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,910

i feel like something's wrong here

478
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920

 

479
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,230

let's see i have some sideways pistons

480
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
let's see i have some sideways pistons
 

481
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,509
let's see i have some sideways pistons
are supposed to place i think they go

482
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
are supposed to place i think they go
 

483
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,070
are supposed to place i think they go
along

484
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
along
 

485
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,829
along
here but then these are in the way

486
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839

 

487
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,590

hmm

488
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
hmm
 

489
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,350
hmm
hmm you know what we might need to put

490
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
hmm you know what we might need to put
 

491
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,670
hmm you know what we might need to put
the sideways ones the other direction

492
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
the sideways ones the other direction
 

493
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,550
the sideways ones the other direction
then

494
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560

 

495
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,230

so this way i didn't really want to do

496
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
so this way i didn't really want to do
 

497
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,949
so this way i didn't really want to do
it that way but it's fine

498
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
it that way but it's fine
 

499
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,670
it that way but it's fine
nothing wrong with that all right and

500
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
nothing wrong with that all right and
 

501
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,949
nothing wrong with that all right and
then

502
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
then
 

503
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,350
then
some more pistons down here

504
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360

 

505
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,870

yeah this is right this is definitely

506
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
yeah this is right this is definitely
 

507
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,630
yeah this is right this is definitely
right

508

510
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760

 

511
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,590

521
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,910
get me anxious or aggravated
but when when the power goes down or the

522
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
but when when the power goes down or the
 

523
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,829
but when when the power goes down or the
internet goes down i just feel

524
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
internet goes down i just feel
 

525
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,230
internet goes down i just feel
like ah just drives me crazy

526
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
like ah just drives me crazy
 

527
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,870
like ah just drives me crazy
because so much of what i do involves

528
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
because so much of what i do involves
 

529
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,910
because so much of what i do involves
both of those

530
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
both of those
 

531
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,990
both of those
and if i can't do those things it's like

532
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
and if i can't do those things it's like
 

533
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,190
and if i can't do those things it's like
um and i can live without computers

534
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
um and i can live without computers
 

535
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,230
um and i can live without computers
without the internet

536
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
without the internet
 

537
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,230
without the internet
and all that for for quite a while but

538
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
and all that for for quite a while but
 

539
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,350
and all that for for quite a while but
the thing is

540
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
the thing is
 

541
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,110
the thing is
the fact that it could come up at any

542
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
the fact that it could come up at any
 

543
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,470
the fact that it could come up at any
time just

544
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
time just
 

545
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,190
time just
just like or the fact i don't know when

546
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
just like or the fact i don't know when
 

547
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,870
just like or the fact i don't know when
it's going to come back up

548
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
it's going to come back up
 

549
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,990
it's going to come back up
is what really bugs me if i knew a time

550
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
is what really bugs me if i knew a time
 

551
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,990
is what really bugs me if i knew a time
or what's what's wrong or anything like

i was able to get a little bit of

564
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
i was able to get a little bit of
 

565
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,310
i was able to get a little bit of
internet today by tethering my phone

566
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
internet today by tethering my phone
 

567
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,230
internet today by tethering my phone
to my computer but for some reason that

568
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
to my computer but for some reason that
 

569
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,069
to my computer but for some reason that
stopped working as well

570
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
stopped working as well
 

571
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,910
stopped working as well
just randomly no clue why

572
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
just randomly no clue why
 

573
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,470
just randomly no clue why
still have data on it but it just

574
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
still have data on it but it just
 

575
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,430
still have data on it but it just
stopped

576
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
stopped
 

577
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,069
stopped
it's really annoying i went too far here

578
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
it's really annoying i went too far here
 

579
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,470
it's really annoying i went too far here
those out all right

580
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
those out all right
 

581
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,069
those out all right
uh let me get down the rest of these

582
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
uh let me get down the rest of these
 

583
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,829
uh let me get down the rest of these
pistons and then we'll start placing the

584
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
pistons and then we'll start placing the
 

585
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,310
pistons and then we'll start placing the
water

586
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320

 

587
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,310

so we're actually almost done here we

588
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
so we're actually almost done here we
 

589
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,310
so we're actually almost done here we
just have to work out a few more details

590
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
just have to work out a few more details
 

591
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,470
just have to work out a few more details
with this build

592
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
with this build
 

593
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,350
with this build
uh let's put the water down though so

594
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
uh let's put the water down though so
 

595
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,470
uh let's put the water down though so
the water

596
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
the water
 

597
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,310
the water
this is why i like ice too by the way

598
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
this is why i like ice too by the way
 

599
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,590
this is why i like ice too by the way
it's it's portable water

600
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
it's it's portable water
 

601
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,110
it's it's portable water
it's so easy to place instead of like

602
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
it's so easy to place instead of like
 

603
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,550
it's so easy to place instead of like
carrying water buckets all over the

604
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
carrying water buckets all over the
 

605
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:12,949
carrying water buckets all over the
place

606
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
place
 

607
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,990
place
this is so much better uh we're gonna

608
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
this is so much better uh we're gonna
 

609
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,470
this is so much better uh we're gonna
have

610
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480

 

611
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,590

water all below these pistons like this

612
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
water all below these pistons like this
 

613
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,990
water all below these pistons like this
source

614
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
source
 

615
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,509
source
blocks the stuff below the pistons won't

616
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
blocks the stuff below the pistons won't
 

617
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,190
blocks the stuff below the pistons won't
freeze because they don't have a view to

618
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
freeze because they don't have a view to
 

619
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,710
freeze because they don't have a view to
the sky

620
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
the sky
 

621
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,389
the sky
um then we'll want to put a few blocks

622
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
um then we'll want to put a few blocks
 

623
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,629
um then we'll want to put a few blocks
over top these edge ones

624
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
over top these edge ones
 

625
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,030
over top these edge ones
so that even if like we don't want these

626
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
so that even if like we don't want these
 

627
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,590
so that even if like we don't want these
to turn to ice here

628
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
to turn to ice here
 

629
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,790
to turn to ice here
so if these blocks all disappear

630
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800
so if these blocks all disappear
 

631
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,269
so if these blocks all disappear
with this setup it'll be able to

632
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
with this setup it'll be able to
 

633
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,150
with this setup it'll be able to
recreate

634
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
recreate
 

635
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,670
recreate
the water i'll just show you

636
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
the water i'll just show you
 

637
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,350
the water i'll just show you
all right

638
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
all right
 

639
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,790
all right
yep not a problem not a problem good

640
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
yep not a problem not a problem good
 

641
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,750
yep not a problem not a problem good
so now we need to

642
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
so now we need to
 

643
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,430
so now we need to
let's see we're going to need to get

644
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440
let's see we're going to need to get
 

645
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,190
let's see we're going to need to get
some more detector rails going along

646
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
some more detector rails going along
 

647
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,750
some more detector rails going along
beside these pistons here

648
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
beside these pistons here
 

649
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,509
beside these pistons here
let's get these down that's what

650
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
let's get these down that's what
 

651
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,949
let's get these down that's what
that's what will activate them going

652
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
that's what will activate them going
 

653
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,190
that's what will activate them going
sideways and we'll probably want at

654
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
sideways and we'll probably want at
 

655
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,710
sideways and we'll probably want at
least two power rails on

656
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720
least two power rails on
 

657
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,310
least two power rails on
both ends to make sure it can get all

658
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
both ends to make sure it can get all
 

659
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,910
both ends to make sure it can get all
the way across

660
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920

 

661
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,990

like this let me show you the

662
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
like this let me show you the
 

663
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,629
like this let me show you the
cart too what it does it's pretty cool

664
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
cart too what it does it's pretty cool
 

665
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,030
cart too what it does it's pretty cool
so if we get this thing going

666
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040

 

667
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,710

oh let's get out of here quickly we're

668
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
oh let's get out of here quickly we're
 

669
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,790
oh let's get out of here quickly we're
missing it

670
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
missing it
 

671
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,750
missing it
aha so normally it's pretty tough to

672
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
aha so normally it's pretty tough to
 

673
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,389
aha so normally it's pretty tough to
wire

674
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:40,399
wire
 

675
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,189
wire
pistons like when they're in a big panel

676
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:43,199
pistons like when they're in a big panel
 

677
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:43,829
pistons like when they're in a big panel
like this

678
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:43,839
like this
 

679
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,470
like this
going upward uh so i figured i'd just

680
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
going upward uh so i figured i'd just
 

681
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,870
going upward uh so i figured i'd just
use detector rails it's much easier

682
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:48,880
use detector rails it's much easier
 

683
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,829
use detector rails it's much easier
and it looks kind of cool so i think

684
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
and it looks kind of cool so i think
 

685
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,949
and it looks kind of cool so i think
that's good

686
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
that's good
 

687
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,550
that's good
watch this this should activate yeah

688
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
watch this this should activate yeah
 

689
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,310
watch this this should activate yeah
those go up

690
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
those go up
 

691
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,189
those go up
very good it recreated the water oh it's

692
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
very good it recreated the water oh it's
 

693
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,430
very good it recreated the water oh it's
going back

694
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
going back
 

695
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,710
going back
i don't know if i want this thing

696
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
i don't know if i want this thing
 

697
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,389
i don't know if i want this thing
running like all the time like the cart

698
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
running like all the time like the cart
 

699
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,470
running like all the time like the cart
i don't know if it needs to

700
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,480

 

701
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,470

i don't know those are just part of the

702
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
i don't know those are just part of the
 

703
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,870
i don't know those are just part of the
details we have to figure out yet

704
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,880
details we have to figure out yet
 

705
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,269
details we have to figure out yet
but uh if we make the cart come up here

706
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279

 

707
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,870

uh this should work out pretty good

708
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
uh this should work out pretty good
 

709
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,790
uh this should work out pretty good
actually

710
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
actually
 

711
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,550
actually
can this curve no needs more space

712
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560

 

713
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,829

oh is there gonna be enough space i

714
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:29,839
oh is there gonna be enough space i
 

715
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,670
oh is there gonna be enough space i
don't think there is

716
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
don't think there is
 

717
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,150
don't think there is
let's see let's just try it so if this

718
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
let's see let's just try it so if this
 

719
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,829
let's see let's just try it so if this
goes up

720
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
goes up
 

721
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,829
goes up
can we put a oh i think it just worked

722
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
can we put a oh i think it just worked
 

723
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,910
can we put a oh i think it just worked
out actually look at this

724
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
out actually look at this
 

725
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,389
out actually look at this
nice very nice so then i'll go down here

726
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
nice very nice so then i'll go down here
 

727
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,910
nice very nice so then i'll go down here
and then we gotta send it

728
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
and then we gotta send it
 

729
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,829
and then we gotta send it
back to there so maybe we'll just have a

730
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
back to there so maybe we'll just have a
 

731
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,069
back to there so maybe we'll just have a
side

732
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
side
 

733
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,829
side
rail going here so it doesn't have to go

734
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
rail going here so it doesn't have to go
 

735
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,030
rail going here so it doesn't have to go
through the whole middle thing again

736
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
through the whole middle thing again
 

737
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,910
through the whole middle thing again
it'll just go right back to the start

738
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:57,920
it'll just go right back to the start
 

739
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,750
it'll just go right back to the start
okay let me show you how i did the rails

740
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
okay let me show you how i did the rails
 

741
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,150
okay let me show you how i did the rails
so the cart's going this way then i

742
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160
so the cart's going this way then i
 

743
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,269
so the cart's going this way then i
added this rail

744
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
added this rail
 

745
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,829
added this rail
to make it go back to the beginning uh

746
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839
to make it go back to the beginning uh
 

747
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,590
to make it go back to the beginning uh
originally i had i had it going all the

748
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
originally i had i had it going all the
 

749
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,470
originally i had i had it going all the
way through here

750
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
way through here
 

751
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,389
way through here
and it just went around really nice and

752
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
and it just went around really nice and
 

753
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,150
and it just went around really nice and
clean but

754
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
clean but
 

755
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,389
clean but
it didn't work out right because we want

756
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
it didn't work out right because we want
 

757
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,790
it didn't work out right because we want
these lower pistons to activate first

758
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
these lower pistons to activate first
 

759
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,069
these lower pistons to activate first
and then these ones

760
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
and then these ones
 

761
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,710
and then these ones
right after them and if we make it go

762
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
right after them and if we make it go
 

763
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,150
right after them and if we make it go
just around here

764
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
just around here
 

765
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,949
just around here
and the carts go in this direction then

766
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
and the carts go in this direction then
 

767
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,750
and the carts go in this direction then
these ones all get activated and then

768
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:27,760
these ones all get activated and then
 

769
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,389
these ones all get activated and then
it activates the bottom ones so it's in

770
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
it activates the bottom ones so it's in
 

771
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,030
it activates the bottom ones so it's in
reverse

772
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
reverse
 

773
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,710
reverse
we want to make sure these get activate

774
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
we want to make sure these get activate
 

775
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,949
we want to make sure these get activate
first then these so i had to do like a

776
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
first then these so i had to do like a
 

777
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,990
first then these so i had to do like a
figure eight thing here

778
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
figure eight thing here
 

779
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,430
figure eight thing here
it goes down activates those bottom ones

780
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
it goes down activates those bottom ones
 

781
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,350
it goes down activates those bottom ones
there

782
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
there
 

783
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,710
there
and then it comes up around goes this

784
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
and then it comes up around goes this
 

785
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,230
and then it comes up around goes this
direction

786
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
direction
 

787
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,389
direction
goes down here and that comes out over

788
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
goes down here and that comes out over
 

789
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,110
goes down here and that comes out over
here

790
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
here
 

791
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,790
here
it like goes around and then it goes oh

792
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
it like goes around and then it goes oh
 

793
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,710
it like goes around and then it goes oh
i'm getting all turned around and then

794
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
i'm getting all turned around and then
 

795
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,110
i'm getting all turned around and then
it goes right left right left right left

796
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
it goes right left right left right left
 

797
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,629
it goes right left right left right left
all the way down to there

798
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639
all the way down to there
 

799
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,389
all the way down to there
back up and around down

800
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399

 

801
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,470

oh it's it's a little confusing but it

802
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
oh it's it's a little confusing but it
 

803
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,749
oh it's it's a little confusing but it
works

804
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
works
 

805
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,749
works
so all right i think it works i haven't

806
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
so all right i think it works i haven't
 

807
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,350
so all right i think it works i haven't
tried it yet

808
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
tried it yet
 

809
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,430
tried it yet
so let's give it a try make sure it does

810
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
so let's give it a try make sure it does
 

811
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,710
so let's give it a try make sure it does
work

812
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:14,720
work
 

813
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,790
work
i just want to start it right here this

814
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
i just want to start it right here this
 

815
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,870
i just want to start it right here this
is kind of the beginning

816
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,880
is kind of the beginning
 

817
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,269
is kind of the beginning
okay they get pushed sideways

818
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279

 

819
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,949

no darn it i forgot about that problem

820
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
no darn it i forgot about that problem
 

821
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,470
no darn it i forgot about that problem
i don't want to move this block because

822
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
i don't want to move this block because
 

823
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,230
i don't want to move this block because
it's keeping the water in place there i

824
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
it's keeping the water in place there i
 

825
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,790
it's keeping the water in place there i
actually

826
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:36,800
actually
 

827
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,509
actually
let it uh leak out and erect all my

828
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519
let it uh leak out and erect all my
 

829
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,829
let it uh leak out and erect all my
rails and i had to replace them

830
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
rails and i had to replace them
 

831
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,310
rails and i had to replace them
i i'll have to move this back one more i

832
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
i i'll have to move this back one more i
 

833
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,870
i i'll have to move this back one more i
guess

834
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:46,880

 

835
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,030

just about got it there we are let's try
it one more time

890
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,029
yay so pushes those up it pushes them
sideways

896
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
sideways
 

897
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,070
sideways
and pushes them up oh it'll do it on

898
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
and pushes them up oh it'll do it on
 

899
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,590
and pushes them up oh it'll do it on
the next trip i guess on this trip these

900
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
the next trip i guess on this trip these
 

901
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,310
the next trip i guess on this trip these
ones will get pushed up though

902
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
ones will get pushed up though
 

903
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,150
ones will get pushed up though
um so a big thing we got to watch for

904
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
um so a big thing we got to watch for
 

905
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,549
um so a big thing we got to watch for
here is how long it takes to do a cycle

906
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559
here is how long it takes to do a cycle
 

907
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,070
here is how long it takes to do a cycle
as well like is this ice going to be

908
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
as well like is this ice going to be
 

909
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,029
as well like is this ice going to be
frozen

910
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
frozen
 

911
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,950
frozen
by the time it gets back or should we

912
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
by the time it gets back or should we
 

913
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,870
by the time it gets back or should we
make it wait a while

914
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
make it wait a while
 

915
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,549
make it wait a while
looks like we only have three ice blocks

916
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
looks like we only have three ice blocks
 

917
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,070
looks like we only have three ice blocks
there currently

918
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,080
there currently
 

919
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,510
there currently
or four

920
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520

 

921
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,630

all right these ones are gonna go up now

922
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640

 

923
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,990

oh oh i didn't put a cover over it

924
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
oh oh i didn't put a cover over it
 

925
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,669
oh oh i didn't put a cover over it
so i didn't create the water properly

926
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
so i didn't create the water properly
 

927
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,029
so i didn't create the water properly
okay

928
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039

937
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,029
i'm not sure about it's gonna make these
side ones

938
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
side ones
 

939
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,830
side ones
like a vertical column all the way up

940
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
like a vertical column all the way up
 

941
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,350
like a vertical column all the way up
first and then it's gonna be the next

942
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360
first and then it's gonna be the next
 

943
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,750
first and then it's gonna be the next
row

944
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
row
 

945
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,789
row
all the way up and next roll next row

946
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
all the way up and next roll next row
 

947
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,789
all the way up and next roll next row
not roll

948
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:10,799
not roll
 

949
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,070
not roll

torches are gone rails are backed in
place let's try it out again let's just

964
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
place let's try it out again let's just
 

965
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,870
place let's try it out again let's just
watch it for a bit

966
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
watch it for a bit
 

967
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,230
watch it for a bit
see what it does make sure it's all okay

968
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
see what it does make sure it's all okay
 

969
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,990
see what it does make sure it's all okay
before we cover it up because i'm gonna

970
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
before we cover it up because i'm gonna
 

971
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,230
before we cover it up because i'm gonna
hide most these pistons

972
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240

 

973
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,710

yeah it's looking good looking good

974
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
yeah it's looking good looking good
 

975
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,470
yeah it's looking good looking good
there's gonna be a layer of ice

976
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,480
there's gonna be a layer of ice
 

977
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,270
there's gonna be a layer of ice
one thick right above the whole middle

978
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
one thick right above the whole middle
 

979
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,070
one thick right above the whole middle
thing

980
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,080
thing
 

981
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,150
thing
so the idea isn't that you harvest all

982
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
so the idea isn't that you harvest all
 

983
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,190
so the idea isn't that you harvest all
the ice just

984
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
the ice just
 

985
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,710
the ice just
but there'll be one layer you don't

986
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
but there'll be one layer you don't
 

987
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,270
but there'll be one layer you don't
harvest that you walk on and

988
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,280
harvest that you walk on and
 

989
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,270
harvest that you walk on and
and it'll help make it look better and

990
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
and it'll help make it look better and
 

991
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,310
and it'll help make it look better and
and work better

992
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
and work better
 

993
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,510
and work better
because i'm going to be putting blocks

994
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520
because i'm going to be putting blocks
 

995
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,029
because i'm going to be putting blocks
over top like these pistons these rails

996
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039
over top like these pistons these rails
 

997
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,789
over top like these pistons these rails
all flush with the ground is how i

998
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:06,799
all flush with the ground is how i
 

999
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,710
all flush with the ground is how i
designed it that's why we wanted these

1000
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
designed it that's why we wanted these
 

1001
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,830
designed it that's why we wanted these
detector rails along

1002
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
detector rails along
 

1003
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,230
detector rails along
the side of this instead of blowers or

1004
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,240
the side of this instead of blowers or
 

1005
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,830
the side of this instead of blowers or
above it or something

1006
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840

 

1007
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,029

yeah so it looks like it's going

1008
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:23,039

 

1009
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,510

yeah and i'm gonna try and make it out

1010
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:25,520
yeah and i'm gonna try and make it out
 

1011
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,470
yeah and i'm gonna try and make it out
of prismarine blocks i think

1012
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480
of prismarine blocks i think
 

1013

it goes really quickly you need you need
 

1057
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,710
it goes really quickly you need you need
a lot of it to really build anything

1058
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
a lot of it to really build anything
 

1059

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,200
make sure it starts the next column
 

1071
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,070
make sure it starts the next column
without any problems and it has

1072
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
without any problems and it has
 

1073
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,909
without any problems and it has
so that's cool looks pretty neat

1074
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:33,919
so that's cool looks pretty neat

i might harvest some of this ice and

1078
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:38,559
i might harvest some of this ice and
 

1079
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,909
i might harvest some of this ice and
just put down the floor

1080
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
just put down the floor
 

1081
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,310
just put down the floor
of ice that it's supposed to have after

1082
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,320
of ice that it's supposed to have after
 

1083
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,909
of ice that it's supposed to have after
the first harvest just so you can see

1084
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
the first harvest just so you can see
 

1085
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,590
the first harvest just so you can see
what it looks like

1086
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
what it looks like
 

1087
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,350
what it looks like
when it's when it's done properly

1088
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,360
when it's when it's done properly
 

1089
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,110
when it's when it's done properly
so there we go we got an ice floor in

1090
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120
so there we go we got an ice floor in
 

1091
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,710
so there we go we got an ice floor in
the middle this is what it's supposed to

1092
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
the middle this is what it's supposed to
 

1093
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,669
the middle this is what it's supposed to
look like

1094
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:53,679
look like
 

1095
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,590
look like
and we would harvest everything from

1096
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,600
and we would harvest everything from
 

1097
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,110
and we would harvest everything from
this block up

1098
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,120
this block up
 

1099
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,830
this block up
uh when whenever we want to uh so it's

1100
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
uh when whenever we want to uh so it's
 

1101
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,070
uh when whenever we want to uh so it's
gonna create a giant 10 by 10 by

1102
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,080
gonna create a giant 10 by 10 by
 

1103
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,390
gonna create a giant 10 by 10 by
10 cube of ice here which is a thousand

1104
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
10 cube of ice here which is a thousand
 

1105
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,110
10 cube of ice here which is a thousand
blocks

1106
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120
blocks
 

1107
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,310
blocks
15 stacks of ice per harvest

1108
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
15 stacks of ice per harvest
 

1109
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,990
15 stacks of ice per harvest
which is pretty good it looks like it's

1110
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,000
which is pretty good it looks like it's
 

1111
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,430
which is pretty good it looks like it's
going to fill up pretty quick too like

1112
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
going to fill up pretty quick too like
 

1113
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,190
going to fill up pretty quick too like
probably only

1114
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
probably only
 

1115
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,950
probably only
four or five hours of running if i was

1116
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
four or five hours of running if i was
 

1117
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,909
four or five hours of running if i was
to guess

1118
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919

 

1119
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,549

which is way more ice than i use so i'll

1120
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
which is way more ice than i use so i'll
 

1121
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,909
which is way more ice than i use so i'll
probably shut it off

1122
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
probably shut it off
 

1123
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,710
probably shut it off
every so often as i get the ice so it's

1124
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,720
every so often as i get the ice so it's
 

1125
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,029
every so often as i get the ice so it's
not running all the time

1126
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
not running all the time
 

1127
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,909
not running all the time
but yeah pretty cool pretty cool this is

1128
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:29,919
but yeah pretty cool pretty cool this is
 

1129
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,149
but yeah pretty cool pretty cool this is
the last of the ice 34 blocks but we

1130
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
the last of the ice 34 blocks but we
 

1131
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,070
the last of the ice 34 blocks but we
will have more soon

1132
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
will have more soon
 

1133

turns out this is a corrupted chunk

1156
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
turns out this is a corrupted chunk
 

1157
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,310
turns out this is a corrupted chunk
where the blacksmith was ah

1158
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,320
where the blacksmith was ah
 

1159
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,430
where the blacksmith was ah

that means what it's doing it can read

1162
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:14,960
that means what it's doing it can read
 

1163
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,070
that means what it's doing it can read
the chunk okay but it can't save to that

1164
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,080
the chunk okay but it can't save to that
 

1165
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,750
the chunk okay but it can't save to that
chunk anymore

1166
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:19,760
chunk anymore
 

1167
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,149
chunk anymore
um which is not something i've ever had

1168
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:22,159
um which is not something i've ever had
 

1169
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,669
um which is not something i've ever had
happened to me before in a world

1170
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679
happened to me before in a world
 

1171
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,750
happened to me before in a world
so you can place blocks in that chunk

1172
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
so you can place blocks in that chunk
 

1173
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,549
so you can place blocks in that chunk
and it's okay right but as soon as you

1174
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:32,559
and it's okay right but as soon as you
 

1175
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,789
and it's okay right but as soon as you
leave the area in it or shut down the

1176
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:34,799
leave the area in it or shut down the
 

1177
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,669
leave the area in it or shut down the
world

1178
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
world
 

1179
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,350
world
this chunk unloads and when it tries to

1180
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,360
this chunk unloads and when it tries to
 

1181
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,590
this chunk unloads and when it tries to
reload it since it wasn't able to save

1182
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600
reload it since it wasn't able to save
 

1183
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:39,909
reload it since it wasn't able to save
it

1184
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
it
 

1185
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,710
it
it it uh returns to whatever it was

1186
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
it it uh returns to whatever it was
 

1187
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,390
it it uh returns to whatever it was
when it corrupted so

1188
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,400
when it corrupted so
 

1189
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,070
when it corrupted so
let me demonstrate uh

1190
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,080
let me demonstrate uh
 

1191
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,310
let me demonstrate uh
here look over here where it says chunk

1192
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
here look over here where it says chunk
 

1193
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,390
here look over here where it says chunk
0 13 10 that's the position

1194
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,400
0 13 10 that's the position
 

1195
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,590
0 13 10 that's the position
the in the in is the chunk number

1196
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:03,600
the in the in is the chunk number
 

1197
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,710
the in the in is the chunk number
so we're at negative 20 here

1198
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:06,720
so we're at negative 20 here
 

1199
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,830
so we're at negative 20 here
negative 20 is okay negative 19

1200
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
negative 20 is okay negative 19
 

1201
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,870
negative 20 is okay negative 19
2 8 is the corrupted chunk

1202
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:12,880
2 8 is the corrupted chunk
 

1203
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,430
2 8 is the corrupted chunk
so anything put in there is going to

1204
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:15,440
so anything put in there is going to
 

1205
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,350
so anything put in there is going to
disappear when this area

1206
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
disappear when this area
 

1207
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,710
disappear when this area
unloads so i'm just going to exit out

1208
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
unloads so i'm just going to exit out
 

1209
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,909
unloads so i'm just going to exit out
go back in

1210
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:23,919

 

1211
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,950

and all those blocks are gone so that

1212
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:26,960
and all those blocks are gone so that
 

1213
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,110
and all those blocks are gone so that
really stinks i don't know

1214
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,120
really stinks i don't know
 

1215
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,230
really stinks i don't know
really what to do with that uh

1216
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,240
really what to do with that uh
 

1217
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,430
really what to do with that uh
it could be a result of the snapshots or

1218
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
it could be a result of the snapshots or
 

1219
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,549
it could be a result of the snapshots or
it could

1220
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
it could
 

1221
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,710
it could
just be it corrupted a long time ago and

1222
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
just be it corrupted a long time ago and
 

1223
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,549
just be it corrupted a long time ago and
i never noticed because

1224
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:40,559
i never noticed because
 

1225
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,310
i never noticed because
i haven't changed anything in this area

1226
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,320
i haven't changed anything in this area
 

1227
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,070
i haven't changed anything in this area
in a long long time

1228
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,080
in a long long time
 

1229
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,669
in a long long time
and i think that's what it is actually i

1230
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:45,679
and i think that's what it is actually i
 

1231
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,269
and i think that's what it is actually i
don't think it is the snapshots like i

1232
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:47,279
don't think it is the snapshots like i
 

1233
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,549
don't think it is the snapshots like i
thought it might be the glitched

1234
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:48,559
thought it might be the glitched
 

1235
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,149
thought it might be the glitched
outdoors up there

1236
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
outdoors up there
 

1237
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,789
outdoors up there
that messed it up but the priest had a

1238
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:52,799
that messed it up but the priest had a
 

1239
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,549
that messed it up but the priest had a
glitched outdoor too

1240
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:54,559
glitched outdoor too
 

1241
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,909
glitched outdoor too
and that didn't cause any problems um

1242
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
and that didn't cause any problems um
 

1243
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,750
and that didn't cause any problems um
so it's not that it's something else

1244
00:24:59,750 --> 00:24:59,760
so it's not that it's something else
 

1245
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,909
so it's not that it's something else
that happened probably a long time ago

1246
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
that happened probably a long time ago
 

1247
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,390
that happened probably a long time ago
