00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
could probably talk easily half an hour
 

363
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,630

um it's pretty interesting it
 

371
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,910
um it's pretty interesting it
it's a good system i like the idea of

372
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
it's a good system i like the idea of
 

373
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,509
it's a good system i like the idea of
trading stuff

374
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519

379
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,750
stuff that has a value to it
that you don't really need maybe you

380
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
that you don't really need maybe you
 

381
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,670
that you don't really need maybe you
have too much of it like

382
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
have too much of it like
 

383
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,550
have too much of it like
i have over a double chest full of coal

384
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
i have over a double chest full of coal
 

385
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,990
i have over a double chest full of coal
which i probably

386
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
which i probably
 

387
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,069
which i probably
am not ever going to use so i like the

388
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
am not ever going to use so i like the
 

389
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,389
am not ever going to use so i like the
idea that i can trade that

390
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
idea that i can trade that
 

391
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,150
idea that i can trade that
for something more valuable to me

392
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
for something more valuable to me
 

393
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,829
for something more valuable to me

00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:13,839
um like diamond armor which isn't really
 

395
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,350

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,990
of diamonds too
but you know what i mean

400
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
but you know what i mean
 

401
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,670
but you know what i mean
so the trading system itself is pretty

402
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
so the trading system itself is pretty
 

403
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,110
so the trading system itself is pretty
cool it does

404
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
cool it does
 

405
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,990
cool it does
make the game slightly easier because it

406
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
make the game slightly easier because it
 

407
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,110
make the game slightly easier because it
gives you another way of getting items

408
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120

 

409
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,590

which is fine as long as mo yang

410
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
which is fine as long as mo yang
 

411
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,590
which is fine as long as mo yang
you know tried to incorporate ways to

412
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
you know tried to incorporate ways to
 

413
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,350
you know tried to incorporate ways to
make the game more challenging as well

414
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
make the game more challenging as well
 

415
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,190
make the game more challenging as well
like

416
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
like
 

417
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,030
like
this patch at least came up with one way

418
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
this patch at least came up with one way
 

419
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,710
this patch at least came up with one way
of doing that they increased the damage

420
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
of doing that they increased the damage
 

421
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,590
of doing that they increased the damage
creepers do

422
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
creepers do
 

423
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,069
creepers do
which is great so

424
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079

 

425
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,150

yeah it's got to be get give and take

426
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
yeah it's got to be get give and take
 

427
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,590
yeah it's got to be get give and take
if you give you got to take something

428
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
if you give you got to take something
 

429
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,069
if you give you got to take something
too so if you make the game easier in

430
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
too so if you make the game easier in
 

431
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,110
too so if you make the game easier in
one way you got to make it more

432
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
one way you got to make it more
 

433
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,670
one way you got to make it more
challenging

434
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
challenging
 

435
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,629
challenging
in another i i feel but uh

436
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639

 

437
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,790

let's just go over how the trading works

438
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
let's just go over how the trading works
 

439
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,269
let's just go over how the trading works
so

440
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279

 

441
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,470

it seems you only get new trade uh

442
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
it seems you only get new trade uh
 

443
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,990
it seems you only get new trade uh
offers if you trade them the last item

444
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
offers if you trade them the last item
 

445
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,150
offers if you trade them the last item
so if i do that

446
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
so if i do that
 

447
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,150
so if i do that
there's a chance i might get a new offer

448
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
there's a chance i might get a new offer
 

449
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,629
there's a chance i might get a new offer

451
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,230
i don't think it's always he gets that

time

490
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079

492
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
i'm wondering if the offer goes away
 

493
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,590
i'm wondering if the offer goes away
when i leave the screen or if it can go

494
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
when i leave the screen or if it can go
 

495
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,069
when i leave the screen or if it can go
away

00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
away
 

497
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,990
away
while i'm in it as well i think it's

498
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
while i'm in it as well i think it's
 

499
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,190
while i'm in it as well i think it's
only when i leave it

500
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
only when i leave it
 

501
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,150
only when i leave it
still there

502
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160

 

503
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,230

and it's gone so three tries and it

504
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
and it's gone so three tries and it

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,190
and it's gone so three tries and it
disappeared

506
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200

 

507
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,110

so that may be random or it may not be

508
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
so that may be random or it may not be
 

509
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,870
so that may be random or it may not be

the villager trading system it can be

520
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
the villager trading system it can be
 

521
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,030
the villager trading system it can be
exploited

522
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
exploited
 

523
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,710
exploited
they did a better job at this than i was

524
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
they did a better job at this than i was
 

525

expecting when it first came out it

526
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
expecting when it first came out it
 

527
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,750

looked like it was going to be

528
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
looked like it was going to be
 

529
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,110
looked like it was going to be
extremely easy to exploit and now it

530
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
extremely easy to exploit and now it
 

531
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,870
extremely easy to exploit and now it
seems like

532
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
seems like
 

533
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,310
seems like
it's more challenging especially

534
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
it's more challenging especially
 

535
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,990
it's more challenging especially
considering the offer can disappear

536
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000

 

537
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,230

one thing i want to try out too is if

538
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
one thing i want to try out too is if

maybe i'll make some and we'll just see
that first

544
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279

 

545
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,030

actually this gives us a good chance to

546
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
actually this gives us a good chance to
 

547
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,910
actually this gives us a good chance to
try out our new furnace room and also

548

um so i might have to look into
 

569
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,430
um so i might have to look into
ways to speed it up

so
 

613
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,310
so
for example say i had thousands and

614
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
for example say i had thousands and
 

615
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,389
for example say i had thousands and
thousands of paper

616
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
thousands of paper
 

617
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,069
thousands of paper
i might throw it all on the ground where

618
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
i might throw it all on the ground where
 

619
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,990
i might throw it all on the ground where
i'm standing here

620
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
i'm standing here
 

621
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,150
i'm standing here
and and as i trade with the villager

622
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160

most of stuff this is this would be a

724
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
most of stuff this is this would be a
 

725
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,190
most of stuff this is this would be a
terrible deal like i would not want to

726
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
terrible deal like i would not want to
 

727
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,830
terrible deal like i would not want to
make that

728
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
make that
 

729
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,270
make that
this is a terrible deal it's not really

730
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,280
this is a terrible deal it's not really
 

731
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,230
this is a terrible deal it's not really
stuff you would have

732
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
stuff you would have
 

733
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,669
stuff you would have
laying around that they're offering to

734
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
laying around that they're offering to
 

735
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,950
laying around that they're offering to
buy

736
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960
buy
 

737
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,710
buy
for the most part like the librarian

738
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:38,720
for the most part like the librarian
 

739
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,510
for the most part like the librarian
who has paper laying around i don't who

740
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
who has paper laying around i don't who
 

741
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,150
who has paper laying around i don't who
has books laying around i don't

742
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
has books laying around i don't
 

743
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,669
has books laying around i don't
so you almost have to grind to make them

744
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
so you almost have to grind to make them
 

745
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,789
so you almost have to grind to make them
just so you can trade i don't i don't

746
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
just so you can trade i don't i don't
 

747
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,430
just so you can trade i don't i don't
know it's

748
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,440
know it's
 

749
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,070
know it's
it's a little weird to me it would make

750
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,080
it's a little weird to me it would make
 

751
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,630
it's a little weird to me it would make
sense

752
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:54,640
sense
 

753
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,310
sense
more sense like if they bought wood or

754
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,320
more sense like if they bought wood or
 

755
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,710
more sense like if they bought wood or
something something you have lots of or

756
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:58,720
something something you have lots of or
 

757
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,110
something something you have lots of or
cobblestone or

758
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120
cobblestone or
 

759
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,950
cobblestone or
you know something that has a little bit

760
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
you know something that has a little bit
 

761
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,950
you know something that has a little bit
of a value to it but you might not need

762
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:04,960
of a value to it but you might not need
 

763
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,510
of a value to it but you might not need
and you might want something better but

764
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
and you might want something better but
 

765
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,669
and you might want something better but
less of it

766
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
less of it
 

767
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,710
less of it
yeah so maybe back to talking about why

768
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
yeah so maybe back to talking about why
 

769
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,549
yeah so maybe back to talking about why
it seems like the villager system was

770
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
it seems like the villager system was
 

771
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,990
it seems like the villager system was
meant to be exploited

772
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
meant to be exploited
 

773
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,150
meant to be exploited
uh in general their trades are a

774
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
uh in general their trades are a
 

775
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,270
uh in general their trades are a
terrible

776
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,280
terrible
 

777
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,070
terrible
deal like that's a terrible deal in my

778
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080
deal like that's a terrible deal in my
 

779
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,190
deal like that's a terrible deal in my
opinion

780
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200

 

781
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,710

and i'm going to use a blacksmith as the

782
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
and i'm going to use a blacksmith as the
 

783
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,510
and i'm going to use a blacksmith as the
main example for this you can trade him

784
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
main example for this you can trade him
 

785
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,390
main example for this you can trade him
four or five diamonds to get one emerald

786
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
four or five diamonds to get one emerald
 

787
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,990
four or five diamonds to get one emerald
and then if you were to buy

788
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
and then if you were to buy
 

789
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,230
and then if you were to buy
a diamond chess piece from him it would

790
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
a diamond chess piece from him it would
 

791
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,029
a diamond chess piece from him it would
cost you

792
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
cost you
 

793
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,470
cost you
16 to 18 emeralds so

794
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,480
16 to 18 emeralds so
 

795
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,190
16 to 18 emeralds so
that's like spending 64 to 90 diamonds

796
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
that's like spending 64 to 90 diamonds
 

797
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,230
that's like spending 64 to 90 diamonds
on a diamond chess piece so that's 8 to

798
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,240
on a diamond chess piece so that's 8 to
 

799
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,990
on a diamond chess piece so that's 8 to
11.25 times more expensive than if you

800
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
11.25 times more expensive than if you
 

801
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,510
11.25 times more expensive than if you
were to just make it yourself

802
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
were to just make it yourself
 

803
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,230
were to just make it yourself
if you were to exchange the diamonds and

804
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
if you were to exchange the diamonds and
 

805
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,630
if you were to exchange the diamonds and
then

806
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
then
 

807
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,830
then
buy something made of diamonds it's

808
00:19:59,830 --> 00:19:59,840
buy something made of diamonds it's
 

809
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,750
buy something made of diamonds it's
it's a total ripoff um

810
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
it's a total ripoff um
 

811
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,430
it's a total ripoff um
so just making the odd trade here and

812
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
so just making the odd trade here and
 

813
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,190
so just making the odd trade here and
there with these guys is not

814
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
there with these guys is not
 

815
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,390
there with these guys is not
the best thing to do because this is a

816
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400
the best thing to do because this is a
 

817
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,270
the best thing to do because this is a
good trade

818
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
good trade
 

819
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,510
good trade
in my opinion this is the best trade for

820
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
in my opinion this is the best trade for
 

821
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,669
in my opinion this is the best trade for
getting emeralds

822
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:33,760
now i got xb before
 

923
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,510
now i got xb before
when i was confused there because i took

924
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,520
when i was confused there because i took
 

925
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,110
when i was confused there because i took
the items out of the furnace

926
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
the items out of the furnace
 

927
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,870
the items out of the furnace
that's that's the action that gives it

928
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:38,880
that's that's the action that gives it
 

929
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,110
that's that's the action that gives it
to you

930
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120

 

931
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,310

just got some and the reason

932
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
just got some and the reason
 

933
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,710
just got some and the reason
it's that is because you can't put items

934
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
it's that is because you can't put items
 

935
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,230
it's that is because you can't put items
into that slot if you could you could

936
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
into that slot if you could you could
 

937
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,710
into that slot if you could you could
just

938
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:50,720
just
 

939
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,230
just
put it in take it out put it in take it

940
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
put it in take it out put it in take it
 

941
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,950
put it in take it out put it in take it
out and keep getting xp from that

942
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
out and keep getting xp from that
 

943
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,630
out and keep getting xp from that
the only way to get it into that slot is

944
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,640
the only way to get it into that slot is
 

945
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,669
the only way to get it into that slot is
by smelting it

946
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679

 

947
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,270

um it's not really

948
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
um it's not really
 

949
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,669
um it's not really
a liable way of leveling up like you get

950
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:05,679
a liable way of leveling up like you get
 

951
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,110
a liable way of leveling up like you get
some from it but it's not much like

952
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
some from it but it's not much like
 

953
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,630
some from it but it's not much like
and certain things give you more than

954
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:10,640
and certain things give you more than
 

955
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,950
and certain things give you more than
others like i think 10 cobblestone gets

956
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
others like i think 10 cobblestone gets
 

957
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,430
others like i think 10 cobblestone gets
you

958
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
you
 

959
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,669
you
one xp when you smelt it while iron

960
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:17,679
one xp when you smelt it while iron
 

961
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,990
one xp when you smelt it while iron
gets you a lot more

962
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,000
gets you a lot more
 

963
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,789
gets you a lot more
17 19 level 19

964
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:28,799

 

965
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,830

20 um

966

970
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:43,919

 

971
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,149

okay okay let's move on here we talked

972
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:46,159
okay okay let's move on here we talked
 

973
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,590
okay okay let's move on here we talked
about that enough

974
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,600
about that enough
 

975
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,310
about that enough
uh another new feature is that items can

976
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,320
uh another new feature is that items can
 

977
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,350
uh another new feature is that items can
stack

978
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
stack
 

979
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,870
stack
together

980
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880

 

981
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,870

or entities to help prevent lag

982
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:58,880
or entities to help prevent lag
 

983
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,789
or entities to help prevent lag
there's a test i want to do with this

984
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
there's a test i want to do with this
 

985
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,070
there's a test i want to do with this
i'm wondering if

986
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,080
i'm wondering if
 

987
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,350
i'm wondering if
when you throw a new item into the stack

988
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360
when you throw a new item into the stack
 

989
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,470
when you throw a new item into the stack
if that renews the timer

990
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
if that renews the timer
 

991
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,669
if that renews the timer
on when it despawns so

992
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
on when it despawns so
 

993
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,430
on when it despawns so
i'm wondering like for example if i

994
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,440
i'm wondering like for example if i
 

995
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,909
i'm wondering like for example if i
throw one here and i throw one here

996
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:15,919
throw one here and i throw one here
 

997
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,950
throw one here and i throw one here
if after like three minutes or so i

998
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:18,960
if after like three minutes or so i
 

999
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,190
if after like three minutes or so i
throw another one into that stack

1000
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,200
throw another one into that stack
 

1001
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,909
throw another one into that stack
if that will renew the five minutes

1002
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:23,919
if that will renew the five minutes
 

1003
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,230
if that will renew the five minutes
despawn timer on that one

1004
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
despawn timer on that one
 

1005
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,310
despawn timer on that one
so that's what i'm going to do i'm gonna

1006
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,320
so that's what i'm going to do i'm gonna
 

1007
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,830
so that's what i'm going to do i'm gonna
i'm gonna throw one here

1008
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:29,840
i'm gonna throw one here
 

1009
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,950
i'm gonna throw one here
i'm gonna throw one here after

1010
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
i'm gonna throw one here after
 

1011
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,149
i'm gonna throw one here after
a few minutes i'm gonna throw another

1012
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:34,159
a few minutes i'm gonna throw another
 

1013
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,990
a few minutes i'm gonna throw another
one in here and i want to see if

1014
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000
one in here and i want to see if
 

1015
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,950
one in here and i want to see if
if this one disappears way before it

1016
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960

 

1017
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,269

ah they disappeared at about the same

1018
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:43,279
ah they disappeared at about the same
 

1019
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,070
ah they disappeared at about the same
time which

1020
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,080
time which
 

1021
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,510
time which
means if you have

1022
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:47,520
means if you have
 

1023
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,590
means if you have
an item down and another one joins with

1024
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:49,600
an item down and another one joins with
 

1025
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,789
an item down and another one joins with
it it

1026
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:50,799
it it
 

1027
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,269
it it
gets whatever timing the first one had

1028
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
gets whatever timing the first one had
 

1029
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:53,990
gets whatever timing the first one had
so if

1030
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,000
so if
 

1031
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,909
so if
if that was down for four minutes and

1032
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:55,919
if that was down for four minutes and
 

1033
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,549
if that was down for four minutes and
another item

1034
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
another item
 

1035
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,669
another item
joined together with it

1036
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:01,679
joined together with it
 

1037
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,029
joined together with it
like that then in another minute both

1038
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:05,039
like that then in another minute both
 

1039
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,390
like that then in another minute both
blocks will disappear so

1040
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400
blocks will disappear so
 

1041
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,190
blocks will disappear so
keep that in mind

1042
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,200

 

1043
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,950

and one of the biggest features i've

1044
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:14,960
and one of the biggest features i've
 

1045
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,950
and one of the biggest features i've
been looking forward to with the 1.3

1046
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:16,960
been looking forward to with the 1.3
 

1047
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,510
been looking forward to with the 1.3
patch

1048
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520
patch
 

1049
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,669
patch
is getting ice

1050
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:21,679

 

1051
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,070

oh that's awesome been waiting so long

1052
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,080
oh that's awesome been waiting so long
 

1053
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,870
oh that's awesome been waiting so long
for this stuff

1054
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880

 

1055
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,710

can't make water in the nether with it

1056
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
can't make water in the nether with it
 

1057
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,070
can't make water in the nether with it
but you know what

1058
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,080

 

1059
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,510

there's so many other things you can do

1060
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:33,520
there's so many other things you can do
 

1061
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,430
there's so many other things you can do
with it anyway

1062
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,440
with it anyway
 

1063
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,909
with it anyway
the main the main use for ice is for

1064
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:37,919
the main the main use for ice is for
 

1065
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,430
the main the main use for ice is for
moving items around because

1066
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:41,440

 

1067
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,110

they slide you can move an item as far

1068
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120
they slide you can move an item as far
 

1069
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,789
they slide you can move an item as far
as you want on flat ground

1070
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:46,799
as you want on flat ground
 

1071
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,110
as you want on flat ground
otherwise in a normal water stream you

1072
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,120
otherwise in a normal water stream you
 

1073
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,230
otherwise in a normal water stream you
got to go down every eight blocks and

1074
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,240
got to go down every eight blocks and
 

1075
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,669
got to go down every eight blocks and
it's challenging um so yeah moving

1076
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:55,679
it's challenging um so yeah moving
 

1077
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,230
it's challenging um so yeah moving
items around my sheep farm

1078
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,240
items around my sheep farm
 

1079
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,310
items around my sheep farm
my sheep farm i've been waiting for the

1080
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
my sheep farm i've been waiting for the
 

1081
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,830
my sheep farm i've been waiting for the
ice to complete it

1082
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:03,840
ice to complete it
 

1083
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,750
ice to complete it
and with my storage room area i've

1084
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:05,760
and with my storage room area i've
 

1085
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,029
and with my storage room area i've
needed

1086

or i will need ice for all the farms i
 

1089
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,029
or i will need ice for all the farms i
plan on building there as well as some

1090
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,039
plan on building there as well as some
 

1091
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,390
plan on building there as well as some
of the decorative stuff

1092
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,400
of the decorative stuff
 

1093
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,590
of the decorative stuff
i want to do because ice also looks very

1094
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
i want to do because ice also looks very
 

1095
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,149
i want to do because ice also looks very
good

1096
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159

 

1097
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,950

has a lot of unique properties you can

1098
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:22,960
has a lot of unique properties you can
 

1099
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,990
has a lot of unique properties you can
you can move quick on

1100
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,000
you can move quick on
 

1101
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,789
you can move quick on

an overall useful block and i'm glad
 

1105
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,110
an overall useful block and i'm glad
it's

1106

it's
 

1107
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,510
it's
we're able to get it again in the game

1108
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
we're able to get it again in the game
 

1109
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,950
we're able to get it again in the game
in an easy way

1110
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:34,960

 

1111
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,789

okay guys so i'm actually going to build

1112
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:36,799
okay guys so i'm actually going to build
 

1113
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,149
okay guys so i'm actually going to build
something real quick here just a

1114
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:38,159
something real quick here just a
 

1115
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,269
something real quick here just a
temporary

1116
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:39,279
temporary
 

1117
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,789
temporary
temporary thing got my stuff together

1118
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:42,799
temporary thing got my stuff together
 

1119
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,590
temporary thing got my stuff together
uh the problem with taking ice like this

1120
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:45,600
uh the problem with taking ice like this
 

1121
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,669
uh the problem with taking ice like this
is it's going to scar the landscape if i

1122
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:47,679
is it's going to scar the landscape if i
 

1123
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,430
is it's going to scar the landscape if i
keep doing it

1124
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:49,440
keep doing it
 

1125
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,750
keep doing it
because this this ice is gone it's not

1126
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:51,760
because this this ice is gone it's not
 

1127
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,110
because this this ice is gone it's not
coming back

1128
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,120
coming back
 

1129
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,350
coming back
i removed the water and

1130
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
i removed the water and
 

1131
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,110
i removed the water and
the only way to get it back is to

1132
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,120
the only way to get it back is to
 

1133
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,549
the only way to get it back is to
replace the water and let it freeze

1134
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
replace the water and let it freeze
 

1135
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,470
replace the water and let it freeze
again

1136
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:02,480
again
 

1137
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,909
again
and same like if we take it from the

1138
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:03,919
and same like if we take it from the
 

1139
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,710
and same like if we take it from the
ocean we would take it off one layer at

1140
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
ocean we would take it off one layer at
 

1141
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,990
ocean we would take it off one layer at
a time

1142
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,000
a time
 

1143
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,430
a time
and it would freeze you could take off

1144
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,440
and it would freeze you could take off
 

1145
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,510
and it would freeze you could take off
another layer eventually though

1146
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:11,520
another layer eventually though
 

1147
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,110
another layer eventually though
you would get to the bottom and there

1148
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,120
you would get to the bottom and there
 

1149
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,149
you would get to the bottom and there
would be no ocean left

1150
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
would be no ocean left
 

1151
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,389
would be no ocean left
so before i get into the habit of doing

1152
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:18,399
so before i get into the habit of doing
 

1153
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,149
so before i get into the habit of doing
that i want to set up something

1154
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
that i want to set up something
 

1155
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,950
that i want to set up something
that will regenerate ice just something

1156
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
that will regenerate ice just something
 

1157
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,789
that will regenerate ice just something
real simple and quick

1158
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:24,799
real simple and quick
 

1159
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,950
real simple and quick
out in the snowy biome over here there's

1160
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:26,960
out in the snowy biome over here there's
 

1161
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,830
out in the snowy biome over here there's
a nice flat

1162
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
a nice flat
 

1163
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,389
a nice flat
spot up ahead right here

1164
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:32,399
spot up ahead right here
 

1165
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,350
spot up ahead right here
so i'll clear the trees and i'm just

1166
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:35,360
so i'll clear the trees and i'm just
 

1167
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,310
so i'll clear the trees and i'm just
going to make something

1168
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:36,320
going to make something
 

1169
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,350
going to make something
like a 16 by 16

1170
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
like a 16 by 16
 

1171
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,470
like a 16 by 16
pad for for creating ice

1172
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:44,480

 

1173
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,070

so this is what i've been working on

1174
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
so this is what i've been working on
 

1175
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,669
so this is what i've been working on
this is the ice tray

1176
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:47,679
this is the ice tray
 

1177
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,110
this is the ice tray
it's just about done i'm not spending a

1178
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,120
it's just about done i'm not spending a
 

1179
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,190
it's just about done i'm not spending a
whole lot of time on it i just want to

1180
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,200
whole lot of time on it i just want to
 

1181
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,230
whole lot of time on it i just want to
get it up and functioning and

1182
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,240
get it up and functioning and
 

1183
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,909
get it up and functioning and
probably won't even bother replacing the

1184
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:57,919
probably won't even bother replacing the
 

1185
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,310
probably won't even bother replacing the
grass with with this stone just because

1186
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:00,320
grass with with this stone just because
 

1187
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,029
grass with with this stone just because
it's

1188
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:01,039
it's
 

1189
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,630
it's
most likely going to be a temporary

1190
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:02,640
most likely going to be a temporary
 

1191
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,789
most likely going to be a temporary
thing

1192
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:04,799
thing
 

1193
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:12,950
thing
that'll tear down one day soon

1194
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:12,960

 

1195
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,310

it is a 16 by 16 so

1196
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,320
it is a 16 by 16 so
 

1197
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,310
it is a 16 by 16 so
that will yield four stacks of ice

1198
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,320
that will yield four stacks of ice
 

1199
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,389
that will yield four stacks of ice
every time these creepers

1200
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:24,399
every time these creepers
 

1201
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,070
every time these creepers
i'm scared i got no armor on and i

1202
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
i'm scared i got no armor on and i
 

1203
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,190
i'm scared i got no armor on and i
and it's like s p now

1204
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,200

 

1205
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,669

plus they detonate really far away

1206
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679

 

1207
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,029

okay so those are all down so now this

1208
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:41,039
okay so those are all down so now this
 

1209
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:48,870
okay so those are all down so now this
one lever will control all these pistons

1210
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:48,880

 

1211
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:59,990

or one piston what's up with that

1212
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,000

 

1213
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,230

what's going on

1214
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:04,240

 

1215
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:16,950

i just tried this and it worked

1216
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:16,960

 

1217
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,389

oh it's sending power oh that's what oh

1218
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:20,399
oh it's sending power oh that's what oh
 

1219
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,269
oh it's sending power oh that's what oh
sending power back i made a loop here

1220
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:23,279
sending power back i made a loop here
 

1221
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,230
sending power back i made a loop here
okay i'll fix this

1222
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,240
okay i'll fix this
 

1223
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,310
okay i'll fix this
i'm gonna put water in these drops here

1224
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,320
i'm gonna put water in these drops here
 

1225
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,070
i'm gonna put water in these drops here
and it should be good to go

1226
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,080

 

1227
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,070

this is what i did instead it'll work

1228
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,080
this is what i did instead it'll work
 

1229
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,190
this is what i did instead it'll work
it'll work just fine so this is all

1230
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,200
it'll work just fine so this is all
 

1231
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,990
it'll work just fine so this is all
ready to go

1232
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
ready to go
 

1233
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,230
ready to go
i got the water in place all the pistons

1234
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
i got the water in place all the pistons
 

1235
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,510
i got the water in place all the pistons
are ready

1236
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
are ready
 

1237
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,549
are ready
it'll create an infinite spring in this

1238
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:46,559
it'll create an infinite spring in this
 

1239
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,830
it'll create an infinite spring in this
whole thing

1240
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:47,840
whole thing
 

1241
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,950
whole thing
uh when i pull this lever and then that

1242
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:50,960
uh when i pull this lever and then that
 

1243
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:58,389
uh when i pull this lever and then that
will freeze

1244
00:29:58,389 --> 00:29:58,399

 

1245
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,350

and it freezes because this water is

1246
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:01,360
and it freezes because this water is
 

1247
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,789
and it freezes because this water is
exposed to the air

1248
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:02,799
exposed to the air
 

1249
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,470
exposed to the air
this water over here though is covered

1250
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:04,480
this water over here though is covered
 

1251
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,669
this water over here though is covered
so it won't freeze

1252
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:07,679

 

1253
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,870

close that and it's ready to go for the

1254
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:10,880
close that and it's ready to go for the
 

1255
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,110
close that and it's ready to go for the
next time once all this freezes i can

1256
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
next time once all this freezes i can
 

1257
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,470
next time once all this freezes i can
come in here with the

1258
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,480
come in here with the
 

1259
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,750
come in here with the
silk touch remove the layer open it up

1260
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:17,760
silk touch remove the layer open it up
 

1261
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,310
silk touch remove the layer open it up
again to create the new one

1262
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,320
again to create the new one
 

1263
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,310
again to create the new one
nice and simple and only took like

1264
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,320
nice and simple and only took like
 

1265
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,990
nice and simple and only took like
15 minutes to build

1266
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,000

 

1267
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,789

oh yeah also the glitch with dogs in

1268
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:30,799
oh yeah also the glitch with dogs in
 

1269
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,149
oh yeah also the glitch with dogs in
that teleporting is not

1270

that teleporting is not
 

1271
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,870
that teleporting is not
fixed in 1.3 not the pre-release anyway

1272
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:36,880
fixed in 1.3 not the pre-release anyway
 

1273
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,149
fixed in 1.3 not the pre-release anyway
because this guy just randomly

1285
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,389

and now we are at the san quarry because

1286
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:58,399
and now we are at the san quarry because
 

1287
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,909
and now we are at the san quarry because
we're going to try something out here

1288
00:30:59,909 --> 00:30:59,919
we're going to try something out here
 

1289

you can shear leaves really quick in smp

1298
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,080
you can shear leaves really quick in smp
 

1299
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,230
you can shear leaves really quick in smp
a lot faster than

1300
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:14,240
a lot faster than
 

1301
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,430
a lot faster than
in single player before now

1302
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,440
in single player before now
 

1303
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,470
in single player before now
that single player is emulating a server

1304

that single player is emulating a server
 

1305
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,149
that single player is emulating a server
i'm curious to see if that

1306
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:22,159
i'm curious to see if that
 

1307
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,630
i'm curious to see if that
effect has carried over or not so here

1308
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:24,640
effect has carried over or not so here
 

1309
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,590
effect has carried over or not so here
we go

1310
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:25,600
we go
 

1311
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,149
we go
this is efficiency 4

1312
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:30,159

 

1313
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,750

it does sweet

1314
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:33,760
it does sweet
 

1315
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,110
it does sweet
yeah that's another thing i was really

1316
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,120
yeah that's another thing i was really
 

1317
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,950
yeah that's another thing i was really
excited about because

1318
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:36,960
excited about because
 

1319
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,470
excited about because
i do not particularly enjoy gathering

1320
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:40,480
i do not particularly enjoy gathering

sand in single player

1322
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:42,640
sand in single player
 

1323
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,149
sand in single player
usually i would use tnt for it but if we

1324
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:46,159
usually i would use tnt for it but if we
 

1325
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,509
usually i would use tnt for it but if we
can do this now

1326
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
can do this now
 

1327
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,509
can do this now
it's gonna be awesome

1328
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:51,519

 

1329
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,149

so fast

1330
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:56,159

 

1331
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,830

and like look how long the shovel lasts

1332
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840
and like look how long the shovel lasts
 

1333
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,149
and like look how long the shovel lasts
two it's it's so quick

1334
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:00,159
two it's it's so quick
 

1335
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,310
two it's it's so quick
and barely uses up the tool

1336
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:04,320

 

1337
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,669

and it's fun to do

1338
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:07,679

 

1339
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,269

cool wow man that took
 

1341
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,190
cool wow man that took
hardly any time at all it's like two

1342
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,200
hardly any time at all it's like two
 

1343

three minutes filled up my inventory

1344
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:17,840

 

1345
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,710

so much sand i guess i never really

1346
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
so much sand i guess i never really
 

1347
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,750
so much sand i guess i never really
talked about

1348
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:25,760

 

1349
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,789

uh also while

1350
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:28,799
uh also while
 

1351
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,950
uh also while
while you're looking at this uh entity

1352
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
while you're looking at this uh entity
 

1353
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,909
while you're looking at this uh entity
items they

1354
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:31,919
items they
 

1355
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,830
items they
glitch out like they do in s p i think

1356
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:33,840
glitch out like they do in s p i think
 

1357
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,509
glitch out like they do in s p i think
that's actually above

1358
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:35,519
that's actually above
 

1359
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,029
that's actually above
or else below the sand

1360
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:39,039

 

1361
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,630

so you can walk right up to it not pick

1362
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:40,640

blaze farm in just a second
i wanted to enchant some feather falling

1532
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:54,560
i wanted to enchant some feather falling
 

1533
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,910
i wanted to enchant some feather falling
boots

1534
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:55,920
boots
 

1535
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,950
boots
which is i think level 26 is what you

1536
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:58,960
which is i think level 26 is what you
 

1537
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,670
which is i think level 26 is what you
want for that now

1538
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:01,680
want for that now
 

1539
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,790
want for that now
um but it seems you can't get that if

1540
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:04,800
um but it seems you can't get that if
 

1541
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,829
um but it seems you can't get that if
you have your enchanting table maxed out

1542
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:06,839
you have your enchanting table maxed out
 

1543
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,270
you have your enchanting table maxed out
so

1544
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,280
so
 

1545
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,829
so
it's still there's still some benefit to

1546
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:11,839
it's still there's still some benefit to
 

1547
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,109
it's still there's still some benefit to
having a variable

1548
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:13,119
having a variable
 

1549
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,150
having a variable
enchanting table it seems

1550
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,160
enchanting table it seems
 

1551
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:24,069
enchanting table it seems
what will that do oh overdid it

1552
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:24,079

 

1553
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,270

00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,280

 

1555
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,610

um

1556
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:27,620

quite a few books no it still won't drop

1562
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:41,280

 

1563
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,630

00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:02,880

 

1571
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,630

okay maybe we won't block out a corner

1572
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:06,640
okay maybe we won't block out a corner
 

1573

now i don't know if i can get a 26.

1578
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:19,520
now i don't know if i can get a 26.
 

1579
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,990
now i don't know if i can get a 26.
might not be possible

1580
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000

 

1581
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,190

i don't know if the top ones work

1582
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,200
i don't know if the top ones work
 

1583
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,470
i don't know if the top ones work
anymore even they probably do

1584
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:32,480
anymore even they probably do
 

1585
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:39,270
anymore even they probably do
man 24

1586
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:39,280

 

1587
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,710

yeah i don't think i can

1588
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:42,720

 

1589
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,950

all right well we'll do a 24.

1590
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:48,960

 

1591
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:55,349

beautiful wow that's that's really good

1592
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:55,359

 

1593
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,550

i'm safe again so let us check out the

1594
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:58,560
i'm safe again so let us check out the
 

1595
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,790
i'm safe again so let us check out the
blaze farm there is a lot of pistons in

1596
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:00,800
blaze farm there is a lot of pistons in
 

1597
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,710
blaze farm there is a lot of pistons in
this thing and a lot of redstone

1598
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:02,720
this thing and a lot of redstone
 

1599
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,750
this thing and a lot of redstone
which has me worried it takes

1600
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:05,760
which has me worried it takes
 

1601
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,950
which has me worried it takes
i think 825 xp to go from zero to 30 now

1602
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:10,960
i think 825 xp to go from zero to 30 now
 

1603
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,069
i think 825 xp to go from zero to 30 now
which is about 5.6 times less than

1604
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:14,079
which is about 5.6 times less than
 

1605
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:24,710
which is about 5.6 times less than
what it was before before it was 4625

1606
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:24,720

 

1607
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,310

see that i thought would have messed up

1608
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:26,320
see that i thought would have messed up
 

1609
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,510
see that i thought would have messed up
i don't really need that i should take

1610
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:27,520
i don't really need that i should take
 

1611
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,230
i don't really need that i should take
that out

1612
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,240

 

1613
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,990

yeah the pistons aren't giving me

1614
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,000
yeah the pistons aren't giving me
 

1615
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,390
yeah the pistons aren't giving me
trouble like i thought they would

1616
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:34,400
trouble like i thought they would
 

1617
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,750
trouble like i thought they would
they seem to be okay still

1618
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:37,760

 

1619
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,310

it's probably only a select few things a

1620
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:40,320
it's probably only a select few things a
 

1621
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,990
it's probably only a select few things a
few glitches that don't work anymore

1622
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,000
few glitches that don't work anymore
 

1623
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,030
few glitches that don't work anymore
with them

1624
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,040

 

1625
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,150

okay so it only takes um what is it

1626
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,160
okay so it only takes um what is it
 

1627
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,510
okay so it only takes um what is it
about 83 get 83 blaze to get

1628
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:53,520
about 83 get 83 blaze to get
 

1629
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,349
about 83 get 83 blaze to get
from zero to 30.

1630
00:39:57,349 --> 00:39:57,359
from zero to 30.
 

1631
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,030
from zero to 30.
okay i think that'll do it it's about 90

1632
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,040
okay i think that'll do it it's about 90
 

1633
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,589
okay i think that'll do it it's about 90
90 blaze in there so we will

1634
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:05,599
90 blaze in there so we will
 

1635
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,990
90 blaze in there so we will
do that and just the correction or

1636
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,000
do that and just the correction or
 

1637
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,510
do that and just the correction or
clarification of what i said

1638
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:11,520
clarification of what i said
 

1639
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,950
clarification of what i said
when i said 4625 xp i meant from

1640
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:14,960
when i said 4625 xp i meant from
 

1641
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,990
when i said 4625 xp i meant from
zero to 50 before that's what it was not

1642
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,000
zero to 50 before that's what it was not
 

1643
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,230
zero to 50 before that's what it was not
zero to 30.

1644
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,240
zero to 30.
 

1645
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,630
zero to 30.
but the new max level is 30.

1646
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:24,640
but the new max level is 30.
 

1647
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,750
but the new max level is 30.
which this should take us to if

1648
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:27,760
which this should take us to if
 

1649
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,270
which this should take us to if
if i figured everything right

1650
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:31,280

 

1651
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:42,710

probably 31 or 32

1652
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:42,720

 

1653
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,910

oh man did i call it or what

1654
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:45,920
oh man did i call it or what
 

1655
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,630
oh man did i call it or what
that's cool so you don't want to go over

1656
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:48,640
that's cool so you don't want to go over
 

1657
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,470
that's cool so you don't want to go over
30 really because

1658
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:50,480
30 really because
 

1659
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,510
30 really because
um it starts to cost more per level i

1660
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:53,520
um it starts to cost more per level i
 

1661
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,030
um it starts to cost more per level i
think it was three xp more

1662
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,040
think it was three xp more
 

1663
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,190
think it was three xp more
each level um

1664
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,200
each level um
 

1665
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,870
each level um
but yeah maybe we'll enchant a few

1666
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:00,880
but yeah maybe we'll enchant a few
 

1667
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,390
but yeah maybe we'll enchant a few
things and then we'll call it an

1668
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:02,400
things and then we'll call it an
 

1669
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,790
things and then we'll call it an
episode i need a new axe and

1670
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:08,800

 

1671
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,589

the thing is if you do a big batch of

1672
00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:11,599
the thing is if you do a big batch of
 

1673
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,950
the thing is if you do a big batch of
blaze like if you were to kill

1674
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:12,960
blaze like if you were to kill
 

1675
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,990
blaze like if you were to kill
200 or 250 like i usually do

1676
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,000
200 or 250 like i usually do
 

1677
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,790
200 or 250 like i usually do
you can get the xp and then ender pearl

1678
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:18,800
you can get the xp and then ender pearl
 

1679
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,990
you can get the xp and then ender pearl
as it's swirling around

1680
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,000
as it's swirling around
 

1681
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,069
as it's swirling around
you you can ender pearl to get out of it

1682
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:22,079
you you can ender pearl to get out of it
 

1683
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,430
you you can ender pearl to get out of it
so it doesn't follow you and then you

1684
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:23,440
so it doesn't follow you and then you
 

1685
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,030
so it doesn't follow you and then you
can go back to its

1686
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,040
can go back to its
 

1687
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,550
can go back to its
pick up 30 more levels into pearl away

1688
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:28,560
pick up 30 more levels into pearl away
 

1689
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,230
pick up 30 more levels into pearl away
and just keep going back and forth until

1690
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,240
and just keep going back and forth until
 

1691
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,190
and just keep going back and forth until
it's all used up

1692
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,200
it's all used up
 

1693
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,470
it's all used up

1721
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,670

before i was afraid to go over 250

1722
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:21,680
before i was afraid to go over 250
 

1723
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,589
before i was afraid to go over 250
because i would run out of memory and

1724
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:23,599
because i would run out of memory and
 

1725
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,270
because i would run out of memory and
crash

1726
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
crash
 

1727
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,190
crash
and i corrupted my world once doing that

1728
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,200
and i corrupted my world once doing that
 

1729
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,510

notes that they

1734
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:32,720
notes that they
 

1735
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,390
notes that they
improved i think memory usage

1736
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:36,400
improved i think memory usage
 

1737
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,950
improved i think memory usage
and if you look it's barely going over

1738
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:38,960
and if you look it's barely going over
 

1739
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,750
and if you look it's barely going over
300 even

1740
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:41,760
300 even
 

1741
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,150
300 even
so we probably can handle a lot more

1742
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
so we probably can handle a lot more
 

1743
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,430
