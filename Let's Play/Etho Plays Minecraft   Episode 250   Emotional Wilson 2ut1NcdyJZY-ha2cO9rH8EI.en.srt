they saw a cool pattern that if i can

148
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
they saw a cool pattern that if i can
 

149
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,190
they saw a cool pattern that if i can
control

150
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
control
 

151
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,110
control
what which of the four smiles i'm

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,430
what which of the four smiles i'm
showing by the length of the redstone

154
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
showing by the length of the redstone
 

155
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,350
showing by the length of the redstone
signal if i set it up right

156
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
signal if i set it up right
 

157
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,350
signal if i set it up right
which would probably be a good way of

158
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
which would probably be a good way of
 

159
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,869
which would probably be a good way of
doing this i'm not sure if i'm

160
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
doing this i'm not sure if i'm
 

161
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,789
doing this i'm not sure if i'm
going to do it that way but i'm

162
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
going to do it that way but i'm
 

163
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,309
going to do it that way but i'm
considering it

164
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
considering it
 

165
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,070
considering it
i'm not sure if it's actually easier or

166
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
i'm not sure if it's actually easier or
 

167
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,550
i'm not sure if it's actually easier or
not i'll find out as i get into it i

168
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
not i'll find out as i get into it i
 

169
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,350
not i'll find out as i get into it i
guess

170
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
guess
 

171
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,710
guess
the other big thing i've done is i've

172
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
the other big thing i've done is i've
 

173
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,750
the other big thing i've done is i've
added in these hopper variable things

174
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
added in these hopper variable things
 

175
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,990
added in these hopper variable things
which we've talked about before and

176
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
which we've talked about before and
 

177
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,110
which we've talked about before and
this this stone and this wire here this

178
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
this this stone and this wire here this
 

179
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,830
this this stone and this wire here this

181
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,910
controls
the stat bars on the other side the

182
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
the stat bars on the other side the
 

183
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,830
the stat bars on the other side the
lamps

184
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
lamps
 

185
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,270
lamps
and it goes left to right on this side

186
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
and it goes left to right on this side
 

187
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,589
and it goes left to right on this side

and
left to right on this side because

190
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
left to right on this side because
 

191
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,750
left to right on this side because
that's the way we read here

192
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
that's the way we read here
 

193
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,710
that's the way we read here
in english land english language

194
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
in english land english language
 

195
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,630
in english land english language
i don't know why i said that you know

196
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
i don't know why i said that you know
 

197
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,710
i don't know why i said that you know
some in some languages they don't read

198
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
some in some languages they don't read
 

199
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,229
some in some languages they don't read
left to right i guess that's why i said

200
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
left to right i guess that's why i said
 

201
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:16,789
left to right i guess that's why i said
it

202
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
it
 

203
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,789
it
so i i figure that makes sense to do the

204
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
so i i figure that makes sense to do the
 

205
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,909
so i i figure that makes sense to do the
stat bar that way

206
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
stat bar that way
 

207
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,790
stat bar that way
as well even though logically the

208
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
as well even though logically the
 

209
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,390
as well even though logically the
easiest way for me to do it is probably

210
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
easiest way for me to do it is probably
 

211
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,990
easiest way for me to do it is probably
to have

212
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
to have
 

213
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,110
to have
the variables on the other side also

214
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
the variables on the other side also
 

215
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,390
the variables on the other side also
far away because you see there are

216
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
far away because you see there are
 

217
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,629
far away because you see there are
they're on the right side here like

218
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
they're on the right side here like
 

219
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,469
they're on the right side here like
those ones it would actually be easier

220
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
those ones it would actually be easier
 

221
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,990
those ones it would actually be easier
for me to put them on the left

222
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
for me to put them on the left
 

223
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,270
for me to put them on the left
but just because the way we read and

224
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
but just because the way we read and
 

225
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,749
but just because the way we read and
whatnot

226
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
whatnot
 

227
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,110

anyway i got the age barg

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
anyway i got the age barg
 

229
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,390
anyway i got the age barg
done too up here so what we got to do

00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
done too up here so what we got to do
 

231
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,350
done too up here so what we got to do
what we're going to work on now is

what we're going to work on now is
 

233
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,950
what we're going to work on now is
connecting stuff together

234
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
connecting stuff together
 

235
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,390
connecting stuff together
oops so let's work on the happiness i

236
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
oops so let's work on the happiness i

uh by the way if you guys missed this if

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
uh by the way if you guys missed this if
 

241

uh by the way if you guys missed this if
if you're not up to speed of what i'm

if you're not up to speed of what i'm
 

243
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,830
if you're not up to speed of what i'm
doing here i'm making like a tamagotchi

logic behind it and
 

251
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,990
logic behind it and
and how to make it all work together

252
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
and how to make it all work together
 

253
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,070
and how to make it all work together

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
things i can
 

257
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,550
things i can
i can do addition and subtraction sort

258
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
i can do addition and subtraction sort
 

259
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,430
i can do addition and subtraction sort
of

in minecraft the wire on top locks it
 

263
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,790
in minecraft the wire on top locks it
and the one on the side here this

264
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
and the one on the side here this
 

265
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,909

00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
block and torch dealio allows me to
 

267
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,310
block and torch dealio allows me to
switch between addition and subtraction

268
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
switch between addition and subtraction
 

269
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,310
switch between addition and subtraction
right so these these pistons control the

270
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
right so these these pistons control the
 

271
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,110
right so these these pistons control the
eyes we want these to be retracted if

272
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
eyes we want these to be retracted if
 

273
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,909
eyes we want these to be retracted if
the pet is

274
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
the pet is
 

275
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,430
the pet is
very sad or very happy or dead

276
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
very sad or very happy or dead
 

277
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,870
very sad or very happy or dead
those are the three times we want these

278
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
those are the three times we want these
 

279
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,830
those are the three times we want these
pistons unpowered

280
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
pistons unpowered
 

281
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,830
pistons unpowered
so we're going to use the length of the

282
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
so we're going to use the length of the
 

283
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,469
so we're going to use the length of the
wire

284
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
wire
 

285
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,670
wire
to determine oh

286
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
to determine oh
 

287
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,230
to determine oh
when when we change this basically so

288
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
when when we change this basically so
 

289
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,270
when when we change this basically so
this would be super sad

290
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
this would be super sad
 

291
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,670
this would be super sad
that's if it's at that level nothing

292
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
that's if it's at that level nothing
 

293
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,950
that's if it's at that level nothing
changes here

294
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
changes here
 

295
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,230
changes here
if it's at two three or four then those

296
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
if it's at two three or four then those
 

297
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,270
if it's at two three or four then those
need to be extended if it's at five

298
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
need to be extended if it's at five
 

299
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,430
need to be extended if it's at five
they need to be retracted or if the bets

300
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
they need to be retracted or if the bets
 

301
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,510
they need to be retracted or if the bets
dead then it needs to be retracted as

302
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
dead then it needs to be retracted as
 

303
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,790
dead then it needs to be retracted as
well so

304
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
well so
 

305
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,350
well so
i think we got to do something like this

306
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
i think we got to do something like this
 

307
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,790
i think we got to do something like this
we need an andy

308
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
we need an andy
 

309
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,510
we need an andy
for sure if it's only at

310
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
for sure if it's only at
 

311
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,790
for sure if it's only at
at one block distance the pulse or the

312
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
at one block distance the pulse or the
 

313
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,469
at one block distance the pulse or the
the redstone we don't need to do

314
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
the redstone we don't need to do
 

315
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,550
the redstone we don't need to do
anything because we don't need anything

316
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
anything because we don't need anything
 

317
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,749
anything because we don't need anything
to change right

318
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
to change right
 

319
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,830
to change right
it's only if it's at two three or four

320
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
it's only if it's at two three or four
 

321
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,870
it's only if it's at two three or four
that we need to

322
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
that we need to
 

323
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,469
that we need to
to do something so i figure we need to

324
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
to do something so i figure we need to
 

325
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,270
to do something so i figure we need to
do this

326
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
do this
 

327
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,830
do this
have the and gates

328
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840

 

329
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,150

um as soon as the signal gets

330
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
um as soon as the signal gets
 

331
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,309
um as soon as the signal gets
two blocks distance they'll switch his

332
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
two blocks distance they'll switch his
 

333
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,510
two blocks distance they'll switch his
torch

334
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
torch
 

335
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,589
torch
and you can see now it's letting up a

336
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
and you can see now it's letting up a
 

337
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,550
and you can see now it's letting up a
signal through

338
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
signal through
 

339
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,309
signal through
the hand gate so this would get powered

340
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
the hand gate so this would get powered
 

341
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,749
the hand gate so this would get powered
at uh at two

342
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
at uh at two
 

343
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,749
at uh at two
and then we need to make it unpowered

344
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
and then we need to make it unpowered
 

345
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,950
and then we need to make it unpowered
like this

346
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
like this
 

347
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,230
like this
if it's at one like it is right now or

348
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
if it's at one like it is right now or
 

349
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,950
if it's at one like it is right now or
if it's at

350
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
if it's at
 

351
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,070
if it's at
five so um

352
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
five so um
 

353
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,909
five so um
it gets to 5 we want to do this

354
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
it gets to 5 we want to do this
 

355
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,309
it gets to 5 we want to do this
basically

356
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
basically
 

357
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,510
basically
and that would unpower it so 1

358
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
and that would unpower it so 1
 

359
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,589
and that would unpower it so 1
2 3 4 5 6.

2 3 4 5 6.
 

361
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,110
2 3 4 5 6.
get all the way up there

362
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120

 

363
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,670

wait no no one two three four four five

364
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
wait no no one two three four four five
 

365
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,589
wait no no one two three four four five
yeah that's right

366
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
yeah that's right
 

367
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,110
yeah that's right
how do we position this i'm not truly

368
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
how do we position this i'm not truly
 

369
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,510
how do we position this i'm not truly
sure

370
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520

 

371
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,749

oh good news guys i think we got it

372
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:43,759
oh good news guys i think we got it
 

373
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,550
oh good news guys i think we got it
figured out here

374

what it's doing
 

429
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,750
what it's doing
to make that happen um

430
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760

 

431
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,509

maybe we'll run it again

432
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
this setup allows us to do that
 

507
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,710
this setup allows us to do that
if i send power to this wire here it'll

508
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
if i send power to this wire here it'll
 

509
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,030
if i send power to this wire here it'll
override it

510
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040

 

511
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,670

which is really really good and this is

512
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
which is really really good and this is
 

513
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,829
which is really really good and this is
all up and out of the way i believe so

514
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
all up and out of the way i believe so
 

515
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,269
all up and out of the way i believe so
i'm pretty happy with this uh

516
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
i'm pretty happy with this uh
 

517
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,430
i'm pretty happy with this uh
oh hey so if

518
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
oh hey so if
 

519
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,389
oh hey so if
i think that's our health bar there if

520
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
i think that's our health bar there if
 

521
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,870
i think that's our health bar there if
any

522
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
any
 

523
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,790
any
power if there's no power in this wire i

524
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
power if there's no power in this wire i
 

525
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,910
power if there's no power in this wire i
guess

526
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
guess
 

527
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,509
guess
then then we send power to this wire

528
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
then then we send power to this wire
 

529
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,069
then then we send power to this wire
to override i think that's how we have

530
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
to override i think that's how we have
 

531
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,670
to override i think that's how we have
to do it

532
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
to do it
 

533
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,110
to do it
um this guy man he's just waiting for

534
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
um this guy man he's just waiting for
 

535
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,110
um this guy man he's just waiting for
his chance

536
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
his chance
 

537
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,509
his chance
just waiting he wants me so bad

538
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519

 

539
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,030

oop dangerous

540
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040

 

541
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,310

hates redstone

542
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320

 

543
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,710

yeah that's how you spell redstone with

544
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
yeah that's how you spell redstone with
 

545
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,870
yeah that's how you spell redstone with
the space no i know i know

546
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
the space no i know i know
 

547
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,790
the space no i know i know
um all right let's get rid of him

548
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
um all right let's get rid of him
 

549
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,150
um all right let's get rid of him
i'm gonna go see where he came from

550
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160

 

551
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,710

oh no you don't

552
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
oh no you don't
 

553
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,910
oh no you don't
oh he brought a buddy

554
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920

 

555
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,310

and now from his perspective the signs

556
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
and now from his perspective the signs
 

557
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,269
and now from his perspective the signs
pointing at me

558
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279

 

559
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,110

oh that was a miss

560
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120

 

561
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,269

get out of here

562
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279

 

563
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,590

all right so i put in that override line

564
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
all right so i put in that override line
 

565
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,910
all right so i put in that override line
of wire so even though the happiness is

566
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
of wire so even though the happiness is
 

567
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,470
of wire so even though the happiness is
at three when the eyes should be full

568
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
at three when the eyes should be full
 

569
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,829
at three when the eyes should be full
they're not because the the health is at

570
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
they're not because the the health is at
 

571
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:14,629
they're not because the the health is at
zero

572
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
zero
 

573
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,430
zero
so he's dead uh it's being overwritten

574
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
so he's dead uh it's being overwritten
 

575
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,150
so he's dead uh it's being overwritten
and we can we can see this working

576
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
and we can we can see this working
 

577
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,670
and we can we can see this working
uh let's see if i can get up high enough

578
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
uh let's see if i can get up high enough
 

579
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,670
uh let's see if i can get up high enough
to show you i really gotta

580
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
to show you i really gotta
 

581
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,110
to show you i really gotta
set up some proper scaffolding

582
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
set up some proper scaffolding
 

583
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,150
set up some proper scaffolding
yeah okay so that's the variable for

584
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
yeah okay so that's the variable for
 

585
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,190
yeah okay so that's the variable for
the health it goes to that comparator up

586
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
the health it goes to that comparator up
 

587
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,350
the health it goes to that comparator up
to that

588
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
to that
 

589
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,150
to that
redstone dust there gets to that torch

590
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,160
redstone dust there gets to that torch
 

591
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,190
redstone dust there gets to that torch
goes over top

592
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
goes over top
 

593
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,310
goes over top
that wiring that way that goes all the

594
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
that wiring that way that goes all the
 

595
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,710
that wiring that way that goes all the
way down to repeater and to our override

596
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
way down to repeater and to our override
 

597
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,110
way down to repeater and to our override
line

598
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
line
 

599
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,389
line
there okay those are all the steps so if

600
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
there okay those are all the steps so if
 

601
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,670
there okay those are all the steps so if
we were to

602
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
we were to
 

603
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,590
we were to
give him some health if he was still

604
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
give him some health if he was still
 

605
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,870
give him some health if he was still
alive

606
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
alive
 

607
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,910
alive
uh we would see a difference

608
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920

 

609
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,949

yeah you heard it switch he's alive

610
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
yeah you heard it switch he's alive
 

611
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,030
yeah you heard it switch he's alive
he's got spirit in his eyes now

612
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040

 

613
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,790

and now he's got the full eyes and he's

614
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
and now he's got the full eyes and he's
 

615
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,990
and now he's got the full eyes and he's
got one one health bar

616
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000

 

617
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,590

now i really want to try to get the

618
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
now i really want to try to get the
 

619
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,590
now i really want to try to get the
smile working this episode too because i

620
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
smile working this episode too because i
 

621
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,269
smile working this episode too because i
think it'd be really cool to see

622
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
think it'd be really cool to see
 

623
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,470
think it'd be really cool to see
the whole face working together linked

624
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
the whole face working together linked
 

625
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,110
the whole face working together linked
to the

626
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
to the
 

627
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,990
to the
the happiness bar here uh so hopefully

628
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
the happiness bar here uh so hopefully
 

629
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,750
the happiness bar here uh so hopefully
we can get that done today

630
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
we can get that done today
 

631
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,870
we can get that done today
i have no idea how to do the wiring

632
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
i have no idea how to do the wiring
 

633
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,269
i have no idea how to do the wiring
though

634
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
though
 

635
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,030
though
it's going to be really complicated i

636
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
it's going to be really complicated i
 

637
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,310
it's going to be really complicated i
think

638
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
think
 

639
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,030
think
um let's let's head back here and see if

640
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
um let's let's head back here and see if
 

641
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,949
um let's let's head back here and see if
we can figure something out

642
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
we can figure something out
 

643
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,750
we can figure something out
oh just kidding it's all done i got it

644
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:45,760
oh just kidding it's all done i got it
 

645
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:45,990
oh just kidding it's all done i got it
all

646
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
all
 

647
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,670
all
i got it all hooked up here uh it took

648
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
i got it all hooked up here uh it took
 

649
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,189
i got it all hooked up here uh it took
me a while to figure out and it's

650
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:49,199
me a while to figure out and it's
 

651
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:55,030
me a while to figure out and it's
pretty complicated but

652
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040

 

653
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,710

let's let's look at the demonstration

654
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
let's let's look at the demonstration
 

655
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,710
let's let's look at the demonstration
first and then maybe we'll go over the

656
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:58,720
first and then maybe we'll go over the
 

657
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,310
first and then maybe we'll go over the
wiring real quick

658
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
wiring real quick
 

659
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,750
wiring real quick
i did this off camera just so we could

660
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,760
i did this off camera just so we could
 

661
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,910
i did this off camera just so we could
get it done today

662
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
get it done today
 

663
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,189
get it done today
and hopefully do something else so this

664
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:07,199
and hopefully do something else so this
 

665
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,030
and hopefully do something else so this
is the variable for

666
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
is the variable for
 

667
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,310
is the variable for
the happiness uh

668
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
the happiness uh
 

669
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,710
the happiness uh
i'm gonna switch it so it starts

670
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:14,720
i'm gonna switch it so it starts
 

671
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,590
i'm gonna switch it so it starts
incrementing or increasing i mean

672
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600

 

673
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,470

so right now super sad we see it's at

674
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
so right now super sad we see it's at
 

675
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,350
so right now super sad we see it's at
level one

676
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360

face oh yeah
so that's all directly linked with the

702
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
so that's all directly linked with the
 

703
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,189
so that's all directly linked with the
happiness bar there with our variable

704
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
happiness bar there with our variable
 

705
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,350
happiness bar there with our variable
that is really cool to see it and we can

706
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
that is really cool to see it and we can
 

707
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,670
that is really cool to see it and we can
even watch it go in reverse

708
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
even watch it go in reverse
 

709
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,030
even watch it go in reverse
switch it to subtraction

710
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,040
switch it to subtraction
 

711
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,949
switch it to subtraction
so again the idea with these variables

712
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
so again the idea with these variables
 

713
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,150
so again the idea with these variables
is we'll keep them locked

714
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
is we'll keep them locked
 

715
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,829
is we'll keep them locked
just about all the time the only time

716
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
just about all the time the only time
 

717
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,350
just about all the time the only time
it's not going to be locked is when

718
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
it's not going to be locked is when
 

719
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,069
it's not going to be locked is when
we're either increasing or decreasing

720
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
we're either increasing or decreasing
 

721
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,509
we're either increasing or decreasing
the stat which will only be for

from the health bar up here so i just

848
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
from the health bar up here so i just
 

849
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,150
from the health bar up here so i just
drew off from this line that we did

850
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
drew off from this line that we did
 

851
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,549
drew off from this line that we did
before this repeater is really important

852
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:18,559
before this repeater is really important
 

853
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,909
before this repeater is really important
it prevents

854
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
it prevents
 

855
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,710
it prevents
current from backflowing to here which

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
current from backflowing to here which
 

857
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,310
current from backflowing to here which
would totally

858
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
would totally
 

859
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,150
would totally
uh wreck our face so it goes down

860
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,160
uh wreck our face so it goes down
 

861
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,190

world up for download again and you can

884
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
world up for download again and you can
 

885
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,789
world up for download again and you can
check it out closer

886
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:00,799
check it out closer
 

887
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,230
check it out closer
when i do that uh

888
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
when i do that uh
 

889
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,070
when i do that uh
the main thing is i had to do it in

890
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
the main thing is i had to do it in
 

891
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,590
the main thing is i had to do it in
order so go sad face

892
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
order so go sad face
 

893
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,390
order so go sad face
happy or sad face neutral face happy

894
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
happy or sad face neutral face happy
 

895
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,669
happy or sad face neutral face happy
face

896
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
face
 

897
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,470
face
um at full power is happy face that no

898
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
um at full power is happy face that no
 

899
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,029
um at full power is happy face that no
power is sad face

900
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
power is sad face
 

901
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,230
power is sad face
so it goes to here this is that's this

902
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
so it goes to here this is that's this
 

903
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,710
so it goes to here this is that's this
is it's

904
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
is it's
 

905
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,230
is it's
uh i hate you face this is sad face

906
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240
uh i hate you face this is sad face
 

907
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,430
uh i hate you face this is sad face
wait no

908
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440

 

909
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,070

wait a minute i'm lost

910
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080

 

911
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,110

well anyway um neutral faces here

912
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
well anyway um neutral faces here
 

913
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,230
well anyway um neutral faces here
neutral face connects to two of these

914
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,240
neutral face connects to two of these
 

915
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,549
neutral face connects to two of these
uh then finally happy face since it's

916
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
uh then finally happy face since it's
 

917
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,750
uh then finally happy face since it's
the absolute

918
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
the absolute
 

919
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,150
the absolute
opposite of sad face i just have to

920
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
opposite of sad face i just have to
 

921
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,190
opposite of sad face i just have to
power all three

922
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
power all three
 

923
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,350
power all three
so goes down one further here

924
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
so goes down one further here
 

925
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,190
so goes down one further here
to this repeater

926
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200

 

927
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,789

and then that goes to the outer

928
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
and then that goes to the outer
 

929
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,270
and then that goes to the outer
outer edges of the smile anyway you get

930
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,280
outer edges of the smile anyway you get
 

931
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,110
outer edges of the smile anyway you get
the idea i hope

932
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
the idea i hope
 

933
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,149
the idea i hope
um now that we got that done that was

934
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,159
um now that we got that done that was
 

935
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,830
um now that we got that done that was
probably the toughest part of this whole

936
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840
probably the toughest part of this whole
 

937
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,230
probably the toughest part of this whole
project i'm guessing

938
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
project i'm guessing
 

939
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,310
project i'm guessing
although stuff like feeding it and

940
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
although stuff like feeding it and
 

941
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,750
although stuff like feeding it and
that's going to be pretty complicated

942
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:17,760
that's going to be pretty complicated
 

943
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,870
that's going to be pretty complicated
too

944
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
too
 

945
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,990
too
but as far as

946
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,000
but as far as
 

947
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,990
but as far as
the variables and everything that's just

948
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,000
the variables and everything that's just
 

949
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,669
the variables and everything that's just
going to be a lot of

950
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
going to be a lot of
 

951
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,710
going to be a lot of
uh timing stuff which isn't super

952
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
uh timing stuff which isn't super
 

953
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,070
uh timing stuff which isn't super
complicated it's going to be a mess to

954
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080
complicated it's going to be a mess to
 

955
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,230
complicated it's going to be a mess to
wire though for sure

956
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,240
wire though for sure
 

957
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,789
wire though for sure
um and then we have to do the

958
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
um and then we have to do the
 

959
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,070
um and then we have to do the
interactive stuff

960
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,080
interactive stuff
 

961
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,549
interactive stuff
but we're gonna leave this project here

962
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
but we're gonna leave this project here
 

963
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,710
but we're gonna leave this project here
for today and i think we'll go

964
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:40,720
for today and i think we'll go
 

965
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,590
for today and i think we'll go
go do something fun not that this wasn't

966
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:43,600
go do something fun not that this wasn't
 

967
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,590
go do something fun not that this wasn't
this was a lot of fun for me

968
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600
this was a lot of fun for me
 

969
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,950
this was a lot of fun for me
we'll go do something else something

970
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:46,960
we'll go do something else something
 

971
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,630
we'll go do something else something
different

972
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640

 

973
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,230

yeah so i thought for a change maybe

974
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
yeah so i thought for a change maybe
 

975
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,750
yeah so i thought for a change maybe
like for the next five or ten minutes in

976
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
like for the next five or ten minutes in
 

977
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,430
like for the next five or ten minutes in
the video we'll just go

978
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
the video we'll just go
 

979
