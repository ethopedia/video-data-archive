is like a way of transporting the ender

74
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:15,860
is like a way of transporting the ender
 

75
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,880
is like a way of transporting the ender
pearls from the farm back to the ender

00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:21,890
pearls from the farm back to the ender
 

77
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,620
pearls from the farm back to the ender
portal here so they're easy to get but

78
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:23,630
portal here so they're easy to get but
 

79
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,620
portal here so they're easy to get but
get through because I find I don't use

80
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:26,630
get through because I find I don't use
 

81
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,330

ender pearls as much as I would like to

82
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:28,340
ender pearls as much as I would like to
 

83
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,710
ender pearls as much as I would like to
because they're kind of a pain to

84
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:29,720
because they're kind of a pain to
 

85
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,199
because they're kind of a pain to
transport like from here all the way to

86
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,209
transport like from here all the way to
 

87
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:38,430
transport like from here all the way to
my man cave is a long distance really so

88
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:38,440
my man cave is a long distance really so
 

89
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,810

today we still have the East Road here I

90
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:40,820
today we still have the East Road here I
 

91
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,570
today we still have the East Road here I
think I think the way we're going to do

92
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:43,580
think I think the way we're going to do
 

93
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,680
think I think the way we're going to do
this is open this up right now the

94
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:47,690
this is open this up right now the
 

95
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,570
this is open this up right now the
easiest way of doing it I think is to

96
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:49,580
easiest way of doing it I think is to
 

97
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,420
easiest way of doing it I think is to
set up a track underneath here with a

98
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:52,430
set up a track underneath here with a
 

99
00:02:52,430 --> 00:03:01,539
set up a track underneath here with a
two-block high clearance mm maybe maybe

100
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:01,549
two-block high clearance mm maybe maybe
 

101
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,009
two-block high clearance mm maybe maybe
we can get it so we can load the

102
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:03,019
we can get it so we can load the
 

103
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,780
we can get it so we can load the
minecart up over there with ender pearls

104
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:04,790
minecart up over there with ender pearls
 

105
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,340
minecart up over there with ender pearls
and then when it's full it'll take off

106
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,350
and then when it's full it'll take off
 

107
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,560
and then when it's full it'll take off
down this track drop them off and then

108
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:08,570
down this track drop them off and then
 

109
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,650
down this track drop them off and then
come back once we reload the the

110
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:11,660
come back once we reload the the
 

111
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,580
come back once we reload the the
minecart or something but yeah so we're

112
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:15,590
minecart or something but yeah so we're
 

113
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,080
minecart or something but yeah so we're
going to we're going to try set up some

114
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,090
going to we're going to try set up some
 

115
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,170
going to we're going to try set up some
automated ender pearl delivery system

116
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:20,180
automated ender pearl delivery system
 

117
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,460
automated ender pearl delivery system
today if we can and there's also a few

118
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:24,470
today if we can and there's also a few
 

119
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,870
today if we can and there's also a few
other little things I want to try out

120
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:25,880
other little things I want to try out
 

121
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,750
other little things I want to try out
with the end like getting a horse there

122
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:28,760
with the end like getting a horse there
 

123
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,660
with the end like getting a horse there
how how does that work exactly let's

124
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:31,670
how how does that work exactly let's
 

125
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,970
how how does that work exactly let's
find out so luckily I have a pathway all

126
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:36,980
find out so luckily I have a pathway all
 

127
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,390
find out so luckily I have a pathway all
the way from here to the stronghold base

128
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
the way from here to the stronghold base
 

129
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,880
the way from here to the stronghold base
that I almost never use but it's it's

130
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:42,890
that I almost never use but it's it's
 

131
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:48,390
that I almost never use but it's it's
available if I need right over here

132
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400

 

133
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,839

hey guys yeah I built this a long time

134
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:52,849
hey guys yeah I built this a long time
 

135
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:56,949
hey guys yeah I built this a long time
ago don't really use it but it's it's

136
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
ago don't really use it but it's it's

there if I ever need to like move

138
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,170
there if I ever need to like move
 

139
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,479

supplies from one base to another easily

140
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:01,489
supplies from one base to another easily
 

141
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,550
supplies from one base to another easily
so we might use this to get the ender

142
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:03,560
so we might use this to get the ender
 

143
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,990
so we might use this to get the ender
pearls to the man cave or we might try

144
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
pearls to the man cave or we might try
 

145
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,280
pearls to the man cave or we might try
to set something up through the nether

146
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,290
to set something up through the nether
 

147
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,750
to set something up through the nether
because the nether would be a lot closer

148
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:10,760
because the nether would be a lot closer
 

149
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,399
because the nether would be a lot closer
but just got to deal with going through

150
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:14,409
but just got to deal with going through
 

151
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,170
but just got to deal with going through
portals and stuff if you go the nether

152
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:17,180
portals and stuff if you go the nether
 

153
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,240
portals and stuff if you go the nether
route this is actually a lot further

154
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,250
route this is actually a lot further
 

155
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,140
route this is actually a lot further
than I remembered

156
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,150
than I remembered
 

157
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,659
than I remembered

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:37,140
with a pump down my head and just take
 

239
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,180
with a pump down my head and just take
these guys out or I can I can stand over

240
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,190
these guys out or I can I can stand over
 

241
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,460
these guys out or I can I can stand over
here and and look at them all and have

242
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:43,470
here and and look at them all and have
 

243
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,960

have to spend time running around but
 

249
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,960
have to spend time running around but
I'm wondering how quick is it with the

250
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:53,970
I'm wondering how quick is it with the
 

251
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,340
I'm wondering how quick is it with the
horse if I just go like assassin mode

252
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:58,350
horse if I just go like assassin mode
 

253
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:05,810
horse if I just go like assassin mode
here how tough is this

254
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:05,820

 

255
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:13,260

not superfast still see I'm trying to

256
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:13,270
not superfast still see I'm trying to
 

257
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,460
not superfast still see I'm trying to
find something that's quicker than

258
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:14,470
find something that's quicker than
 

259
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:19,080
find something that's quicker than
having them come to me with this this

260
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,090
having them come to me with this this
 

261
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,970
having them come to me with this this
set up where they're all flat on the

262
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:20,980
set up where they're all flat on the
 

263
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,580
set up where they're all flat on the
ground like this

264
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:22,590
ground like this
 

265
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,100
ground like this
okay let's try speed it up I brought

266
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,110
okay let's try speed it up I brought
 

267
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,930
okay let's try speed it up I brought
some potions and other ideas I could get

268
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:27,940
some potions and other ideas I could get
 

269
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,970
some potions and other ideas I could get
a beacon here with speed to on and then

270
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:29,980
a beacon here with speed to on and then
 

271
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,140
a beacon here with speed to on and then
I could run around a lot quicker not

272
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,150
I could run around a lot quicker not
 

273
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,270
I could run around a lot quicker not
with the horse but just eyes as myself

274
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,280

 

275
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,910

this isn't too bad don't think it's

276
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:41,920
this isn't too bad don't think it's
 

277
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,440
this isn't too bad don't think it's
faster than having them come to me

278
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,450
faster than having them come to me
 

279
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,560
faster than having them come to me
though but it's interesting to see

280
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:45,570
though but it's interesting to see
 

281
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,360
though but it's interesting to see
regardless it's just a little too hard

282
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,370
regardless it's just a little too hard
 

283
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:58,710
regardless it's just a little too hard
to control well we got 30 levels in no

284
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
to control well we got 30 levels in no
 

285
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,640
to control well we got 30 levels in no
time just goofing around over here so

I got a little surprise let's see if we

292
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:09,550
I got a little surprise let's see if we
 

293
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:16,280
I got a little surprise let's see if we
can make it happen again for lucky here

294
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,290

 

295
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,120

what a piece of junk could you ask for a

296
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,130
what a piece of junk could you ask for a
 

297
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,120
what a piece of junk could you ask for a
worse enchantment Elias is there bane of

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,130
worse enchantment Elias is there bane of
 

299
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,580
worse enchantment Elias is there bane of
arthropods three that would have been

300
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:26,590
arthropods three that would have been
 

301
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:31,560
arthropods three that would have been
pretty bad to you but yeah earlier today

I enchanted a diamond sword 30 levels

304
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,030
I enchanted a diamond sword 30 levels
 

305
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,760
I enchanted a diamond sword 30 levels
and it got unbreaking three on it so

306
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:38,770
and it got unbreaking three on it so
 

307
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,770
and it got unbreaking three on it so
they must have changed it when they

308
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:40,780
they must have changed it when they
 

309
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,290
they must have changed it when they
added the Chapmans for fishing rods I'm

310
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:43,300
added the Chapmans for fishing rods I'm
 

311
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
added the Chapmans for fishing rods I'm
guessing where you can now get

312
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,310
guessing where you can now get
 

313
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,690
guessing where you can now get
unbreaking 3 from enchanting swords or

314
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:48,700
unbreaking 3 from enchanting swords or
 

315
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,030
unbreaking 3 from enchanting swords or
run breaking period I would say so

316
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
run breaking period I would say so
 

317
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,560
run breaking period I would say so
that's pretty cool

318
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:54,570

 

319
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,320

okay so we're just laying the the ground

320
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,330
okay so we're just laying the the ground
 

321
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,700
okay so we're just laying the the ground
for our track here we're going to use

322
00:09:59,700 --> 00:09:59,710
for our track here we're going to use
 

323
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,550
for our track here we're going to use
these wooden slabs I guess they kind of

324
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
these wooden slabs I guess they kind of
 

325
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,310
these wooden slabs I guess they kind of
match the fences in that above not that

326
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:05,320
match the fences in that above not that
 

327
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,710
match the fences in that above not that
it matters too much I put all my stuff

328
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:07,720
it matters too much I put all my stuff
 

329
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,420
it matters too much I put all my stuff
in the chest because I figured I would

330
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:09,430
in the chest because I figured I would
 

331
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,820
in the chest because I figured I would
die placing these slabs above the void

332
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:11,830
die placing these slabs above the void
 

333
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,130
die placing these slabs above the void
there but I actually actually didn't

334
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,140
there but I actually actually didn't
 

335
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,540
there but I actually actually didn't
because sometimes when you place these

336
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:15,550
because sometimes when you place these
 

337
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,140
because sometimes when you place these
it will place

338
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,150
it will place
 

339
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,900
it will place
like a half slab blower and you'll just

340
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:18,910
like a half slab blower and you'll just
 

341
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,250
like a half slab blower and you'll just
fall through the ground as you're

342
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:20,260
fall through the ground as you're
 

343
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,560
fall through the ground as you're
placing it which is really annoying but

344
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:22,570
placing it which is really annoying but
 

345
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,210
placing it which is really annoying but
it didn't happen which I was a little

346
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:24,220

surprised yeah we're going to make this

348
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:28,690
surprised yeah we're going to make this
 

349
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,600
surprised yeah we're going to make this

74770 KN processor a lot of people don't
realize this but just saying you have an

480
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:46,699
realize this but just saying you have an
 

481
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:49,179
realize this but just saying you have an
i7 doesn't doesn't mean you have like

482
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:49,189
i7 doesn't doesn't mean you have like
 

483
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:50,979
i7 doesn't doesn't mean you have like
top-of-the-line computer there's

484
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:50,989
top-of-the-line computer there's
 

485
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:54,129
top-of-the-line computer there's
different models like first generation

486
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:54,139
different models like first generation
 

487
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,739
different models like first generation
second generation third and I think

488
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:56,749
second generation third and I think
 

489
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:58,049
second generation third and I think
they're up to the fourth now so the

490
00:13:58,049 --> 00:13:58,059
they're up to the fourth now so the
 

491
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:01,150
they're up to the fourth now so the
4770k is a part of the fourth generation

492
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,160
4770k is a part of the fourth generation
 

493
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,229
4770k is a part of the fourth generation
there's also different lakes specs to it

494
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:05,239
there's also different lakes specs to it
 

495
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:06,759
there's also different lakes specs to it
like some are more efficient than others

496
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:06,769
like some are more efficient than others
 

497
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:08,559
like some are more efficient than others
like they consume less power

498
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:08,569
like they consume less power
 

499
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:12,909
like they consume less power
but do more well then they won't be as

fast as like a gaming processor anyway
 

503
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,479
fast as like a gaming processor anyway
but I think it's pretty good processor

504
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:19,489
but I think it's pretty good processor
 

505
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:21,460
but I think it's pretty good processor

stuff to my stake so bit annoying but I
 

587
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,829
stuff to my stake so bit annoying but I
recovered here and I got most of this

588
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
recovered here and I got most of this
 

589
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,869
recovered here and I got most of this
built now so I'll show you what it's

590
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:47,879
built now so I'll show you what it's
 

591
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,519
built now so I'll show you what it's
going to do very simple actually not

592
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:49,529
going to do very simple actually not
 

593
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:52,069
going to do very simple actually not
nothing too fancy here but we have a

594
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
nothing too fancy here but we have a
 

595
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,740
nothing too fancy here but we have a
storage minecart down below

596
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:53,750
storage minecart down below
 

597
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,080
storage minecart down below
with iron fences I can walk on these

598
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,090
with iron fences I can walk on these
 

599
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,930
with iron fences I can walk on these
without falling through no problem

600
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:57,940
without falling through no problem
 

601
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,210
without falling through no problem
but I can also access the minecart and

602
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:01,220
but I can also access the minecart and
 

603
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,510
but I can also access the minecart and
fill it up with ender pearls and let's

604
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:04,520
fill it up with ender pearls and let's
 

605
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,230
fill it up with ender pearls and let's
just see if it makes it all the way back

606
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:07,240
just see if it makes it all the way back
 

607
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,050
just see if it makes it all the way back
so yeah I'll be able to get ender pearls

608
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,060
so yeah I'll be able to get ender pearls
 

609
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,449
so yeah I'll be able to get ender pearls
here and then send them off over here we

610
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:13,459
here and then send them off over here we
 

611
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:19,390
here and then send them off over here we
have a button there goes hopefully it

612
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:19,400
have a button there goes hopefully it
 

613
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,110
have a button there goes hopefully it
makes it all the way I decided to do

614
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
makes it all the way I decided to do
 

615
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,790
makes it all the way I decided to do
something like this just it was the

616
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:24,800
something like this just it was the
 

617
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,520
something like this just it was the
easiest way of doing it oh you know what

618
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:30,530
easiest way of doing it oh you know what
 

619
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,360
easiest way of doing it oh you know what
I don't think I have any ladders so

620
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,370
I don't think I have any ladders so
 

621
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,750
I don't think I have any ladders so
we'll just walk on here I guess and

622
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
we'll just walk on here I guess and
 

623
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,450
we'll just walk on here I guess and
every 20 blocks I have a detective rail

624
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:40,460
every 20 blocks I have a detective rail
 

625
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,710
every 20 blocks I have a detective rail
and a power rail hopefully that was

626
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:41,720
and a power rail hopefully that was
 

627
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:49,500
and a power rail hopefully that was
enough for it to make it all the way

628
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,510

 

629
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:56,700

00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:05,660
still I still have snowmen on the island
 

637
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,960
still I still have snowmen on the island
and they're like an never-ending battle

638
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:07,970
and they're like an never-ending battle
 

639
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,290
and they're like an never-ending battle
with the Enderman they'll take a take a

640
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:11,300
with the Enderman they'll take a take a
 

641
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,730
with the Enderman they'll take a take a
shot at the Enderman Enderman teleports

642
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:14,740
shot at the Enderman Enderman teleports
 

643
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,830
shot at the Enderman Enderman teleports
every time so that before they used to

644
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
every time so that before they used to
 

645
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,120
every time so that before they used to
attack the snowman but they don't

646
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,130
attack the snowman but they don't
 

647
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:24,190
attack the snowman but they don't
anymore and it made it awesome so we

648
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,200
anymore and it made it awesome so we
 

649
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,740
anymore and it made it awesome so we
need to make an unloading station here

650
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:26,750
need to make an unloading station here
 

651
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:33,100
need to make an unloading station here
too yet oh no I didn't I didn't we're

652
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,110
too yet oh no I didn't I didn't we're
 

653
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,770
too yet oh no I didn't I didn't we're
good let me grab some comparators and

654
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:35,780
good let me grab some comparators and
 

655
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,790
good let me grab some comparators and
stuff and we will do that so I was

656
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:39,800
stuff and we will do that so I was
 

657
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,140
stuff and we will do that so I was
looking through a bunch of chests for

658
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,150
looking through a bunch of chests for
 

659
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,690
looking through a bunch of chests for
some redstone stuff here and in one of

660
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:43,700
some redstone stuff here and in one of
 

661
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,560
some redstone stuff here and in one of
them I happen to find a single lone

662
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:46,570
them I happen to find a single lone
 

663
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,540
them I happen to find a single lone
comparator we only need one though so

664
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:49,550
comparator we only need one though so
 

665
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,950
comparator we only need one though so
let's make sure we don't lose it these

666
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:53,960
let's make sure we don't lose it these
 

667
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,660
let's make sure we don't lose it these
guys have actually saved me a few times

668
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:55,670
guys have actually saved me a few times
 

669
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,010
guys have actually saved me a few times
like I've accidentally looked at

670
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,020
like I've accidentally looked at
 

671
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,420
like I've accidentally looked at
Enderman and they've been chasing me and

672
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:58,430
Enderman and they've been chasing me and
 

673
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,720
Enderman and they've been chasing me and
then one of these guys will just

674
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:00,730
then one of these guys will just
 

675
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,100
then one of these guys will just
secret-service him and take off and

676
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,110
secret-service him and take off and
 

677
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,850
secret-service him and take off and
leave me alone

678
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:03,860
leave me alone
 

679
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,190
leave me alone
that's pretty cool

680
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200

 

681
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,320

so what we're trying to do here

682
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:09,330
so what we're trying to do here
 

683
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,760
so what we're trying to do here
storage minecart is going to come we

684
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:10,770
storage minecart is going to come we
 

685
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,750
storage minecart is going to come we
want to unload the ender pearls into

686
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
want to unload the ender pearls into
 

687
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,850
want to unload the ender pearls into
some chest reservoirs here and then

688
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:16,860
some chest reservoirs here and then
 

689
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,780
some chest reservoirs here and then
return automatically on its own if if

690
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:20,790
return automatically on its own if if
 

691
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,560
return automatically on its own if if
the Ches the reservoir is full we want

692
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:24,570
the Ches the reservoir is full we want
 

693
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,240
the Ches the reservoir is full we want
it to sit here and wait until there's

694
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,250
it to sit here and wait until there's
 

695
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,220
it to sit here and wait until there's
space for it and then once the cart is

696
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,230
space for it and then once the cart is
 

697
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,520
space for it and then once the cart is
fully unloaded may take off again so to

698
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:31,530
fully unloaded may take off again so to
 

699
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,540
fully unloaded may take off again so to
do all that is actually pretty simple

700
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:34,550
do all that is actually pretty simple
 

701
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,890
do all that is actually pretty simple
let me show you how to do it case you

702
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:36,900
let me show you how to do it case you
 

703
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,970
let me show you how to do it case you
don't know we're going to change this

704
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:39,980
don't know we're going to change this
 

705
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,950
don't know we're going to change this
you sound change this over to a bunch of

706
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:44,960
you sound change this over to a bunch of
 

707
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,300
you sound change this over to a bunch of
hoppers and actually let's put the chest

708
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,310
hoppers and actually let's put the chest
 

709
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,590
hoppers and actually let's put the chest
down already so we'll have a few double

710
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,600
down already so we'll have a few double
 

711
00:19:51,600 --> 00:20:00,380
down already so we'll have a few double
Ches well this is actually really messy

712
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:00,390
Ches well this is actually really messy
 

713
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:05,390
Ches well this is actually really messy
setup sadly my end is not very pretty I

714
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:05,400
setup sadly my end is not very pretty I
 

715
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,330
setup sadly my end is not very pretty I
haven't I haven't focused too much on

716
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:08,340
haven't I haven't focused too much on
 

717
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,870
haven't I haven't focused too much on
making it look good and it shows maybe

718
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:11,880
making it look good and it shows maybe
 

719
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,160
making it look good and it shows maybe
one day we'll build some natural

720
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,170
one day we'll build some natural
 

721
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,870
one day we'll build some natural
structures here though and try to make

722
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:14,880
structures here though and try to make
 

723
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,440
structures here though and try to make
something cool let's get our power rail

724
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:18,450
something cool let's get our power rail
 

725
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,220
something cool let's get our power rail
back so stuff stuff will trickle down to

726
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,230
back so stuff stuff will trickle down to
 

727
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,230
back so stuff stuff will trickle down to
the bottom chest items in these hoppers

728
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,240
the bottom chest items in these hoppers
 

729
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,510
the bottom chest items in these hoppers
going into the chest can also go down to

730
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
going into the chest can also go down to
 

731
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,690
going into the chest can also go down to
these hoppers so should work out okay

732
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:32,700
these hoppers so should work out okay
 

733
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:42,920
these hoppers so should work out okay
and then to do that cart thing see hey

734
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:42,930
and then to do that cart thing see hey
 

735
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,540
and then to do that cart thing see hey
whoa

736
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:44,550
whoa
 

737
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:50,090
whoa
guy get out of my crosshair oh yeah

738
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:50,100
guy get out of my crosshair oh yeah
 

739
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,150
guy get out of my crosshair oh yeah
we're gonna have to lower this more

740
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,160
we're gonna have to lower this more
 

741
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:58,950
we're gonna have to lower this more
actually pick these out

742
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960

 

743
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,700

this is why I had an axe on me before I

744
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:03,710
this is why I had an axe on me before I
 

745
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,120
this is why I had an axe on me before I
lost it

746
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,130
lost it
 

747
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:12,690
lost it
get that going and compared her here

748
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:12,700
get that going and compared her here
 

749
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,100
get that going and compared her here
look how simple this is so we get a

750
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,110
look how simple this is so we get a
 

751
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:20,130
look how simple this is so we get a
comparator block in front of that oops

752
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:20,140
comparator block in front of that oops
 

753
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,820
comparator block in front of that oops
invert the signal with a torch and get

754
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:24,830
invert the signal with a torch and get
 

755
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,460
invert the signal with a torch and get
some redstone dust up here and then a

756
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:27,470
some redstone dust up here and then a
 

757
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:33,220
some redstone dust up here and then a
block on top of that like so so that

758
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,230
block on top of that like so so that
 

759
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,010
block on top of that like so so that
power is the power rail unless there's

760
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,020
power is the power rail unless there's
 

761
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,930
power is the power rail unless there's
an item flowing through here then this

762
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:37,940
an item flowing through here then this
 

763
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,960
an item flowing through here then this
turns on this turns off and the cart

764
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:40,970
turns on this turns off and the cart
 

765
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,270
turns on this turns off and the cart
sits there until it's done sending stuff

766
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
sits there until it's done sending stuff
 

767
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,940
sits there until it's done sending stuff
through the hopper so it's pretty simple

768
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:45,950
through the hopper so it's pretty simple
 

769
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:50,080
through the hopper so it's pretty simple
however though let's actually get rid of

770
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,090
however though let's actually get rid of
 

771
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,090
however though let's actually get rid of
this for right now I just want to show

772
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:52,100
this for right now I just want to show
 

773
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,710
this for right now I just want to show
you something really important with this

774
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:53,720
you something really important with this
 

775
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:00,760
you something really important with this
setup okay just a little experiment here

776
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:00,770
setup okay just a little experiment here
 

777
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:07,330
setup okay just a little experiment here
so if you if you send blocks through

778
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:07,340
so if you if you send blocks through
 

779
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,220
so if you if you send blocks through
this look at this the comparator is not

780
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:09,230
this look at this the comparator is not
 

781
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,080
this look at this the comparator is not
turning on because there's it's not

782
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,090
turning on because there's it's not
 

783
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:14,650
turning on because there's it's not
registering any items in the hopper very

784
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:14,660
registering any items in the hopper very
 

785
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,650
registering any items in the hopper very
strange because it's definitely sending

786
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:17,660
strange because it's definitely sending
 

787
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,590
strange because it's definitely sending
stuff through there if you were to lock

788
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:20,600
stuff through there if you were to lock
 

789
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,530
stuff through there if you were to lock
the hopper below for a split second as

790
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:23,540
the hopper below for a split second as
 

791
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,180
the hopper below for a split second as
it's still sending stuff

792
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,190

 

793
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,240

hey all Sun starts working it's flashing

794
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,250
hey all Sun starts working it's flashing
 

795
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:36,430
hey all Sun starts working it's flashing
