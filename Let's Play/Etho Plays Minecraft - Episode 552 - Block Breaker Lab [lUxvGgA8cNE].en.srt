all right guys this is exciting mo jang
have added a new block to the game

8
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
have added a new block to the game
 

9
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,270
have added a new block to the game
another one for the 1.16 update you know

10
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,280
another one for the 1.16 update you know
 

11
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,550
another one for the 1.16 update you know
i thought they were done with the update

12
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:16,560
i thought they were done with the update
 

13
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,510
i thought they were done with the update
i thought that was it

14
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
i thought that was it
 

15
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,990
i thought that was it
um yeah there's a new block called

16
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
um yeah there's a new block called
 

17
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,910
um yeah there's a new block called
cracked nether bricks

18
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920
cracked nether bricks
 

19
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,269
cracked nether bricks
now technically it's been in the game

20
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
now technically it's been in the game
 

21
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,029
now technically it's been in the game
for quite a while but i just discovered

22
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:25,039
for quite a while but i just discovered
 

23
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,870
for quite a while but i just discovered
it today

24
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:26,880
it today
 

25
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,589
it today
somehow i missed this one uh i knew

26
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
somehow i missed this one uh i knew
 

27
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,990
somehow i missed this one uh i knew
about the chiseled one

28
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
about the chiseled one
 

29
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,630
about the chiseled one
but i didn't know they added this so you

30
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
but i didn't know they added this so you
 

31
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,750
but i didn't know they added this so you
just take uh

32
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
just take uh
 

33
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,590
just take uh
you pick the regular nether brick and

34
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600
you pick the regular nether brick and
 

35
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,590
you pick the regular nether brick and
you smelt it

36
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
you smelt it
 

37
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,190
you smelt it
can't craft it that's probably why i

38
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
can't craft it that's probably why i
 

39
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,709
can't craft it that's probably why i
didn't see it

40
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
didn't see it
 

41
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,790
didn't see it
oh look at this the cracks are in the

42
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
oh look at this the cracks are in the
 

43
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,790
oh look at this the cracks are in the
exact same place on every block

44
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
exact same place on every block
 

45
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,389
exact same place on every block
now if you guys are worried about the

46
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
now if you guys are worried about the
 

47
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,990
now if you guys are worried about the
end reporters that i had forgotten about

48
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000
end reporters that i had forgotten about
 

49
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,549
end reporters that i had forgotten about
them

50
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
them
 

51
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,869
them
no no no no i want to get ender porters

52
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:52,879
no no no no i want to get ender porters
 

53
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:53,750
no no no no i want to get ender porters
all around our world

54
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
all around our world
 

55
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,750
all around our world
trust me it just takes a lot of time to

56
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
trust me it just takes a lot of time to
 

57
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,110
trust me it just takes a lot of time to
set these up so i'm trying to do like

58
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
set these up so i'm trying to do like
 

59
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,869
set these up so i'm trying to do like
maybe one an episode

60
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
maybe one an episode
 

61
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,950
maybe one an episode
uh but i gotta like dig the tunnels run

62
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
uh but i gotta like dig the tunnels run
 

63
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,709
uh but i gotta like dig the tunnels run
the redstone hundreds of blocks that's

64
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
the redstone hundreds of blocks that's
 

65
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,590
the redstone hundreds of blocks that's
actually

66
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
actually
 

67
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,789
actually
surprisingly uh time consuming but we

68
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
surprisingly uh time consuming but we
 

69
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,469
surprisingly uh time consuming but we
got one over here now we gotta build a

70
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
got one over here now we gotta build a
 

71
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,870
got one over here now we gotta build a
building for this as well uh and

72
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
building for this as well uh and
 

73
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,789
building for this as well uh and
probably add a lot more to make it cool

74
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
probably add a lot more to make it cool
 

75
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,270
probably add a lot more to make it cool
but

76
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
but
 

77
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,310
but
for now we hit the button takes us to

78
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
for now we hit the button takes us to
 

79
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,469
for now we hit the button takes us to
our guardian farm so we can go to our

80
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
our guardian farm so we can go to our
 

81
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,510
our guardian farm so we can go to our
guardian farm and back now

82
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
guardian farm and back now
 

83
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,429
guardian farm and back now
look how fast that is too that's insane

84
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
look how fast that is too that's insane
 

85
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,789
look how fast that is too that's insane
yeah so to give you an idea of what's

86
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
yeah so to give you an idea of what's
 

87
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,990
yeah so to give you an idea of what's
happening here we're just

88
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
happening here we're just
 

89
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,990
happening here we're just
suspending our ender pearl in the bubble

90
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
suspending our ender pearl in the bubble
 

91
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,510
suspending our ender pearl in the bubble
column and then whenever we want to

92
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
column and then whenever we want to
 

93
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,749
column and then whenever we want to
activate it we'll teleport

94
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
activate it we'll teleport
 

95
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,990
activate it we'll teleport
and we've run redstone hundreds of

96
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
and we've run redstone hundreds of
 

97
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,670
and we've run redstone hundreds of
blocks to different locations in our

98
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
blocks to different locations in our
 

99
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,630
blocks to different locations in our
world

100
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
world
 

101
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,390
world
so that we can teleport hundreds of

102
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400
so that we can teleport hundreds of
 

103
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,469
so that we can teleport hundreds of
blocks at the press of a button

104
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
blocks at the press of a button
 

105
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,590
blocks at the press of a button
basically

106
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
basically
 

107
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,510
basically
so that one takes us all the way to over

108
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
so that one takes us all the way to over
 

109
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,510
so that one takes us all the way to over
here we also had another one that we set

110
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
here we also had another one that we set
 

111
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,030
here we also had another one that we set
up previously this takes us to our

112
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
up previously this takes us to our
 

113
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,310
up previously this takes us to our
stronghold

114
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
stronghold
 

115
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,270
stronghold
which is a few hundred blocks away as

116
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
which is a few hundred blocks away as
 

117
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,389
which is a few hundred blocks away as
well

118
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
well
 

119
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,550
well
and basically you just load the pearl

120
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
and basically you just load the pearl
 

121
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,350
and basically you just load the pearl
hit the button and then go back

122
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
hit the button and then go back
 

123
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,270
hit the button and then go back
so this one it takes a couple seconds to

124
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
so this one it takes a couple seconds to
 

125
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,389
so this one it takes a couple seconds to
activate

126
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
activate
 

127
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,190
activate
um we tried to make like an instant wire

128
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,200
um we tried to make like an instant wire
 

129
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,670
um we tried to make like an instant wire
using

130
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
using
 

131
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,550
using
trip wires but i'm no i thought it was a

132
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
trip wires but i'm no i thought it was a
 

133
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,070
trip wires but i'm no i thought it was a
little bit slow because the chunks were

134
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
little bit slow because the chunks were
 

135
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,589
little bit slow because the chunks were
loading and there was a delay

136
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
loading and there was a delay
 

137
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,510
loading and there was a delay
but now i'm realizing it's probably got

138
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
but now i'm realizing it's probably got
 

139
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,830
but now i'm realizing it's probably got
a little bit of delay in the wire itself

140
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
a little bit of delay in the wire itself
 

141
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,949
a little bit of delay in the wire itself
it wasn't instant

142
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
it wasn't instant
 

143
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,350
it wasn't instant
after all because this one seems a lot

144
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
after all because this one seems a lot
 

145
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,630
after all because this one seems a lot
faster to me

146
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
faster to me
 

147
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,229
faster to me
yeah so for this end reporter we just

148
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
yeah so for this end reporter we just
 

149
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,070
yeah so for this end reporter we just
went for the old school instant wire

150
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
went for the old school instant wire
 

151
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,070
went for the old school instant wire
this has been in the game for many years

152
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
this has been in the game for many years
 

153
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,190
this has been in the game for many years
and

154
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
and
 

155
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,670
and
probably won't break anytime soon aha

156
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
probably won't break anytime soon aha
 

157
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,350
probably won't break anytime soon aha
yeah so last episode i

158
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
yeah so last episode i
 

159
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,990
yeah so last episode i
introduced the big project plan to you

160
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
introduced the big project plan to you
 

161
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,430
introduced the big project plan to you

there's mysteries out there guys we

196
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
there's mysteries out there guys we
 

197
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,949
there's mysteries out there guys we
gotta discover them we gotta

we gotta explain them we gotta we gotta
see all the craziness and the lab is

202
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
see all the craziness and the lab is
 

203
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,110
see all the craziness and the lab is
gonna allow us to do it

204
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
gonna allow us to do it
 

205
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,949
gonna allow us to do it
i mean look at that guys can you explain

206
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
i mean look at that guys can you explain
 

207
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,470
i mean look at that guys can you explain
that

208
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
that
 

209
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,830
that
i could probably explain it to you but

210
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
i could probably explain it to you but
 

211
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,350
i could probably explain it to you but
i'm not going to tell you i believe that

212
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
i'm not going to tell you i believe that
 

213
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,110
i'm not going to tell you i believe that
as a little puzzle for you guys

214
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
as a little puzzle for you guys
 

215
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,430
as a little puzzle for you guys
now before we get to building our lab we

216
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
now before we get to building our lab we
 

217
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,550
now before we get to building our lab we
got to clear out a

218
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
got to clear out a
 

219
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,030
got to clear out a
massive area in that mountain hollow it

220
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
massive area in that mountain hollow it
 

221
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,990
massive area in that mountain hollow it
out

222
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
out
 

223
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,710
out
which got me wondering about the respawn

224
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
which got me wondering about the respawn
 

225
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,509
which got me wondering about the respawn
anchor now

226
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
anchor now
 

227
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,270
anchor now
speed mining has been the fastest way of

228
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
speed mining has been the fastest way of
 

229
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,630
speed mining has been the fastest way of
mining in this game

230
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
mining in this game
 

231
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,789
mining in this game
for the longest time technically tnt is

232
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
for the longest time technically tnt is
 

233
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,030
for the longest time technically tnt is
faster if you have the tnt

234
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
faster if you have the tnt
 

235
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,190
faster if you have the tnt
generally for tnt to be faster you need

236
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
generally for tnt to be faster you need
 

237
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,830
generally for tnt to be faster you need
to either dupe the sand or dupe the tnt

238
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
to either dupe the sand or dupe the tnt
 

239
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,110
to either dupe the sand or dupe the tnt
which is not something we do in our

240
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
which is not something we do in our
 

241
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,350
which is not something we do in our
let's play here so we need

242
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
let's play here so we need
 

243
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,229
let's play here so we need
to try respawn anchors so these emit a

244
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
to try respawn anchors so these emit a
 

245
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,149
to try respawn anchors so these emit a
massive explosion and they

246
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
massive explosion and they
 

247
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,869
massive explosion and they
should be faster than speed mining if

248
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
should be faster than speed mining if
 

249
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,710
should be faster than speed mining if
you can survive it

250
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
you can survive it
 

251
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,030
you can survive it
so we got blast protection pretty much

252
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
so we got blast protection pretty much
 

253
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,390
so we got blast protection pretty much
maxed out here

254
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
maxed out here
 

255
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,830
maxed out here
i want to see how much damage this

256
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
i want to see how much damage this
 

257
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,429
i want to see how much damage this
actually does

258
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
actually does
 

259
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,149
actually does
and we're gonna try have our shield

260
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
and we're gonna try have our shield
 

261
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,429
and we're gonna try have our shield
equipped to

262
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
equipped to
 

263
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,030
equipped to
take the blast as we right click this

264
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
take the blast as we right click this
 

265
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,390
take the blast as we right click this
thing

266
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
thing
 

267
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,749
thing
you ready for it i don't know if we can

268
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
you ready for it i don't know if we can
 

269
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,550
you ready for it i don't know if we can
do that

270
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560

 

271
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,629

well it's survivable just barely though

272
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
well it's survivable just barely though
 

273
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,110
well it's survivable just barely though
oh snappers we might be on to something

274
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
oh snappers we might be on to something
 

275
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,790
oh snappers we might be on to something
here actually i wasn't sure at first but

276
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
here actually i wasn't sure at first but
 

277
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,629
here actually i wasn't sure at first but
i've done a bit more testing

278
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
i've done a bit more testing
 

279
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,670
i've done a bit more testing
and this might be a game changer idea

280
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
and this might be a game changer idea
 

281
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,070
and this might be a game changer idea
so the cool thing about respawn anchors

282
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
so the cool thing about respawn anchors
 

283
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,430
so the cool thing about respawn anchors
is they're kind of farmable right you

284
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
is they're kind of farmable right you
 

285
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,430
is they're kind of farmable right you
get the crying obsidian from the piglen

286
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
get the crying obsidian from the piglen
 

287
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,790
get the crying obsidian from the piglen
bartering and the

288
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
bartering and the
 

289
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,270
bartering and the
glowstone from villager trading so you

290
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
glowstone from villager trading so you
 

291
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,390
glowstone from villager trading so you
can acquire them

292
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
can acquire them
 

293
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,110
can acquire them
fairly easily and you need glowstone to

294
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
fairly easily and you need glowstone to
 

295
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,390
fairly easily and you need glowstone to
activate them

296
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
activate them
 

297
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,830
activate them
uh we got to clear out this room this is

298
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
uh we got to clear out this room this is
 

299
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,189
uh we got to clear out this room this is
where we're going to be putting our

300
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
where we're going to be putting our
 

301
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,189
where we're going to be putting our
block breaking lab we got to go about 15

302
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
block breaking lab we got to go about 15
 

303
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,110
block breaking lab we got to go about 15
to 20 blocks up in this area

304
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
to 20 blocks up in this area
 

305
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,870
to 20 blocks up in this area
which is a fair bit of land to clear

306
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
which is a fair bit of land to clear
 

307
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,629
which is a fair bit of land to clear
right so

308
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
right so
 

309
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,270
right so
here is what i've kind of figured out

310
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
here is what i've kind of figured out
 

311
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,870
here is what i've kind of figured out
still refining the idea a bit

312
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
still refining the idea a bit
 

313
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,990
still refining the idea a bit
but i think your respawn anchor

314
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
but i think your respawn anchor
 

315
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,670
but i think your respawn anchor
dirt respawn anchor dirt respawn anchor

316
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
dirt respawn anchor dirt respawn anchor
 

317
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,189
dirt respawn anchor dirt respawn anchor
all the way up to as high as you want to

318
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
all the way up to as high as you want to
 

319
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,670
all the way up to as high as you want to
go

320
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
go
 

321
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,270
go
so here's the secret sauce to it we're

322
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
so here's the secret sauce to it we're
 

323
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,029
so here's the secret sauce to it we're
going to put an anchor on the top this

324
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
going to put an anchor on the top this
 

325
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,870
going to put an anchor on the top this
will block the explosion from really

326
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
will block the explosion from really
 

327
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,909
will block the explosion from really
hitting us

328
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
hitting us
 

329
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,909
hitting us
and the cool thing is as we go down the

330
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
and the cool thing is as we go down the
 

331
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,990
and the cool thing is as we go down the
anvil falls with us

332
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
anvil falls with us
 

333
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,909
anvil falls with us
so i think this is all we got to do so

334
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
so i think this is all we got to do so
 

335
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,590
so i think this is all we got to do so
we right click the glowstone then we

336
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
we right click the glowstone then we
 

337
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,909
we right click the glowstone then we
right click the anchor

338
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
right click the anchor
 

339
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,950
right click the anchor
and we took like no damage

340
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
and we took like no damage
 

341
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,430
and we took like no damage
i got a fire resist on i got resistance

342
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
i got a fire resist on i got resistance
 

343
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,350
i got a fire resist on i got resistance
beacon and all that stuff at the moment

344

don't want to lose my stuff
 

351
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,469
don't want to lose my stuff
but yeah you just right click go down

352
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
but yeah you just right click go down
 

353
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,990
but yeah you just right click go down
right click down

354
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
right click down
 

355
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,629
right click down
right click go down all the way down

356
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
right click go down all the way down
 

357
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,550
right click go down all the way down
here now here

358
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
here now here
 

359
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,070
here now here
we could get hurt because i'm not above

360
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
we could get hurt because i'm not above
 

361
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,870
we could get hurt because i'm not above
it

362
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880

 

363
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,029

and uh yeah it clears out a decent

364
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
and uh yeah it clears out a decent
 

365
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,309
and uh yeah it clears out a decent
amount of area

366
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
amount of area
 

367
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,309
amount of area
uh we might need to put it every block

368
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
uh we might need to put it every block
 

369
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,590
uh we might need to put it every block
though because it's leaving a bit more

370
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
though because it's leaving a bit more
 

371
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,870
though because it's leaving a bit more
junk than i expected

372
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
junk than i expected
 

373
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,070
junk than i expected
yeah let's go again here but we're going

374
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
yeah let's go again here but we're going
 

375
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,510
yeah let's go again here but we're going
to place it every block this time i

376
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
to place it every block this time i
 

377
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,270
to place it every block this time i
think it'll work a lot better actually

378
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
think it'll work a lot better actually
 

379
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,830
think it'll work a lot better actually
so just solid anchors all the way up

380
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
so just solid anchors all the way up
 

381
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,830
so just solid anchors all the way up
here

382
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
here
 

383
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,189
here
oh i don't have my shovel on me because

384
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
oh i don't have my shovel on me because
 

385
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,350
oh i don't have my shovel on me because
i'm afraid i'm going to die here

386
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
i'm afraid i'm going to die here
 

387
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,550
i'm afraid i'm going to die here
another thing you can do with this as

388
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
another thing you can do with this as
 

389
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,830
another thing you can do with this as
well if you don't mind wasting some

390
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
well if you don't mind wasting some
 

391
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,350
well if you don't mind wasting some
glowstone is you can just hold right

392
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
glowstone is you can just hold right
 

393
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,629
glowstone is you can just hold right
click if you want to fill it up all the

394
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
click if you want to fill it up all the
 

395
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,390
click if you want to fill it up all the
way

396
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
way
 

397
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,670
way
and then it pops but

398
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
and then it pops but
 

399
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,629
and then it pops but
that way you don't have to switch

400
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
that way you don't have to switch
 

401
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,590
that way you don't have to switch
between items

402
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600

 

403
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,170

still a little nervous

404
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:36,180
still a little nervous
 

405
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,029
still a little nervous
[Music]

406
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
[Music]
 

407
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,110
[Music]
oh it's so cool though

408
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120

 

409
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,469

isn't it i think that's so awesome

410
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
isn't it i think that's so awesome
 

411
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,230
isn't it i think that's so awesome
anvil still okay you got to keep an eye

412
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
anvil still okay you got to keep an eye
 

413
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,550
anvil still okay you got to keep an eye
on it oh i'm stuck on something here

414
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560

 

415
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,029

i got to figure out how to center better

416
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
i got to figure out how to center better
 

417
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,790
i got to figure out how to center better
because the main thing i waste time on

418
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
because the main thing i waste time on
 

419
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,029
because the main thing i waste time on
is

420
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
is
 

421
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,870
is
trying to get back on the anvil here

422
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
trying to get back on the anvil here
 

423
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,550
trying to get back on the anvil here
kind of pushes you away

424
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
kind of pushes you away
 

425
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,350
kind of pushes you away
as you go down maybe i gotta jump

426
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
as you go down maybe i gotta jump
 

427
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,110
as you go down maybe i gotta jump
every time oh i'm out of ghost stone but

428
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
every time oh i'm out of ghost stone but
 

429
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,710
every time oh i'm out of ghost stone but
yeah look how much bigger this hole is

430
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
yeah look how much bigger this hole is
 

431
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,550
yeah look how much bigger this hole is
you gotta do it every block i guess

432
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560

 

433
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,909

even though that seems to work

434
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:15,919
even though that seems to work
 

435
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,110
even though that seems to work
unfortunately i'm gonna have to mine

436
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
unfortunately i'm gonna have to mine
 

437
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,629
unfortunately i'm gonna have to mine
most this out manually still

438
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
most this out manually still
 

439
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,710
most this out manually still
because uh we don't have a good gold

440
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
because uh we don't have a good gold
 

441
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,390
because uh we don't have a good gold
farm and that was my only stack of

442
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
farm and that was my only stack of
 

443
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,670
farm and that was my only stack of
respawn anchors so

444
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
respawn anchors so
 

445
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,950
respawn anchors so
we're out very much mining later and

446
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
we're out very much mining later and
 

447
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,350
we're out very much mining later and
check it out we got a massive room

448
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
check it out we got a massive room
 

449
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,070
check it out we got a massive room
cleared out

450
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
cleared out
 

451
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,550
cleared out
oh look at all this space think of all

452
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
oh look at all this space think of all
 

453
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,990
oh look at all this space think of all
the things we could do with all this

454
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
the things we could do with all this
 

455
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,469
the things we could do with all this
space

456
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
space
 

457
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,309
space
this is perfect i just got a whole bunch

458
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:36,319
this is perfect i just got a whole bunch
 

459
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,990
this is perfect i just got a whole bunch
of stone and we have a place to put it

460
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
of stone and we have a place to put it
 

461
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,870
of stone and we have a place to put it
now

462
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
now
 

463
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,469
now
with that i think we're ready to get

464
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
with that i think we're ready to get
 

465
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,150
with that i think we're ready to get
started building the very first room

466
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
started building the very first room
 

467
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,070
started building the very first room
of our new lab project oh this is

468
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
of our new lab project oh this is
 

469
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,150
of our new lab project oh this is
exciting yeah so i tried to jot down a

470
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
exciting yeah so i tried to jot down a
 

471
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,749
exciting yeah so i tried to jot down a
couple notes here to help organize

472
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
couple notes here to help organize
 

473
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,110
couple notes here to help organize
what we're going to be putting in this

474
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
what we're going to be putting in this
 

475
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,510
what we're going to be putting in this
block breaking room so if it's related

476
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
block breaking room so if it's related
 

477
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,350
block breaking room so if it's related
to block breaking ideally we'll want to

478
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
to block breaking ideally we'll want to
 

479
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,350
to block breaking ideally we'll want to
put it in this room like haste 1 haste

480
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
put it in this room like haste 1 haste
 

481
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,390
put it in this room like haste 1 haste
two beacons

482
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
two beacons
 

483
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,629
two beacons
affect your mining speed so that's

484
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
affect your mining speed so that's
 

485
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,309
affect your mining speed so that's
related to block braking right so

486
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
related to block braking right so
 

487
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,629
related to block braking right so
somewhere in this room we wanna set up a

488
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
somewhere in this room we wanna set up a
 

489
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,230
somewhere in this room we wanna set up a
haste one and haste two beacon that we

490
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
haste one and haste two beacon that we
 

491
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,469

version of this is we're trying to build
a lab

516
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
a lab
 

517
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,830
a lab
but rather than fill in the rooms of

518
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
but rather than fill in the rooms of
 

519
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,110
but rather than fill in the rooms of
that lab with

520
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
that lab with
 

521
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,070
that lab with
like uh machines that are purely

522
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
like uh machines that are purely
 

523
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,750
like uh machines that are purely
decorative that don't do anything

524
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
decorative that don't do anything
 

525
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,790
decorative that don't do anything
we're gonna use the game as content

526
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
we're gonna use the game as content
 

527
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,029
we're gonna use the game as content
for deciding what we put in our rooms

528
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
for deciding what we put in our rooms
 

529
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,790
for deciding what we put in our rooms
and we're going to try arrange them

530
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
and we're going to try arrange them
 

531
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,230
and we're going to try arrange them
in a way that looks nice and is

532
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
in a way that looks nice and is
 

533
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,910
in a way that looks nice and is
presentable and interactive

534
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
presentable and interactive
 

535
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,670

last episode we got started on the
mining speed timer i just added a couple

538
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
mining speed timer i just added a couple
 

539
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,750
mining speed timer i just added a couple
lights above it to represent seconds the

540
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
lights above it to represent seconds the
 

541
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,750
lights above it to represent seconds the
bottom row is for tenths of seconds

542
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
bottom row is for tenths of seconds
 

543
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,910
bottom row is for tenths of seconds
so for breaking obsidian something that

544
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
so for breaking obsidian something that
 

545
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,470
so for breaking obsidian something that
takes a bit longer we'll be able to

546
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
takes a bit longer we'll be able to
 

547
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,030
takes a bit longer we'll be able to
hopefully measure that still but yeah

548
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
hopefully measure that still but yeah
 

549
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,470
hopefully measure that still but yeah
this is gonna be the main machine of

550
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
this is gonna be the main machine of
 

551
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,150
this is gonna be the main machine of
this room the most important thing so we

552
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
this room the most important thing so we
 

553
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,990
this room the most important thing so we
want that center of the room front

um yeah so beacons i'm thinking we're
 

569
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,990
um yeah so beacons i'm thinking we're
gonna put above the timer

570
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
gonna put above the timer
 

571
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,990
gonna put above the timer
to the left and the right and the

572
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
to the left and the right and the
 

573
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,389
to the left and the right and the
conduit up above in the middle

574
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
conduit up above in the middle
 

575
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,630
conduit up above in the middle
uh elder guardians probably gonna be up

576
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
uh elder guardians probably gonna be up
 

577
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,630
uh elder guardians probably gonna be up
above us in the center of the room

above us in the center of the room
 

579
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,310
above us in the center of the room
and because this is gonna be such a

massive room my plan is
 

583
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,190
massive room my plan is
to add four columns to it uh one over

584
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
to add four columns to it uh one over
 

585
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,910
to add four columns to it uh one over
there one

586

there one here one here they're going to
 

589
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,949
there one here one here they're going to
go up to the ceiling and look like

590
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
go up to the ceiling and look like
 

591
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:43,350
go up to the ceiling and look like
they're

592
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
they're
 

593
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,509
they're
supporting the roof so it doesn't cave

594
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
supporting the roof so it doesn't cave
 

595
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,870
supporting the roof so it doesn't cave
in on us right

596
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
in on us right
 

597
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,030
in on us right
um the plan with this is blackstone

598
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
um the plan with this is blackstone
 

599
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,470
um the plan with this is blackstone
columns we're going to get some glass

600
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
columns we're going to get some glass
 

601
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,030
columns we're going to get some glass
panes blue ones here for color

602
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
panes blue ones here for color
 

603
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,030
panes blue ones here for color
and i want to try something out with

604
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
and i want to try something out with
 

605
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,790
and i want to try something out with
this build end rods

606
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
this build end rods
 

607
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,550
this build end rods
are going to be used a lot probably

608
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
are going to be used a lot probably
 

609
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,990
are going to be used a lot probably
stack them like this in the middle the

610
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
stack them like this in the middle the
 

611
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,910
stack them like this in the middle the
panes don't connect to them

612
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
panes don't connect to them
 

613
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,590
panes don't connect to them
oh yeah check that out so the other

614
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
oh yeah check that out so the other
 

615
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,910
oh yeah check that out so the other
thing these columns do is they frame in

616
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
thing these columns do is they frame in
 

617
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,790
thing these columns do is they frame in
our timer

618
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
our timer
 

619
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,310
our timer
again this is our centerpiece of the

620
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
again this is our centerpiece of the
 

621
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,630
again this is our centerpiece of the
room we want our eyes to focus on that

622
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
room we want our eyes to focus on that
 

623
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,949
room we want our eyes to focus on that
and these kind of work as a border by

624
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
and these kind of work as a border by
 

625
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,949
and these kind of work as a border by
having them stick out a bit

626
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
having them stick out a bit
 

627
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,430
having them stick out a bit
forward and also by being a different

628
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
forward and also by being a different
 

629
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,230
forward and also by being a different
color

630
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
color
 

631
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,550
color
it makes our eyes attracted more to the

632
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
it makes our eyes attracted more to the
 

633
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,509
it makes our eyes attracted more to the
center here

634
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
center here
 

635
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,190
center here
the other thing that we should do is

636
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
the other thing that we should do is
 

637
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,790
the other thing that we should do is
lighten up that timer it's like

638
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
lighten up that timer it's like
 

639
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,350
lighten up that timer it's like
gray concrete black stone basalt let's

640
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
gray concrete black stone basalt let's
 

641
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,870
gray concrete black stone basalt let's
try use some of these other colors we

642
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
try use some of these other colors we
 

643
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,150
try use some of these other colors we
have in mind for the

644
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
have in mind for the
 

645
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,750
have in mind for the
our build palette here i think we're

646
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
our build palette here i think we're
 

647
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,430
our build palette here i think we're
gonna go for acacia it's close in color

648
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
gonna go for acacia it's close in color
 

649
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,350
gonna go for acacia it's close in color
to the lamps and i think we're gonna be

650
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
to the lamps and i think we're gonna be
 

651
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,790
to the lamps and i think we're gonna be
speeding through most of the building

652
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
speeding through most of the building
 

653
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,310
speeding through most of the building
this episode i mostly just want to show

654
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
this episode i mostly just want to show
 

655
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,829
this episode i mostly just want to show
you guys why we're doing stuff not

656
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
you guys why we're doing stuff not
 

657
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,870
you guys why we're doing stuff not
actually the building itself

658
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
actually the building itself
 

659
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,430
actually the building itself
basalt door frame i don't think so nope

660
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
basalt door frame i don't think so nope
 

661
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,509
basalt door frame i don't think so nope
we're going for red terracotta

662
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
we're going for red terracotta
 

663
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,350
we're going for red terracotta
so the formula i used to use when

664
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
so the formula i used to use when
 

665
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,790
so the formula i used to use when
building is i would pick three

666
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
building is i would pick three
 

667
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,829
building is i would pick three
maybe four blocks different colors

668
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
maybe four blocks different colors
 

669
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,910
maybe four blocks different colors
and then those are the only blocks i

670
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
and then those are the only blocks i
 

671
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,430
and then those are the only blocks i
would use in the build

672
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
would use in the build
 

673
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,430
would use in the build
and that works fine on a small scale but

674
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
and that works fine on a small scale but
 

675
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,350
and that works fine on a small scale but
if you're doing a big room like this

676
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
if you're doing a big room like this
 

677
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,829
if you're doing a big room like this
you want like a few different colors and

678
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
you want like a few different colors and
 

679
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,750
you want like a few different colors and
then lots of different shades within

680
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
then lots of different shades within
 

681
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,190
then lots of different shades within
those colors so

682
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
those colors so
 

683
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,590
those colors so
we're not just having red terracotta

684
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
we're not just having red terracotta
 

685
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,470
we're not just having red terracotta
we're having

686
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
we're having
 

687
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,030
we're having
crimson wood mixed in different oranges

688
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
crimson wood mixed in different oranges
 

689
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,990
crimson wood mixed in different oranges
and stuff

690
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
and stuff
 

691
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,470
and stuff
and kind of fade between the things you

692
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
and kind of fade between the things you
 

693
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,990
and kind of fade between the things you
know this happens to be every time i

694
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
know this happens to be every time i
 

695
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,590
know this happens to be every time i
build something it's like oh

696
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
build something it's like oh
 

697
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,509
build something it's like oh
i'm okay with it and then i start second

698
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
i'm okay with it and then i start second
 

699
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,110
i'm okay with it and then i start second
guessing myself a little bit like is it

700
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
guessing myself a little bit like is it
 

701
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,710
guessing myself a little bit like is it
too much detail

702
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
too much detail
 

703
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,670
too much detail
oh it might be too much detail might be

704
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
oh it might be too much detail might be
 

705
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:27,990
oh it might be too much detail might be
a bit

706
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
a bit
 

707
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,790
a bit
too chaotic i don't know uh we gotta

708
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
too chaotic i don't know uh we gotta
 

709
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,710
too chaotic i don't know uh we gotta
drop off a few things that the man cave

710
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
drop off a few things that the man cave
 

711
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,110
drop off a few things that the man cave
and also pick up a few things so if you

712
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
and also pick up a few things so if you
 

713
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,030
and also pick up a few things so if you
guys don't know i'm storing a lot of my

i think i'm gonna make him a special
 

729
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,910
i think i'm gonna make him a special
little area

730
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
little area
 

731
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,430
little area
or something let's just put a composter

732
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
or something let's just put a composter
 

733
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,710
or something let's just put a composter
here maybe he'll go to that

734
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
here maybe he'll go to that
 

735
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,430
here maybe he'll go to that
oh he's going to it he's going to it

736
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
oh he's going to it he's going to it
 

737

got to get our tools repaired you know

740
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
got to get our tools repaired you know
 

741
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,310
got to get our tools repaired you know
it happens to all of us you're mining

742
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
it happens to all of us you're mining
 

743
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,910
it happens to all of us you're mining
you're not paying attention

744
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
you're not paying attention
 

745
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,389
you're not paying attention
and bam you break your diamond pick it's

746
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
and bam you break your diamond pick it's
 

747
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,470
and bam you break your diamond pick it's
the worst feeling ever

748
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
the worst feeling ever
 

749
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,150
the worst feeling ever
nope not anymore now you can break

750
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
nope not anymore now you can break
 

751
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,230
nope not anymore now you can break

752
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
netherrite pics
 

753
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,750
netherrite pics
oh i haven't done it yet but i'm gonna

754
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
oh i haven't done it yet but i'm gonna
 

755
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,269
oh i haven't done it yet but i'm gonna
be so sad when i do it

756
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
be so sad when i do it
 

757
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,190
be so sad when i do it
yeah so at first when i was designing

758
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
yeah so at first when i was designing
 

759
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,190
yeah so at first when i was designing
this i just did a rectangle shape for

760
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200
this i just did a rectangle shape for
 

761
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,110
this i just did a rectangle shape for
the timer and it looked okay but it was

762
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
the timer and it looked okay but it was
 

763
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,069
the timer and it looked okay but it was
very plain

764
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
very plain
 

765
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,470
very plain
so i went back and i've added a whoo-hoo

766
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480
so i went back and i've added a whoo-hoo
 

767
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,910
so i went back and i've added a whoo-hoo
at the top there

768
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
at the top there
 

769
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,509
at the top there
and that just makes it a bit more

770
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
and that just makes it a bit more
 

771
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,350
and that just makes it a bit more
interesting i think you can see we got

772
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
interesting i think you can see we got
 

773
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,269
interesting i think you can see we got
the most acacia in the center again

774
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
the most acacia in the center again
 

775
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,269
the most acacia in the center again
that's to help focus our eyes on the

776
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:35,279
that's to help focus our eyes on the
 

777
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,230
that's to help focus our eyes on the
center

778
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
center
 

779
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,430
center
and there's a little bit less on the

780
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
and there's a little bit less on the
 

781
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,470
and there's a little bit less on the
sides and also the center is the biggest

782
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
sides and also the center is the biggest
 

783
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,269
sides and also the center is the biggest
portion of the thing but yeah we are on

784
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:43,279
portion of the thing but yeah we are on
 

785
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,150
portion of the thing but yeah we are on
number two

786
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
number two
 

787
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,190
number two
of our list here block hardness stash so

788
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
of our list here block hardness stash so
 

789
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,790
of our list here block hardness stash so
we have a machine to figure out how fast

790
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
we have a machine to figure out how fast
 

791
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,629
we have a machine to figure out how fast
we can mine blocks

792
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
we can mine blocks
 

793
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,110
we can mine blocks
we need we need the blocks now so we're

794
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
we need we need the blocks now so we're
 

795
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,150
we need we need the blocks now so we're
gonna have

796
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
gonna have
 

797
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,310
gonna have
in these spaces here a stash of all the

798
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
in these spaces here a stash of all the
 

799
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,350
in these spaces here a stash of all the
blocks in the game

800
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
blocks in the game
 

801
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,949
blocks in the game
ideally i don't know if we're actually

802
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
ideally i don't know if we're actually
 

803
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,470
ideally i don't know if we're actually
gonna get to doing that but

804
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
gonna get to doing that but
 

805
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,790
gonna get to doing that but
we'd probably want a stack or at least

806
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
we'd probably want a stack or at least
 

807
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,670
we'd probably want a stack or at least
four blocks

808
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
four blocks
 

809
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,230
four blocks
of each thing in these chests and

810
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
of each thing in these chests and
 

811
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,790
of each thing in these chests and
hopefully

812
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
hopefully
 

813
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,110
hopefully

thoughts uh about it
so yeah is a very polarizing idea it

850
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
so yeah is a very polarizing idea it
 

851
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,750
so yeah is a very polarizing idea it
seems some of you are really in favor of

852
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
seems some of you are really in favor of
 

853
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,150
seems some of you are really in favor of
me doing this project and some of you

854
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
me doing this project and some of you
 

855
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,430
me doing this project and some of you
seem to be not so much in favor of it

856
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:55,440
seem to be not so much in favor of it
 

857
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,670
seem to be not so much in favor of it
some valid criticism got brought up that

858
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
some valid criticism got brought up that
 

859
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,189
some valid criticism got brought up that
i hadn't thought about actually

860
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
i hadn't thought about actually
 

861
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,590
i hadn't thought about actually
so i've taken that in and i think it

862
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600
so i've taken that in and i think it
 

863
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,629
so i've taken that in and i think it
might adjust

864
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
might adjust
 

865
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,350
might adjust
how we do this project a little bit but

866
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
how we do this project a little bit but
 

867
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,710
how we do this project a little bit but
also i just want to say

868
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
also i just want to say
 

869
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,629
also i just want to say
we'll probably roll with it for a few

870
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
we'll probably roll with it for a few
 

871
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,150
we'll probably roll with it for a few
episodes and just see

872
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
episodes and just see
 

873
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,670
episodes and just see
if you guys like it or not because it's

874
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
if you guys like it or not because it's
 

875
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,069
if you guys like it or not because it's
hard to judge if you like it or not even

876
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
hard to judge if you like it or not even
 

877
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,189
hard to judge if you like it or not even
i don't know

878

i don't know
 

879
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,030
i don't know
what we're doing exactly until we

880
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
what we're doing exactly until we
 

881
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,870
what we're doing exactly until we
actually just get down and start

882
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
actually just get down and start
 

883
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,470
actually just get down and start
building it like we are today

884
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
building it like we are today
 

885
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,910
building it like we are today
so yeah i think once we make a little

886
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
so yeah i think once we make a little
 

887
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,670
so yeah i think once we make a little
bit of progress on it i'll check in with

888
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
bit of progress on it i'll check in with
 

889
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,350
bit of progress on it i'll check in with
you guys again and see if the thoughts

890
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
you guys again and see if the thoughts
 

891
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,949
you guys again and see if the thoughts
are the same or if they've changed it

892
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
are the same or if they've changed it

00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,040
and then figure out what to do from
 

897
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,269
and then figure out what to do from
there oh snappers

i don't think most of the rooms we do in
 

909
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,670
i don't think most of the rooms we do in
this project are going to be quite so

910
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
this project are going to be quite so
 

911
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,069

wings onto this still and i didn't get
to that

952

but there's an area underneath which is
 

969
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,910

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,470
dome here uh with an exhibit in
somewhere around here that way we can

976
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
somewhere around here that way we can
 

977
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,230
somewhere around here that way we can
still look out and see the cool scenery

978
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
still look out and see the cool scenery
 

979
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,949
still look out and see the cool scenery
here

980
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959
here
 

981
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,509
here
um which i think will be good but yeah

982
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
um which i think will be good but yeah
 

983
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,110
um which i think will be good but yeah
we added another column

984
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
we added another column
 

985
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,150
we added another column
like we had the original four and then

986
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
like we had the original four and then
 

987
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,069
like we had the original four and then
besides these ones i added another one

988
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
besides these ones i added another one
 

989
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,990
besides these ones i added another one
so we could put a staircase between

990
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
so we could put a staircase between
 

991
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,030
so we could put a staircase between
so you go up the staircase did you see

992
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
so you go up the staircase did you see
 

993
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,230
so you go up the staircase did you see
him

994
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
him
 

995
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,710
him
i saw him he's over here oh he can't get

996
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
i saw him he's over here oh he can't get
 

997
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,870
i saw him he's over here oh he can't get
to us though

998
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
to us though
 

999
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,310
to us though
so we'll probably have a door that leads

1000
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
so we'll probably have a door that leads
 

1001
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,230
so we'll probably have a door that leads
to the facility over here

1002
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
to the facility over here
 

1003
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,230
to the facility over here
we also can then go across the bridge

1004
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,240
we also can then go across the bridge
 

1005
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,749
we also can then go across the bridge
and get a pretty good view

1006
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
and get a pretty good view
 

1007
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,350
and get a pretty good view
good overview of the room here so you

1008
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
good overview of the room here so you
 

1009
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,949
good overview of the room here so you
can see the beacons nice and easy from

1010
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
can see the beacons nice and easy from
 

1011
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:13,910
can see the beacons nice and easy from
here

1012
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
here
 

1013
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,150
here
uh you'll notice i made the middle area

1014
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
uh you'll notice i made the middle area
 

1015
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,430
uh you'll notice i made the middle area
a little bit brighter red

1016
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
a little bit brighter red
 

1017
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,509
a little bit brighter red
and then the sides are the crimson stem

1018
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
and then the sides are the crimson stem
 

1019
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,629
and then the sides are the crimson stem
a bit darker

1020
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
a bit darker
 

1021
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,189
a bit darker
and it just kind of makes the center

1022
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
and it just kind of makes the center
 

1023
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,870
and it just kind of makes the center
more important i guess

1024
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
more important i guess
 

1025
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,030
more important i guess
uh this bridge is uh just the acacia

1026
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
uh this bridge is uh just the acacia
 

1027
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,710
uh this bridge is uh just the acacia
trap doors we've got some end rods in

1028
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
trap doors we've got some end rods in
 

1029
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,269
trap doors we've got some end rods in
here

1030
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
here
 

1031
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,269
here
kind of feels like we got some wiring

1032
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:31,279
kind of feels like we got some wiring
 

1033
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,030
kind of feels like we got some wiring
running under metal grating

1034
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
running under metal grating
 

1035
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,269
running under metal grating
is what i was trying to go for and then

1036
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
is what i was trying to go for and then
 

1037
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,949
is what i was trying to go for and then
chains is railing

1038
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
chains is railing
 

1039
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,310
chains is railing
um a couple lanterns and stuff again

1040
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
um a couple lanterns and stuff again
 

1041
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,829
um a couple lanterns and stuff again
we'll probably have another door here to

1042
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
we'll probably have another door here to
 

1043
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,350
we'll probably have another door here to
lead to the facility

1044
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
lead to the facility
 

1045
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,110
lead to the facility
now i want to clarify something here

1046
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
now i want to clarify something here
 

1047
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,230
now i want to clarify something here
when you guys look at this you're

1048
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
when you guys look at this you're
 

1049
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,590
when you guys look at this you're
probably like etho i thought you were

1050
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600
probably like etho i thought you were
 

1051
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,470
probably like etho i thought you were
building a lab

1052
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
building a lab
 

1053
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,629
building a lab
i was expecting quartz and white

1054
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
i was expecting quartz and white
 

1055
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,470
i was expecting quartz and white
concrete bright colors

1056
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
concrete bright colors
 

1057
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,150
concrete bright colors
clean cuts uh typical lab stuff right

1058
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
clean cuts uh typical lab stuff right
 

1059
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,230
clean cuts uh typical lab stuff right
and i went for more of a grungy dark

1060
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
and i went for more of a grungy dark
 

1061
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,910
and i went for more of a grungy dark
themed thing here

1062
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
themed thing here
 

1063
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,870
themed thing here
so just to sort of explain that we're

1064
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:02,880
so just to sort of explain that we're
 

1065
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,710
so just to sort of explain that we're
splitting the project into two main

1066
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
splitting the project into two main
 

1067
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,549
splitting the project into two main
areas we have the wiki entries that's

1068
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
areas we have the wiki entries that's
 

1069
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,510
areas we have the wiki entries that's
what this is

1070
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
what this is
 

1071
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,990
what this is
these are going to be in general darker

1072
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
these are going to be in general darker
 

1073
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,990
these are going to be in general darker
themed more grungy looking

1074
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
themed more grungy looking
 

1075
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,470
themed more grungy looking
um but it'll depend on what we're

1076
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
um but it'll depend on what we're
 

1077
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,750
um but it'll depend on what we're
putting in the room like if we have

1078
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760
putting in the room like if we have
 

1079
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,710
putting in the room like if we have
something involving

1080
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
something involving
 

1081
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,270
something involving
water it'll probably be aqua themed or

1082
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
water it'll probably be aqua themed or
 

1083
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,630
water it'll probably be aqua themed or
if we're doing something with plants

1084
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
if we're doing something with plants
 

1085
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,150
if we're doing something with plants
it'll probably be plants

1086
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
it'll probably be plants
 

1087
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,870
it'll probably be plants
nature themed you know but the other

1088
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:24,880
nature themed you know but the other
 

1089
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,829
nature themed you know but the other
part of the project

1090
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
part of the project
 

1091
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,549
part of the project
is going to be the facility the support

1092
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
is going to be the facility the support
 

1093
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,070
is going to be the facility the support
thing that connects all our rooms

1094
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
thing that connects all our rooms
 

1095
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,630
thing that connects all our rooms
together

1096
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
together
 

1097
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,909
together
and provides transportation and anything

1098
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
and provides transportation and anything
 

1099
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,590
and provides transportation and anything
else we might need right

1100
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,600
else we might need right
 

1101
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,070
else we might need right
that will be the typical lab super clean

1102
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
that will be the typical lab super clean
 

1103
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,630
that will be the typical lab super clean
bright white colors and stuff and we'll

1104
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
bright white colors and stuff and we'll
 

1105
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,950
bright white colors and stuff and we'll
have a clear distinction between the two

1106
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:44,960
have a clear distinction between the two
 

1107
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,950
have a clear distinction between the two
yeah so the reason we did this room

1108
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
yeah so the reason we did this room
 

1109
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,470
yeah so the reason we did this room
first the block breaking room

1110
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
first the block breaking room
 

1111
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,310
first the block breaking room
was because i figured it'd be one of the

1112
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
was because i figured it'd be one of the
 

1113
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,070
was because i figured it'd be one of the
most complicated ones to do

1114
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
most complicated ones to do
 

1115
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,990
most complicated ones to do
and if we could get through it we could

1116
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
and if we could get through it we could
 

1117
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,150
and if we could get through it we could
probably do any of them

1118
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
probably do any of them
 

1119
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,830
probably do any of them
because uh the challenging part about

1120
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
because uh the challenging part about
 

1121
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,590
because uh the challenging part about
this one is we have to combine

1122
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
this one is we have to combine
 

1123
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,350
this one is we have to combine
so many different factors together

1124
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
so many different factors together
 

1125
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,789
so many different factors together
because many different things affect

1126
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
because many different things affect
 

1127
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,310
because many different things affect
your mining speed

1128
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
your mining speed
 

1129
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,110
your mining speed
and be able to test them in different

1130
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
and be able to test them in different
 

1131
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,350
and be able to test them in different
combinations and see the result

1132
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
combinations and see the result
 

1133
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,830
combinations and see the result
so yeah we got our mining thing here we

1134
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
so yeah we got our mining thing here we
 

1135
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,990
so yeah we got our mining thing here we
can see what happens when we mine things

1136
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
can see what happens when we mine things
 

1137
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,070
can see what happens when we mine things
in water how it slows us down also

1138
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
in water how it slows us down also
 

1139
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,750
in water how it slows us down also
mining stuff floating in the air slows

1140
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:19,760
mining stuff floating in the air slows
 

1141
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,430
mining stuff floating in the air slows
us down so we got the ladder to keep us

1142
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
us down so we got the ladder to keep us
 

1143
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,390
us down so we got the ladder to keep us
suspended

1144
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
suspended
 

1145
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,270
suspended
we can test that out and when we break

1146
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
we can test that out and when we break
 

1147
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,029
we can test that out and when we break
the first block here

1148
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:27,039
the first block here
 

1149
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,150
the first block here
it starts the timer which i still need

1150
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160
it starts the timer which i still need
 

1151
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,549
it starts the timer which i still need
to finish because it's not working

1152
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559
to finish because it's not working
 

1153
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,990
to finish because it's not working
the seconds aren't doing anything at the

1154
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
the seconds aren't doing anything at the
 

1155
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,430
the seconds aren't doing anything at the
moment uh also i don't have the stop

1156
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
moment uh also i don't have the stop
 

1157
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,870
moment uh also i don't have the stop
working at the moment so it just keeps

1158
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
working at the moment so it just keeps
 

1159
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,310
working at the moment so it just keeps
going when we get to the last one but

1160
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
going when we get to the last one but
 

1161
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,549
going when we get to the last one but
it's supposed to stop when we mine

1162
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
it's supposed to stop when we mine
 

1163
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,470
it's supposed to stop when we mine
uh the five blocks here and then you can

1164
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
uh the five blocks here and then you can
 

1165
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,070
uh the five blocks here and then you can
see the total time

1166
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
see the total time
 

1167
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,669
see the total time
based on all the different factors

1168
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
based on all the different factors
 

1169
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,590
based on all the different factors
combined together so another one of the

1170
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
combined together so another one of the
 

1171
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,150
combined together so another one of the
factors

1172
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
factors
 

1173
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,750
factors
is what block you're breaking so we're

1174
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
is what block you're breaking so we're
 

1175
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,310
is what block you're breaking so we're
gonna have all the different blocks here

1176
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,320
gonna have all the different blocks here
 

1177
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,830
gonna have all the different blocks here
ideally in a perfect world um also what

1178
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:57,840
ideally in a perfect world um also what
 

1179
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,789
ideally in a perfect world um also what
tool we're using

1180
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
tool we're using
 

1181
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,950
tool we're using
really affects our mining speed so we'll

1182
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
really affects our mining speed so we'll
 

1183
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,950
really affects our mining speed so we'll
have a stash of all the different tools

1184
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
have a stash of all the different tools
 

1185
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,750
have a stash of all the different tools
here

1186
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
here
 

1187
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,549
here
from wood stone iron diamond netherright

1188
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
from wood stone iron diamond netherright
 

1189
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,350
from wood stone iron diamond netherright
to gold

1190
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360
to gold
 

1191
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,390
to gold
slowest the fastest and we want

1192
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
slowest the fastest and we want
 

1193
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,150
slowest the fastest and we want
the unenchanted version but also

1194
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,160
the unenchanted version but also
 

1195
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,430
the unenchanted version but also
efficiency one

1196
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440
efficiency one
 

1197
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,990
efficiency one
through five um so that'll take a little

1198
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
through five um so that'll take a little
 

1199
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,510
through five um so that'll take a little
bit to get together

1200
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
bit to get together
 

1201
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,029
bit to get together
we've got a few of them here um and then

1202
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
we've got a few of them here um and then
 

1203
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,669
we've got a few of them here um and then
there's axes swords will want to get

1204
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
there's axes swords will want to get
 

1205
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,549
there's axes swords will want to get
shears

1206
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
shears
 

1207
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,510
shears
you can put efficiency on shears and

1208
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
you can put efficiency on shears and
 

1209
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,190
you can put efficiency on shears and
also

1210
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:29,200
also
 

1211
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,909
also
we need hose in here too and i think

1212
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
we need hose in here too and i think
 

1213
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,270
we need hose in here too and i think
that'll cover all the tools if i'm

1214
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280
that'll cover all the tools if i'm
 

1215
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,029
that'll cover all the tools if i'm
forgetting something let me know because

1216
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
forgetting something let me know because
 

1217
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,830
forgetting something let me know because
it's hard to keep track of all this

1218
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
it's hard to keep track of all this
 

1219
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,230
it's hard to keep track of all this
stuff

1220
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,240
stuff
 

1221
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,310
stuff
the other thing that affects our mining

1222
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
the other thing that affects our mining
 

1223
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,350
the other thing that affects our mining
speed though is

1224
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
speed though is
 

1225
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,029
speed though is
haste beacons right so we'll have some

1226
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
haste beacons right so we'll have some
 

1227
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,870
haste beacons right so we'll have some
controls over here

1228
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:44,880
controls over here
 

1229
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,669
controls over here
we can turn our beacons on and off we

1230
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
we can turn our beacons on and off we
 

1231
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,669
we can turn our beacons on and off we
got the numbers there to represent

1232
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
got the numbers there to represent
 

1233
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,909
got the numbers there to represent
if it's haste one or haste two so now if

1234
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:51,919
if it's haste one or haste two so now if
 

1235
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,510
if it's haste one or haste two so now if
we flick this one

1236
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
we flick this one
 

1237
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,710
we flick this one
we'll get haste one that's back on and

1238
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:56,720
we'll get haste one that's back on and
 

1239
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,630
we'll get haste one that's back on and
we also had to put it close enough to

1240
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
we also had to put it close enough to
 

1241
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,830
we also had to put it close enough to
this room

1242
00:19:59,830 --> 00:19:59,840
this room
 

1243
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,909
this room
so that we actually get the effect like

1244
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
so that we actually get the effect like
 

1245
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,029
so that we actually get the effect like
if it was

1246
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039
if it was
 

1247
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,630
if it was
i think if we stand over here we're too

1248
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
i think if we stand over here we're too
 

1249
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,270
i think if we stand over here we're too
far away so that was another challenging

1250
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280
far away so that was another challenging
 

1251
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,710
far away so that was another challenging
thing to consider

1252
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
thing to consider
 

1253
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,029
thing to consider
and we can mix and match them and see

1254
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:11,039
and we can mix and match them and see
 

1255
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,870
and we can mix and match them and see
the effect but also conduit power

1256
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
the effect but also conduit power
 

1257
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,470
the effect but also conduit power
affects mining speed so we need to be

1258
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:14,480
affects mining speed so we need to be
 

1259
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,510
affects mining speed so we need to be
able to turn

1260
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:15,520
able to turn
 

1261
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,549
able to turn
that on and off so if we have the water

1262
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:18,559
that on and off so if we have the water
 

1263
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,270
that on and off so if we have the water
out here

1264
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
out here
 

1265
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,350
out here
get the water we sit in the water you

1266
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,360
get the water we sit in the water you
 

1267
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,110
get the water we sit in the water you
can see i think i got it off at the

1268
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,120
can see i think i got it off at the
 

1269
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,990
can see i think i got it off at the
moment

1270
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000
moment
 

1271
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,310
moment
so we're not getting the conduit power

1272
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
so we're not getting the conduit power
 

1273
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,350
so we're not getting the conduit power
up here

1274
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,360
up here
 

1275
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,390
up here
but if we flick this on we just push a

1276
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400
but if we flick this on we just push a
 

1277
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,390
but if we flick this on we just push a
block into the three by three by three

1278
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
block into the three by three by three
 

1279
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,190
block into the three by three by three
water there and that shuts it off

1280
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
water there and that shuts it off
 

1281
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,310
water there and that shuts it off
but if we retract it lights uh turn on

1282
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
but if we retract it lights uh turn on
 

1283
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,310
but if we retract it lights uh turn on
when the conduit power is active

1284
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,320
when the conduit power is active
 

1285
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,190
when the conduit power is active
and now when we go in the water here we

1286
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,200
and now when we go in the water here we
 

1287
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,470
and now when we go in the water here we
have conduit power

1288
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
have conduit power
 

1289
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,390
have conduit power
and the final thing we have in this room

1290
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
and the final thing we have in this room
 

1291
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,990
and the final thing we have in this room
is the cage in the middle

1292
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,000
is the cage in the middle
 

1293
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,710
is the cage in the middle
for the elder guardian so we can get his

1294
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
for the elder guardian so we can get his
 

1295
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,470
for the elder guardian so we can get his
mining fatigue effect we'll have a

1296
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
mining fatigue effect we'll have a
 

1297
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,430
mining fatigue effect we'll have a
switch to

1298
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
switch to
 

1299
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,190
switch to
drop him down we'll probably put a slime

1300
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
drop him down we'll probably put a slime
 

1301
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,870
drop him down we'll probably put a slime
block there so he'll

1302
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:58,880
block there so he'll
 

1303
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,870
block there so he'll
fall down and bounce around for a bit

1304
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:00,880
fall down and bounce around for a bit
 

1305
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,390
fall down and bounce around for a bit
and then give it to us

1306
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
and then give it to us
 

1307
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,470
and then give it to us
and then when we shut off the switch we

1308
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:04,480
and then when we shut off the switch we
 

1309
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,750
and then when we shut off the switch we
need to somehow

1310
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:05,760
need to somehow
 

1311
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,549
need to somehow
get him out of there and go up a bubble

1312
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
get him out of there and go up a bubble
 

1313
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,149
get him out of there and go up a bubble
elevator to the top of the mountain if

1314
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159
elevator to the top of the mountain if
 

1315
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,710
elevator to the top of the mountain if
you're over 50 blocks away from him

1316
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
you're over 50 blocks away from him
 

1317
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,710
you're over 50 blocks away from him
you don't get the effect and that's why

1318
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
you don't get the effect and that's why
 

1319
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,789
you don't get the effect and that's why
i built this around y

1320
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
i built this around y
 

1321
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,430
i built this around y
180 or so so we have a bit of leeway

1322
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440
180 or so so we have a bit of leeway
 

1323
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,950
180 or so so we have a bit of leeway
where we can store them up there and we

1324
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
where we can store them up there and we
 

1325
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,350
where we can store them up there and we
won't get the effect

1326
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
won't get the effect
 

1327
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,630
won't get the effect
but i'm not sure how we're doing all

1328
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
but i'm not sure how we're doing all
 

1329
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,950
but i'm not sure how we're doing all
that just yet and when we drop them down

1330
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:26,960
that just yet and when we drop them down
 

1331
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,190
that just yet and when we drop them down
the lights there will turn on as well

1332
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,200
the lights there will turn on as well
 

1333
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,350
the lights there will turn on as well
and that's the kind of plan with that

1334
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
and that's the kind of plan with that
 

1335
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,350
and that's the kind of plan with that
so how did we do here well let's check

1336
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
so how did we do here well let's check
 

1337
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,190
so how did we do here well let's check
out our list we kind of worked on

1338
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,200
out our list we kind of worked on
 

1339
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,470
out our list we kind of worked on
these six things and we're missing

1340
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
these six things and we're missing
 

1341
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,230
these six things and we're missing
just a few of them these are the a lot

1342
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
just a few of them these are the a lot
 

1343
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,549
just a few of them these are the a lot
easier to do than these ones though so

1344
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
easier to do than these ones though so
 

1345
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,310
easier to do than these ones though so
that's why i saved them for last ghost

1346
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
that's why i saved them for last ghost
 

1347
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,669
that's why i saved them for last ghost
blocks i don't know if we need to add

1348
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
blocks i don't know if we need to add
 

1349
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,870
blocks i don't know if we need to add
that into this room

1350
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:46,880
that into this room
 

1351
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,190
that into this room
maybe that would go into the a bug room

1352
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
maybe that would go into the a bug room
 

1353
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,230
maybe that would go into the a bug room
or something

1354
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
or something
 

1355
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,950
or something
but anyways unfortunately i did kind of

1356
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
but anyways unfortunately i did kind of
 

1357
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,630
but anyways unfortunately i did kind of
mismanage my time a little bit today and

1358
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
mismanage my time a little bit today and
 

1359
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,070
mismanage my time a little bit today and
spent too long building there

1360
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
spent too long building there
 

1361
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,070
spent too long building there
but we got a good start on the project

1362
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,080
but we got a good start on the project
 

1363
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,510
but we got a good start on the project
hopefully it gives you a better idea of

1364
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520
hopefully it gives you a better idea of
 

1365
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,710
hopefully it gives you a better idea of
what we're doing

1366
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
what we're doing
 

1367
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,149
what we're doing
and like i said before we're only going

1368
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159
and like i said before we're only going
 

1369
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,830
and like i said before we're only going
to be working on it like 20 to 40

1370
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:03,840
to be working on it like 20 to 40
 

1371
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,950
to be working on it like 20 to 40
percent of our time

1372
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
percent of our time
 

1373
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,950
percent of our time
i just spent a full episode on it today

1374
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
i just spent a full episode on it today
 

1375
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,470
i just spent a full episode on it today
because it's a new thing

1376
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
because it's a new thing
 

1377
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,149
because it's a new thing
uh but next episode we're probably gonna

1378
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
uh but next episode we're probably gonna
 

1379
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,990
uh but next episode we're probably gonna
be working on farms and we'll probably

1380
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
be working on farms and we'll probably
 

1381
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,830
be working on farms and we'll probably
do a little bit on it we'll see how it

1382
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
do a little bit on it we'll see how it
 

1383
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,029
do a little bit on it we'll see how it
goes

1384
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:15,039
goes
 

1385
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,630
goes
here's the comment of the day it says i

1386
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
here's the comment of the day it says i
 

1387
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,789
here's the comment of the day it says i
think this idea is really cool and has a

1388
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799
think this idea is really cool and has a
 

1389
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,230
think this idea is really cool and has a
lot of potential

1390
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
lot of potential
 

1391
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,390
lot of potential
the only thing i'm a little worried

1392
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,400
the only thing i'm a little worried
 

1393
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,470
the only thing i'm a little worried
about is the scope

1394
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
about is the scope
 

1395
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,470
about is the scope
this project is just so huge

1396
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,480
this project is just so huge
 

1397
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,990
this project is just so huge
that being said this is not the first

1398
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,000
that being said this is not the first
 

1399
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,149
that being said this is not the first
time i've been skeptical of

1400
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
time i've been skeptical of
 

1401
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,390
time i've been skeptical of
a project idea when you propose the

1402
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
a project idea when you propose the
 

1403
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,230
a project idea when you propose the
nexus so many years ago it sounded

1404
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,240
nexus so many years ago it sounded
 

1405
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,230
nexus so many years ago it sounded
insane to me but you finished it and

1406
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
insane to me but you finished it and
 

1407
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,870
insane to me but you finished it and
it's so

1408
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:38,880
it's so
 

1409
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,029
it's so
impressive i think it will be fun

1410
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
impressive i think it will be fun
 

1411
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,789
impressive i think it will be fun
discovering and recording all the game

1412
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:42,799
discovering and recording all the game
 

1413

building techniques etc and i know that

1416
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
building techniques etc and i know that
 

1417
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,830
building techniques etc and i know that
if anyone could do it

1418
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:49,840
if anyone could do it
 

1419
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,310
if anyone could do it
it's you yeah so last episode i

1420
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
it's you yeah so last episode i
 

1421
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,630
it's you yeah so last episode i
laid out the ultimate goal of uh storing

1422
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,640
laid out the ultimate goal of uh storing
 

1423
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,470
laid out the ultimate goal of uh storing
all the information in this game

1424
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:58,480
all the information in this game
 

1425
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,909
all the information in this game
in that lab i want to

1426
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
in that lab i want to
 

1427
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,110
in that lab i want to
just clarify that's the

1428
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
just clarify that's the
 

1429
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,909
just clarify that's the
ultimate goal it's actually probably

1430
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:07,919
ultimate goal it's actually probably
 

1431
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,750
ultimate goal it's actually probably
impossible to do that

1432
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
impossible to do that
 

1433
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,510
impossible to do that
i'm just saying we're gonna go and work

1434
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
i'm just saying we're gonna go and work
 

1435
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,350
i'm just saying we're gonna go and work
on it as long as it we're having fun

1436
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
on it as long as it we're having fun
 

1437
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,149
on it as long as it we're having fun
with it

1438
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
with it
 

1439
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,510
with it
if i'm enjoying it and you guys are

1440
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,520
if i'm enjoying it and you guys are
 

1441
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,350
if i'm enjoying it and you guys are
enjoying it we'll keep working on it but

1442
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
enjoying it we'll keep working on it but
 

1443
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,990
enjoying it we'll keep working on it but
if it

1444
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
if it
 

1445
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,549
if it
gets boring or whatever that's it we're

1446
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
gets boring or whatever that's it we're
 

1447
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,270
gets boring or whatever that's it we're
done

1448
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,280
done
 

1449
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,350
done
sort of thing yeah kind of my idea with

1450
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
sort of thing yeah kind of my idea with
 

1451
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,950
sort of thing yeah kind of my idea with
the project is it's almost like we're

1452
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:24,960
the project is it's almost like we're
 

1453
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,070
the project is it's almost like we're
building a base

1454
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,080
building a base
 

1455
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,909
building a base
right uh except it has a purpose to it

1456
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
right uh except it has a purpose to it
 

1457
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,590
right uh except it has a purpose to it
not just like building stuff for the

1458
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
not just like building stuff for the
 

1459
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,669
not just like building stuff for the
sake of building it um

1460
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
sake of building it um
 

1461
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,590
sake of building it um
the thing about this game is like yeah

1462
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:35,600
the thing about this game is like yeah
 

1463
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,590
the thing about this game is like yeah
you can build make farms and farms serve

1464
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:37,600
you can build make farms and farms serve
 

1465
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,789
you can build make farms and farms serve
a purpose right well

1466
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:38,799
a purpose right well
 

1467
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,470
a purpose right well
technically they don't they just get you

1468
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,480
technically they don't they just get you
 

1469
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,070
technically they don't they just get you
resources if you don't actually use

1470
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
resources if you don't actually use
 

1471
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,510
resources if you don't actually use
those resources

1472
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:43,520
those resources
 

1473
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,789
those resources
farming in this game is kind of

1474
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
farming in this game is kind of
 

1475
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,190
farming in this game is kind of
pointless if you're

1476
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
pointless if you're
 

1477
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,630
pointless if you're
just building this game and the

1478
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:48,640
just building this game and the
 

1479
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,990
just building this game and the
buildings don't do anything they're kind

1480
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,000
buildings don't do anything they're kind
 

1481
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,590
buildings don't do anything they're kind
of pointless so i thought this would be

1482
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,600
of pointless so i thought this would be
 

1483
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,269
of pointless so i thought this would be
a good way of combining

1484
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:53,279
a good way of combining
 

1485
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,549
a good way of combining
like building with a purpose and

1486
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:56,559
like building with a purpose and
 

1487
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,909
like building with a purpose and
also the building is going to be

1488
00:23:57,909 --> 00:23:57,919
also the building is going to be
 

1489
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,830
also the building is going to be
extremely expensive so it's going to

1490
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
extremely expensive so it's going to
 

1491
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,950
extremely expensive so it's going to
encourage us to build

1492
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
encourage us to build
 

1493
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,390
encourage us to build
more farms in our world and

1494
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
more farms in our world and
 

1495
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,070
more farms in our world and
do things that we don't normally do in

1496
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,080
do things that we don't normally do in
 

1497
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,669
do things that we don't normally do in
our world because the scope of the

1498
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:07,679
our world because the scope of the
 

1499
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,470
our world because the scope of the
project is

1500
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
project is
 

1501
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,190
project is
the whole game so that's kind of the

1502
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
the whole game so that's kind of the
 

1503
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,830
the whole game so that's kind of the
whole idea

1504
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
whole idea
 

1505
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,510
whole idea
behind the project and yeah we need to

1506
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:15,520
behind the project and yeah we need to
 

1507
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,710
behind the project and yeah we need to
get stuff i used our last beacons today
