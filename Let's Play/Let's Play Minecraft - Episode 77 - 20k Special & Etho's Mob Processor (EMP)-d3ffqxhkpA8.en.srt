this base here I will still use it the

60
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:58,920
this base here I will still use it the
 

61
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,399
this base here I will still use it the
new ones a little bit a little ways away

62
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:01,409
new ones a little bit a little ways away
 

63
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,020
new ones a little bit a little ways away
but it's not too far it's about a

00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,270
processor or EMP for short this thing
this is what I plan on using in my new

86
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
this is what I plan on using in my new
 

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,460
this is what I plan on using in my new
base basically when mobs enter here

88
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:58,470
base basically when mobs enter here
 

89
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,270
base basically when mobs enter here
they'll be separated like I might just

90
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,280
they'll be separated like I might just
 

91
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,600
they'll be separated like I might just
have pigs in here I'll have a big row of

92
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:05,610
have pigs in here I'll have a big row of
 

93
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,300
have pigs in here I'll have a big row of
these things and one will have chickens

94
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:08,310
these things and one will have chickens
 

95
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,759
these things and one will have chickens
one lot of pigs when you'll have squids

96
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:10,769
one lot of pigs when you'll have squids
 

97
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:13,160
one lot of pigs when you'll have squids
when will have creepers you know

98
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,170
when will have creepers you know
 

99
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,640
when will have creepers you know
something like that and what this thing

100
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:16,650
something like that and what this thing
 

101
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,660
something like that and what this thing
does is first of all it's a holding area

102
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:22,670
does is first of all it's a holding area
 

103
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,240
does is first of all it's a holding area
so the mobs will fall from above into

104
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,250
so the mobs will fall from above into
 

105
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,430
so the mobs will fall from above into
this thing here and they will keep

106
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:28,440
this thing here and they will keep
 

107
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,560
this thing here and they will keep
collecting again since they fall down

108
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:32,570
collecting again since they fall down
 

109
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,449
collecting again since they fall down
hundreds and fit in that to block space

110
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:35,459
hundreds and fit in that to block space
 

111
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,670
hundreds and fit in that to block space
no problem and if I wanted to say

was sheep in there again I could hit
 

127
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,530
was sheep in there again I could hit
them but they wouldn't be able to walk

128

block is in their face that's cool I got
these last blocks here just so that you

140
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:26,360
these last blocks here just so that you
 

141
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,250
these last blocks here just so that you
can see what's in the chamber from an

142
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:29,260
can see what's in the chamber from an
 

143
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,580
can see what's in the chamber from an
angle like this from a distance and

144
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:33,590
angle like this from a distance and
 

145
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,430
angle like this from a distance and
these two are glass blocks as well so

146
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,440
these two are glass blocks as well so
 

147
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,219
these two are glass blocks as well so
you can see what's inside

148
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:41,229

 

149
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:46,000

00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:03,620
box will come in crush them I tried out
 

163
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,080
box will come in crush them I tried out
myself it worked

164
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,090
myself it worked
 

165
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,129
myself it worked
crushed me no problem and then when they

166
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:09,139
crushed me no problem and then when they
 

167
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:14,050
crushed me no problem and then when they
died the items will just be sitting here

168
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,060
died the items will just be sitting here
 

169
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:23,170
died the items will just be sitting here
so how can I demonstrate this let's

170
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,180
so how can I demonstrate this let's
 

171
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,050
so how can I demonstrate this let's
pretend this is closed mobs will die the

172
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:26,060
pretend this is closed mobs will die the
 

173
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,060
pretend this is closed mobs will die the
items will drop kind of like that when

174
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,070
items will drop kind of like that when
 

175
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,150
items will drop kind of like that when
you open this they'll pop out and then

176
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,160
you open this they'll pop out and then
 

177
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,390
you open this they'll pop out and then
you can pick up the items from the

178
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
you can pick up the items from the
 

179
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,310
you can pick up the items from the
individually separated mobs I'll be

180
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:39,320
individually separated mobs I'll be
 

181
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,960
individually separated mobs I'll be
separating them using what I've learned

182
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:40,970
separating them using what I've learned
 

183
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:48,240
separating them using what I've learned
from the space here so this lever here

184
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,250
from the space here so this lever here
 

185
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:54,010
from the space here so this lever here
opens up the floor and below is lava so

186
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,020
opens up the floor and below is lava so
 

187
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,320
opens up the floor and below is lava so
this is useful say I didn't want

188
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,330
this is useful say I didn't want
 

189
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,020
this is useful say I didn't want
chickens in my world if I want to get

190
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,030
chickens in my world if I want to get
 

191
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,260
chickens in my world if I want to get
rid of all the chickens

192
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,270

 

193
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,170

and I had this cloak no if I had this

194
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:05,180
and I had this cloak no if I had this
 

195
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,200
and I had this cloak no if I had this
clothes the chickens would just gently

196
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,210
clothes the chickens would just gently
 

197
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,719
clothes the chickens would just gently
float down fall in lava and die and that

198
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:10,729
float down fall in lava and die and that
 

199
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,879
float down fall in lava and die and that
would allow other mobs to take their

200
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:12,889
would allow other mobs to take their
 

201
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:20,490
would allow other mobs to take their
place so that's cool

202
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:20,500

 

203
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,719

say there's a bunch of items on here

204
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:22,729
say there's a bunch of items on here
 

205
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,070
say there's a bunch of items on here
that I didn't want I could just open

206
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
that I didn't want I could just open
 

207
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,050
that I didn't want I could just open
this up they fall in the lava and that's

208
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:29,060
this up they fall in the lava and that's
 

209
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:38,620
this up they fall in the lava and that's
all good umm yeah that seems this really

210
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:38,630
all good umm yeah that seems this really
 

211
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:46,740
all good umm yeah that seems this really
cool so also say I had chickens in here

212
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:46,750

 

213
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,999

actually let's let's just go look at the

214
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:49,009
actually let's let's just go look at the
 

215
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:54,580
actually let's let's just go look at the
back now maybe I'll skip the day just

216
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:54,590
back now maybe I'll skip the day just
 

217
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,770
back now maybe I'll skip the day just
because it's kind of dark we don't have

218
00:06:59,770 --> 00:06:59,780
because it's kind of dark we don't have
 

219
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,720
because it's kind of dark we don't have
any nasty surprises

220
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:05,730

 

221
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,340

so in my new base I plan on separating

222
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:08,350
so in my new base I plan on separating
 

223
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,290
so in my new base I plan on separating
chickens and flour on separating pigs

224
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:12,300
chickens and flour on separating pigs
 

225
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,790
chickens and flour on separating pigs
sheep and cows will probably be together

226
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
sheep and cows will probably be together
 

227
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,140
sheep and cows will probably be together
because I don't know how to separate

228
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,150
because I don't know how to separate
 

229
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,940
because I don't know how to separate
them wolves will be there in their own

230
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:20,950
them wolves will be there in their own
 

231
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:26,670
them wolves will be there in their own
place and squids will have their own

232
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:26,680
place and squids will have their own
 

233
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,860
place and squids will have their own
place slimes I'll have a separate one

234
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:31,870
place slimes I'll have a separate one
 

235
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,050
place slimes I'll have a separate one
for creepers one for zombies one for

236
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,060
for creepers one for zombies one for
 

237
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,990
for creepers one for zombies one for
skeletons one for spiders and basically

238
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
skeletons one for spiders and basically
 

239
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,380
skeletons one for spiders and basically
every mob ah yeah around the back here

240
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,390
every mob ah yeah around the back here
 

241
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,290
every mob ah yeah around the back here
this is what it looks like I may make a

242
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:49,300
this is what it looks like I may make a
 

243
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,900
this is what it looks like I may make a
tutorial for this later but at the

244
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:51,910
tutorial for this later but at the
 

245
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,850
tutorial for this later but at the
moment it's untested I have no idea if

246
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:53,860
moment it's untested I have no idea if
 

247
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,460
moment it's untested I have no idea if
it even works but I'm pretty sure it

248
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:56,470
it even works but I'm pretty sure it
 

249
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:03,690
it even works but I'm pretty sure it
does in the back you also have master

250
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:03,700
does in the back you also have master
 

251
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:09,270
does in the back you also have master
controls so that activates the pressure

252
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
controls so that activates the pressure
 

253
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,990
controls so that activates the pressure
this lever here this one activates the

254
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
this lever here this one activates the
 

255
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,960
this lever here this one activates the
barrier to hold them in and this one

256
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:21,970
barrier to hold them in and this one
 

257
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:29,420
barrier to hold them in and this one
here is kind of cool it releases water

258
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:29,430
here is kind of cool it releases water
 

259
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,560
here is kind of cool it releases water
why would I want water you asked this

260
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:34,570
why would I want water you asked this
 

261
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:42,810
why would I want water you asked this
will actually do many things so say the

262
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:42,820
will actually do many things so say the
 

263
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,700
will actually do many things so say the
idea behind these master controls is if

264
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:44,710
idea behind these master controls is if
 

265
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,560
idea behind these master controls is if
I wanted to link a bunch of these units

266
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:46,570
I wanted to link a bunch of these units
 

267
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,900
I wanted to link a bunch of these units
together and have like a central

268
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:48,910
together and have like a central
 

269
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,760
together and have like a central
computer type then controlling all of

270
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:50,770
computer type then controlling all of
 

271
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,570
computer type then controlling all of
them I would say hook all the crusher

272
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:54,580
them I would say hook all the crusher
 

273
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,080
them I would say hook all the crusher
wires together all the barrier wires

274
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,090
wires together all the barrier wires
 

275
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,970
wires together all the barrier wires
together and all the water ones together

276
00:08:59,970 --> 00:08:59,980
together and all the water ones together
 

277
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,320
together and all the water ones together
and have three different master wires

278
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,330
and have three different master wires
 

279
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,830
and have three different master wires
and if I was to have it automatically

280
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:07,840
and if I was to have it automatically
 

281
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,970
and if I was to have it automatically
kill all the mobs

282
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:08,980
kill all the mobs
 

283
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,630
kill all the mobs
in all the units i would activate well

284
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
in all the units i would activate well
 

285
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,249
in all the units i would activate well
first the barrier would be activated

286
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:15,259
first the barrier would be activated
 

287
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:18,739
first the barrier would be activated
the crusher will kill them barrier would

288
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:18,749
the crusher will kill them barrier would
 

289
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:20,809
the crusher will kill them barrier would
be deactivated and then the pressure

290
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:20,819
be deactivated and then the pressure
 

291
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:25,309
be deactivated and then the pressure
would be deactivated and then there'll

292
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:25,319
would be deactivated and then there'll
 

293
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:28,100
would be deactivated and then there'll
be a bunch of items here and then the

294
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,110
be a bunch of items here and then the
 

295
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,350
be a bunch of items here and then the
central computer or processor or

296
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,360
central computer or processor or
 

297
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,929
central computer or processor or
whatever will activate the water if I

298
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:32,939
whatever will activate the water if I
 

299
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:38,809
whatever will activate the water if I
want and that will cause items to flow

300
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:38,819
want and that will cause items to flow
 

301
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:43,369
want and that will cause items to flow
out through a main stream that all these

302
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:43,379
out through a main stream that all these
 

303
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,269
out through a main stream that all these
units are connected to and by doing this

304
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
units are connected to and by doing this
 

305
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,939
units are connected to and by doing this
I will be able to have a central

306
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:49,949
I will be able to have a central
 

307
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:51,980
I will be able to have a central
collection area which is kind of what I

308
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:51,990
collection area which is kind of what I
 

309
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,210
collection area which is kind of what I
which is what I have with my original

310
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:55,220
which is what I have with my original
 

311
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,660
which is what I have with my original
storage room so this is kind of the best

312
00:09:59,660 --> 00:09:59,670
storage room so this is kind of the best
 

313
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:05,600
storage room so this is kind of the best
of all worlds because I will have the

314
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:05,610
of all worlds because I will have the
 

315
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,639
of all worlds because I will have the
mobs individually separated into all

316
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:07,649
mobs individually separated into all
 

317
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,230
mobs individually separated into all
these units so if I only want string

318
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,240
these units so if I only want string
 

319
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,340
these units so if I only want string
whatever I would just walk up to the

320
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:13,350
whatever I would just walk up to the
 

321
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,730
whatever I would just walk up to the
unit collect string and I can ignore all

322
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:15,740
unit collect string and I can ignore all
 

323
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,530
unit collect string and I can ignore all
the other drops and walk away but from a

324
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:21,540
the other drops and walk away but from a
 

325
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,179
the other drops and walk away but from a
distance I'll have a central computer or

326
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:26,189
distance I'll have a central computer or
 

327
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:28,639
distance I'll have a central computer or
whatever to activate it all the items

328
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:28,649
whatever to activate it all the items
 

329
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:30,679
whatever to activate it all the items
will merge together flow down a stream

330
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:30,689
will merge together flow down a stream
 

331
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:33,230
will merge together flow down a stream
towards me and I'll be able to collect

332
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,240
towards me and I'll be able to collect
 

333
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,780
towards me and I'll be able to collect
all the passive mob drops all the

334
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:35,790
all the passive mob drops all the
 

335
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:43,280
all the passive mob drops all the
hostile mobs and stuff like that what

336
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,290
hostile mobs and stuff like that what
 

337
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,629
hostile mobs and stuff like that what
else does the water do

338
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:48,639

 

339
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,410

I'll say we had the barrier closed water

340
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:53,420
I'll say we had the barrier closed water
 

341
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:01,049
I'll say we had the barrier closed water
was on mobs fall in from here and right

342
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:01,059
was on mobs fall in from here and right
 

343
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:10,479
was on mobs fall in from here and right
now we're stuck within the barrier so if

344
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:10,489
now we're stuck within the barrier so if
 

345
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:12,789
now we're stuck within the barrier so if
it was like this since the water is

346
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:12,799
it was like this since the water is
 

347
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,739
it was like this since the water is
flowing down the mobs wouldn't be able

348
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:14,749
flowing down the mobs wouldn't be able
 

349
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:19,059
flowing down the mobs wouldn't be able
to swim up I don't think again untested

350
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:19,069
to swim up I don't think again untested
 

351
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:20,019
to swim up I don't think again untested
I hope I'm right

352
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:20,029
I hope I'm right
 

353
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:23,259
I hope I'm right
and that will mean they will drown as

354
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:23,269
and that will mean they will drown as
 

355
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:25,449
and that will mean they will drown as
they fall in so I can automatically kill

356
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:25,459
they fall in so I can automatically kill
 

357
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:28,530
they fall in so I can automatically kill
them with this as well by drowning them

358
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:28,540
them with this as well by drowning them
 

359
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,059
them with this as well by drowning them
which is cool of course that doesn't

360
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:31,069
which is cool of course that doesn't
 

361
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:33,309
which is cool of course that doesn't
work for all them like squids that won't

362
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:33,319
work for all them like squids that won't
 

363
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:37,900
work for all them like squids that won't
work but for most moms it will I will

364
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:37,910
work but for most moms it will I will
 

365
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,660
work but for most moms it will I will
probably have to customize these EMP

366
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:40,670
probably have to customize these EMP
 

367
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,499
probably have to customize these EMP
units for certain moms like spiders for

368
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:44,509
units for certain moms like spiders for
 

369
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:50,889
units for certain moms like spiders for
example another thing if I wanted the

370
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:50,899
example another thing if I wanted the
 

371
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:54,489
example another thing if I wanted the
drops to automatically or the mops be

372
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:54,499
drops to automatically or the mops be
 

373
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:57,879
drops to automatically or the mops be
automatically killed by drowning and all

374
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:57,889
automatically killed by drowning and all
 

375
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,590
automatically killed by drowning and all
their items to automatically go to a

376
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
their items to automatically go to a
 

377
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,189
their items to automatically go to a
collection point I could just have that

378
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:03,199
collection point I could just have that
 

379
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,169
collection point I could just have that
one down so say there's a creeper in

380
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:05,179
one down so say there's a creeper in
 

381
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:08,049
one down so say there's a creeper in
there he won't be able to get out you'll

382
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:08,059
there he won't be able to get out you'll
 

383
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:11,710
there he won't be able to get out you'll
die but his drops will still be able to

384
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:11,720
die but his drops will still be able to
 

385
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,320
die but his drops will still be able to
flow to the mainstream

386
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,330

 

387
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,970

okay I just rewatched the some of the

388
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:19,980
okay I just rewatched the some of the
 

389
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,430
okay I just rewatched the some of the
video I've got record so far I realize I

390
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:22,440
video I've got record so far I realize I
 

391
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,550
video I've got record so far I realize I
said punch the sheep to get their wool

392
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
said punch the sheep to get their wool
 

393
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,310
said punch the sheep to get their wool
of course I'm thinking the past terms I

394
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
of course I'm thinking the past terms I
 

395
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,690
of course I'm thinking the past terms I
would use shears to get their wool now

396
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:31,700
would use shears to get their wool now
 

397
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:37,270
would use shears to get their wool now
also since I have a holding area I could

398
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:37,280
also since I have a holding area I could
 

399
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,370
also since I have a holding area I could
it was like this I could die the sheep

400
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:40,380
it was like this I could die the sheep
 

401
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,760
it was like this I could die the sheep
I could also milk cows in this holding

402
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:43,770
I could also milk cows in this holding
 

403
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:47,420
I could also milk cows in this holding
area wolves I could hold and then tame

404
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:47,430
area wolves I could hold and then tame
 

405
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:53,120
area wolves I could hold and then tame
if I want so yeah so many options with

406
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,130
if I want so yeah so many options with
 

407
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,380
if I want so yeah so many options with
this EMP unit and I'm really happy with

408
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:57,390
this EMP unit and I'm really happy with
 

409
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,570
this EMP unit and I'm really happy with
it I got chests here for storage so I

410
00:12:59,570 --> 00:12:59,580
it I got chests here for storage so I
 

411
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,620
it I got chests here for storage so I
would just go pick up the items whether

412
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:03,630
would just go pick up the items whether
 

413
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,900
would just go pick up the items whether
I manually kill the mobs or if it's

414
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:05,910
I manually kill the mobs or if it's
 

415
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,810
I manually kill the mobs or if it's
automatically done using my master

416
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:08,820
automatically done using my master
 

417
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,530
automatically done using my master
controls it's up to me and then I can

418
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:12,540
controls it's up to me and then I can
 

419
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,300
controls it's up to me and then I can
pick them up quickly storm here that's

420
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,310
pick them up quickly storm here that's
 

421
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,540
pick them up quickly storm here that's
good

422
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:19,550
good
 

423
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:25,850
good
with my lava killing thing I have a sign

424
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:25,860
with my lava killing thing I have a sign
 

425
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,650
with my lava killing thing I have a sign
above so even if I have to beat the

426
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:27,660
above so even if I have to beat the
 

427
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,120
above so even if I have to beat the
water I don't have to worry about it

428
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,130
water I don't have to worry about it
 

429
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,790
water I don't have to worry about it
wrecking the lava it'll just flow on top

430
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
wrecking the lava it'll just flow on top
 

431
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,590
wrecking the lava it'll just flow on top
of the sign on there also looks kind of

432
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
of the sign on there also looks kind of
 

433
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,010
of the sign on there also looks kind of
cool having the water what else what

434
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,020
cool having the water what else what
 

435
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,720
cool having the water what else what
else I better check that I have that

436
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:50,730
else I better check that I have that
 

437
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,990
else I better check that I have that
closed well I had a good night checked

438
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
closed well I had a good night checked
 

439
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,340
closed well I had a good night checked
yeah so the mobs will come in from the

440
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:58,350
yeah so the mobs will come in from the
 

441
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,380
yeah so the mobs will come in from the
top

442
00:13:59,380 --> 00:13:59,390
top
 

443
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:05,480
top
optionally I can have water here this X

444
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:05,490
optionally I can have water here this X
 

445
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,519
optionally I can have water here this X
is a water break if I choose

446
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:08,529
is a water break if I choose
 

447
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:12,389
is a water break if I choose
so if I have water there it's possible

448
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:12,399
so if I have water there it's possible
 

449
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,599
so if I have water there it's possible
to prevent moths from taking damage or

450
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:15,609
to prevent moths from taking damage or
 

451
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:20,069
to prevent moths from taking damage or
at least too much damage if I was if

452
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:20,079
at least too much damage if I was if
 

453
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,049
at least too much damage if I was if
this was for chickens oh I would just

454
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:22,059
this was for chickens oh I would just
 

455
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,699
this was for chickens oh I would just
have air because it'll just float down

456
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:23,709
have air because it'll just float down
 

457
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:27,439
have air because it'll just float down
on their own

458
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:27,449

 

459
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,999

another option is I could put lava here

460
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:30,009
another option is I could put lava here
 

461
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:32,969
another option is I could put lava here
and say a pig fell down he would get

462
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:32,979
and say a pig fell down he would get
 

463
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:34,769
and say a pig fell down he would get
cooked automatically and he would be

464
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:34,779
cooked automatically and he would be
 

465
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:39,119
cooked automatically and he would be
held in place by the barrier and then I

466
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:39,129
held in place by the barrier and then I
 

467
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,709
held in place by the barrier and then I
would have cooked pork chops sitting

468
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:40,719
would have cooked pork chops sitting
 

469
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:49,619
would have cooked pork chops sitting
here same with Bobby mobs say say I

470
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:49,629
here same with Bobby mobs say say I
 

471
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:51,389
here same with Bobby mobs say say I
wanted to automatically kill creepers

472
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:51,399
wanted to automatically kill creepers
 

473
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,929
wanted to automatically kill creepers
and get their gunpowder I could have

474
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:54,939
and get their gunpowder I could have
 

475
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:58,139
and get their gunpowder I could have
that down but what like I said one way I

476
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:58,149
that down but what like I said one way I
 

477
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:02,609
that down but what like I said one way I
can do it is with the downward water

478
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:02,619
can do it is with the downward water
 

479
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:08,009
can do it is with the downward water
stream another option would be to not

480
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:08,019
stream another option would be to not
 

481
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:14,309
stream another option would be to not
use water but instead have lava here the

482
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:14,319
use water but instead have lava here the
 

483
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:16,469
use water but instead have lava here the
mobs would fall through the lava be set

484
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:16,479
mobs would fall through the lava be set
 

485
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:21,629
mobs would fall through the lava be set
on fire the lab is high enough that they

486
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:21,639
on fire the lab is high enough that they
 

487
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,489
on fire the lab is high enough that they
won't be able to jump back into it so

488
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:23,499
won't be able to jump back into it so
 

489
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:28,169
won't be able to jump back into it so
they'll just burn in here and their

490
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:28,179
they'll just burn in here and their
 

491
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:30,569
they'll just burn in here and their
drops will fall here so that's another

492
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:30,579
drops will fall here so that's another
 

493
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:38,819
drops will fall here so that's another
way of automatically okay whole dad

494
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:38,829
way of automatically okay whole dad
 

495
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:52,330
way of automatically okay whole dad
never did that before I'm scared

496
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:52,340

 

497
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,060

we'll be back after these technical

498
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,070
we'll be back after these technical
 

499
00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:00,340
we'll be back after these technical
difficulties whoo that was close don't

500
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:00,350
difficulties whoo that was close don't
 

501
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,940
difficulties whoo that was close don't
worry guys I'm all right yeah

502
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:03,950

 

503
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:09,700

so back to my rambling ah so I could

504
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:09,710
so back to my rambling ah so I could
 

505
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,310
so back to my rambling ah so I could
have water I could have lava I could use

506
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:12,320
have water I could have lava I could use
 

507
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,500
have water I could have lava I could use
Pistons again to switch between having

508
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:17,510
Pistons again to switch between having
 

509
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:22,180
Pistons again to switch between having
lava or water or air you know there's so

510
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,190
lava or water or air you know there's so
 

511
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,980
lava or water or air you know there's so
many so many different ways of doing

512
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:23,990
many so many different ways of doing
 

513
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,260
many so many different ways of doing
this I could also kill mobs using fall

514
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,270
this I could also kill mobs using fall
 

515
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:35,530
this I could also kill mobs using fall
damage yeah good stuff good stuff

516
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:35,540
damage yeah good stuff good stuff
 

517
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,660
damage yeah good stuff good stuff
one thing I played around when I was

518
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:37,670
one thing I played around when I was
 

519
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,940
one thing I played around when I was
building this one thing I played around

520
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:39,950
building this one thing I played around
 

521
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,840
building this one thing I played around
with it while building this is I also

522
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:43,850
with it while building this is I also
 

523
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,450
with it while building this is I also
had a lever here originally and that

524
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:46,460
had a lever here originally and that
 

525
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,780
had a lever here originally and that
would activate just the bottom one so

526
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:49,790
would activate just the bottom one so
 

527
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,380
would activate just the bottom one so
mat-based

528
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:50,390
mat-based
 

529
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:56,080
mat-based
both of them and this one activates just

530
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,090
both of them and this one activates just
 

531
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,640
both of them and this one activates just
the top one but I don't think I would

532
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:00,650
the top one but I don't think I would
 

533
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,930
the top one but I don't think I would
really need that for anything so I don't

534
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:04,940
really need that for anything so I don't
 

535
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,400
really need that for anything so I don't
really need that option unless you can

536
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,410
really need that option unless you can
 

537
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,390
really need that option unless you can
think of something that would be useful

538
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
think of something that would be useful
 

539
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,710
think of something that would be useful
for other cool things this will fit in

540
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
for other cool things this will fit in
 

541
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,650
for other cool things this will fit in
the wiring is five wide so you could

542
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:23,660
the wiring is five wide so you could
 

543
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,770
the wiring is five wide so you could
repeat these EMP units every six blocks

544
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:26,780
repeat these EMP units every six blocks
 

545
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:33,040
repeat these EMP units every six blocks
basically so one two three four five I

546
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,050
basically so one two three four five I
 

547
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,520
basically so one two three four five I
don't have another soil block here then

548
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:36,530
don't have another soil block here then
 

549
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,190
don't have another soil block here then
it would be glass pressure glass soil

550
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,200
it would be glass pressure glass soil
 

551
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,320
it would be glass pressure glass soil
soil glass pressure glass oil so I'll

552
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,330
soil glass pressure glass oil so I'll
 

553
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,230
soil glass pressure glass oil so I'll
make that six blocks so you can build

554
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,240
make that six blocks so you can build
 

555
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,750
make that six blocks so you can build
them pretty close together and it'll

556
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
them pretty close together and it'll
 

557
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,270
them pretty close together and it'll
kind of look like a wall when it's when

558
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:52,280
kind of look like a wall when it's when
 

559
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,920
kind of look like a wall when it's when
they're all next to each other which is

560
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:53,930
they're all next to each other which is
 

561
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,060
they're all next to each other which is
cool as well

562
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,070
cool as well
 

563
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:02,489
cool as well
I think that's everything I wanted to

564
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:02,499
I think that's everything I wanted to
 

565
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,399
I think that's everything I wanted to
say about this

566
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:04,409
say about this
 

567
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:08,090
say about this
like I said Toro will come later

568
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,100
like I said Toro will come later
 

569
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,960
like I said Toro will come later
once I actually test it unfortunately I

570
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:12,970
once I actually test it unfortunately I
 

571
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,789
once I actually test it unfortunately I
don't use single player commands or

572
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:14,799
don't use single player commands or
 

573
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,799
don't use single player commands or
anything like that so testing stuff like

574
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:16,809
anything like that so testing stuff like
 

575
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:22,409
anything like that so testing stuff like
this can be challenging for me until I

576
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:22,419
this can be challenging for me until I
 

577
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:24,320
this can be challenging for me until I
actually have it built in working

578
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,330
actually have it built in working
 

579
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,580
actually have it built in working
another nice thing these wires are

580
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:26,590
another nice thing these wires are
 

581
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,219
another nice thing these wires are
neatly spaced one block apart so it's

582
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:29,229
neatly spaced one block apart so it's
 

583
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:35,969
neatly spaced one block apart so it's
easy to connect to them and it looks

584
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:35,979
easy to connect to them and it looks
 

585
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:38,669
easy to connect to them and it looks
decent it'll look better if you use

586
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:38,679
decent it'll look better if you use
 

587
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:41,369
decent it'll look better if you use
different blocks and soil I plan on

588
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:41,379
different blocks and soil I plan on
 

589
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:45,210
different blocks and soil I plan on
having glowstone on this one and behind

590
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:45,220
having glowstone on this one and behind
 

591
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,430
having glowstone on this one and behind
these two glass ones I might make the

592
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
these two glass ones I might make the
 

593
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,169
these two glass ones I might make the
pressure out of glowstone and maybe the

594
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:52,179
pressure out of glowstone and maybe the
 

595
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:53,700
pressure out of glowstone and maybe the
rest of it sandstone or wood or

596
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:53,710
rest of it sandstone or wood or
 

597
00:18:53,710 --> 00:19:03,180
rest of it sandstone or wood or
something but yeah let's go see my let's

598
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,190
something but yeah let's go see my let's
 

599
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,789
something but yeah let's go see my let's
go see location of where I've decided to

600
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:05,799
go see location of where I've decided to
 

601
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:13,259
go see location of where I've decided to
build my new base here we are guys I'm

602
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:13,269
build my new base here we are guys I'm
 

603
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:17,479
build my new base here we are guys I'm
at the location of my future base I

604
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:17,489
at the location of my future base I
 

605
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,399
at the location of my future base I
think you're going to be quite surprised

606
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:20,409
think you're going to be quite surprised
 

607
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,190
think you're going to be quite surprised
when you see what's around me I don't

608
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
when you see what's around me I don't
 

609
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,129
when you see what's around me I don't
think you would have expected I would

610
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:26,139
think you would have expected I would
 

611
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,159
think you would have expected I would
choose a location like this all right

612
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:29,169
choose a location like this all right
 

613
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:38,690
choose a location like this all right
you ready to see it here we go

614
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:38,700

 

615
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,469

yeah pretty much completely different

616
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:43,479
yeah pretty much completely different
 

617
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:47,849
yeah pretty much completely different
from my old base I'm there's a few

618
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:47,859
from my old base I'm there's a few
 

619
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:51,089
from my old base I'm there's a few
islands around here small islands low

620
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:51,099
islands around here small islands low
 

621
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:56,099
islands around here small islands low
islands and it's a huge frozen over

622
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:56,109
islands and it's a huge frozen over
 

623
00:19:56,109 --> 00:20:04,080
islands and it's a huge frozen over
ocean all around me and I marked the

624
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,090
ocean all around me and I marked the
 

625
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,799
ocean all around me and I marked the
central location of my base this is it

626
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:06,809
central location of my base this is it
 

627
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:09,260
central location of my base this is it
why did I choose this area there's

628
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,270
why did I choose this area there's
 

629
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,960
why did I choose this area there's
actually quite a few reasons so maybe

630
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:11,970
actually quite a few reasons so maybe
 

631
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,840
actually quite a few reasons so maybe
I'll I'll say a few of them

632
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:14,850
I'll I'll say a few of them
 

633
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,120
I'll I'll say a few of them
first of all I've always wanted to make

634
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,130
first of all I've always wanted to make
 

635
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,810
first of all I've always wanted to make
a base or building or something in a

636
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:20,820
a base or building or something in a
 

637
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,830
a base or building or something in a
snowy biome because I've never

638
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
snowy biome because I've never
 

639
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,730
snowy biome because I've never
experienced that in Minecraft before

640
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:25,740
experienced that in Minecraft before
 

641
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,840
experienced that in Minecraft before
when we had snowy worlds before in alpha

642
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:29,850
when we had snowy worlds before in alpha
 

643
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,300
when we had snowy worlds before in alpha
version or whatever whenever I would

644
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,310
version or whatever whenever I would

00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,280
version or whatever whenever I would
generate one I would quickly delete it

646
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,290
generate one I would quickly delete it
 

647
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,730
generate one I would quickly delete it
because I was new to the game and I

648
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:37,740
because I was new to the game and I
 

649
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,500
because I was new to the game and I
didn't really know how to deal with the

650
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:39,510
didn't really know how to deal with the
 

651
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:46,010
didn't really know how to deal with the
snow and I like green grass so this is

652
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,020
snow and I like green grass so this is
 

653
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,450
snow and I like green grass so this is
going to be new for me I'm looking

654
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:47,460
going to be new for me I'm looking
 

655
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,770
going to be new for me I'm looking
forward to it since this is a snowy

656
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:50,780
forward to it since this is a snowy
 

657
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:55,190
forward to it since this is a snowy
biome I have new block types that I've

658
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
biome I have new block types that I've
 

659
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,660

always wanted to I can make ice anytime

660
00:20:59,660 --> 00:20:59,670
always wanted to I can make ice anytime
 

661
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,730
always wanted to I can make ice anytime
I want by placing still water and having

662
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:01,740
I want by placing still water and having
 

663
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:07,430
I want by placing still water and having
it freeze so that's awesome that will be

664
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
it freeze so that's awesome that will be
 

665
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,390
it freeze so that's awesome that will be
very useful for making my item streams

666
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:11,400
very useful for making my item streams
 

667
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,710
very useful for making my item streams
because items flow very quickly on ice

668
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:15,720
because items flow very quickly on ice
 

669
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,570
because items flow very quickly on ice
and there's actually a few other tricks

670
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:17,580
and there's actually a few other tricks
 

671
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:23,150
and there's actually a few other tricks
you can do with ice another reason I

672
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,160
you can do with ice another reason I
 

673
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,770
you can do with ice another reason I
chose this location not a lot of people

674
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:24,780
chose this location not a lot of people
 

675
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,880
chose this location not a lot of people
build in snowy biomes so it'd be a

676
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:28,890
build in snowy biomes so it'd be a
 

677
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,690
build in snowy biomes so it'd be a
little bit different be bit unique I

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:32,700
little bit different be bit unique I
 

679
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,420

actually plan on building using ice

680
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:35,430
actually plan on building using ice
 

681
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,820
actually plan on building using ice
blocks a little bit so be kind of like

682
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:37,830
blocks a little bit so be kind of like
 

683
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,680
blocks a little bit so be kind of like
an ice fortress but not entirely out ice

684
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:41,690
an ice fortress but not entirely out ice
 

685
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,960
an ice fortress but not entirely out ice
just because I don't think I could do

686
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:44,970
just because I don't think I could do
 

687
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,040
just because I don't think I could do
that

688
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,050

 

689
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,280

sensors islands around there's out also

690
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,290
sensors islands around there's out also
 

691
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:56,380

00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:56,390
grass nearby so I can get grass to my
 

693
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,940

passive mob spawning pads pretty quickly

694
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:00,950
passive mob spawning pads pretty quickly
 

695
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:08,840
passive mob spawning pads pretty quickly
and there's not much land around hostile

696
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:08,850
and there's not much land around hostile
 

697
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,970
and there's not much land around hostile
mobs don't spawn on ice neither do

698
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:10,980
mobs don't spawn on ice neither do

passive ones so I don't have to place

700
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,390
passive ones so I don't have to place
 

701
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:20,190
passive ones so I don't have to place
many torches there's an ocean here so

702
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,200
many torches there's an ocean here so
 

703
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,599
many torches there's an ocean here so
I like having oceans around even though

704
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:24,609
I like having oceans around even though
 

705
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:28,739
I like having oceans around even though
it's covered by ice having the ocean

706
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:28,749
it's covered by ice having the ocean
 

707
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:32,940
it's covered by ice having the ocean
makes it so there's slightly less cave

708
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:32,950
makes it so there's slightly less cave
 

709
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,570
makes it so there's slightly less cave
systems I believe because the top you

710
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:36,580
systems I believe because the top you

ocean so there won't be any caves in

714
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:42,759
ocean so there won't be any caves in
 

715
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:48,539
ocean so there won't be any caves in
that area hmm what else what else

I might harvest it though I don't know

720
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:56,609
I might harvest it though I don't know

I might harvest it though I don't know
one thing I'm going to have to do is

00:22:58,619 --> 00:22:58,629
one thing I'm going to have to do is
 

723
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,989
one thing I'm going to have to do is
level these islands probably or at least

724
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:00,999
level these islands probably or at least
 

725
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:03,090
level these islands probably or at least
some of them won't take too long pretty

726
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,100
some of them won't take too long pretty
 

727
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,549
some of them won't take too long pretty
because they're pretty low um oh yeah

728
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
because they're pretty low um oh yeah
 

729
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,320
because they're pretty low um oh yeah
the main reason why I chose this

location if you look at the coordinates

732
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,080
location if you look at the coordinates
 

733
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,729
location if you look at the coordinates
it's kind of around a thousand 24x and

it's kind of around a thousand 24x and
 

735
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:25,769
it's kind of around a thousand 24x and
about 512 Zed so that means this block

736
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:25,779
about 512 Zed so that means this block
 

737
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:29,460
about 512 Zed so that means this block

00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:02,559
blocks each one one problem I had with
 

757
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,220

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,230
my old passive and hostile mob systems
 

759
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,549
my old passive and hostile mob systems
is there's I don't fits a glitch in the

760
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:08,559
is there's I don't fits a glitch in the
 

761
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,340
is there's I don't fits a glitch in the
game or just some built-in code to

762
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:11,350
game or just some built-in code to
 

763
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,399
game or just some built-in code to
prevent mobs from spawning if you kill

764
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:14,409
prevent mobs from spawning if you kill
 

765
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:17,789
prevent mobs from spawning if you kill
too many of them but every now and then

766
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:17,799
too many of them but every now and then
 

767
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:20,609
too many of them but every now and then
my passive mob farm which is shut down

768
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:20,619
my passive mob farm which is shut down
 

769
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:23,759
my passive mob farm which is shut down
completely same with my hostile one but

770
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:23,769
completely same with my hostile one but
 

771
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:28,379
completely same with my hostile one but
having my spawning pads in four

772
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:28,389
having my spawning pads in four
 

773
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:29,879
having my spawning pads in four
different regions will prevent that from

774
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:29,889
different regions will prevent that from
 

775
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:32,960
different regions will prevent that from
happening

776
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:32,970

 

777
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,140

I'm also far enough away from anything

778
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,150
I'm also far enough away from anything
 

779
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,210
I'm also far enough away from anything
I've built that it won't interfere with

780
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:38,220
I've built that it won't interfere with
 

781
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,480
I've built that it won't interfere with
my new base and yet I'm not so far away

782
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:41,490
my new base and yet I'm not so far away
 

783
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,370
my new base and yet I'm not so far away
that I can't return to them so that's

784
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:43,380
that I can't return to them so that's
 

785
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:50,300
that I can't return to them so that's
good and yeah it's going to be fun guys

786
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:50,310
good and yeah it's going to be fun guys
 

787
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,400
good and yeah it's going to be fun guys
the very first thing I plan on building

788
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,410
the very first thing I plan on building
 

789
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:56,390
the very first thing I plan on building
is those EMP units I'll probably I don't

790
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:56,400
is those EMP units I'll probably I don't
 

791
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,680
is those EMP units I'll probably I don't
know how many I'll need they'll probably

792
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:57,690
know how many I'll need they'll probably
 

793
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:01,480
know how many I'll need they'll probably
be at least ten of them arranged somehow

794
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:01,490
be at least ten of them arranged somehow
 

795
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,570
be at least ten of them arranged somehow
I'll build them before my spawning pads

796
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:04,580
I'll build them before my spawning pads
 

797
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,940
I'll build them before my spawning pads
and that's the plan guys

798
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:09,950
and that's the plan guys
 

799
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:18,800
and that's the plan guys
that's the future of ethos lab ah yeah

800
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:18,810
that's the future of ethos lab ah yeah
 

801
