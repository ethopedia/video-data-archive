00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
to do is we're going to work on the
 

175
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:42,869
to do is we're going to work on the
tunnel

176
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
tunnel
 

177
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,470
tunnel
it's going to go that way for ways and

178
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
it's going to go that way for ways and
 

179
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,990
it's going to go that way for ways and
then it will start to go

180
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
then it will start to go
 

181
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,430
then it will start to go
up i will

182
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
up i will
 

183
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:59,110
up i will
possibly make it out of sandstone

184
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120

 

185
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,630

i might change this to sandstone too

186
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
i might change this to sandstone too
 

187
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,429
i might change this to sandstone too
yeah uh people were wondering why i used

188
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
yeah uh people were wondering why i used
 

189
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,470
yeah uh people were wondering why i used
the half slabs

190
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
the half slabs
 

191
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,470
the half slabs
because we're down at lava level and

192
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
because we're down at lava level and
 

193
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,710
because we're down at lava level and
stuff could each easily catch on fire if

194
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
stuff could each easily catch on fire if
 

195
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,990
stuff could each easily catch on fire if
i use something that burns

196
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
i use something that burns
 

197
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,910
i use something that burns
so that that's one reason why i might

198
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
so that that's one reason why i might
 

199
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,830
so that that's one reason why i might
want to use sandstone for this too

200
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
want to use sandstone for this too
 

201
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,550
want to use sandstone for this too
so i'll go get some i might go to the

202
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
so i'll go get some i might go to the
 

203
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,909
so i'll go get some i might go to the
end and enchant a new

204
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
end and enchant a new
 

205
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,790
end and enchant a new
axe as well and i will see you guys back

206
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800

 

207
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,469

yeah i got a bunch of sandstone ready

208
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
yeah i got a bunch of sandstone ready
 

209
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,230
yeah i got a bunch of sandstone ready
for the tunnel and we are going to

210
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
for the tunnel and we are going to
 

211
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,590
for the tunnel and we are going to
enchant the axe now

212
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
enchant the axe now
 

213
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,510
enchant the axe now
43. it will have to do

214
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
43. it will have to do
 

215
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,030
43. it will have to do
not quite like the one we had before um

216
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
not quite like the one we had before um
 

217
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,230
not quite like the one we had before um
a lot of people have been wondering

218
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
a lot of people have been wondering
 

219
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,909
a lot of people have been wondering
what's the deal with this island am i

220
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
what's the deal with this island am i
 

221
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,430
what's the deal with this island am i
going to

222
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
going to
 

223
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,710
going to
finish it am i going to make more when i

224
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
finish it am i going to make more when i
 

225
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,950
finish it am i going to make more when i
built it i didn't realize how enderman

226
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
built it i didn't realize how enderman
 

227
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,870
built it i didn't realize how enderman
teleports

228
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
teleports
 

229
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,070
teleports
and it's

230
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080

 

231
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,749

if i remember yeah i'm pretty sure i'm

232
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
if i remember yeah i'm pretty sure i'm
 

233
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,150
if i remember yeah i'm pretty sure i'm
right about this they can teleport 32

234
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
right about this they can teleport 32
 

235
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,629
right about this they can teleport 32
blocks

236
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
blocks
 

237
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,790
blocks
in any direction and they kind of do it

238
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
in any direction and they kind of do it
 

239
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,270
in any direction and they kind of do it
randomly

240
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
randomly
 

241
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,710
randomly
so this is too close to

242
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
so this is too close to
 

243
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,469
so this is too close to
the farm and there's no way of

244
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
the farm and there's no way of
 

245
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,110
the farm and there's no way of
preventing it really

246
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
preventing it really
 

247
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,950
preventing it really
they like you can't just like put

248
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
they like you can't just like put
 

249
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,790
they like you can't just like put
torches and they won't teleport there or

250
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
torches and they won't teleport there or
 

251
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,390
torches and they won't teleport there or
put half slabs and they won't teleport

252
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
put half slabs and they won't teleport
 

253
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,110
put half slabs and they won't teleport
there

254
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
there
 

255
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,550
there
even if you have water down they'll

256
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
even if you have water down they'll
 

257
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,430
even if you have water down they'll
teleport to it but

258
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
teleport to it but
 

259
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,670
teleport to it but
at least they'll try to teleport again

260
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
at least they'll try to teleport again
 

261
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,510
at least they'll try to teleport again
so that's that's really the only way of

262
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
so that's that's really the only way of
 

263
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,629
so that's that's really the only way of
preventing them from

264
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
preventing them from
 

265
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,550
preventing them from
going somewhere is putting down water

266
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
going somewhere is putting down water
 

267
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,310
going somewhere is putting down water
and then they'll they'll still go there

268
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
and then they'll they'll still go there
 

269
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,310
and then they'll they'll still go there
but they'll teleport away

270
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
but they'll teleport away
 

271
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,749
but they'll teleport away
which is not something i want to put on

272
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
which is not something i want to put on
 

273
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,790
which is not something i want to put on
the island anyway so

274
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
the island anyway so
 

275
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,390
the island anyway so
we might still do the the floating

276
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
we might still do the the floating
 

277
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,070
we might still do the the floating
island idea but we'll just have to build

278
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
island idea but we'll just have to build
 

279
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,390
island idea but we'll just have to build
them

280
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
them
 

281
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,270
them
farther away if we do and that one i'll

282
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
farther away if we do and that one i'll
 

283
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,430
farther away if we do and that one i'll
have to tear down

284
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
have to tear down
 

285
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,350
have to tear down
and that's that's the story with that

286
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
and that's that's the story with that
 

287
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,870
and that's that's the story with that
project but we're gonna go back to the

288
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
project but we're gonna go back to the
 

289
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,749
project but we're gonna go back to the
silverfish farm and i will see you there

290
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
silverfish farm and i will see you there
 

291
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,110
silverfish farm and i will see you there
uh we're gonna do a pick too because i

292
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,120
uh we're gonna do a pick too because i
 

293
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,390
uh we're gonna do a pick too because i
gotta do a lot of digging for this

294
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
gotta do a lot of digging for this
 

295
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,749
gotta do a lot of digging for this
project

296
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759

 

297
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,670

yeah that'll do

298
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680

 

299
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,350

and here we are again so i have replaced

300
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
and here we are again so i have replaced
 

301
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,749
and here we are again so i have replaced
the wooden planks with sandstone in this

302
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
the wooden planks with sandstone in this
 

303
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,350
the wooden planks with sandstone in this
peeling chamber

304
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
peeling chamber
 

305
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,790
peeling chamber
and in my opinion it looks a lot better

306
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
and in my opinion it looks a lot better
 

307
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,909
and in my opinion it looks a lot better
but i am known to be partial and biased

308
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
but i am known to be partial and biased
 

309
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,230
but i am known to be partial and biased
when it comes to sandstone but we'll

310
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
when it comes to sandstone but we'll
 

311
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,629
when it comes to sandstone but we'll
we're going to keep it like that and

312
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
we're going to keep it like that and
 

313
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,270
we're going to keep it like that and
with the

314
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
with the
 

315
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,309
with the
the turtle the tunnel we will

316
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
the turtle the tunnel we will
 

317
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,029
the turtle the tunnel we will
probably do sandstone walls at least

318
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
probably do sandstone walls at least
 

319
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,309
probably do sandstone walls at least
maybe the floor too

320
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
maybe the floor too
 

321
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,790
maybe the floor too
we might change the floor here with

322
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
we might change the floor here with
 

323
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,870
we might change the floor here with
sandstone yet

324
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
sandstone yet
 

325
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,029
sandstone yet
i don't know you can't go wrong with

326
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
i don't know you can't go wrong with
 

327
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:37,909
i don't know you can't go wrong with
sandstone

328
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
sandstone
 

329
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,029
sandstone
you really can't uh but we'll do just

330
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
you really can't uh but we'll do just
 

331
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,710
you really can't uh but we'll do just
the walls first

332
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
the walls first
 

333
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,230
the walls first
and maybe figure out afterwards

334
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
and maybe figure out afterwards
 

335
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,870
and maybe figure out afterwards
uh this here is the gate control to let

336
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
uh this here is the gate control to let
 

337
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,670
uh this here is the gate control to let
them out

338
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
them out
 

339
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,070
them out
to let them into the tunnel if we're

340
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
to let them into the tunnel if we're
 

341
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,469
to let them into the tunnel if we're
going to transport them

342
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
going to transport them
 

343
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,909
going to transport them
and what we got to do is we got to build

344
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
and what we got to do is we got to build
 

345
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,150
and what we got to do is we got to build
a horizontal

346
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
a horizontal
 

347
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,430
a horizontal
ish tunnel first just to get it

348
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
ish tunnel first just to get it
 

349
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,909
ish tunnel first just to get it
a little ways away because the storage

350
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
a little ways away because the storage
 

351
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,790
a little ways away because the storage
room is only

352
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
room is only
 

353
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,589
room is only
10 or 15 bucks above and it's going to

354
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
10 or 15 bucks above and it's going to
 

355
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,270
10 or 15 bucks above and it's going to
be fairly big we don't want

356
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
be fairly big we don't want
 

357
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,589
be fairly big we don't want
this to go like straight up to the

358
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
this to go like straight up to the
 

359
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,990
this to go like straight up to the
surface because then the two will

360
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
surface because then the two will
 

361
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,150
surface because then the two will
will get in each other's ways so we want

362
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
will get in each other's ways so we want
 

363
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,309
will get in each other's ways so we want
it to go a little ways out first and

364
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
it to go a little ways out first and
 

365
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,270
it to go a little ways out first and
then go up

366
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
then go up
 

367
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,189
then go up
so that they don't interfere

368
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
so that they don't interfere
 

369
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,309
so that they don't interfere
let us try some sandstone walls and i

370
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
let us try some sandstone walls and i
 

371
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,350
let us try some sandstone walls and i
might

372
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
might
 

373
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,430
might
whip out the new sandstone textures too

374
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
whip out the new sandstone textures too
 

375
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,870
whip out the new sandstone textures too
afterwards and

376
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
afterwards and
 

377
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:39,670
afterwards and
and change it up a bit with that too

378
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680

 

379
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,550

let's see so this tunnel it should be

380
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
let's see so this tunnel it should be
 

381
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,070
let's see so this tunnel it should be
two or three blocks wide at least

382
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
two or three blocks wide at least
 

383
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,510
two or three blocks wide at least
because uh we need to

384
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
because uh we need to
 

385
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,589
because uh we need to
escort the silver fish out of here we

386
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
escort the silver fish out of here we
 

387
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,629
escort the silver fish out of here we
can't have them go on their own because

388
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
can't have them go on their own because
 

389
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,869
can't have them go on their own because
just like the other hostile mobs if they

390
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
just like the other hostile mobs if they
 

391
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,990
just like the other hostile mobs if they
get

392
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
get
 

393
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,390
get
uh more than 32 blocks away from us they

394
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
uh more than 32 blocks away from us they
 

395
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,749
uh more than 32 blocks away from us they
have a chance of despawning over time so

396
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
have a chance of despawning over time so
 

397
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,230
have a chance of despawning over time so
uh we'll have to be right next to them

398
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
uh we'll have to be right next to them
 

399
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,990
uh we'll have to be right next to them
we're gonna have

400
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
we're gonna have
 

401
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,430
we're gonna have
the tunnel for them and then there's

402
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
the tunnel for them and then there's
 

403
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,589
the tunnel for them and then there's
also going to be a small tunnel for me

404
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
also going to be a small tunnel for me
 

405
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,749
also going to be a small tunnel for me
with water streams in that will slowly

406
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
with water streams in that will slowly
 

407
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,749
with water streams in that will slowly
push me to the surface

408
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
push me to the surface
 

409
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,749
push me to the surface
so that they can keep up and i don't

410
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
so that they can keep up and i don't
 

411
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,270
so that they can keep up and i don't
have to

412
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
have to
 

413
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,749
have to
to walk it myself you know that's that's

414
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
to walk it myself you know that's that's
 

415
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,469
to walk it myself you know that's that's
what i'm

416
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
what i'm
 

417
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,469
what i'm
planning with this and to separate

418
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
planning with this and to separate
 

419
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,790
planning with this and to separate
us to we'll either do iron bars or

420
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
us to we'll either do iron bars or
 

421
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,070
us to we'll either do iron bars or
glass panes probably that would make it

422
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
glass panes probably that would make it
 

423
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,630
glass panes probably that would make it
roughly two and a half blocks or so

424
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
roughly two and a half blocks or so
 

425
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,149
roughly two and a half blocks or so
of space for them um

426
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
of space for them um
 

427
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,350
of space for them um
because they're going to be fighting

428
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
because they're going to be fighting
 

429
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,870
because they're going to be fighting
each other for space they'll be in each

430
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
each other for space they'll be in each
 

431
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,710
each other for space they'll be in each
other's way and if we make

432
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
other's way and if we make
 

433
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,670
other's way and if we make
their tunnel too too narrow they'll

434
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
their tunnel too too narrow they'll
 

435
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,710
their tunnel too too narrow they'll
elongate

436
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
elongate
 

437
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,949
elongate
elongate elongate and

438
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959
elongate elongate and
 

439
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,350
elongate elongate and
become too far away from us that they'll

440
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
become too far away from us that they'll
 

441
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,710
become too far away from us that they'll
stop tracking us and

442
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
stop tracking us and
 

443
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,870
stop tracking us and
then they'll just randomly

444
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
then they'll just randomly
 

445
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,670
then they'll just randomly
wander off and despawn

446
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
wander off and despawn
 

447
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,430
wander off and despawn
yeah i'll get i'll get the stuff here

448
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440

 

449
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,350

okay i got some materials together here

450
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
okay i got some materials together here
 

451
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,030
okay i got some materials together here
and we can begin building this

452
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
and we can begin building this
 

453
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,630
and we can begin building this
tunnel let's let's see how this looks

454
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
tunnel let's let's see how this looks
 

455
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,150
tunnel let's let's see how this looks
and again you guys are going to have to

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,230
uh i found a bunch of these iron picks
at the other base there i decide we'll

848
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
at the other base there i decide we'll
 

849
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,750
at the other base there i decide we'll
use them up today instead of going

850
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
use them up today instead of going
 

851
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,710
use them up today instead of going
enchanting again

852
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
enchanting again
 

853
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,669
enchanting again
so we got some i just used an efficiency

854
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:01,679
so we got some i just used an efficiency
 

855
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,630
so we got some i just used an efficiency
three one up

856
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
three one up
 

857
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,590
three one up
we got a bunch of efficiency twos though

858
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
we got a bunch of efficiency twos though
 

859
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,070
we got a bunch of efficiency twos though
so

860
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
so
 

861
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,950
so
just to clean up some of the tool

862
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
just to clean up some of the tool
 

863
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,590
just to clean up some of the tool
storage

864
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:09,600
storage
 

865
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,830
storage
i'm gonna use these up and also grab

866
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
i'm gonna use these up and also grab
 

867
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,430
i'm gonna use these up and also grab
some sandstone from the other base

868
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,440
some sandstone from the other base
 

869
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,870
some sandstone from the other base
but big project big project even though

870
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880
but big project big project even though
 

871
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,870
but big project big project even though
it looks so simple there's

872
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
it looks so simple there's
 

873
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,310
it looks so simple there's
a lot of digging a lot of block placing

874
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
a lot of digging a lot of block placing
 

875
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,510
a lot of digging a lot of block placing
and everything involved

876
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
and everything involved
 

877
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,590
and everything involved
as is placing some iron bars here and

878
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
as is placing some iron bars here and
 

879
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,669
as is placing some iron bars here and
there may be a flaw with this

880
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
there may be a flaw with this
 

881
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,470
there may be a flaw with this
i'm not sure yet we'll we'll see when we

882
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
i'm not sure yet we'll we'll see when we
 

883
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,270
i'm not sure yet we'll we'll see when we
test it

884
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
test it
 

885
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,870
test it
but this is a full block increase

886
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
but this is a full block increase
 

887
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,549
but this is a full block increase
and silverfish are going to be pressed

888
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
and silverfish are going to be pressed
 

889
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,190
and silverfish are going to be pressed
against this iron bar trying to get us

890
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,200
against this iron bar trying to get us
 

891
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,710
against this iron bar trying to get us
so they're going to hit this and they

892
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
so they're going to hit this and they
 

893
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,470
so they're going to hit this and they
might get slowed down from it i'm

894
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
might get slowed down from it i'm
 

895
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,310
might get slowed down from it i'm
guessing they'll just jump up

896
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
guessing they'll just jump up
 

897
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,070
guessing they'll just jump up
and hopefully keep up because

898
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
and hopefully keep up because
 

899
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,190
and hopefully keep up because
if they linger behind us then they

900
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
if they linger behind us then they
 

901
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,830
if they linger behind us then they
will stop tracking us and

902
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
will stop tracking us and
 

903
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,750
will stop tracking us and
get far away and despawn which we don't

904
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
get far away and despawn which we don't
 

905
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,830
get far away and despawn which we don't
want so we'll have to see when

906
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:07,840
want so we'll have to see when
 

907
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,669
want so we'll have to see when
we get to testing but we'll we'll keep

908
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
we get to testing but we'll we'll keep
 

909
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,590
we get to testing but we'll we'll keep
it like this for now

910
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
it like this for now
 

911
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:19,270
it like this for now
and change it later if it's a problem

912
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,280

 

913
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,390

unfortunately we won't be able to test

922
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:31,760
unfortunately we won't be able to test
 

923
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,510
unfortunately we won't be able to test
it today

924
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
it today
 

925
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,630

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
two mediocre picks
 

931
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,630
two mediocre picks
and all we have to do now is place the

932
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
and all we have to do now is place the
 

933
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,510
and all we have to do now is place the
sandstone the iron bars

sandstone the iron bars
 

935
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,430
sandstone the iron bars
and the signs in the water

936
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
and the signs in the water
 

937
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,470
and the signs in the water
and test it so

938
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480

00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:58,840
to enough sandstone
 

1181
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,909
to enough sandstone
so i don't know how much more we're

1182
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
so i don't know how much more we're
 

1183
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,630
so i don't know how much more we're
gonna do with this today

1184
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:03,640
gonna do with this today
 

1185
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,510
gonna do with this today
unfortunately

1186
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:07,520

 

1187
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,029

um i also think i ran out of things to

1188
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:11,039
um i also think i ran out of things to
 

1189
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,070
um i also think i ran out of things to
talk about

1190
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080

 

1191
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,750

hmm

1192
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760

 

1193
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,750

oh well i'm going to stop recording for

1194
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:23,760
oh well i'm going to stop recording for
 

1195
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,870
oh well i'm going to stop recording for
a bit here and

1196
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:24,880
a bit here and
 

1197
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,630
a bit here and
i will get back to you

1198
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
i will get back to you
 

1199
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,350
i will get back to you
and this is the final update so i kept

1200
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,360
and this is the final update so i kept
 

1201
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,909
and this is the final update so i kept
going here about another hour or so

1202
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:33,919
going here about another hour or so
 

1203
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,510
going here about another hour or so
collected more sandstone and we got it

1204
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
collected more sandstone and we got it
 

1205
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,149
collected more sandstone and we got it
finished

1206
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
finished
 

1207
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,830
finished
we got the bars we got all the sandstone

1208
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:40,840
we got the bars we got all the sandstone
 

1209
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,990
we got the bars we got all the sandstone
placed

1210
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
placed
 

1211
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,070
placed
we're starting to put some signs down to

1212
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,080
we're starting to put some signs down to
 

1213
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,230
we're starting to put some signs down to
hold the water in place

1214
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,240
hold the water in place
 

1215
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,710
hold the water in place
once we get that in and there's a few

1216
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
once we get that in and there's a few
 

1217
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,230
once we get that in and there's a few
other

1218
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,240
other
 

1219
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,909
other
things i forgot about like the lighting

1220
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:51,919
things i forgot about like the lighting
 

1221
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,830
things i forgot about like the lighting
we'll have to put in the ceiling and

1222
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:54,840
we'll have to put in the ceiling and
 

1223
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,310
we'll have to put in the ceiling and
and uh yeah but

1224
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
and uh yeah but
 

1225
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,909
and uh yeah but
overall it's about done now

1226
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919
overall it's about done now
 

1227
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,510
overall it's about done now
and we're just gonna do a dry run and

1228
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:03,520
and we're just gonna do a dry run and
 

1229
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,110
and we're just gonna do a dry run and
call it an end

1230
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
call it an end
 

1231
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,029
call it an end
and call it an end for the day

1232
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,039
and call it an end for the day
 

1233
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,950
and call it an end for the day
and obviously i'll i want to have

1234
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960
and obviously i'll i want to have
 

1235
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,549
and obviously i'll i want to have
something a little fancier at the top

1236
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:14,559
something a little fancier at the top
 

1237
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,990
something a little fancier at the top
here

1238
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,000
here
 

1239
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,190
here
oh boy

1240
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,200

 

1241
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,830

but yeah that's that's it so far so

1242
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:23,840
but yeah that's that's it so far so
 

1243
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,350
but yeah that's that's it so far so
let's go

1244
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
let's go
 

1245
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,190
let's go
to the silverfish where'd he go there

1246
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,200
to the silverfish where'd he go there
 

1247
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,669
to the silverfish where'd he go there
you are

1248
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679

 

1249
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,390

let's go get some silver fish and try it

1250
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:32,400
let's go get some silver fish and try it
 

1251
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,870
let's go get some silver fish and try it
out

1252
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:36,880

 

1253
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,430

all right so there are a few leftover

1254
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:39,440
all right so there are a few leftover
 

1255
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,350
all right so there are a few leftover
silverfish blocks here which we'll just

1256
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,360
silverfish blocks here which we'll just
 

1257
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,909
silverfish blocks here which we'll just
manually break to try this out

1258
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
manually break to try this out
 

1259
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,630
manually break to try this out
there these are in an awkward place uh

1260
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:46,640
there these are in an awkward place uh
 

1261
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,430
there these are in an awkward place uh
i'll

1262
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:47,440
i'll
 

1263
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,029
i'll
probably have to manually break all of

1264
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:49,039
probably have to manually break all of
 

1265
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,070
probably have to manually break all of
them to get them out of here

1266
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,080

 

1267
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,990

let's just break a few in case we need

1268
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,000
let's just break a few in case we need
 

1269
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,830
let's just break a few in case we need
to do a few more tests

1270
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:04,840

 

1271
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,269

and

1272
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:07,279
and
 

1273
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,950
and
okay so i will ender pearl out of here

1274
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960
okay so i will ender pearl out of here
 

1275
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:23,110
okay so i will ender pearl out of here
go underneath

1276
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,120

 

1277
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,870

yeah oh did i leave i left the gate open

1278
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:26,880
yeah oh did i leave i left the gate open
 

1279
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,230
yeah oh did i leave i left the gate open
didn't i

1280
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,240
didn't i
 

1281
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,269
didn't i
yep

1282
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279

 

1283
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,750

oh well uh that should have been closed

1284
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:37,760
oh well uh that should have been closed
 

1285
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:46,830
oh well uh that should have been closed
walk to the center so it'll track us

1286
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:46,840

 

1287
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,990

hopefully

1288
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,000
hopefully
 

1289
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,029
hopefully
that seems to work

1290
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039

 

1291
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,750

um any more in there that we missed

1292
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:57,760
um any more in there that we missed
 

1293
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,830
um any more in there that we missed
i just want to see how effective that

1294
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:00,840
i just want to see how effective that
 

1295
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,590
i just want to see how effective that
was

1296
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:03,600
was
 

1297
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,029
was
okay there's one

1298
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:07,039

 

1299
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,870

still one roaming around in there

1300
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:10,880
still one roaming around in there
 

1301
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,950
still one roaming around in there
we'll leave them be okay so if we go

1302
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:12,960
we'll leave them be okay so if we go
 

1303
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,269
we'll leave them be okay so if we go
over here they should all

1304
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:15,279
over here they should all
 

1305
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,269
over here they should all
trickle through yeah

1306
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:19,279
trickle through yeah
 

1307
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,110
trickle through yeah
and they're all following us nicely

1308
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,120
and they're all following us nicely
 

1309
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,070
and they're all following us nicely
let's see

1310
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,080

 

1311
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,669

so they're they're quite a bit slower

1312
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:25,679
so they're they're quite a bit slower
 

1313
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,750
so they're they're quite a bit slower
than us we don't want to move too quick

1314
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:27,760
than us we don't want to move too quick
 

1315
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,510
than us we don't want to move too quick
that's why we're using the water streams

1316
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:29,520
that's why we're using the water streams
 

1317
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,430
that's why we're using the water streams
to get a

1318
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,440
to get a
 

1319
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,230
to get a
consistent speed what happens here

1320
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:36,240

 

1321
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,830

yeah we got a bit of a bottleneck now

1322
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:39,840
yeah we got a bit of a bottleneck now
 

1323
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,590
yeah we got a bit of a bottleneck now
okay so what i could do

1324
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,600
okay so what i could do
 

1325
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,350
okay so what i could do
like they're running into the full block

1326
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,360
like they're running into the full block
 

1327
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,350
like they're running into the full block
whoa

1328
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,360
whoa
 

1329
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,230
whoa
they launch you like crazy uh what i

1330
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
they launch you like crazy uh what i
 

1331
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,990
they launch you like crazy uh what i
could do is probably replace that with

1332
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,000
could do is probably replace that with
 

1333
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,669
could do is probably replace that with
the half slab

1334
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:53,679
the half slab
 

1335
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,470
the half slab
it might look a little weird but they

1336
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,480
it might look a little weird but they
 

1337
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,669
it might look a little weird but they
shouldn't be able to fit through the

1338
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:57,679
shouldn't be able to fit through the
 

1339
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,110
shouldn't be able to fit through the
half slab and iron bar

1340
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,120

 

1341
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,149

yeah they don't want to come at all

1342
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:06,159
yeah they don't want to come at all
 

1343
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,990
yeah they don't want to come at all
uh the iron bars also mess up their

1344
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,000
uh the iron bars also mess up their
 

1345
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,830
uh the iron bars also mess up their
pathfinding i'm pretty sure

1346
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:09,840
pathfinding i'm pretty sure
 

1347
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,190
pathfinding i'm pretty sure
if they're in them like that which might
