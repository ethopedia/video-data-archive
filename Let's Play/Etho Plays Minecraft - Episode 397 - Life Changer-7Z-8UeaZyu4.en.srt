we right now you might be wondering it's
 

13
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,900
we right now you might be wondering it's
kind of obvious isn't it this is not

14
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:23,910
kind of obvious isn't it this is not
 

15
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,310
kind of obvious isn't it this is not
where I come to cry or anything like

16
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:25,320
where I come to cry or anything like
 

17
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,109
where I come to cry or anything like
that it's not no I just dug this up this

18
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:30,119
that it's not no I just dug this up this
 

19
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,440
that it's not no I just dug this up this
is right behind the mob system as you

20
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:33,450
is right behind the mob system as you
 

21
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,850
is right behind the mob system as you
probably guessed I got to be really

22
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:34,860
probably guessed I got to be really
 

23
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,709
probably guessed I got to be really
careful around this too I think because

24
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
careful around this too I think because
 

25
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,360
careful around this too I think because
I don't think there's any way to get

26
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,370
I don't think there's any way to get
 

27
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,360
I don't think there's any way to get
these mushroom blocks anymore right

28
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:40,370
these mushroom blocks anymore right
 

29
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,560
these mushroom blocks anymore right
because you can only get brown and red

30
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:42,570
because you can only get brown and red
 

31
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,569
because you can only get brown and red
mushrooms you can't get these these old

32
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:44,579
mushrooms you can't get these these old
 

33
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,869
mushrooms you can't get these these old
ones anymore I don't think so as we work

34
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:47,879
ones anymore I don't think so as we work
 

35
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,250
ones anymore I don't think so as we work
here today we've got to be very careful

36
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:49,260
here today we've got to be very careful
 

37
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,830
here today we've got to be very careful
no creepers blow it up and I don't hit

38
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
no creepers blow it up and I don't hit
 

39
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,130
no creepers blow it up and I don't hit
it with a pic or something like that but

40
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:55,140
it with a pic or something like that but
 

41
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,459
it with a pic or something like that but
the goal for today we are going to do do

42
00:00:58,459 --> 00:00:58,469
the goal for today we are going to do do
 

43
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,279
the goal for today we are going to do do
that arena idea I thought about it some

44
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:01,289
that arena idea I thought about it some
 

45
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:02,569
that arena idea I thought about it some
more I looked at some of your comments

46
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:02,579
more I looked at some of your comments
 

47
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,450
more I looked at some of your comments
and I am pretty excited for it I think

48
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:05,460
and I am pretty excited for it I think
 

49
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,929
and I am pretty excited for it I think
it's going to turn out pretty good I

50
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:08,939
it's going to turn out pretty good I
 

51
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,380
it's going to turn out pretty good I
hope we will see I guess as we work on

52
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:12,390
hope we will see I guess as we work on
 

53
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,940
hope we will see I guess as we work on
it here okay so the very first step to

54
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:16,950
it here okay so the very first step to
 

55
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,370
it here okay so the very first step to
this we got to get in there probably I

56
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:21,380
this we got to get in there probably I
 

57
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,690
this we got to get in there probably I
made like a little platform to work off

58
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:23,700
made like a little platform to work off
 

59
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,969
made like a little platform to work off
of here but we'll probably want to do is

60
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:25,979
of here but we'll probably want to do is
 

61
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,899
of here but we'll probably want to do is
just like go up a little bit maybe a bit

62
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:29,909
just like go up a little bit maybe a bit
 

63
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,780
just like go up a little bit maybe a bit
more so we have a bit of room to work

64
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:32,790
more so we have a bit of room to work
 

65
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,530
more so we have a bit of room to work
here and what we'll do yeah maybe at

66
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:39,540
here and what we'll do yeah maybe at
 

67
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,240
here and what we'll do yeah maybe at
this level here we're going to have some

68
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,250
this level here we're going to have some
 

69
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,639
this level here we're going to have some
sticky pistons that come out is it too

70
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:43,649
sticky pistons that come out is it too
 

71
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,010
sticky pistons that come out is it too
dark for you guys let me turn on the

72
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:46,020
dark for you guys let me turn on the
 

73
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,590
dark for you guys let me turn on the
torch sticky pistons will come out and

74
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:50,600
torch sticky pistons will come out and
 

75
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,480
torch sticky pistons will come out and
the mobs will land on the floor that

76
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,490
the mobs will land on the floor that
 

77
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,850
the mobs will land on the floor that
pops out of the wall here and then we

78
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:55,860
pops out of the wall here and then we
 

79
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,359
pops out of the wall here and then we
also want to release some water on the

80
00:01:59,359 --> 00:01:59,369
also want to release some water on the
 

81
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,039
also want to release some water on the
ground we're making here so that they

82
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:01,049
ground we're making here so that they
 

83
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,840
ground we're making here so that they
don't die when they hit it right and

84
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:02,850
don't die when they hit it right and
 

85
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,780
don't die when they hit it right and
we'll wash them off this way and they'll

86
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:05,790
we'll wash them off this way and they'll
 

87
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,800
we'll wash them off this way and they'll
fall down into a holding area probably

88
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:08,810
fall down into a holding area probably
 

89
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,210
fall down into a holding area probably
maybe we'll make them bunch up a little

90
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,220
maybe we'll make them bunch up a little
 

91
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,740
maybe we'll make them bunch up a little
bit too

92
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:12,750
bit too
 

93
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,890
bit too
and yeah I was thinking about it there's

94
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:16,900
and yeah I was thinking about it there's
 

95
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,380
and yeah I was thinking about it there's
actually a lot of flexibility with this

96
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:19,390
actually a lot of flexibility with this
 

97
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,830
actually a lot of flexibility with this
whole arena idea I've never made an

98
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:22,840
whole arena idea I've never made an
 

99
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,420
whole arena idea I've never made an
arena before well I should have maybe to

100
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,430
arena before well I should have maybe to
 

101
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,460
arena before well I should have maybe to
be careful how I phrase that I've made a

102
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:29,470
be careful how I phrase that I've made a
 

103
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,650
be careful how I phrase that I've made a
verina's or attempted to make arenas and

104
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:31,660
verina's or attempted to make arenas and
 

105
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,430
verina's or attempted to make arenas and
then servers always seem to get reset

106
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,440
then servers always seem to get reset
 

107
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,470
then servers always seem to get reset
for some reason I've never made a mob

108
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:37,480
for some reason I've never made a mob
 

109
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,000
for some reason I've never made a mob
arena before I should say so this is

110
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,010
arena before I should say so this is
 

111
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,710
arena before I should say so this is
going to be a fun challenge but yeah

112
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:43,720
going to be a fun challenge but yeah
 

113
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,770
going to be a fun challenge but yeah
like we can adjust the difficulty of it

114
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:45,780
like we can adjust the difficulty of it
 

115
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,500
like we can adjust the difficulty of it
the difficulty of it based on like what

116
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:49,510
the difficulty of it based on like what
 

117
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,490
the difficulty of it based on like what
Armour we're wearing

118
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:50,500
Armour we're wearing
 

119
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,070
Armour we're wearing
how many mobs we send through you know

120
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,080
how many mobs we send through you know
 

121
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,890
how many mobs we send through you know
we can give mobs armor we can buff them

122
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:55,900
we can give mobs armor we can buff them
 

123
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,560
we can give mobs armor we can buff them
with potions we can debuff ourselves

124
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:58,570
with potions we can debuff ourselves
 

125
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,550
with potions we can debuff ourselves
with potions you know what weapons were

126
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
with potions you know what weapons were
 

127
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,530
with potions you know what weapons were
using there's a lot of flexibility with

128
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:04,540
using there's a lot of flexibility with
 

129
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,590
using there's a lot of flexibility with
it and I think we can make it more or

130
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:07,600
it and I think we can make it more or
 

131
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,120
it and I think we can make it more or
less challenging depending on what we

132
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,130
less challenging depending on what we
 

133
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,850
less challenging depending on what we
want I'll use planks just so I know it's

134
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:11,860
want I'll use planks just so I know it's
 

135
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,150
want I'll use planks just so I know it's
a different block here all right so this

136
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,160
a different block here all right so this
 

137
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,510
a different block here all right so this
will pop out land on that above this

138
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:18,520
will pop out land on that above this
 

139
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,060
will pop out land on that above this
we're going to put dispensers with water

140
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,070
we're going to put dispensers with water
 

141
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,010
we're going to put dispensers with water
buckets I guess I don't know if I want

142
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,020
buckets I guess I don't know if I want
 

143
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,360
buckets I guess I don't know if I want
to do it all the way along I don't think

144
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,370
to do it all the way along I don't think
 

145
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,840
to do it all the way along I don't think
that's necessary let me figure out

146
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:27,850
that's necessary let me figure out
 

147
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,850
that's necessary let me figure out
exactly what water pattern we need here

148
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:29,860
exactly what water pattern we need here
 

149
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,010
exactly what water pattern we need here
they'll have to go in the very edges for

150
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,020
they'll have to go in the very edges for
 

151
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,170
they'll have to go in the very edges for
sure though

152
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,180
sure though
 

153
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,420
sure though
all right guys very good so we have the

154
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:36,430
all right guys very good so we have the
 

155
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,580
all right guys very good so we have the
first part of this done let me just show

156
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:38,590
first part of this done let me just show
 

157
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,130
first part of this done let me just show
you what I built up here and how it

158
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:41,140
you what I built up here and how it
 

159
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,790
you what I built up here and how it
works can I make it yes we made it good

160
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:44,800
works can I make it yes we made it good
 

161
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,600
works can I make it yes we made it good
so this is basically just a switching

162
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:48,610
so this is basically just a switching
 

163
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,690
so this is basically just a switching
system so that the mobs will either go

164
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:51,700
system so that the mobs will either go
 

165
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,030
system so that the mobs will either go
to the mob system and die or they'll

166
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,040
to the mob system and die or they'll
 

167
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,000
to the mob system and die or they'll
gets routed over to the right here into

168
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,010
gets routed over to the right here into
 

169
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,310
gets routed over to the right here into
the arena so that we can actually use

170
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,320
the arena so that we can actually use
 

171
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,540
the arena so that we can actually use
them to fight against basically you hear

172
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:03,550
them to fight against basically you hear
 

173
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,880
them to fight against basically you hear
them all they are right now just blocked

174
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:05,890
them all they are right now just blocked
 

175
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,030
them all they are right now just blocked
by the stone in the ceiling here I got

176
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
by the stone in the ceiling here I got
 

177
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,750
by the stone in the ceiling here I got
to remove that and let them free somehow

178
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:14,760
to remove that and let them free somehow
 

179
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,800
to remove that and let them free somehow
let me just show you how this works

180
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:16,810
let me just show you how this works
 

181
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,160
let me just show you how this works
before I do that though otherwise they

182
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,170
before I do that though otherwise they
 

183
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,010
before I do that though otherwise they
will fall into the water and then

184
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,020
will fall into the water and then
 

185
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,450
will fall into the water and then
root to the middle here and fall down

186
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:25,460
root to the middle here and fall down
 

187
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,369
root to the middle here and fall down
into another holding cell that we

188
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:27,379
into another holding cell that we
 

189
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:30,249
into another holding cell that we
haven't built yet but yeah we got a

190
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:30,259
haven't built yet but yeah we got a
 

191
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:33,550
haven't built yet but yeah we got a
button here press it once picks up the

192
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:33,560
button here press it once picks up the
 

193
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,779
button here press it once picks up the
water and the Pistons retract you see I

194
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:37,789
water and the Pistons retract you see I
 

195
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:39,730
water and the Pistons retract you see I
got a whole line of signs there as well

196
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:39,740
got a whole line of signs there as well
 

197
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,200
got a whole line of signs there as well
so the water doesn't have to flow all

198
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,210
so the water doesn't have to flow all
 

199
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,559
so the water doesn't have to flow all
the way to the bottom and just stops it

200
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:44,569
the way to the bottom and just stops it
 

201
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:47,379
the way to the bottom and just stops it
from updating press it again water comes

202
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:47,389
from updating press it again water comes
 

203
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,350
from updating press it again water comes
out and the Pistons extends so it's

204
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:50,360
out and the Pistons extends so it's
 

205
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,279
out and the Pistons extends so it's
pretty cool so the drop or not the

206
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:54,289
pretty cool so the drop or not the
 

207
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:56,200
pretty cool so the drop or not the
droppers the dispensers they take two

208
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,210
droppers the dispensers they take two
 

209
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,399
droppers the dispensers they take two
pulses to activate but the Pistons only

210
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:00,409
pulses to activate but the Pistons only
 

211
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:03,490
pulses to activate but the Pistons only
need like an on/off right so that's that

212
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:03,500
need like an on/off right so that's that
 

213
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,740
need like an on/off right so that's that
was a bit tricky I had to make a t

214
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:05,750
was a bit tricky I had to make a t
 

215
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,760
was a bit tricky I had to make a t
flip-flop here and right now the block

216
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:09,770
flip-flop here and right now the block
 

217
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,719
flip-flop here and right now the block
is out if we press it it pulls it back

218
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:12,729
is out if we press it it pulls it back
 

219
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,930
is out if we press it it pulls it back
Pistons retracts press it again and they

220
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:16,940
Pistons retracts press it again and they
 

221
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,899
Pistons retracts press it again and they
extend because it goes forward so it's

222
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:19,909
extend because it goes forward so it's
 

223
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:22,839
extend because it goes forward so it's
fairly simple and then I got another

224
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:22,849
fairly simple and then I got another
 

225
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:27,120
fairly simple and then I got another
wire running up here to the dispensers

226
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,130
wire running up here to the dispensers
 

227
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,499
wire running up here to the dispensers
dispensers are really annoying - I gotta

228
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:29,509
dispensers are really annoying - I gotta
 

229
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:32,350
dispensers are really annoying - I gotta
say I it's not enough that I was

230
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:32,360
say I it's not enough that I was
 

231
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,930
say I it's not enough that I was
powering them like I had this wired a

232
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:34,940
powering them like I had this wired a
 

233
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,070
powering them like I had this wired a
little different before I was actually

234
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
little different before I was actually
 

235
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,360
little different before I was actually
powering the dispensers but they weren't

236
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,370
powering the dispensers but they weren't
 

237
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,490
powering the dispensers but they weren't
activating I had to like power them and

238
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:42,500
activating I had to like power them and
 

239
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,740
activating I had to like power them and
give them a block update for them to

240
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:44,750
give them a block update for them to
 

241
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,860
give them a block update for them to
work so that's what the repeaters are

242
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:47,870
work so that's what the repeaters are
 

243
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,730
work so that's what the repeaters are
for just make a block updates and I

244
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:51,740
for just make a block updates and I
 

245
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,430
for just make a block updates and I
guess I gotta let these guys free this

246
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
guess I gotta let these guys free this
 

247
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,779
guess I gotta let these guys free this
will be fun Oh careful

248
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:00,789
will be fun Oh careful
 

249
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:03,249
will be fun Oh careful
all the while I don't want those

250
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:03,259
all the while I don't want those
 

251
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:09,459
all the while I don't want those
mushroom blocks to break on me oh that's

252
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:09,469
mushroom blocks to break on me oh that's
 

253
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,959
mushroom blocks to break on me oh that's
freaky

254
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:10,969
freaky
 

255
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:16,869
freaky
oh all right so we're gonna have a lot

256
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:16,879
oh all right so we're gonna have a lot
 

257
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,509
oh all right so we're gonna have a lot
of mobs here like it's not an issue for

258
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:19,519
of mobs here like it's not an issue for
 

259
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,669
of mobs here like it's not an issue for
sure don't shoot the creepers

260
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:21,679
sure don't shoot the creepers
 

261
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:24,429
sure don't shoot the creepers
oh I'm not I'm not gonna take that

262
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:24,439
oh I'm not I'm not gonna take that
 

263
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,549
oh I'm not I'm not gonna take that
chance actually if they shoot the

264
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:27,559
chance actually if they shoot the
 

265
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:31,089
chance actually if they shoot the
creepers I get it here they're going to

266
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:31,099
creepers I get it here they're going to
 

267
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,449
creepers I get it here they're going to
blow up down there whether I like it or

268
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:34,459
blow up down there whether I like it or
 

269
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:41,109
blow up down there whether I like it or
not oh man okay we got them all right so

270
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:41,119
not oh man okay we got them all right so
 

271
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:41,889
not oh man okay we got them all right so
that's good

272
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:41,899
that's good
 

273
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:44,109
that's good
I'm not going to switch this again until

274
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:44,119
I'm not going to switch this again until
 

275
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:48,219
I'm not going to switch this again until
I tune for until we get the holding cell

276
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:48,229
I tune for until we get the holding cell
 

277
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:50,799
I tune for until we get the holding cell
set up in the arena here so that's what

278
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:50,809
set up in the arena here so that's what
 

279
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,059
set up in the arena here so that's what
I'm going to work on next

280
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:52,069
I'm going to work on next
 

281
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:54,129
I'm going to work on next
actually let's figure out the shape of

282
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:54,139
actually let's figure out the shape of
 

283
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:56,739
actually let's figure out the shape of
the arena I was figuring might want to

284
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:56,749
the arena I was figuring might want to
 

285
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:01,289
the arena I was figuring might want to
do like a 21 block circle in diameter

286
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:01,299
do like a 21 block circle in diameter
 

287
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:04,619
do like a 21 block circle in diameter
maybe we'll just try lay that out a bit

288
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:04,629
maybe we'll just try lay that out a bit
 

289
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:07,979
maybe we'll just try lay that out a bit
let's move this over one two three four

290
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:07,989
let's move this over one two three four
 

291
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:10,569
let's move this over one two three four
five I'm going to leave a little bit of

292
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:10,579
five I'm going to leave a little bit of
 

293
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:12,369
five I'm going to leave a little bit of
space between this and the mushrooms and

294
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:12,379
space between this and the mushrooms and
 

295
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:14,439
space between this and the mushrooms and
I'll probably want to just put a layer a

296
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:14,449
I'll probably want to just put a layer a
 

297
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,899
I'll probably want to just put a layer a
stone here so if that creeper does blow

298
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:16,909
stone here so if that creeper does blow
 

299
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:21,069
stone here so if that creeper does blow
up they won't get rekt okay tell you

300
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:21,079
up they won't get rekt okay tell you
 

301
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,649
up they won't get rekt okay tell you
what guys you know what we're gonna do

397
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,630
them too big what happens is you can
just like run around the edges and the

398
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
just like run around the edges and the
 

399
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,510
just like run around the edges and the
mobs can never catch up to you and I

400

mobs can never catch up to you and I
 

401
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,389

can't really run away from skeletons
 

405
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,540

because I think they can shoot 16 blocks
 

407
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,710
because I think they can shoot 16 blocks
this is a little bit bigger than that

408
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:05,720
this is a little bit bigger than that
 

409
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,230
this is a little bit bigger than that
but it would be pretty hard to avoid

410
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
but it would be pretty hard to avoid
 

411
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,410
but it would be pretty hard to avoid
getting totally hit you know that's

412
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:11,420
getting totally hit you know that's
 

413
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,910
getting totally hit you know that's
something they should change with this

medium or hard right they should make it

422
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,010
medium or hard right they should make it
 

423
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,460
medium or hard right they should make it
as you go from easy medium hard

424
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:27,470
as you go from easy medium hard
 

425
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,130

the mobs get faster and if you're on hot

426
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:30,140
the mobs get faster and if you're on hot
 

427
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,310

think that would be
 

433
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,600
think that would be
that would actually make the game hard

434
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:40,610
that would actually make the game hard
 

435
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,490
that would actually make the game hard
like the mobs would be something you

436
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:42,500
like the mobs would be something you
 

437
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,290
like the mobs would be something you

create a new portal and every time you

476
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:43,880
create a new portal and every time you
 

477
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,240
create a new portal and every time you
do that you get a new portal just bust

478
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,250
do that you get a new portal just bust
 

479
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,690
do that you get a new portal just bust
it and you get obsidian very cool I like

480
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:49,700
it and you get obsidian very cool I like
 

481
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,080
it and you get obsidian very cool I like
it

482
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,090
it
 

483
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,920
it
I've used it a lot actually but I for

484
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:53,930
I've used it a lot actually but I for
 

485
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,110
I've used it a lot actually but I for
some reason don't have my haste beacon

486
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,120
some reason don't have my haste beacon
 

487
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,740
some reason don't have my haste beacon
here I must have moved it just been

488
00:11:59,740 --> 00:11:59,750
here I must have moved it just been
 

489
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,350
here I must have moved it just been
annoying so the what is the obsidian for

490
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:02,360
annoying so the what is the obsidian for
 

491
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,450
annoying so the what is the obsidian for
we're going to use it on the arena as

492
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:04,460
we're going to use it on the arena as
 

493
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,460
we're going to use it on the arena as
you could probably guess we're going to

494
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:06,470
you could probably guess we're going to
 

495
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,560
you could probably guess we're going to
try line the walls with it so if there's

496
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:08,570
try line the walls with it so if there's
 

497
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,570
try line the walls with it so if there's
creeper explosions and stuff we don't

498
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:10,580
creeper explosions and stuff we don't
 

499
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,480
creeper explosions and stuff we don't
have to worry too much so let's head on

500
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:13,490
have to worry too much so let's head on
 

501
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,970
have to worry too much so let's head on
back I did work out so what was wrong

502
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:15,980
back I did work out so what was wrong
 

503
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,140
back I did work out so what was wrong
with the circle not that it's actually a

504
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,150
with the circle not that it's actually a
 

505
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,800
with the circle not that it's actually a
circle this is minecraft yes I know oh

506
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:22,810
circle this is minecraft yes I know oh
 

507
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,030
circle this is minecraft yes I know oh
let me show you this - I never showed

508
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
let me show you this - I never showed
 

509
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,920
let me show you this - I never showed
you this so to get to the arena we're

510
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:26,930
you this so to get to the arena we're
 

511
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,260
you this so to get to the arena we're
probably going to have to go through

512
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,270
probably going to have to go through
 

513
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,030
probably going to have to go through
here they'll be like an intersection or

514
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
here they'll be like an intersection or
 

515
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,190
here they'll be like an intersection or
something and one of the branches will

516
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
something and one of the branches will
 

517
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,090
something and one of the branches will
go off this way there's some ravine here

518
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,100
go off this way there's some ravine here
 

519
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,080
go off this way there's some ravine here
and that is part of the potion farm over

520
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,090
and that is part of the potion farm over
 

521
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:47,470
and that is part of the potion farm over
there that's about it was there I'm

522
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:47,480
there that's about it was there I'm
 

523
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,030
there that's about it was there I'm
seeing it cobblestone there I'm

524
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
seeing it cobblestone there I'm
 

525
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,440
seeing it cobblestone there I'm
wondering if that's a spawner I don't

526
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:50,450
wondering if that's a spawner I don't
 

527
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,780
wondering if that's a spawner I don't
think it was

528
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:51,790
think it was
 

529
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,150
think it was
but yeah here is our circle so what I'm

530
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,160
but yeah here is our circle so what I'm
 

531
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,410
but yeah here is our circle so what I'm
going to do probably is just like have a

532
00:12:59,410 --> 00:12:59,420
going to do probably is just like have a
 

533
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,810
going to do probably is just like have a
veneer in front of this maybe put the

534
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:01,820
veneer in front of this maybe put the
 

535
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,480
veneer in front of this maybe put the
city in here so you can't actually see

536
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:04,490
city in here so you can't actually see
 

537
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,310
city in here so you can't actually see
it but if a block gets blown up it's

538
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
it but if a block gets blown up it's
 

539
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,010
it but if a block gets blown up it's
only gonna be one thick you know but I

540
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,020
only gonna be one thick you know but I
 

541
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,150
only gonna be one thick you know but I
don't want to make the whole thing out

542
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
don't want to make the whole thing out
 

543
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,790
don't want to make the whole thing out
of obsidian because it looks terrible ah

544
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800

 

545
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,310

that hurts one more block I didn't have

546
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
that hurts one more block I didn't have
 

547
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,160
that hurts one more block I didn't have
to mine all right

548
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,170
to mine all right
 

549
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,320
to mine all right
and then at each of these edges here

550
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,330
and then at each of these edges here
 

551
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,400
and then at each of these edges here
each of these it's probably where we're

552
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,410
each of these it's probably where we're
 

553
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,350
each of these it's probably where we're
going to release the mobs so we'll have

554
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
going to release the mobs so we'll have
 

555
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,200
going to release the mobs so we'll have
four four points to do that somehow we

556
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,210
four four points to do that somehow we
 

557
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,440
four four points to do that somehow we
have to get them to those spots evenly

558
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,450
have to get them to those spots evenly
 

559
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,840
have to get them to those spots evenly
if possible like where they fill up

560
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:37,850
if possible like where they fill up
 

561
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,060
if possible like where they fill up
evenly not exactly sure how to do that

562
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,070
evenly not exactly sure how to do that
 

563
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,680
evenly not exactly sure how to do that
so I couldn't wait guys we're gonna do a

564
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:44,690
so I couldn't wait guys we're gonna do a
 

565
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,470
so I couldn't wait guys we're gonna do a
fight already it I just want to try it

566
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:47,480
fight already it I just want to try it
 

567
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,360
fight already it I just want to try it
out I want to get an idea of how fast

568
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,370
out I want to get an idea of how fast
 

569
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,220
out I want to get an idea of how fast
they fill up the chamber here and and

570
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,230
they fill up the chamber here and and
 

571
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,700
they fill up the chamber here and and
how difficult is that kind of stuff so I

572
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:54,710
how difficult is that kind of stuff so I
 

573
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,560
how difficult is that kind of stuff so I
did make a release chamber this is it

574
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:56,570
did make a release chamber this is it
 

575
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,560
did make a release chamber this is it
and I think this is gonna work out

576
00:13:59,560 --> 00:13:59,570
and I think this is gonna work out
 

577
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,580
and I think this is gonna work out
pretty good actually

578
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:00,590
pretty good actually
 

579
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,250
pretty good actually
I was gonna have like Pistons retract

580
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:03,260
I was gonna have like Pistons retract
 

581
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,860
I was gonna have like Pistons retract
from the ground at first or or fence

582
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:05,870
from the ground at first or or fence
 

583
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,770
from the ground at first or or fence
gates or something but like if I use

584
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:08,780
gates or something but like if I use
 

585
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,510
gates or something but like if I use
fence dude skeletons might shoot over

586
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:10,520
fence dude skeletons might shoot over
 

587
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,420
fence dude skeletons might shoot over
top of it at me or if I have Pistons

588
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:13,430
top of it at me or if I have Pistons
 

589
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,110
top of it at me or if I have Pistons
that retract downward or upward baby

590
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
that retract downward or upward baby
 

591
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,790
that retract downward or upward baby
zombies are going to fit through the one

592
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
zombies are going to fit through the one
 

593
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,240
zombies are going to fit through the one
tall gap er I don't know this this is

594
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,250
tall gap er I don't know this this is
 

595
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,350
tall gap er I don't know this this is
good here like when it's sideways is it

596
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
good here like when it's sideways is it
 

597
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,210
good here like when it's sideways is it
nothing can get you until you release it

598
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:29,220
nothing can get you until you release it
 

599
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,940
nothing can get you until you release it
and very simple so that's the way we're

600
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:31,950
and very simple so that's the way we're
 

601
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,640
and very simple so that's the way we're
doing it let's get up here and start

602
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:36,650
doing it let's get up here and start
 

603
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,020
doing it let's get up here and start
wait wait wait it's not closed is it

604
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,030
wait wait wait it's not closed is it
 

605
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,930
wait wait wait it's not closed is it
let's close it I haven't decided how

606
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:44,940
let's close it I haven't decided how
 

607
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,600
let's close it I haven't decided how
we're doing our arena fight yet there's

608
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:47,610
we're doing our arena fight yet there's
 

609
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,400
we're doing our arena fight yet there's
lots of different ways like we could do

610
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:49,410
lots of different ways like we could do
 

611
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,250
lots of different ways like we could do
it in waves where they sort of build up

612
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:52,260
it in waves where they sort of build up
 

613
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,960
it in waves where they sort of build up
for a while and then we we release all

614
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:53,970
for a while and then we we release all
 

615
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,200
for a while and then we we release all
the mobs and maybe as waves progress

616
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,210
the mobs and maybe as waves progress
 

617
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,510
the mobs and maybe as waves progress
through we we release more and more or

618
00:14:59,510 --> 00:14:59,520
through we we release more and more or
 

619
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,910
through we we release more and more or
they get stronger that type of thing

620
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
they get stronger that type of thing
 

621
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,250
they get stronger that type of thing
we could do like a survival mode where I

622
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:04,260
we could do like a survival mode where I
 

623
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,020
we could do like a survival mode where I
try to kill as many as I tend before I

624
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,030
try to kill as many as I tend before I
 

625
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,310
try to kill as many as I tend before I
die and get like a point for each one we

626
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:09,320
die and get like a point for each one we
 

627
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,450
die and get like a point for each one we
could do like a Time Attack how many I

628
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:14,460
could do like a Time Attack how many I
 

629
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,880
could do like a Time Attack how many I
can kill on a certain amount of time

630
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:15,890
can kill on a certain amount of time
 

631
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,290
can kill on a certain amount of time
there's lots of different ways I haven't

632
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:18,300
there's lots of different ways I haven't
 

633
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,490
there's lots of different ways I haven't
decided which way we're doing it we're

634
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:22,500
decided which way we're doing it we're
 

635
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,050
decided which way we're doing it we're
gonna probably have a control room

636
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:24,060
gonna probably have a control room
 

637
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,450
gonna probably have a control room
somewhere is it nighttime now

638
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:26,460
somewhere is it nighttime now
 

639
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,500
somewhere is it nighttime now
I think it's nighttime guys or maybe

640
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:30,510
I think it's nighttime guys or maybe
 

641
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,150
I think it's nighttime guys or maybe
because I'm up higher here they're not

642
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
because I'm up higher here they're not
 

643
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,860
because I'm up higher here they're not
spawning now yeah we'll have a control

644
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:36,870
spawning now yeah we'll have a control
 

645
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,840
spawning now yeah we'll have a control
room that's where that button is going

646
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:38,850
room that's where that button is going
 

647
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,860
room that's where that button is going
to be so that we can turn the switch on

648
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:42,870
to be so that we can turn the switch on
 

649
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,980
to be so that we can turn the switch on
and off oh and I never put the water up

650
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:45,990
and off oh and I never put the water up
 

651
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:52,550
and off oh and I never put the water up
oh and I never close that I'm supposed

652
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
oh and I never close that I'm supposed
 

653
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,400
oh and I never close that I'm supposed
to put water there oops

654
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:55,410
to put water there oops
 

655
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,430
to put water there oops
think we're safe maybe it's not

656
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:58,440
think we're safe maybe it's not
 

657
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,570
think we're safe maybe it's not
nighttime I don't know I think it's

658
00:15:59,570 --> 00:15:59,580
nighttime I don't know I think it's
 

659
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,680
nighttime I don't know I think it's
because I was up high they stopped

660
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:00,690
because I was up high they stopped
 

661
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,190
because I was up high they stopped
spawning

662
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,200
spawning
 

663
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,670
spawning
yeah but if we do a control room type of

664
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:04,680
yeah but if we do a control room type of
 

665
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,170
yeah but if we do a control room type of
thing we might be able to make several

666
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:06,180
thing we might be able to make several
 

667
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,930
thing we might be able to make several
different game modes and control it

668
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:08,940
different game modes and control it
 

669
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,150
different game modes and control it
there depending on what we want to do

670
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,160
there depending on what we want to do
 

671

let's just let these guys out and see
 

683
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,220
let's just let these guys out and see
what it's like

684
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,230

 

685

greatest first test oh and they're going

688
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800
greatest first test oh and they're going
 

689
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,350
greatest first test oh and they're going
to be running around if we got creepers

690
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:44,360
to be running around if we got creepers
 

691
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,200
to be running around if we got creepers
that are about to explode forgot about

692
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,210
that are about to explode forgot about
 

693

that okay I have pretty good armor on is
the thing and I get sword so if we tone

696
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
the thing and I get sword so if we tone
 

697
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,590
the thing and I get sword so if we tone
this down a bit it's going to be really

698
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
this down a bit it's going to be really
 

699
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:07,240
this down a bit it's going to be really
difficult can't already okay guys so

700
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,250
difficult can't already okay guys so
 

701
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,860
difficult can't already okay guys so
we're going to try this one more time I

702
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:08,870
we're going to try this one more time I
 

703
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,870
we're going to try this one more time I
waited a bit too long there's more mobs

704
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
waited a bit too long there's more mobs
 

705
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,300
waited a bit too long there's more mobs
there than I want but we'll see what

706
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,310
there than I want but we'll see what
 

707
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,400
there than I want but we'll see what
happens I guess what I really want to

708
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,410
happens I guess what I really want to
 

709
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,929
happens I guess what I really want to
test out now though is having some

710
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:16,939
test out now though is having some
 

711
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:19,090
test out now though is having some
obstacles on the course like some walls

712
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:19,100
obstacles on the course like some walls
 

713
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,179
obstacles on the course like some walls
to hide behind and use strategically so

714
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:22,189
to hide behind and use strategically so
 

715
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:24,010
to hide behind and use strategically so
we got a few of those and we'll just see

716
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,020
we got a few of those and we'll just see
 

717
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,949
we got a few of those and we'll just see
how that affects things later we'll

718
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
how that affects things later we'll
 

719
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,630
how that affects things later we'll
probably add traps and stuff to this -

720
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
probably add traps and stuff to this -
 

721
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,230
probably add traps and stuff to this -
like where maybe there's lava pits or or

adding a second layer to it like
 

871
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,659
adding a second layer to it like
vertically and I think that'll be okay

some more space here and we now have a
31 block diameter circle this feels

904
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,210
31 block diameter circle this feels
 

905
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,340

tunnel from the man cave to the old
 

917
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,070
tunnel from the man cave to the old
stronghold base and this you know out of

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,080
stronghold base and this you know out of
 

919
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,660

everything I've built in the man cave
this has probably been the most useless

922
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
this has probably been the most useless
 

923
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,900
this has probably been the most useless

933
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,880
portal I could use it to but never
happened I never use it so it's not a

934
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:45,890
happened I never use it so it's not a
 

935
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,740
happened I never use it so it's not a
big deal if we just bump it to the left

936
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:47,750
big deal if we just bump it to the left
 

937
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,380

00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,560
a little bit put a bend in it or
something it's a low priority thing so

940
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:53,570
something it's a low priority thing so
 

941
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,350
something it's a low priority thing so
we won't worry about it too much but

942
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:56,360
we won't worry about it too much but

feed it into a thing and then when we do

980
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,080
feed it into a thing and then when we do
 

981
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,760
feed it into a thing and then when we do
that we get a moment break and it'll

982
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:54,770
that we get a moment break and it'll
 

983
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,440
that we get a moment break and it'll

start storing up mobs again and
 

985
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,290
start storing up mobs again and
in that break we get maybe a reward like

986
00:24:59,290 --> 00:24:59,300
in that break we get maybe a reward like
 

987
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,930

helps us to survive a bit longer for the

992
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,070
helps us to survive a bit longer for the
 

993
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,150
helps us to survive a bit longer for the
next wave and as we go through the waves

994
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,160
next wave and as we go through the waves
 

995
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,520
next wave and as we go through the waves
that keeps happening maybe we need more

996
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:12,530
that keeps happening maybe we need more
 

997
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:17,050

1000
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:18,650
get less I don't know somehow we have to
 

1001
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,760
get less I don't know somehow we have to
have a tipping balance where it becomes

1002
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:21,770
have a tipping balance where it becomes
 

1003
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,190
have a tipping balance where it becomes
more and more difficult too but I like

1004

think there's really much benefit to
 

1009
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,150

think yeah it'll go up to two until they
 

1035
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,410
think yeah it'll go up to two until they
combine but if we have a different item

1036
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:23,420
combine but if we have a different item
 

1037
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,940
combine but if we have a different item
they'll go up to two I didn't know that

I never use these these are like the

1040
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:26,570
I never use these these are like the
 

1041
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,070
I never use these these are like the
most useless thing in the game so that's

1042
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,080
most useless thing in the game so that's
 

1043
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,470
most useless thing in the game so that's
interesting but each of the mobs will be

1044
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:32,480
interesting but each of the mobs will be
 

1045
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,700
interesting but each of the mobs will be
separate so I think it will work for

1046

separate so I think it will work for
 

1047
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,990
separate so I think it will work for
