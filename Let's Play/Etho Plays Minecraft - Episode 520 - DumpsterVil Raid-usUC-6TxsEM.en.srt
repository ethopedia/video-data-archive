179
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:55,509
steal one of these guys from him can we
do that no how can we make them detach

180

to see if like one will despawn and the

184
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:02,629
to see if like one will despawn and the
 

185
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,390
to see if like one will despawn and the
other one stays like if we can detach it

186

but I don't think this leads to really
doing anything I don't think it's

190
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:08,810
doing anything I don't think it's
 

191

1074
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:25,600
running I guess they didn't really fight
 

1075
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,290

anybody right so I want to challenge

1076
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:28,300
anybody right so I want to challenge
 

1077
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,650
anybody right so I want to challenge
myself to try make a villager statue now

1078
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:31,660
myself to try make a villager statue now
 

1079
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,530
myself to try make a villager statue now
that we can like make granite stairs and

1080
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:34,540
that we can like make granite stairs and
 

1081
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,180
that we can like make granite stairs and
andesite stairs and all kinds of stuff

1082
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,190
andesite stairs and all kinds of stuff
 

1083
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:36,890
andesite stairs and all kinds of stuff
like that

1084
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:36,900
like that
 

1085
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,750
like that
so looking at the villagers obviously

1086
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:39,760
so looking at the villagers obviously
 

1087
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,270
so looking at the villagers obviously
the arms are a prominent feature the

1088
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:42,280
the arms are a prominent feature the
 

1089
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,440
the arms are a prominent feature the
feet are a little bit different so

1090
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:43,450
feet are a little bit different so
 

1091
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,880
feet are a little bit different so
that's why we we did them a little

1092
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:44,890
that's why we we did them a little
 

1093
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,310
that's why we we did them a little
difference and I guess we want the arms

1094
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:47,320
difference and I guess we want the arms
 

1095
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,080
difference and I guess we want the arms
to stick out

1096
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,090

 

1097
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,580

it'll probably take a little bit of

1098
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:53,590
it'll probably take a little bit of
 

1099
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,290
it'll probably take a little bit of
messing around to get this looking good

1100
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:55,300
messing around to get this looking good
 

1101
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,210
messing around to get this looking good
but we're just gonna do the rough shape

1102
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:57,220
but we're just gonna do the rough shape
 

1103
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,840
but we're just gonna do the rough shape
of it first and we're gonna try to do it

1104
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:00,850
of it first and we're gonna try to do it
 

1105
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,030
of it first and we're gonna try to do it
with a three by three head we're gonna

1106
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,040
with a three by three head we're gonna
 

1107
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,960
with a three by three head we're gonna
keep it pretty small and proportional

1108
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:06,970
keep it pretty small and proportional
 

1109
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,160
keep it pretty small and proportional
you know so it'll be probably something

1110
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,170
you know so it'll be probably something
 

1111
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:16,590
you know so it'll be probably something
like this 3 by 3 so 1 2 3 will kind of

1112
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:16,600
like this 3 by 3 so 1 2 3 will kind of
 

1113
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,290
like this 3 by 3 so 1 2 3 will kind of
just look at this as it is the big thing

1114
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:19,300
just look at this as it is the big thing
 

1115
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,400
just look at this as it is the big thing
though is we can make like granite

1116
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:20,410
though is we can make like granite
 

1117
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,280
though is we can make like granite
fences which is gonna be important for

1118
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,290
fences which is gonna be important for
 

1119
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:26,390
fences which is gonna be important for
the nose how are the proportions there

1120
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:26,400
the nose how are the proportions there
 

1121
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,130
the nose how are the proportions there
that's pretty close actually yeah we can

1122
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:32,140
that's pretty close actually yeah we can
 

1123
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,650
that's pretty close actually yeah we can
will you make that work okay so I got

1124
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:34,660
will you make that work okay so I got
 

1125
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,210
will you make that work okay so I got
the stuff together here for a

1126
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:36,220
the stuff together here for a
 

1127
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,950
the stuff together here for a
stonecutter that's one of the new

1128
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:37,960
stonecutter that's one of the new
 

1129
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,140
stonecutter that's one of the new
workstations and it's actually a very

1130
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,150
workstations and it's actually a very
 

1131
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,590
workstations and it's actually a very
useful machine that got added in this

1132
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:43,600
useful machine that got added in this
 

1133
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,420
useful machine that got added in this
update so let's let's get one of those

1134
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,430
update so let's let's get one of those
 

1135
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:52,050
update so let's let's get one of those
going no recipe we got no stone uh-oh I

1136
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:52,060
going no recipe we got no stone uh-oh I
 

1137
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,390
going no recipe we got no stone uh-oh I
think it's like this well we might need

1138
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:54,400
think it's like this well we might need
 

1139
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,170
think it's like this well we might need
stone like raw stone I wonder where we

1140
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:58,180
stone like raw stone I wonder where we
 

1141
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,930
stone like raw stone I wonder where we
can get some of that all right I think

1142
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:00,940
can get some of that all right I think
 

1143
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,440
can get some of that all right I think
this is three pieces oh you make it now

1144
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:04,450
this is three pieces oh you make it now
 

1145
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,000
this is three pieces oh you make it now
yeah there it is okay stone cutter

1146
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,010
yeah there it is okay stone cutter
 

1147
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,010
yeah there it is okay stone cutter
available so it's one iron and get three

1148
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:08,020
available so it's one iron and get three
 

1149
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,390
available so it's one iron and get three
stone and we lay that down it just looks

1150
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:12,400
stone and we lay that down it just looks
 

1151
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,220
stone and we lay that down it just looks
like a saw but I don't think it hurts

1152
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,230
like a saw but I don't think it hurts
 

1153
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,340
like a saw but I don't think it hurts
you know a little disappointing on that

1154
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:17,350
you know a little disappointing on that
 

1155
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,650
you know a little disappointing on that
front ah but this is really cool so we

1156
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:19,660
front ah but this is really cool so we
 

1157
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,960
front ah but this is really cool so we
can put stuff in here like our Granite's

1158
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:21,970
can put stuff in here like our Granite's
 

1159
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,710
can put stuff in here like our Granite's
and just like how outputs a single

1160
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:25,720
and just like how outputs a single
 

1161
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,110
and just like how outputs a single
single block so one piece turns into one

1162
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,120
single block so one piece turns into one
 

1163
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,480
single block so one piece turns into one
piece of wall and the great thing is

1164
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:30,490
piece of wall and the great thing is
 

1165
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:35,390
piece of wall and the great thing is
like normally stairs you need like six

1166
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:35,400
like normally stairs you need like six
 

1167
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,520
like normally stairs you need like six
and the site to make four stairs like if

1168
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:38,530
and the site to make four stairs like if
 

1169
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:42,030
and the site to make four stairs like if
you just craft them this way right you

1170
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,040
you just craft them this way right you
 

1171
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,340
you just craft them this way right you
only get four it takes six blocks but if

1172
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,350
only get four it takes six blocks but if
 

1173
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,870
only get four it takes six blocks but if
you use a stone cutter it's one to one

1174
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:45,880
you use a stone cutter it's one to one
 

1175
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,330
you use a stone cutter it's one to one
so you you save on materials which is

1176
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:48,340
so you you save on materials which is
 

1177
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,170
so you you save on materials which is
actually a pretty big deal there's a lot

1178
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:52,180
actually a pretty big deal there's a lot
 

1179
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,850
actually a pretty big deal there's a lot
of value in using this thing especially

1180
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:53,860
of value in using this thing especially
 

1181
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,120
of value in using this thing especially
if you're working on a big project so

1182
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,130
if you're working on a big project so
 

1183
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,160
if you're working on a big project so
I'll be cool I think we want a little

1184
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,170
I'll be cool I think we want a little
 

1185
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,880
I'll be cool I think we want a little
bit more detail on the feet or the shoes

so yeah let's soups add some detail here

1190
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:11,500
so yeah let's soups add some detail here
 

1191
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,060
so yeah let's soups add some detail here
something like that

1192
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,070
something like that
 

1193
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,910
something like that
uh-huh and now we got a we got a mess

around with rounding up the arms and
 

1197
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,140
around with rounding up the arms and
stuff and the main reason what we wanted

1198
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,150
stuff and the main reason what we wanted
 

1199
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,340
stuff and the main reason what we wanted
those three emeralds the two of them for

1200
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:24,350
those three emeralds the two of them for
 

1201
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,680
those three emeralds the two of them for
the eyes cuz villagers have green eyes

1202
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:26,690
the eyes cuz villagers have green eyes
 

1203
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,640
the eyes cuz villagers have green eyes
oh that looks freaky and they kind of

1204
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:30,650
oh that looks freaky and they kind of
 

1205
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,260
oh that looks freaky and they kind of
hold an emerald like in between their

1206
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:32,270
hold an emerald like in between their
 

1207
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,270
hold an emerald like in between their
their hands now so I wanted one over

1208
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:34,280
their hands now so I wanted one over
 

1209
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,480
their hands now so I wanted one over
there and I guess we'll probably put

1210
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:37,490
there and I guess we'll probably put
 

1211
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,480
there and I guess we'll probably put
like some more granite here for their

1212
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:39,490
like some more granite here for their
 

1213
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,000
like some more granite here for their
their actual hands you know I lowered it

1214
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,010
their actual hands you know I lowered it
 

1215
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:46,770
their actual hands you know I lowered it
by one cuz it looked a bit too tall and

1216
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:46,780
by one cuz it looked a bit too tall and
 

1217
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,320
by one cuz it looked a bit too tall and
we're just adding the details now to

1218
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:50,330
we're just adding the details now to
 

1219
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,490
we're just adding the details now to
really sell it so we're gonna try give

1220
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:54,500
really sell it so we're gonna try give
 

1221
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,820
really sell it so we're gonna try give
it a bit of a neck right I rounded out

1222
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:57,830
it a bit of a neck right I rounded out
 

1223
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,430
it a bit of a neck right I rounded out
like a an arm here and I think it looks

1224
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:00,440
like a an arm here and I think it looks
 

1225
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,920
like a an arm here and I think it looks
pretty good actually

1226
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:01,930
pretty good actually
 

1227
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,470
pretty good actually
okay we're gonna give them a coin purse

1228
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:05,480
okay we're gonna give them a coin purse
 

1229
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,290
okay we're gonna give them a coin purse
that's what the diamond block is for and

1230
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:08,300
that's what the diamond block is for and
 

1231
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,300
that's what the diamond block is for and
just for a little bit more texture on as

1232
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:10,310
just for a little bit more texture on as
 

1233
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,930
just for a little bit more texture on as
coats we will go for actually let's just

1234
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:13,940
coats we will go for actually let's just
 

1235
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,960
coats we will go for actually let's just
do raw andesite down the middle like

1236
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:16,970
do raw andesite down the middle like
 

1237
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,930
do raw andesite down the middle like
that how's it looking right now I think

1238
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:19,940
that how's it looking right now I think
 

1239
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,360
that how's it looking right now I think
we're pretty close here's the big thing

1240
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:22,370
we're pretty close here's the big thing
 

1241
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,300
we're pretty close here's the big thing
okay here's what here's a good idea

1242
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:24,310
okay here's what here's a good idea
 

1243
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,760
okay here's what here's a good idea
we're gonna put the fences for the nose

1244
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:27,770
we're gonna put the fences for the nose
 

1245
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:32,970
we're gonna put the fences for the nose
obviously and then get ready for this

1246
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:32,980
obviously and then get ready for this
 

1247
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,970
obviously and then get ready for this
daylight detectors for the eyebrows

1248
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:35,980
daylight detectors for the eyebrows
 

1249
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,620
daylight detectors for the eyebrows
perfect right I think that's I think

1250
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:38,630
perfect right I think that's I think
 

1251
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,020
perfect right I think that's I think
that's a really good idea okay let's

1252
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,030
that's a really good idea okay let's
 

1253
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,380
that's a really good idea okay let's
finish it up here or that will do

1254
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:43,390
finish it up here or that will do
 

1255
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,380
finish it up here or that will do
another arm so I think the arm is like

1256
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:47,390
another arm so I think the arm is like
 

1257
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:53,220
another arm so I think the arm is like
this and then we kind of curve this one

1258
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:53,230
this and then we kind of curve this one
 

1259
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,260
this and then we kind of curve this one
like so so it looks like it has a bit of

1260
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:56,270
like so so it looks like it has a bit of
 

1261
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,510
like so so it looks like it has a bit of
a bigger shoulder right and let's

1262
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:58,520
a bigger shoulder right and let's
 

1263
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,910
a bigger shoulder right and let's
actually get some slabs just for a

1264
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:00,920
actually get some slabs just for a
 

1265
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,720
actually get some slabs just for a
little bit more shape oh so you have two

1266
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:04,730
little bit more shape oh so you have two
 

1267
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,200
little bit more shape oh so you have two
slabs oh that's great yeah that works

1268
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,210
slabs oh that's great yeah that works
 

1269
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:08,950
slabs oh that's great yeah that works
out right

1270
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:08,960
out right
 

1271
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,960
out right
okay so put one slab there I think the

1272
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:13,970
okay so put one slab there I think the
 

1273
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,610
okay so put one slab there I think the
hands are maybe a little bit shaped word

1274
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:15,620
hands are maybe a little bit shaped word
 

1275
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,830
hands are maybe a little bit shaped word
but I think it'll be okay

1276
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:17,840
but I think it'll be okay
 

1277
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,360
but I think it'll be okay
I think we got it let's take a look at

1278
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:22,370
I think we got it let's take a look at
 

1279
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:26,620
I think we got it let's take a look at
our work here oh yeah yeah there we go

00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:41,840
just want one stare one little minor
 

1291
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,170
just want one stare one little minor
detail addition right over here let's

1292
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:47,180
detail addition right over here let's
 

1293
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,390
detail addition right over here let's
change this to a stare so it looks like

1294
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:49,400
change this to a stare so it looks like
 

1295
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:55,720
change this to a stare so it looks like
a v-neck okay how we're doing oh yeah

1296
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:55,730
a v-neck okay how we're doing oh yeah
 

1297
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,620
a v-neck okay how we're doing oh yeah
there we go

1298
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:56,630
there we go
 

1299
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:59,350
there we go
I have an idea for something else I

1300
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,360
I have an idea for something else I
 

1301
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,230
I have an idea for something else I
wanted to check out today too we'll just

1302
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:02,240
wanted to check out today too we'll just
 

1303
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,510
wanted to check out today too we'll just
do it real quick here if we can but

1304
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:04,520
do it real quick here if we can but
 

1305
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,320
do it real quick here if we can but
basically with observers and Budd

1306
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,330
basically with observers and Budd
 

1307
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,970
basically with observers and Budd
switches in general you're able to

1308
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:09,980
switches in general you're able to
 

1309
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,160
switches in general you're able to
detect when you someone goes to bed

1310
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,170
detect when you someone goes to bed
 

1311
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,570
detect when you someone goes to bed
right like if you hook it up to the bed

1312
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:15,580
right like if you hook it up to the bed
 

1313
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,550
right like if you hook it up to the bed
you got a detect oh not that way and not

1314
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:18,560
you got a detect oh not that way and not
 

1315
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,690
you got a detect oh not that way and not
that way this way yeah so check this out

1316
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:22,700
that way this way yeah so check this out
 

1317
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,570
that way this way yeah so check this out
when we go to bed plays the note block

1318
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:25,580
when we go to bed plays the note block
 

1319
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,490
when we go to bed plays the note block
when we wake up it plays a note block so

1320
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:27,500
when we wake up it plays a note block so
 

1321
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,630
when we wake up it plays a note block so
let's see if that works

1322
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:28,640
let's see if that works
 

1323
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,260
let's see if that works
on the villagers as well so hook the

1324
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:32,270
on the villagers as well so hook the
 

1325
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,980
on the villagers as well so hook the
observer up there and note block here

1326
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:34,990
observer up there and note block here
 

1327
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:40,180
observer up there and note block here
cool now let's go to bed not a lot of

1328
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,190
cool now let's go to bed not a lot of
 

1329
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,360
cool now let's go to bed not a lot of
room in here all right let's just do it

1330
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:43,370
room in here all right let's just do it
 

1331
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:49,380
room in here all right let's just do it
out here we should be able to hear it oh

1332
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:49,390

 

1333
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:53,800

it did work oh cool so that allows us to

1334
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:53,810
it did work oh cool so that allows us to
 

1335
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,420
it did work oh cool so that allows us to
check when a villager goes to bed at

1336
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:55,430
check when a villager goes to bed at
 

1337
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,920
check when a villager goes to bed at
nighttime when he wakes up cheering the

1338
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:56,930
nighttime when he wakes up cheering the
 

1339
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:00,460
nighttime when he wakes up cheering the
day which is kind of cool that unlocks a

1340
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:00,470
day which is kind of cool that unlocks a
 

1341
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,230
day which is kind of cool that unlocks a
couple new redstone e things we can do

1342
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,240
couple new redstone e things we can do
 

1343
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,390
couple new redstone e things we can do
like maybe when they go home at night

1344
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:04,400
like maybe when they go home at night
 

1345
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,190
like maybe when they go home at night
time they turn on the light on that

1346
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:06,200
time they turn on the light on that
 

1347
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,870
time they turn on the light on that
house and you can see clearly someone's

1348
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:07,880
house and you can see clearly someone's
 

1349
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,920
house and you can see clearly someone's
there you know or in our case here we're

1350
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:11,930
there you know or in our case here we're
 

1351
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,520
there you know or in our case here we're
gonna try have like a campfire indicator

1352
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:14,530
gonna try have like a campfire indicator
 

1353
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:19,900
gonna try have like a campfire indicator
so basically when they go to bed this

1354
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:19,910
so basically when they go to bed this
 

1355
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,030
so basically when they go to bed this
grass block will get retracted and when

1356
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:22,040
grass block will get retracted and when
 

1357
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,590
grass block will get retracted and when
they wake up it'll they'll go back in

1358
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:23,600
they wake up it'll they'll go back in
 

1359
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,670
they wake up it'll they'll go back in
place which means there will be smoke

1360
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:26,680
place which means there will be smoke
 

1361
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,170
place which means there will be smoke
when they're sleeping basically we

1362
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:29,180
when they're sleeping basically we
 

1363
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,150
when they're sleeping basically we
easily see

1364
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:31,160
easily see
 

1365
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,550
easily see
someone's at that house okay it's night

1366
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:33,560

1369
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,110
time are you gonna go to that house yep
went to bed at debated our piston thing

1370
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,120
went to bed at debated our piston thing
 

1371
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
went to bed at debated our piston thing
and tada

1372
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,130
and tada
 

1373
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,660
and tada
[Music]

1374
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:43,670
[Music]
 

1375
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,150
[Music]
so you can see the smoke from a long

1376
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:46,160
so you can see the smoke from a long
 

1377
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,370
so you can see the smoke from a long
distance - right so we can clearly see

1378
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:48,380
distance - right so we can clearly see
 

1379
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,360
distance - right so we can clearly see
somebody's in that that house and like

1380
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,370
somebody's in that that house and like
 

1381
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,770
somebody's in that that house and like
if you were to design the house you'd

1382
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:53,780
if you were to design the house you'd
 

1383
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,180
if you were to design the house you'd
probably like put a chimney in it or

1384
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:55,190
probably like put a chimney in it or
 

1385
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,620
probably like put a chimney in it or
something and you could you could have

1386
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:56,630
something and you could you could have
 

1387
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,240
something and you could you could have
like a smoke signal that activates at

1388
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,250
like a smoke signal that activates at
 

1389
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,680
like a smoke signal that activates at
nighttime I think that would be really

1390
00:33:59,680 --> 00:33:59,690
nighttime I think that would be really
 

1391
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,040
nighttime I think that would be really
cool you can see it all the way from

1392
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,050
cool you can see it all the way from
 

1393
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,450
cool you can see it all the way from
over here I put a hay bale under the

1394
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:04,460
over here I put a hay bale under the
 

1395
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,710
over here I put a hay bale under the
campfire so there's more smoke - aha so

1396
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:08,720
campfire so there's more smoke - aha so
 

1397
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,270
campfire so there's more smoke - aha so
you could put that in every single house

1398
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:10,280
you could put that in every single house
 

1399
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,169
you could put that in every single house
or you know noteblock things or maybe

1400
00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:14,179
or you know noteblock things or maybe
 

1401
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,240
or you know noteblock things or maybe
you have a counter hooked ups every bed

1402
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,250
you have a counter hooked ups every bed
 

1403
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,860
you have a counter hooked ups every bed
and every day it resets and then when

1404
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:17,870
and every day it resets and then when
 

1405
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:18,730
and every day it resets and then when
they go to bed

1406

00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,850
back home here because it's about time
to wrap up our episode so next episode

1422
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:39,860
to wrap up our episode so next episode
 

1423
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,830
to wrap up our episode so next episode
will probably actually get into building

1424
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:41,840
will probably actually get into building
 

1425
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,169
will probably actually get into building
some stuff on our basis getting a little

1426
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:44,179
some stuff on our basis getting a little
 

1427
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:47,139
some stuff on our basis getting a little
bit more technical with the updates and

1428
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:47,149
bit more technical with the updates and
 

1429
00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:49,149
bit more technical with the updates and
for sure we will probably play with TNT

1430
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:49,159
for sure we will probably play with TNT
 

1431
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,919
for sure we will probably play with TNT
a little bit next episode because if you

1432
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:50,929
a little bit next episode because if you
 

1433
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:55,210
a little bit next episode because if you
guys didn't see TNT actually drops all

1434
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:55,220
guys didn't see TNT actually drops all
 

1435
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,450
guys didn't see TNT actually drops all
the blocks out now which means you can

1436
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:58,460
the blocks out now which means you can
 

1437
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,760
the blocks out now which means you can
probably use it in a lot of farms a lot

1438
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:00,770
probably use it in a lot of farms a lot
 

1439
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,740
probably use it in a lot of farms a lot
of resource collecting I'm actually

1440
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:02,750
of resource collecting I'm actually
 

1441
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,480
of resource collecting I'm actually
really excited about that change

1442
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:04,490
really excited about that change
 

1443
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,180
really excited about that change
if you blast it again though like if you

1444
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:07,190
if you blast it again though like if you
 

1445
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,590
if you blast it again though like if you
have some blocks on the ground already

1446
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:08,600
have some blocks on the ground already
 

1447
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,990
have some blocks on the ground already
and you TNT those get destroyed

1448
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,000
and you TNT those get destroyed
 

1449
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,840
and you TNT those get destroyed
let's throw an ender pearl down what

1450
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:13,850
let's throw an ender pearl down what
 

1451
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,290
let's throw an ender pearl down what
kind

1452
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:14,300
kind
 

1453
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,940
kind
oh I'm close to TNT yeah so then an

1454
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:18,950
oh I'm close to TNT yeah so then an
 

1455
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,590
oh I'm close to TNT yeah so then an
ender pearl got blown to bits so you

1456
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:20,600
ender pearl got blown to bits so you
 

1457
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,240
ender pearl got blown to bits so you
kind of have to blast it once collect

1458
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,250
kind of have to blast it once collect
 

1459
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,970
kind of have to blast it once collect
its plastic and collected so it's not

1460
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:24,980
its plastic and collected so it's not
 

1461
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,970
its plastic and collected so it's not
like super easy to do but when I woke up

1462
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:27,980
like super easy to do but when I woke up
 

1463
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,470
like super easy to do but when I woke up
this morning like one of the main things

1464
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:29,480
this morning like one of the main things
 

1465
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,680
this morning like one of the main things
I just had to find out today first thing

1466
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:32,690
I just had to find out today first thing
 

1467
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,510
I just had to find out today first thing
on my mind was I wonder I wonder if you

1468
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:37,520
on my mind was I wonder I wonder if you
 

1469
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,690
on my mind was I wonder I wonder if you
can do like depth charges now and like

1470
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:40,700
can do like depth charges now and like
 

1471
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,480
can do like depth charges now and like
have the blocks float up in the water is

1472
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:43,490
have the blocks float up in the water is
 

1473
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,790
have the blocks float up in the water is
that is that a thing

1474
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:45,800
that is that a thing
 

1475
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,520
that is that a thing
because the sand lands where the TNT is

1476
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:48,530
because the sand lands where the TNT is
 

1477
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,490
because the sand lands where the TNT is
so it allows it to blow up underwater

1478
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:51,500
so it allows it to blow up underwater
 

1479
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,440
so it allows it to blow up underwater
and it looks like all the blocks kind of

1480
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:54,450
and it looks like all the blocks kind of
 

1481
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:57,099
and it looks like all the blocks kind of
float don't they

1482
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:57,109
float don't they
 

1483
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:00,170
float don't they
very slowly though that's the only thing

1484
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:00,180
very slowly though that's the only thing
 

1485
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,170
very slowly though that's the only thing
that was pretty slow there's still some

1486
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:03,180
that was pretty slow there's still some
 

1487
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,120
that was pretty slow there's still some
down there that aren't gonna float -

1488
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,130
down there that aren't gonna float -
 

1489
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,080
down there that aren't gonna float -
mm-hmm cuz I was thinking you could just

1490
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,090
mm-hmm cuz I was thinking you could just
 

1491
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,150
mm-hmm cuz I was thinking you could just
keep blasting over and over with depth

1492
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,160
keep blasting over and over with depth
 

1493
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,580
keep blasting over and over with depth
charges and actually mine resources that

1494
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:13,590
charges and actually mine resources that
 

1495
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,589
charges and actually mine resources that
way but it's probably not the best

1496
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:17,599
way but it's probably not the best
 

1497
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,030
way but it's probably not the best
because those ones on the surface I

1498
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,040
because those ones on the surface I
 

1499
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,060
because those ones on the surface I
think would be okay yeah didn't get

1500
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,070
think would be okay yeah didn't get
 

1501
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:26,930
think would be okay yeah didn't get
blown up oh and the second blast

1502
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:26,940
blown up oh and the second blast
 

1503
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,510
blown up oh and the second blast
nothing really floated not too many not

1504
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,520
nothing really floated not too many not
 

1505
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,260
nothing really floated not too many not
to me blocks loaded up that time okay

1506
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:33,270
to me blocks loaded up that time okay
 

1507
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,420
to me blocks loaded up that time okay
I was curious I thought we would try it

1508
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:35,430
I was curious I thought we would try it
 

1509
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:41,510
I was curious I thought we would try it
out yeah most of them are staying under

1510
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:41,520
out yeah most of them are staying under
 

1511
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,950
out yeah most of them are staying under
under the water here because it's kind

1512
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:42,960
under the water here because it's kind
 

1513
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,470
under the water here because it's kind
of downward turns anyways let's do the

1514
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:45,480
of downward turns anyways let's do the
 

1515
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,880
of downward turns anyways let's do the
common the day I picked the short and

1516
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:46,890
common the day I picked the short and
 

1517
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,339
common the day I picked the short and
sweet one it says etho why don't you use

1518
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:49,349
sweet one it says etho why don't you use
 

1519
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:52,730
sweet one it says etho why don't you use
shaders in your LPS I might have

1520
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:52,740
shaders in your LPS I might have
 

1521
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,440
shaders in your LPS I might have
answered this one in the past I can't

1522
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:54,450
answered this one in the past I can't
 

1523
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:59,150
answered this one in the past I can't
remember but main for most reason a lot

1524
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,160
remember but main for most reason a lot
 

1525
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,000
remember but main for most reason a lot
of you guys don't like shaders so if I

1526
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,010
of you guys don't like shaders so if I
 

1527
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,430
of you guys don't like shaders so if I
use shaders in the series automatically

1528
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:04,440
use shaders in the series automatically
 

1529
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,780
use shaders in the series automatically
a lot of you guys just tune out and you

1530
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:05,790
a lot of you guys just tune out and you
 

1531
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,040
a lot of you guys just tune out and you
don't want to watch it gives you

1532
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,050
don't want to watch it gives you
 

1533
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,700
don't want to watch it gives you
headaches or whatever reasons you have

1534
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:09,710
headaches or whatever reasons you have
 

1535
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,200
headaches or whatever reasons you have
it's just it's not a good thing it

1536
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,210
it's just it's not a good thing it
 

1537
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,060
it's just it's not a good thing it
doesn't add much benefit some of you

1538
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,070
doesn't add much benefit some of you
 

1539
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,320
doesn't add much benefit some of you
guys might like the series a little bit

1540
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,330
guys might like the series a little bit
 

1541
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,270
guys might like the series a little bit
more with the shaders but then a lot of

1542
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:17,280
more with the shaders but then a lot of
 

1543
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,250
more with the shaders but then a lot of
people does this tune out entirely

1544
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:19,260
people does this tune out entirely
 

1545
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,220
people does this tune out entirely
so overall generally not a good idea to

1546
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:22,230
so overall generally not a good idea to
 

1547
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,900
so overall generally not a good idea to
use shaders when you're making an LP

1548
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:23,910
use shaders when you're making an LP
 

1549
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,970
use shaders when you're making an LP
series because you alienate a lot of the

1550
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:25,980
series because you alienate a lot of the
 

1551
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,910
series because you alienate a lot of the
viewership second main reason though is

1552
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:28,920
viewership second main reason though is
 

1553
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,770
viewership second main reason though is
like let's say we were to do it in our

1554
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:30,780
like let's say we were to do it in our
 

1555
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,890
like let's say we were to do it in our
vanilla series here you have to install

1556
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:33,900
vanilla series here you have to install
 

1557
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,109
vanilla series here you have to install
Forge so you'd have to wait for a new

1558
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:36,119
Forge so you'd have to wait for a new
 

1559
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,839
Forge so you'd have to wait for a new
forge update to come out for like 114

1560
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:38,849
forge update to come out for like 114
 

1561
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:40,790
forge update to come out for like 114
before you can even think about doing

1562
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:40,800
before you can even think about doing
 

1563
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,460
before you can even think about doing
the shaders so we would have to wait a

1564
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:43,470
the shaders so we would have to wait a
 

1565
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,070
the shaders so we would have to wait a
long time probably a month or two at

1566
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,080
long time probably a month or two at
 

1567
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,160
long time probably a month or two at
least whenever a new update comes out so

1568
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,170
least whenever a new update comes out so
 

1569
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,349
least whenever a new update comes out so
that wouldn't be good and the third main

1570
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:51,359
that wouldn't be good and the third main
 

1571
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,329
that wouldn't be good and the third main
reason though is like it takes a lot of

1572
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:53,339
reason though is like it takes a lot of
 

1573
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,550
reason though is like it takes a lot of
computer power to run shaders which

1574
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:55,560
computer power to run shaders which
 

1575
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,010
computer power to run shaders which
means my fan needs to run hard all the

1576
