kind of what I did in my sheep farm you

60
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:48,600
kind of what I did in my sheep farm you
 

61
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,980
kind of what I did in my sheep farm you
know how I hit the pistons in the in the

62
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:51,990
know how I hit the pistons in the in the
 

63
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,960
know how I hit the pistons in the in the
roof in it or in the ceiling and it

64
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:53,970
roof in it or in the ceiling and it
 

65
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,389
roof in it or in the ceiling and it
matches the wooden plank texture well

66
00:01:59,389 --> 00:01:59,399
matches the wooden plank texture well
 

67
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,190
matches the wooden plank texture well
somebody suggested I should just do

68
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
somebody suggested I should just do
 

69
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,610
somebody suggested I should just do
something like this

70
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:04,620

 

71
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,999

isn't that cool I would think that's a

72
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:09,009
isn't that cool I would think that's a
 

73
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,210
isn't that cool I would think that's a
great idea so you still get the lighting

74
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:12,220
great idea so you still get the lighting
 

75
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,260
great idea so you still get the lighting
because light passes through Pistons

76
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:15,270
because light passes through Pistons
 

77
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,450
because light passes through Pistons
wrong way wrong way you can use pumpkins

don't use glowstone although the Pistons

84
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,090
don't use glowstone although the Pistons
 

85
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,220
don't use glowstone although the Pistons
are a bit expensive but yeah I think

86
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,230
are a bit expensive but yeah I think

are a bit expensive but yeah I think
that's I'm gonna use this a lot I think

88
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160

 

89
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,240

99
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,960
white mixed in and yeah
just a really good idea so I'll switch

100
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:54,970

the middle and you know how I said I was
 

163
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,210
the middle and you know how I said I was
going to put lights at the top the

164
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:46,220
going to put lights at the top the
 

165
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,659
going to put lights at the top the
problem is like in the ceiling here

166
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:49,669
problem is like in the ceiling here
 

167
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:53,140
problem is like in the ceiling here
problem is light level fifteen there

168
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,150
problem is light level fifteen there
 

169
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,860
problem is light level fifteen there
fourteen thirteen twelve eleven ten by

170
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:56,870
fourteen thirteen twelve eleven ten by
 

171
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,270
fourteen thirteen twelve eleven ten by
the time it makes the grass that's

172
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,280
the time it makes the grass that's
 

173
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,310
the time it makes the grass that's
already a ten so you're not going to get

174
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
already a ten so you're not going to get
 

175
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,680
already a ten so you're not going to get
much light from the ceiling on the

176
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:02,690
much light from the ceiling on the
 

177
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,740
much light from the ceiling on the
ground because it's so high up and even

178
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:05,750
ground because it's so high up and even
 

179
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:14,050
ground because it's so high up and even
less if you do it here um put three over

180
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,060
less if you do it here um put three over
 

181
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,969
less if you do it here um put three over
here that looks pretty good but yeah

182
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:18,979
here that looks pretty good but yeah
 

183
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:19,930
here that looks pretty good but yeah

until 1.3 anyway I'm just wondering why

190
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:35,599
until 1.3 anyway I'm just wondering why
 

191
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:42,760

how I left that last time one thing we
 

195
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,750
how I left that last time one thing we
haven't finished yet though that we've

196
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:49,760
haven't finished yet though that we've
 

197
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,629
haven't finished yet though that we've
spent a lot of time on is the silverfish

198
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
spent a lot of time on is the silverfish
 

199
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,240
spent a lot of time on is the silverfish
farms so let's go work on that today and

200
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,250
farms so let's go work on that today and
 

201
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,150
farms so let's go work on that today and
hopefully put an end to that long

202
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
hopefully put an end to that long
 

203
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,050
hopefully put an end to that long

are we're at the stronghold this is
 

207
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,650
are we're at the stronghold this is
where silverfish farm is and also our

213
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,800
future storage room is going to go so
our dog likes to hang out and randomly

214
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:19,810
our dog likes to hang out and randomly

our dog likes to hang out and randomly
teleport to us I did a bunch of caving

216
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,370
teleport to us I did a bunch of caving
 

217
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,050
teleport to us I did a bunch of caving
around here the other day and seems to

218
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,060
around here the other day and seems to
 

219
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,399
around here the other day and seems to
be working a little bit quicker the mob

220
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:27,409
be working a little bit quicker the mob
 

221
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:28,679
be working a little bit quicker the mob

all I'm going to make that a focus try

224
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:31,239
all I'm going to make that a focus try
 

225
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:32,999
all I'm going to make that a focus try
to do more and more caving around here

226
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:33,009
to do more and more caving around here
 

227
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:39,529
to do more and more caving around here
so that we can get it peaked out maximum

228
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:39,539
so that we can get it peaked out maximum
 

229
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,559
so that we can get it peaked out maximum
maximum efficiency so there's only a few

230
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:43,569
maximum efficiency so there's only a few
 

231
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,239
maximum efficiency so there's only a few
loose ends left with this thing let's

232
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:45,249
loose ends left with this thing let's
 

233
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:49,999
loose ends left with this thing let's
grab some glass one thing we need to do

234
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:50,009
grab some glass one thing we need to do
 

235
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,889
grab some glass one thing we need to do
is seal it and I did work at that

236
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:54,899
is seal it and I did work at that
 

237
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:57,779
is seal it and I did work at that
because remember last time when we were

238
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:57,789
because remember last time when we were
 

239
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:00,629
because remember last time when we were
here we had that disaster the silverfish

240
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
here we had that disaster the silverfish
 

241
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,659
here we had that disaster the silverfish
got out and they made a mess of

242
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:03,669
got out and they made a mess of
 

243
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:08,429
got out and they made a mess of
everything they owe and they they killed

244
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:08,439
everything they owe and they they killed
 

245
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:13,529
everything they owe and they they killed
me many times a while it's a disaster

246
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:13,539
me many times a while it's a disaster
 

247
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,859
me many times a while it's a disaster
look at look at what they did and almost

248
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:16,869
look at look at what they did and almost
 

249
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,129
look at look at what they did and almost
caught it on fire all went wrong so we

250
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:20,139
caught it on fire all went wrong so we
 

251
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,749
caught it on fire all went wrong so we
need to seal it so that never happens

252
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
need to seal it so that never happens
 

253
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,889
need to seal it so that never happens
again it's like a radioactive power

254
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:25,899
again it's like a radioactive power
 

255
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,399
again it's like a radioactive power
plant that can have a leak at any time

256
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:29,409
plant that can have a leak at any time
 

257
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:33,959
plant that can have a leak at any time
we need to make sure it's it's safe as

258
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:33,969
we need to make sure it's it's safe as
 

259
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,059
we need to make sure it's it's safe as
far as I know I got it almost all sealed

260
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:36,069
far as I know I got it almost all sealed
 

261
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:39,299
far as I know I got it almost all sealed
there was one spot over here we'll just

262
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:39,309
there was one spot over here we'll just
 

263
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:42,540
there was one spot over here we'll just
plug up with this I think I was still

264
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:42,550
plug up with this I think I was still
 

265
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,399
plug up with this I think I was still
deciding what to do what we'll do we'll

266
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:44,409
deciding what to do what we'll do we'll
 

267
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:47,399
deciding what to do what we'll do we'll
do glass for now anyway I also did this

268
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:47,409
do glass for now anyway I also did this
 

269
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:48,659
do glass for now anyway I also did this
wiring I don't know if I ever showed

270
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:48,669
wiring I don't know if I ever showed
 

271
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,269
wiring I don't know if I ever showed
this but I cleaned up cleaned up over

272
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:51,279
this but I cleaned up cleaned up over
 

273
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,079
this but I cleaned up cleaned up over
here quite a bit looks a lot better this

274
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,089
here quite a bit looks a lot better this
 

275
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,479
here quite a bit looks a lot better this
is for the snowman controls to turn them

276
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:57,489
is for the snowman controls to turn them
 

277
00:07:57,489 --> 00:08:01,669
is for the snowman controls to turn them
on and off which is not fully done yet

278
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:01,679
on and off which is not fully done yet
 

279
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:04,709
on and off which is not fully done yet
this is not sealed either it's a good

280
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:04,719
this is not sealed either it's a good
 

281
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:12,770
this is not sealed either it's a good
thing we went around check in here

282
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:12,780

 

283
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,810

just put glass for now thing is I'm

284
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:17,820
just put glass for now thing is I'm
 

285
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,190
just put glass for now thing is I'm
trying to make it look good but at the

286
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,200
trying to make it look good but at the
 

287
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,980
trying to make it look good but at the
same time there's a limit to how much

288
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:21,990
same time there's a limit to how much
 

289
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,250
same time there's a limit to how much
you can do with that so the only big

290
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:25,260
you can do with that so the only big
 

291
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,730
you can do with that so the only big
leak left I believe is behind the

292
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:28,740
leak left I believe is behind the
 

293
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,770
leak left I believe is behind the
snowman so what we'll do we'll put put

294
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:35,780
snowman so what we'll do we'll put put
 

295
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,300
snowman so what we'll do we'll put put
dark planks behind them and see how that

296
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,310
dark planks behind them and see how that
 

297
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,459
dark planks behind them and see how that
looks and leave that there until we

298
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:40,469
looks and leave that there until we
 

299
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,170
looks and leave that there until we
decide on something else

300
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:42,180
decide on something else
 

301
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,860
decide on something else
I was also trying to figure out what to

302
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:45,870
I was also trying to figure out what to
 

303
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,990
I was also trying to figure out what to
put behind these little open half slab

304
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
put behind these little open half slab
 

305
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,810
put behind these little open half slab
areas I put white wool there but I don't

306
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:50,820
areas I put white wool there but I don't
 

307
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,520
areas I put white wool there but I don't
like that well we should figure

308
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:52,530
like that well we should figure
 

309
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,760
like that well we should figure
something out for that too and the idea

310
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:55,770
something out for that too and the idea
 

311
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,680
something out for that too and the idea
is the silverfish fall down they all

312
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:57,690
is the silverfish fall down they all
 

313
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,930
is the silverfish fall down they all
funnel to the spot will have a killing

314
00:08:59,930 --> 00:08:59,940
funnel to the spot will have a killing
 

315
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,170
funnel to the spot will have a killing
chamber we're going to have to change

316
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:03,180
chamber we're going to have to change
 

317
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:09,920
chamber we're going to have to change
this so we'll have maybe two dispensers

318
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:09,930
this so we'll have maybe two dispensers
 

319
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,970
this so we'll have maybe two dispensers
on this side these will be for poison

320
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:13,980
on this side these will be for poison
 

321
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,250
on this side these will be for poison
potions so when they're all in here we

322
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:16,260
potions so when they're all in here we
 

323
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,960
potions so when they're all in here we
push a button they get poisoned down to

324
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:17,970
push a button they get poisoned down to
 

325
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,920
push a button they get poisoned down to
one or two half a hearts then we throw

326
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:21,930
one or two half a hearts then we throw
 

327
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,960
one or two half a hearts then we throw
us damage potion at them and we get all

328
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:23,970
us damage potion at them and we get all
 

329
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:30,920
us damage potion at them and we get all
XP or or we'll also have a front display

330
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:30,930
XP or or we'll also have a front display
 

331
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,940
XP or or we'll also have a front display
so we can see them and we'll have a door

332
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:34,950
so we can see them and we'll have a door
 

333
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:41,060
so we can see them and we'll have a door
maybe over here you know what I'm going

334
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,070
maybe over here you know what I'm going
 

335
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,829
maybe over here you know what I'm going
to make this come out one more block at

336
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:42,839
to make this come out one more block at
 

337
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,920
to make this come out one more block at
least get a little space away from this

338
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:45,930
least get a little space away from this
 

339
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,820
least get a little space away from this
this room

340
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:46,830
this room
 

341
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,480
this room
oops we'll have a door here that will

342
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,490
oops we'll have a door here that will
 

343
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,740
oops we'll have a door here that will
terraeum this way and then up to the

344
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:54,750
terraeum this way and then up to the
 

345
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,450
terraeum this way and then up to the
surface because we want a way of getting

346
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:56,460
surface because we want a way of getting
 

347
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,100
surface because we want a way of getting
them out of here too so we'll have the

348
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,110
them out of here too so we'll have the
 

349
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,320
them out of here too so we'll have the
option of either killing them there or

350
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,330
option of either killing them there or
 

351
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,010
option of either killing them there or
transporting them out too to the top of

352
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,020
transporting them out too to the top of
 

353
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,410
transporting them out too to the top of
the world I just harvested a bunch of

354
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:09,420
the world I just harvested a bunch of
 

355
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,540
the world I just harvested a bunch of
the pine wood here in this forest

356
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:11,550
the pine wood here in this forest
 

357
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,579
the pine wood here in this forest
waiting for the leaves to the spawn

358
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:13,589
waiting for the leaves to the spawn
 

359
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:16,460
waiting for the leaves to the spawn
there's a nice one right next to the

360
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:16,470
there's a nice one right next to the
 

361
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,450
there's a nice one right next to the
stronghold over there so we got our wood

362
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:20,460
stronghold over there so we got our wood
 

363
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,850
stronghold over there so we got our wood
for behind the snowmen let's head on

364
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:22,860
for behind the snowmen let's head on
 

365
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,260
for behind the snowmen let's head on
down there and

366
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,270
down there and
 

367
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,610
down there and
to see how it looks all right let's see

368
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:28,620
to see how it looks all right let's see
 

369
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,130
to see how it looks all right let's see
how this looks I also thought about

370
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,140
how this looks I also thought about
 

371
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,420
how this looks I also thought about
using Blackwell something that you don't

372
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:35,430
using Blackwell something that you don't
 

373
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,020
using Blackwell something that you don't
really focus on darker colors are better

374
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,030
really focus on darker colors are better
 

375
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:44,090
really focus on darker colors are better
it I would say and also the marble color

376
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:44,100
it I would say and also the marble color
 

377
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,610
it I would say and also the marble color
in this this room is mostly the white

378
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:46,620
in this this room is mostly the white
 

379
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,180
in this this room is mostly the white
color so having a little extra dark will

380
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,190
color so having a little extra dark will
 

381
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:58,160
color so having a little extra dark will
help bounce out the look the wiring is

382
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,170
help bounce out the look the wiring is
 

383
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:04,700
help bounce out the look the wiring is
right above there okay this is

384
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:04,710
right above there okay this is
 

385
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:12,380
right above there okay this is
difference not needed okay let's see

386
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:12,390
difference not needed okay let's see
 

387
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:19,870
difference not needed okay let's see
let's take a look out how it's going

388
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:19,880

 

389
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:28,270

such a mess down here

390
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:28,280

 

391
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,230

hmm yeah I don't know it almost seems a

392
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,240
hmm yeah I don't know it almost seems a
 

393
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,760
hmm yeah I don't know it almost seems a
little plain to me well I'll do the

394
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:37,770
little plain to me well I'll do the
 

395
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,900
little plain to me well I'll do the
whole thing if we want to change it

396
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:38,910
whole thing if we want to change it
 

397
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,600
whole thing if we want to change it
later we can it's easy too if you got

398
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:41,610
later we can it's easy too if you got
 

399
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,770
later we can it's easy too if you got
ideas let me know black will might be

400
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:45,780
ideas let me know black will might be
 

401
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:53,030
ideas let me know black will might be
better but it's I'm not sure I've kind

402
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
better but it's I'm not sure I've kind
 

403
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,560
better but it's I'm not sure I've kind
of hit the point where I just want this

404
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:54,570
of hit the point where I just want this
 

405
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,420
of hit the point where I just want this
thing up and working you know get it

406
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:56,430
thing up and working you know get it
 

407
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,600
thing up and working you know get it
functioning and if we want to perfect it

408
00:11:59,600 --> 00:11:59,610
functioning and if we want to perfect it
 

409
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,090
functioning and if we want to perfect it
later we can but let's just get it going

410
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:02,100
later we can but let's just get it going
 

411
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,550
later we can but let's just get it going
you know so I've actually had that

412
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
you know so I've actually had that
 

413
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,730
you know so I've actually had that
silverfish farm show off for of at least

414
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:07,740
silverfish farm show off for of at least
 

415
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,610
silverfish farm show off for of at least
a month now maybe two months and I could

416
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:10,620
a month now maybe two months and I could
 

417
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,430
a month now maybe two months and I could
be getting XP from it and doing other

418
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
be getting XP from it and doing other
 

419
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,300
be getting XP from it and doing other
things if it was up and running but I've

420
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:17,310
things if it was up and running but I've
 

421
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,570
things if it was up and running but I've
just been dragging my feet about it

422
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:20,580
just been dragging my feet about it
 

423
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,340
just been dragging my feet about it

424
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:22,350
there's we got a few projects like that
 

425

433
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,120

yeah you know what's looking weird is

434
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,130
yeah you know what's looking weird is
 

435
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,660
yeah you know what's looking weird is
these dark dark patches and from the

436
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:43,670
these dark dark patches and from the
 

437
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,040
these dark dark patches and from the
stairs there maybe I should just replace

438
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,050
stairs there maybe I should just replace
 

439
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:51,910
stairs there maybe I should just replace
those with full planks that's what's

440
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:51,920
those with full planks that's what's
 

441
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,350
those with full planks that's what's
making it look weird now I'll try that

442
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:56,360
making it look weird now I'll try that
 

443
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,630
making it look weird now I'll try that
let's see how that looks mm-hmm so that

444
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:01,640
let's see how that looks mm-hmm so that
 

445
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,250
let's see how that looks mm-hmm so that
seems to have done the trick it looks a

446
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:03,260
seems to have done the trick it looks a
 

447
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,639
seems to have done the trick it looks a
lot more fluent now a lot more normal

448
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:08,649
lot more fluent now a lot more normal
 

449
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:11,680
lot more fluent now a lot more normal
stairs they we're having that lighting

450
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:11,690
stairs they we're having that lighting
 

451
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,690

glitch where they appear darker than
 

453
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,139
glitch where they appear darker than
they should which is a glitch I I take

454
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:17,149
they should which is a glitch I I take
 

455
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:19,389
they should which is a glitch I I take
advantage of the times like in the mini

456
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:19,399
advantage of the times like in the mini
 

457
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,829
advantage of the times like in the mini
storage room I use that for an aesthetic

458
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:23,839
storage room I use that for an aesthetic
 

459
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,769

look but at other times like this it's

460
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:26,779
look but at other times like this it's
 

461
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:30,730

this and this and this and this and try

470
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:43,699
this and this and this and this and try
 

471
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:56,380
this and this and this and this and try
full blocks

472
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:56,390

 

473
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,290

hmm yeah I don't know

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:00,300
hmm yeah I don't know
 

475
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:07,760
hmm yeah I don't know
let's try get a couple of these what

476
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:07,770
let's try get a couple of these what
 

477
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:18,310
let's try get a couple of these what
happens if we change this make it square

this little window area with our weird
stair placements I was thinking we'll

500
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:11,850
stair placements I was thinking we'll
 

501
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,890
stair placements I was thinking we'll
try like do the dark wood in this corner

521
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,699
know don't know too many choices that's
I like building things with function

522
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:04,709
I like building things with function
 

523
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:06,049
I like building things with function
because there's always a right and a

524
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:06,059
because there's always a right and a
 

525
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:06,919
because there's always a right and a
wrong choice

526

wrong choice
 

527
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:08,809
wrong choice
but when you do go for things with a

528
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:08,819
but when you do go for things with a
 

529
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:12,919
but when you do go for things with a
look it's open to anybody's

530
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:12,929
look it's open to anybody's
 

531
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:21,469
look it's open to anybody's
interpretation yeah I like that

532
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:21,479
interpretation yeah I like that
 

533
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:27,879
interpretation yeah I like that

534
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:27,889
we'll do that there we go that is done
 

535
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:31,009

00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:31,019
this middle kind of messed it messed up
 

537
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,509
this middle kind of messed it messed up
the pattern a bit so we have dark there

538
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:34,519
the pattern a bit so we have dark there
 

539
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,679
the pattern a bit so we have dark there
but it works out okay

540
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:36,689
but it works out okay
 

541
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:41,710

that's where the that's where the
 

549
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,329
that's where the that's where the
silverfish blocks come from yeah it

550
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:56,339
silverfish blocks come from yeah it
 

551
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,489
silverfish blocks come from yeah it
should be good now this is the only way

552
00:16:58,489 --> 00:16:58,499
should be good now this is the only way
 

553
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:00,579
should be good now this is the only way

00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:00,589
they're going to get out through here
 

555
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:02,749
they're going to get out through here
you're going to fall into the killing

556
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:02,759
you're going to fall into the killing
 

557
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:09,879
you're going to fall into the killing
chamber which we want to move one block

558
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:09,889

 

559
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:24,679

let's move these right here

560
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:24,689

 

561
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:29,820

with the dispensers down so they should

562
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:29,830
with the dispensers down so they should
 

563
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,669
with the dispensers down so they should
naturally fall into this little holding

564
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:32,679
naturally fall into this little holding
 

565
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,580
naturally fall into this little holding
area and if they don't they can also

566
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:37,590
area and if they don't they can also
 

567
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,320
area and if they don't they can also
track me through the wall like

568
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,330
track me through the wall like
 

569
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,100
track me through the wall like
silverfish can see through walls up to

570
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,110
silverfish can see through walls up to
 

571
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,480
silverfish can see through walls up to
about eight blocks or so I don't know

572
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:45,490
about eight blocks or so I don't know
 

573
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:51,810
about eight blocks or so I don't know
the exact number that drop them down

574
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:51,820
the exact number that drop them down
 

575
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,919
the exact number that drop them down
I have glass I kind of want to use iron

576
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:55,929
I have glass I kind of want to use iron
 

577
00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:02,639

bars but Oh ding familiar problem is
 

579
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,950
bars but Oh ding familiar problem is
back I'm going to I'm going to move this

580
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
back I'm going to I'm going to move this
 

581
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,440
back I'm going to I'm going to move this
lava a weight a little bit of ways a

582
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,450
lava a weight a little bit of ways a
 

583
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,649
lava a weight a little bit of ways a
little ways away from here

584
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:12,659
little ways away from here
 

585
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:19,019
little ways away from here
so we don't have any problems that's

586
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:19,029
so we don't have any problems that's
 

587
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:19,769
so we don't have any problems that's
much better

588
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:19,779
much better
 

589
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:22,320
much better
now we have some room to work here to

590
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,330
now we have some room to work here to
 

591
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,570
now we have some room to work here to
move to breathe let's get back to it the

592
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:27,580
move to breathe let's get back to it the
 

593
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,580
move to breathe let's get back to it the
point of having two dispensers here is

594
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:29,590
point of having two dispensers here is
 

595
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,409
point of having two dispensers here is
just so we don't have to refill them as

596
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:31,419
just so we don't have to refill them as
 

597
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:36,690
just so we don't have to refill them as
often and it's going to take a while to

598
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:36,700
often and it's going to take a while to
 

599
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,720
often and it's going to take a while to
clean up all the mess around here but I

600
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:39,730
clean up all the mess around here but I
 

601
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,760
clean up all the mess around here but I
I do intend to not today obviously but

602
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:44,770
I do intend to not today obviously but
 

603
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:51,090
I do intend to not today obviously but
sometime so do something like that I

604
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:51,100
sometime so do something like that I
 

605
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,880
sometime so do something like that I
will do the bottom they'll do the top I

606
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:53,890
will do the bottom they'll do the top I
 

607
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:59,850
will do the bottom they'll do the top I
have poison potions in these alright and

608
00:18:59,850 --> 00:18:59,860
have poison potions in these alright and
 

609
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:05,220
have poison potions in these alright and
then we're going to put just one piston

610
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,230
then we're going to put just one piston
 

611
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:11,970
then we're going to put just one piston
here is all we all we really need and do

612
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:11,980
here is all we all we really need and do
 

613
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,990
here is all we all we really need and do
that and let's just put a lever down so

614
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
that and let's just put a lever down so
 

615
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,539
that and let's just put a lever down so
we can control it so that'll be our gate

616
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:21,549
we can control it so that'll be our gate
 

617
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:25,710
we can control it so that'll be our gate
for sending them to the surface of

618
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:25,720
for sending them to the surface of
 

619
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,080
for sending them to the surface of
course they we want to escort them to

620
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,090
course they we want to escort them to
 

621
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,970
course they we want to escort them to
the surface we don't want to just send

622
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:29,980
the surface we don't want to just send
 

623
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,080
the surface we don't want to just send
them on their own otherwise we'll

624
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,090
them on their own otherwise we'll
 

625
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,970
them on their own otherwise we'll
probably D spawn on their way we have to

626
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:32,980
probably D spawn on their way we have to
 

627
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,870
probably D spawn on their way we have to
be within the 32 block range that rule

628
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
be within the 32 block range that rule
 

629
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,340
be within the 32 block range that rule
still applies even

630
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:38,350
still applies even
 

631
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,560
still applies even
silverfish and let's say go into a block

632
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:43,570
silverfish and let's say go into a block
 

633
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:58,630
silverfish and let's say go into a block
then it doesn't matter but okay

634
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640

 

635
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,370

I'll be tweaking this fissure afterwards

636
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:01,380
I'll be tweaking this fissure afterwards
 

637
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,940
I'll be tweaking this fissure afterwards
too just want to get the shape and

638
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:04,950
too just want to get the shape and
 

639
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:12,740
too just want to get the shape and
everything figured out and maybe we'll

640
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:12,750
everything figured out and maybe we'll
 

641
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:23,960
everything figured out and maybe we'll
do a test run today to order okay that's

642
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:23,970
do a test run today to order okay that's
 

643
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,909
do a test run today to order okay that's
our holding area open it and close it

644
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:27,919
our holding area open it and close it
 

645
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:37,220
our holding area open it and close it
and then what I want to do is want to

646
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,230
and then what I want to do is want to
 

647
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,190
and then what I want to do is want to
lead them into a three-wide tunnel at

648
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,200
lead them into a three-wide tunnel at
 

649
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,320
lead them into a three-wide tunnel at
least because there's going to be a lot

650
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,330
least because there's going to be a lot
 

651
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,020
least because there's going to be a lot
of silverfish and they're going to be

652
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,030
of silverfish and they're going to be
 

653
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:50,690
of silverfish and they're going to be
tracking me so to keep them all group

654
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:50,700
tracking me so to keep them all group
 

655
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,270
tracking me so to keep them all group
together to keep them following me we

656
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
together to keep them following me we
 

657
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,010
together to keep them following me we
need to give them us enough space to

658
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:55,020
need to give them us enough space to
 

659
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,510
need to give them us enough space to
move around so let's make it three wide

660
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:58,520
move around so let's make it three wide
 

661
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,750
move around so let's make it three wide
instead of like just one wide you know

662
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:01,760
instead of like just one wide you know
 

663
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,240
instead of like just one wide you know
otherwise they will bottleneck and jam

664
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,250
otherwise they will bottleneck and jam
 

665
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:19,039
otherwise they will bottleneck and jam
and mmm all out of those yeah and what

666
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:19,049
and mmm all out of those yeah and what
 

667
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:21,140
and mmm all out of those yeah and what
we'll do is we'll just lead them this

668
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,150
we'll do is we'll just lead them this
 

669
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,899
we'll do is we'll just lead them this
way without moving them up for a ways

670
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:23,909
way without moving them up for a ways
 

671
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,880
way without moving them up for a ways
just so that they don't interfere with

672
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:25,890
just so that they don't interfere with
 

673
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,549
just so that they don't interfere with
the storage room in the future because

674
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
the storage room in the future because
 

675
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,730
the storage room in the future because
it if they're like we got to make them

676
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:31,740
it if they're like we got to make them
 

677
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,669
it if they're like we got to make them
go up to the surface and if we do that

678
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:34,679
go up to the surface and if we do that
 

679
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,630
go up to the surface and if we do that
too close to the storage room they will

680
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
too close to the storage room they will
 

681
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,700
too close to the storage room they will
the two projects will get in the way of

682
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:40,710
the two projects will get in the way of
 

683
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:50,390
the two projects will get in the way of
each other right on okay oh I gotta go

to bed here so we'll continue this part

686
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:53,850
to bed here so we'll continue this part
 

687
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,500
to bed here so we'll continue this part
of it next time I would like to do a

688
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:57,510
of it next time I would like to do a
 

689
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:03,890
of it next time I would like to do a
killing a killing test today though if

690
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:03,900
killing a killing test today though if
 

691
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,169
killing a killing test today though if
we can there's a few silverfish left in

692
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:06,179
we can there's a few silverfish left in
 

693
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,480
we can there's a few silverfish left in
that room

694
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:09,490

 

695
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,050

how should we do this I know what I'll

696
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,060
how should we do this I know what I'll
 

697
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:19,120
how should we do this I know what I'll
do I'll just take that out put that in

698
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,130
do I'll just take that out put that in
 

699

go so well last time this is these are
 

705
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,830
go so well last time this is these are
all the silverfish left from last

706
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
all the silverfish left from last
 

707
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:40,500
all the silverfish left from last
disaster so let's get rid of them all

708
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:40,510

 

709
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,130

no matter shooting oh that one guys is

no matter shooting oh that one guys is
 

711
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:58,390
no matter shooting oh that one guys is
up let's get them out okay as long as

712
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
up let's get them out okay as long as
 

713
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,680
up let's get them out okay as long as
they're not jumping they don't damage

714
00:22:59,680 --> 00:22:59,690
they're not jumping they don't damage
 

715
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:10,600
they're not jumping they don't damage
you is that other stuntman shooting you

716
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:10,610
you is that other stuntman shooting you
 

717
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:19,830
you is that other stuntman shooting you
with that okay and it's probably a good

718
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:19,840
with that okay and it's probably a good
 

719
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:28,710
with that okay and it's probably a good
two or three hundred left they're easily

720
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720

 

721
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:36,910

lilia mom man oh no more coming out okay

lilia mom man oh no more coming out okay
 

723
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,450
lilia mom man oh no more coming out okay
I guess that's the cutoff point their

724
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:42,460

 

725
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,960

plan for this I plan for it come on come

729
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:01,280

how how did they get out come on gotta

730
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,290
how how did they get out come on gotta
 

731
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:05,890
how how did they get out come on gotta
be kidding

732
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:05,900

 

733
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,770

whistles - there's still a few running

734
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:09,780
whistles - there's still a few running
 

735
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,870
whistles - there's still a few running
around there if you're mad at the

736
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:11,880
around there if you're mad at the
 

737
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:19,940
around there if you're mad at the
Stoneman 100 should we try to get that

738
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:19,950
Stoneman 100 should we try to get that
 

739
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:26,540
Stoneman 100 should we try to get that
rest up - it looks like some silver fish

740
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:26,550
rest up - it looks like some silver fish
 

741
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,490
rest up - it looks like some silver fish
were left over down there that got out

742
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:28,500
were left over down there that got out
 

743
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:34,730
were left over down there that got out
and now we have lapis flowing again did

744
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:34,740
and now we have lapis flowing again did
 

745
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:49,330
and now we have lapis flowing again did
I tell you and we will put this no not

746
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:49,340

 

747
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:57,950

this gets dangerous still need to figure

748
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:57,960
this gets dangerous still need to figure
 

749
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,540
this gets dangerous still need to figure
out a way of doing this top part a

750
00:24:59,540 --> 00:24:59,550
out a way of doing this top part a
 

751
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:07,520
out a way of doing this top part a
little bit better dang it

752
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:07,530
little bit better dang it
 

753
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:22,350
little bit better dang it
there goes all the silver fish hmm

754
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:22,360

 

755
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,640

yeah I'm not sure what to do this isn't

756
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:24,650
yeah I'm not sure what to do this isn't
 

757
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,750
yeah I'm not sure what to do this isn't
working out too well they can't get up

758
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:28,760
working out too well they can't get up
 

759
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,550
working out too well they can't get up
here right oh you know what those two

760
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:33,560
here right oh you know what those two
 

761
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,990
here right oh you know what those two
that were there they probably were

762
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,000
that were there they probably were
 

763
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,720
that were there they probably were
outside and they came from like over

764
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:37,730
outside and they came from like over
 

765
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,550
outside and they came from like over
here was loud was flowing now let's

766
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:42,560
here was loud was flowing now let's
 

767
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,100
here was loud was flowing now let's
cover it up just in case don't want any

768
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,110
cover it up just in case don't want any
 

769

771
00:25:52,570 --> 00:26:00,060

let's try out the poison very good

772
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,070
let's try out the poison very good
 

773
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:09,210
let's try out the poison very good
and then 77 okay

774
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:09,220
and then 77 okay
 

775
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:18,799
and then 77 okay
team is really legend got them all

776
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:18,809
team is really legend got them all
 

777
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:27,060
team is really legend got them all
awesome alright so next time we'll

778
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,070
awesome alright so next time we'll
 

779
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,419
awesome alright so next time we'll
finish most of this up I'm pretty sure

780
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:30,429
finish most of this up I'm pretty sure
 

781
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:36,419
finish most of this up I'm pretty sure
and should be pretty cool when it's all

782
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:36,429
and should be pretty cool when it's all
 

783
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:38,669
and should be pretty cool when it's all
done I'll have to think about ways of

784
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:38,679
done I'll have to think about ways of
 

785
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:40,320
done I'll have to think about ways of
getting the top three layers of

786
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,330
getting the top three layers of
 

787
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,110
getting the top three layers of
silverfish down because way it is right

788
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,120
silverfish down because way it is right
 

789
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,250
silverfish down because way it is right
now isn't working too well but it

790
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:47,260
now isn't working too well but it
 

791
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,840
now isn't working too well but it
shouldn't be that difficult to figure

792
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:48,850
shouldn't be that difficult to figure
 

793
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:57,149
shouldn't be that difficult to figure
out a couple XP orbs got stuck are they

794
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:57,159
out a couple XP orbs got stuck are they
 

795
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:05,430
out a couple XP orbs got stuck are they
coming from mm there's a lot of XP orbs

796
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
coming from mm there's a lot of XP orbs
 

797
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,719
coming from mm there's a lot of XP orbs
