dispensers the inner ring is gonna be
 

27
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,310
dispensers the inner ring is gonna be
for items that don't really have a block

28
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:09,320
for items that don't really have a block

block like cobblestone is and so I
 

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,280
block like cobblestone is and so I
figured I'm going to need to make

that's 2026 this kind of big this is
 

79
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:21,250
that's 2026 this kind of big this is
gonna be a big storage room

80
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:21,260

 

81
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:38,650

oh yeah I should count this we need 24

82
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:38,660
oh yeah I should count this we need 24
 

83
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,930
oh yeah I should count this we need 24
wood blocks here 1 2 3

84
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:40,940
wood blocks here 1 2 3
 

85
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:52,350
wood blocks here 1 2 3
23 24 holy this is huge

86
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:52,360

 

87
00:04:52,360 --> 00:05:08,470

hmm maybe two huge 24 and then two for

88
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:08,480
hmm maybe two huge 24 and then two for
 

89
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:30,160
hmm maybe two huge 24 and then two for
the corner

90
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,170

 

91
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:47,720

and I don't know about this now that's

92
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:47,730
and I don't know about this now that's
 

93
00:05:47,730 --> 00:06:02,980
and I don't know about this now that's
way too big I'm gonna redo this do-over

94
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:02,990

 

95
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,430

okay so I had it kind of figured out

96
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
okay so I had it kind of figured out
 

97
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,490
okay so I had it kind of figured out
mathematically on paper but when you

98
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:10,500
mathematically on paper but when you
 

99
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,030
mathematically on paper but when you
actually see it it doesn't look good so

100
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,040

 

101
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:22,310

the plan is to make it look good or

102
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:22,320
the plan is to make it look good or
 

103
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,510
the plan is to make it look good or
better at least

104
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,520

 

105
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,760

and so I'm gonna make the inside a lot

106
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:31,770
and so I'm gonna make the inside a lot
 

107
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:58,370
and so I'm gonna make the inside a lot
smaller got to fill in this hole I put

108
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:58,380
smaller got to fill in this hole I put
 

109
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,370
smaller got to fill in this hole I put
it towards here for now so that's one

110
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:04,380
it towards here for now so that's one
 

111
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:14,870
it towards here for now so that's one
side and I'm sure wish it was a baked

112
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
side and I'm sure wish it was a baked
 

113
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,760
side and I'm sure wish it was a baked
item

114
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:16,770
item
 

115
00:07:16,770 --> 00:08:00,860
item
I kind of want this to end here 14 plus

116
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:00,870
I kind of want this to end here 14 plus
 

117
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:10,630
I kind of want this to end here 14 plus
4 is 18 as that compared to this side

118
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:10,640

kinda match these buttons gets a
dispenser and each of these dispensers

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,010
dispenser and each of these dispensers
 

153
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:43,980

00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,070
pads I have oats hooked up and so with
 

327
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,430
pads I have oats hooked up and so with
no delay it's one note block and then

328
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
no delay it's one note block and then
 

329
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,350
no delay it's one note block and then
with the two redstone delay for ticks

330
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:30,360
with the two redstone delay for ticks
 

331
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,909
with the two redstone delay for ticks
it hits the next one and so what I had

332
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:37,919
it hits the next one and so what I had
 

333
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:45,740
it hits the next one and so what I had
figured is I apparently boats move at

334
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:45,750
figured is I apparently boats move at
 

335
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,490
figured is I apparently boats move at
the same speed as mine carts boats on

336
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:49,500
the same speed as mine carts boats on
 

337
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,279
the same speed as mine carts boats on
that eats Road a lot of people said that

338
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:52,289
that eats Road a lot of people said that
 

339
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:55,010
that eats Road a lot of people said that
mine carts move at eight blocks per

340
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:55,020
mine carts move at eight blocks per
 

341
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:02,090
mine carts move at eight blocks per
second and so it would take about half a

342
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,100
second and so it would take about half a
 

343
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,710
second and so it would take about half a
second to move from this pressure plate

344
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:03,720
second to move from this pressure plate
 

345
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:11,430
second to move from this pressure plate
to

346
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440

 

347
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,879

- this one so that would be half a

348
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:15,889
- this one so that would be half a
 

349
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:24,279
- this one so that would be half a
second so if we had a temple of one

350
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:24,289
second so if we had a temple of one
 

351
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:29,049
second so if we had a temple of one
second I'm not very good at musical

352
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:29,059
second I'm not very good at musical
 

353
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:33,310
second I'm not very good at musical
theory but let's say this counted as one

354
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:33,320
theory but let's say this counted as one
 

355
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,180

bar going from here to here going over

356
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,190
bar going from here to here going over
 

357
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,970
bar going from here to here going over
to pressure plates that's eight blocks

358
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:39,980
to pressure plates that's eight blocks
 

359
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,080
to pressure plates that's eight blocks
one second this in between one would be

360
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,090
one second this in between one would be
 

361
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,460
one second this in between one would be
half a second and a lot of people say

362
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:48,470
half a second and a lot of people say
 

363
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,859
half a second and a lot of people say
that there's 16 ticks per second in this

364
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:53,869
that there's 16 ticks per second in this
 

365
00:21:53,869 --> 00:22:00,970
that there's 16 ticks per second in this
game so that's current passing through 8

366
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:00,980
game so that's current passing through 8
 

367
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,810
game so that's current passing through 8
torches would be 1 second current

368
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:04,820
torches would be 1 second current
 

369
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,119
torches would be 1 second current
passing through 4 torches will be half a

370
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:07,129
passing through 4 torches will be half a
 

371
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:12,249
passing through 4 torches will be half a
second or the time to go from here to

372
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:12,259
second or the time to go from here to
 

373
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:15,580
second or the time to go from here to
here if in fact minecarts moved at 8

374
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:15,590
here if in fact minecarts moved at 8
 

375
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:21,519
here if in fact minecarts moved at 8
blocks per second and going through two

376
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:21,529
blocks per second and going through two
 

377
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:27,849
blocks per second and going through two
torches would be 1/4 second so that's

378
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:27,859
torches would be 1/4 second so that's
 

379
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:37,000
torches would be 1/4 second so that's
why I have have it like this

380
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,010

so like going to this first one would be

384
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:45,600
so like going to this first one would be
 

385
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,440
so like going to this first one would be
like if the note was on the bar at the

386
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:48,450
like if the note was on the bar at the
 

387
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,479
like if the note was on the bar at the
start of the bar this would be like a

388
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:50,489
start of the bar this would be like a
 

389
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:54,919
start of the bar this would be like a
quarter moving up a pressure plate would

390
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:54,929
quarter moving up a pressure plate would
 

391
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:57,889
quarter moving up a pressure plate would
be a half and then passing through two

392
00:22:57,889 --> 00:22:57,899
be a half and then passing through two
 

393
00:22:57,899 --> 00:22:59,539
be a half and then passing through two
two more torches would be a three

394
00:22:59,539 --> 00:22:59,549
two more torches would be a three
 

395
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:04,609
two more torches would be a three
quarter if in fact all those numbers

396
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:04,619
quarter if in fact all those numbers
 

397
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:10,220

were accurate but if you go over them

yeah so did you hear that it didn't

yeah so did you hear that it didn't
 

411
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:52,159
yeah so did you hear that it didn't
sound to me like the oops I accidentally

412
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:52,169
sound to me like the oops I accidentally
 

413
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:54,739

pressed right it didn't sound like the

pressed right it didn't sound like the
 

415
00:23:54,749 --> 00:24:03,730
pressed right it didn't sound like the
temple was even there like it should be

all those so six notes got played they
 

421
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:10,399
all those so six notes got played they
should all be evenly spaced from each

should all be evenly spaced from each
 

423
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:22,720

00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,370

yeah if there there was 16 picks in a

give me your ideas on this what should I

452
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:19,490
do
 

453
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,430
