00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,950
I don't know if I want to film it but
that's what I'm doing right now I'm

going to start a new sand mine thing
 

17
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,810

here the last one I was working on is

18
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:32,820
here the last one I was working on is
 

19
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,470
here the last one I was working on is
pretty much empty and I could there is

20
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
pretty much empty and I could there is
 

21
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,240
pretty much empty and I could there is
more desert around there but it's I

22
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,250
more desert around there but it's I
 

23
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,950
more desert around there but it's I
really shouldn't have been digging

24
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:39,960
really shouldn't have been digging
 

25
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,209
really shouldn't have been digging
around there because it's nearer that

26
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:41,219
around there because it's nearer that
 

27
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,020
around there because it's nearer that
cave I should I picked the spot now

28
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,030
cave I should I picked the spot now
 

29
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,610
cave I should I picked the spot now
that's a little bit further away so I

30
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:46,620
that's a little bit further away so I
 

31
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,010
that's a little bit further away so I
can scar the landscape without worrying

32
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,020
can scar the landscape without worrying
 

33
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,189
can scar the landscape without worrying
as much about about the beauty of the

34
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:52,199
as much about about the beauty of the
 

35
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,770
as much about about the beauty of the
surrounding area and there's lots of

36
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:54,780
surrounding area and there's lots of
 

37
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,560
surrounding area and there's lots of
sand around here so it should last me

38
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:56,570
sand around here so it should last me
 

39
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,869
sand around here so it should last me
hopefully forever so this is my new a

40
00:00:59,869 --> 00:00:59,879
hopefully forever so this is my new a
 

41
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,920
hopefully forever so this is my new a
new sand line starting right here and

42
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:03,930
new sand line starting right here and
 

43
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,950
new sand line starting right here and
I'll probably cut out that direction

44
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960

 

45
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,090

well it didn't take me too long and I

46
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,100
well it didn't take me too long and I
 

47
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,160
well it didn't take me too long and I
already got a huge chunk cut out of the

48
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,170
already got a huge chunk cut out of the
 

49
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,190
already got a huge chunk cut out of the
land got quite a bit of stuff from it

50
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:18,200
land got quite a bit of stuff from it
 

51
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,510
land got quite a bit of stuff from it
just have a chest here I've been filling

52
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:20,520
just have a chest here I've been filling
 

53
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,370
just have a chest here I've been filling
so that's what I got from cutting that

54
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:22,380
so that's what I got from cutting that
 

55
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,149
so that's what I got from cutting that
out and yes I do know you can make

56
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
out and yes I do know you can make
 

57
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,920
out and yes I do know you can make
sandstone from sand a lot of people have

58
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:27,930
sandstone from sand a lot of people have
 

59
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,030
sandstone from sand a lot of people have
been commenting on that so should last

60
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,040
been commenting on that so should last
 

61
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:44,450
been commenting on that so should last
me a while again I got one two three so

62
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:44,460
me a while again I got one two three so
 

63
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,490
me a while again I got one two three so
hard to tell the difference between

64
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:45,500
hard to tell the difference between
 

65
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,560
hard to tell the difference between
sandstone and sand well there's another

66
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:48,570
sandstone and sand well there's another
 

67
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,499
sandstone and sand well there's another
one oh yeah there's quite a bit like all

68
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:54,509
one oh yeah there's quite a bit like all
 

69
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,880
one oh yeah there's quite a bit like all
that sandstone for that that's pretty

70
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:55,890
that sandstone for that that's pretty
 

71
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,240
that sandstone for that that's pretty
good

72
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,250
good
 

73
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,030
good
and I may convert some of this to it I

74
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
and I may convert some of this to it I
 

75
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,130
and I may convert some of this to it I
don't like doing it because it's a

76
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,140
don't like doing it because it's a
 

77
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,780
don't like doing it because it's a
little bit wasteful but at the same time

78
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:02,790
little bit wasteful but at the same time
 

79
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,270
little bit wasteful but at the same time
I don't have gunpowder to make TNT

80
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
I don't have gunpowder to make TNT
 

81
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,429
I don't have gunpowder to make TNT
anyway so there's nothing else I'd

82
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
anyway so there's nothing else I'd
 

83
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,490
anyway so there's nothing else I'd
really use it for except glass

84
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:11,500

 

85
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,010

so with that sandstone is able to finish

86
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,020
so with that sandstone is able to finish
 

87
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,320
so with that sandstone is able to finish
another section of the tree farm and

88
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,330
another section of the tree farm and
 

89
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,760
another section of the tree farm and
we'll probably go through that at the

90
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:17,770
we'll probably go through that at the
 

91
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,370
we'll probably go through that at the
end of the episode but right now I think

92
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:20,380
end of the episode but right now I think
 

93
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,490
end of the episode but right now I think
I may go do some caving gets more ironed

94
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:22,500
I may go do some caving gets more ironed
 

95
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,850
I may go do some caving gets more ironed
so I'm very very very little on iron and

96
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:26,860
so I'm very very very little on iron and
 

97
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,100
so I'm very very very little on iron and
I might try to put the other montage of

98
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,110
I might try to put the other montage of
 

99
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,550
I might try to put the other montage of
it so I think I'm going to go caving in

100
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:31,560
it so I think I'm going to go caving in
 

101
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,140
it so I think I'm going to go caving in

clean up this area a little bit this is

208
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
clean up this area a little bit this is
 

209
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,730

stored so I think I'm going to try
 

215
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,819

convert this into more of a room instead

216
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:10,829
convert this into more of a room instead
 

217
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:13,370
convert this into more of a room instead
of being like open on the sides here the

218
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:13,380
of being like open on the sides here the
 

219
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,490
of being like open on the sides here the
cave system next to it I want to convert

220
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:16,500
cave system next to it I want to convert
 

221
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,850
cave system next to it I want to convert
it more to an actual room with a door

222
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:18,860
it more to an actual room with a door
 

223
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,759
it more to an actual room with a door
and an exterior and all that so for the

224
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:22,769
and an exterior and all that so for the
 

225
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:25,040
and an exterior and all that so for the
door I think I'm going to put its like

226
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,050
door I think I'm going to put its like
 

227
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,240
door I think I'm going to put its like
over here doesn't doesn't do matter

228
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,250
over here doesn't doesn't do matter
 

229
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,699
over here doesn't doesn't do matter
where it goes because no matter where it

230
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:31,709
where it goes because no matter where it
 

231
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:34,610
where it goes because no matter where it
is I'll have to still jump around over

232
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:34,620
is I'll have to still jump around over
 

233
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,990
is I'll have to still jump around over
the water streams and stuff to get

234
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
the water streams and stuff to get
 

235
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,329
the water streams and stuff to get
around in here so main thing is that it

236
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:38,339
around in here so main thing is that it
 

237
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,999
around in here so main thing is that it
looks good on the outside and we have

238
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:41,009
looks good on the outside and we have
 

239
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:44,090
looks good on the outside and we have
wire over here so I don't exactly want

240
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:44,100
wire over here so I don't exactly want
 

241
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,610
wire over here so I don't exactly want
to Center the door on the center of the

242
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:46,620
to Center the door on the center of the
 

243
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,340
to Center the door on the center of the
room because the wires in the way so I

244
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:52,350
room because the wires in the way so I
 

245
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,769
room because the wires in the way so I
think what I'll do we'll try extend this

246
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:57,779
think what I'll do we'll try extend this
 

247
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,889
think what I'll do we'll try extend this
path so I try to keep it symmetrical

248
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:00,899
path so I try to keep it symmetrical
 

249
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:05,230
path so I try to keep it symmetrical
ish and still conform with the terrain

250
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,240
ish and still conform with the terrain
 

251
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,059
ish and still conform with the terrain
that's so one of the goals I have with

252
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:08,069
that's so one of the goals I have with
 

253
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:10,220
that's so one of the goals I have with
this whole cave area that it kind of

254
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,230
this whole cave area that it kind of
 

255
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,809
this whole cave area that it kind of
goes with the terrain so places where it

256
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:11,819
goes with the terrain so places where it
 

257
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:14,329
goes with the terrain so places where it
goes up like this is where our place is

258
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:14,339
goes up like this is where our place is
 

259
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:14,730
goes up like this is where our place is
that

260
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:14,740
that
 

261
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,370
that
to naturally went up even though I might

262
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:17,380
to naturally went up even though I might
 

263
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,990
to naturally went up even though I might
have smoothed it out a little bit more

264
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,000
have smoothed it out a little bit more
 

265
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,389
have smoothed it out a little bit more
and same with here this is a place where

266
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:21,399
and same with here this is a place where
 

267
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:26,670
and same with here this is a place where
it went down a bit so over here I'm

268
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:26,680
it went down a bit so over here I'm
 

269
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,269
it went down a bit so over here I'm
going to make it go up probably won't be

270
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:30,279
going to make it go up probably won't be
 

271
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,320
going to make it go up probably won't be
quite as steep but just to keep this the

272
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,330
quite as steep but just to keep this the
 

273
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:42,840
quite as steep but just to keep this the
natural shape more so and I was thinking

274
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:42,850
natural shape more so and I was thinking
 

275
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:49,820
natural shape more so and I was thinking
I might do like a 3x3 grass area here I

276
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:49,830

 

277
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,870

kind of looked this over before I

278
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:51,880
kind of looked this over before I
 

279
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,970
kind of looked this over before I
started this and it seems we can have a

280
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:56,980
started this and it seems we can have a
 

281
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,940
started this and it seems we can have a
cool effect here so have a 3x3 there

282
00:12:59,940 --> 00:12:59,950
cool effect here so have a 3x3 there
 

283
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:05,670
cool effect here so have a 3x3 there
that gives us one two three this will be

284
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
that gives us one two three this will be
 

285
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,670
that gives us one two three this will be
the fourth block this would be the fifth

286
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:08,680
the fourth block this would be the fifth
 

287
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,050
the fourth block this would be the fifth
so if the fourth block is where we need

288
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:13,060
so if the fourth block is where we need
 

289
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,370
so if the fourth block is where we need
it centered so I think I'm just going to

290
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:17,380
it centered so I think I'm just going to
 

291
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:24,000
it centered so I think I'm just going to
put some wood here like that and some

292
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,010
put some wood here like that and some
 

293
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:30,449
put some wood here like that and some
more stairs like so and then we can

294
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:30,459
more stairs like so and then we can
 

295
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:35,670
more stairs like so and then we can
probably do another 3x3 thing here and I

296
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
probably do another 3x3 thing here and I
 

297
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,130
probably do another 3x3 thing here and I
think that will work out good for going

298
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,140
think that will work out good for going
 

299
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,940
think that will work out good for going
up to the door

300
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:38,950
up to the door
 

301
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:50,220
up to the door
I hope cardioid till this cave is like

302
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:50,230
I hope cardioid till this cave is like
 

303
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,560
I hope cardioid till this cave is like
all done it's gonna look gonna look

304

doesn't matter if it's day or night the
 

317
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:08,760

00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:16,710
when I used to record I would always
it'd be like a minute before sunset and

324
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
it'd be like a minute before sunset and
 

325
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,850
it'd be like a minute before sunset and
it's like I would have to wait that

326
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:17,860
it's like I would have to wait that
 

327
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,650
it's like I would have to wait that
minute out before I started recording it

328
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:19,660
minute out before I started recording it
 

329
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,980
minute out before I started recording it
was really annoying that kind of thing

330
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:22,990
was really annoying that kind of thing
 

331
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,780
was really annoying that kind of thing
doesn't bother you when you play

332
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:24,790
doesn't bother you when you play
 

333
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,300
doesn't bother you when you play
normally but when you're recording

334
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:27,310
normally but when you're recording
 

335
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:34,060
normally but when you're recording
it becomes an issue okay and I'm going

336
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,070
it becomes an issue okay and I'm going
 

337
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,740
it becomes an issue okay and I'm going
to make this go up I guess because it

338
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:35,750
to make this go up I guess because it
 

339
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:42,699
to make this go up I guess because it
goes up naturally and I don't know if

340
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:42,709
goes up naturally and I don't know if
 

341
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,050
goes up naturally and I don't know if
I'm going to do another 3x3 it might

342
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,060
I'm going to do another 3x3 it might
 

343
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:50,410
I'm going to do another 3x3 it might
look really checkered t if I do that I

344
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:50,420
look really checkered t if I do that I
 

345
00:14:50,420 --> 00:15:01,060
look really checkered t if I do that I
go up one two three blocks yet shouldn't

346
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,070
go up one two three blocks yet shouldn't
 

347
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,670
go up one two three blocks yet shouldn't
maybe did a staircase that start to say

348
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
maybe did a staircase that start to say
 

349
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,740
maybe did a staircase that start to say
I don't want it to be going up when it

350
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:08,750
I don't want it to be going up when it
 

351
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,680
I don't want it to be going up when it
comes to the door I want it to be flat

352
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:11,690
comes to the door I want it to be flat
 

353
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:19,630
comes to the door I want it to be flat
ground at the top here okay and the

354
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:19,640
ground at the top here okay and the
 

355
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,300
ground at the top here okay and the
doors probably not be over like over

356
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,310
doors probably not be over like over
 

357
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:27,280
doors probably not be over like over
here whoop this pitch is too good this

358
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,290
here whoop this pitch is too good this
 

359
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,699
here whoop this pitch is too good this
is try to points in a dug to block so

360
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:29,709
is try to points in a dug to block so
 

361
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,960
is try to points in a dug to block so
yeah the door probably shouldn't be here

362
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:31,970
yeah the door probably shouldn't be here
 

363
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,250
yeah the door probably shouldn't be here
because the wires will probably get in

364
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:33,260
because the wires will probably get in
 

365
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,720
because the wires will probably get in
the way here so I'm going to move it

366
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:34,730
the way here so I'm going to move it
 

367
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,069
the way here so I'm going to move it
maybe over here or over here just back a

368
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:39,079
maybe over here or over here just back a
 

369
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:44,680
maybe over here or over here just back a
little bit and there should be at least

370
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:44,690
little bit and there should be at least
 

371
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,800
little bit and there should be at least
three blocks of flat space so I'm going

372
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:47,810
three blocks of flat space so I'm going
 

373
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,569
three blocks of flat space so I'm going
to tinker with it a bit off-camera and

374
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:49,579
to tinker with it a bit off-camera and
 

375
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:50,380
to tinker with it a bit off-camera and
we'll see how it goes

376
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:50,390
we'll see how it goes
 

377
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:55,569
we'll see how it goes
oops so the way I've been doing this

378
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:55,579
oops so the way I've been doing this
 

379
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,000
oops so the way I've been doing this
incline is not going to work its way too

380
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,010
incline is not going to work its way too
 

381
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:03,040
incline is not going to work its way too
gradual it's about two blocks to low

382
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,050
gradual it's about two blocks to low
 

383
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,260
gradual it's about two blocks to low
where I would like it to be when it gets

384
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:05,270
where I would like it to be when it gets
 

385
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,840
where I would like it to be when it gets
the end and it doesn't look all that

386
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:07,850
the end and it doesn't look all that
 

387
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,710
the end and it doesn't look all that
great so I will be adjusting this and I

388
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:11,720
great so I will be adjusting this and I
 

389
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,180
great so I will be adjusting this and I
was using stairs before I should be

390
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,190
was using stairs before I should be
 

391
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,730
was using stairs before I should be
using half slabs the nice nice thing

392
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:15,740
using half slabs the nice nice thing
 

393
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,829
using half slabs the nice nice thing
about using half slabs is you can sprint

394
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
about using half slabs is you can sprint
 

395
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,780
about using half slabs is you can sprint
up it without your sprint failing on you

396
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:21,790
up it without your sprint failing on you
 

397
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:27,610
up it without your sprint failing on you
but if you use a stair which is kind of

398
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:27,620
but if you use a stair which is kind of
 

399
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,590
but if you use a stair which is kind of
the reason why trying to avoid a steep

400
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
the reason why trying to avoid a steep
 

401
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,530
the reason why trying to avoid a steep
staircase or something is because you

402
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:32,540
staircase or something is because you
 

403
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,949
staircase or something is because you
can't run over it without your sprint

404
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:35,959
can't run over it without your sprint
 

405
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:41,410
can't run over it without your sprint
stopping so I'll try something else here

406
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:41,420
stopping so I'll try something else here
 

407
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,450
stopping so I'll try something else here
so I changed this up again and I'm

408
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:44,460
so I changed this up again and I'm
 

409
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,860
so I changed this up again and I'm
lighting this a lot more let me know

410
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:45,870
lighting this a lot more let me know
 

411
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,740
lighting this a lot more let me know
your opinion no it's a gradual staircase

412
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:50,750
your opinion no it's a gradual staircase
 

413
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,600
your opinion no it's a gradual staircase
you can run up it without your sprint

414
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:53,610
you can run up it without your sprint
 

415
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,390
you can run up it without your sprint
giving out and then it there's a break

416
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:56,400
giving out and then it there's a break
 

417
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,200
giving out and then it there's a break
in it over here this will be grass and

418
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,210
in it over here this will be grass and
 

419
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:04,160
in it over here this will be grass and
you have the other section over here the

420
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,170
you have the other section over here the
 

421
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,560
you have the other section over here the
door will be somewhere over here I'm

422
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:06,570
door will be somewhere over here I'm
 

423
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,620
door will be somewhere over here I'm
guessing so when you get to the top you

424
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:09,630
guessing so when you get to the top you
 

425
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,850
guessing so when you get to the top you
have a nice view of it it's not like

426
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:10,860
have a nice view of it it's not like
 

427
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,980
have a nice view of it it's not like
it's right in your face when you get up

428
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:12,990
it's right in your face when you get up
 

429
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,770
it's right in your face when you get up
like like if it was right over here that

430
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:15,780
like like if it was right over here that
 

431
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,949
like like if it was right over here that
would that would kind of suck so I think

432
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
would that would kind of suck so I think
 

433
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,650
would that would kind of suck so I think
that'll work out okay um let me know

434
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:24,660
that'll work out okay um let me know
 

435
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,680
that'll work out okay um let me know
what you think oh I've been getting

436
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:27,690
what you think oh I've been getting
 

437
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,270
what you think oh I've been getting
terrible frame rates today I don't know

438
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
terrible frame rates today I don't know
 

439
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,940
terrible frame rates today I don't know
why I should do a reboot probably anyway

440
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:34,950
why I should do a reboot probably anyway
 

441
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,720
why I should do a reboot probably anyway
I'll also probably rip this wall out so

442
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:38,730
I'll also probably rip this wall out so
 

443
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,070
I'll also probably rip this wall out so
we can have it more open in here and if

444
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,080
we can have it more open in here and if
 

445
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,190
we can have it more open in here and if
I do that we'll kind of have like a nice

446
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
I do that we'll kind of have like a nice
 

447
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,790
I do that we'll kind of have like a nice
upper section over where I'm standing

448
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:49,800
upper section over where I'm standing
 

449
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,640
upper section over where I'm standing
that kind of does a half circle or a

450
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:52,650
that kind of does a half circle or a
 

451
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,170
that kind of does a half circle or a
quarter circle shape which is cool might

452
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:57,180
quarter circle shape which is cool might
 

453
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,470
quarter circle shape which is cool might
be able to do something nice with that

454
00:17:59,470 --> 00:17:59,480
be able to do something nice with that
 

455
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:06,770
be able to do something nice with that
and I'll probably do wood on the sides

456
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:06,780
and I'll probably do wood on the sides
 

457
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,500
and I'll probably do wood on the sides
like I did with other stairs

458
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,510

 

459
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,910

these are spaced a little differently

460
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:13,920
these are spaced a little differently
 

461
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,650
these are spaced a little differently
though so it's not going to be exactly

462
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:15,660
though so it's not going to be exactly
 

463
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,260
though so it's not going to be exactly
the same actually you know what I would

464
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,270
the same actually you know what I would
 

465
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,740
the same actually you know what I would
maybe like to do here is a wooden pillar

466
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:23,750
maybe like to do here is a wooden pillar
 

467
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,920
maybe like to do here is a wooden pillar
with lighting in the middle maybe a 3x3

468
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:27,930
with lighting in the middle maybe a 3x3
 

469
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,040
with lighting in the middle maybe a 3x3
wood pillar to help get some light on

470
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,050
wood pillar to help get some light on
 

471
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,570
wood pillar to help get some light on
the stairs because it's really hard to

472
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:32,580
the stairs because it's really hard to
 

473
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,160
the stairs because it's really hard to
light these stairs without unless I do a

474
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,170
light these stairs without unless I do a
 

475
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,210
light these stairs without unless I do a
chandelier above or something

476
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:38,220
chandelier above or something
 

477
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,210
chandelier above or something
so I'm type of light lighting above

478
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:40,220
so I'm type of light lighting above
 

479
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,200
so I'm type of light lighting above
let's just see how this goes

480
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,210
let's just see how this goes
 

481
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:49,530
let's just see how this goes
I thought I saw fire it's as a torch

482
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:49,540

 

483
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:56,250

the J do like a wooden pillar

484
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:56,260
the J do like a wooden pillar
 

485
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:04,650
the J do like a wooden pillar
type thing oh yes

486
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:04,660
type thing oh yes
 

487
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,410
type thing oh yes
cheap mints I've been trying to get that

488
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:07,420
cheap mints I've been trying to get that
 

489
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:16,650
cheap mints I've been trying to get that
one for so long okay I might put a light

490
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:16,660
one for so long okay I might put a light
 

491
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,950
one for so long okay I might put a light
over here like on top the soil and then

492
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:19,960
over here like on top the soil and then
 

493
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,950
over here like on top the soil and then
maybe another one directly above and

494
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:25,960
maybe another one directly above and
 

495
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,730
maybe another one directly above and
have this or maybe I should have that I

496
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:29,740
have this or maybe I should have that I
 

497
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,990
have this or maybe I should have that I
should probably have the light a little

498
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:31,000
should probably have the light a little
 

499
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,960
should probably have the light a little
higher like up here and up here

500
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:36,970
higher like up here and up here
 

501
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:46,560
higher like up here and up here
perhaps I'm tempted to try uh pour lava

502
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:46,570
perhaps I'm tempted to try uh pour lava
 

503
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,840
perhaps I'm tempted to try uh pour lava
in the middle this actually to be honest

504
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:48,850
in the middle this actually to be honest
 

505
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,360
in the middle this actually to be honest
I don't know I think it would work I

506
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,370
I don't know I think it would work I
 

507
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,120
I don't know I think it would work I
should test it and creative before I do

508
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,130
should test it and creative before I do
 

509
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:59,160
should test it and creative before I do
that though if if lava works the same as

510
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,170
that though if if lava works the same as
 

511
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,380
that though if if lava works the same as
fire or similar to it that would work so

512
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:03,390
fire or similar to it that would work so
 

513
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,820
fire or similar to it that would work so
maybe I'll try that out and see how it

514
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:05,830
maybe I'll try that out and see how it
 

515
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,630
maybe I'll try that out and see how it
goes but regardless this is kind of like

516
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:09,640
goes but regardless this is kind of like
 

517
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,860
goes but regardless this is kind of like
what the pillar would look like maybe

518
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:13,870
what the pillar would look like maybe
 

519
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:22,790
what the pillar would look like maybe
it's a little too big mmm

520
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:22,800

 

521
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,950

okay so putting lava in that pillar does

522
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:25,960
okay so putting lava in that pillar does
 

523
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,620
okay so putting lava in that pillar does
work without it catching on fire if you

524
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:28,630
work without it catching on fire if you
 

525
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,790
work without it catching on fire if you
do it right but the thing is it's it's

526
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:32,800
do it right but the thing is it's it's
 

527
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,310
do it right but the thing is it's it's
really bulky I didn't really like it so

528
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,320
really bulky I didn't really like it so
 

529
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,700
really bulky I didn't really like it so
I took it out I tried putting the rails

530
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:38,710
I took it out I tried putting the rails
 

531
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,970
I took it out I tried putting the rails
on the stairs to see what it would look

532
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:41,980
on the stairs to see what it would look
 

533
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,010
on the stairs to see what it would look
like you know I'm not sure how I feel

534
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,020
like you know I'm not sure how I feel
 

535
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,020
like you know I'm not sure how I feel
about it it's almost a little bit too

536
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,030
about it it's almost a little bit too
 

537
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,800
about it it's almost a little bit too
jagged so I may have to do something

538
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:52,810
jagged so I may have to do something
 

539
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,560
jagged so I may have to do something
with half slabs like a block type that

540
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:55,570
with half slabs like a block type that
 

541
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,650
with half slabs like a block type that
has half slabs so not a whole lot of

542
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:58,660
has half slabs so not a whole lot of
 

543
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,770
has half slabs so not a whole lot of
choices with that maybe I did grab some

544
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:01,780
choices with that maybe I did grab some
 

545
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,770
choices with that maybe I did grab some
fences to see how it would look if we

546
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:04,780
fences to see how it would look if we
 

547
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,740
fences to see how it would look if we
did like we did before on other stairs

548
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:09,750

 

549
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:21,990

OOP something like that ah missing like

550
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000
OOP something like that ah missing like
 

551
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:31,290
OOP something like that ah missing like
crazy today

552
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:31,300

 

553
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,060

it's amazing how much defenses add to it

554
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,070
it's amazing how much defenses add to it
 

555
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,830
it's amazing how much defenses add to it
actually I'm liking that a lot more now

556
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:37,840
actually I'm liking that a lot more now
 

557
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,090
actually I'm liking that a lot more now
but I'll let you guys comment on it tell

558
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:43,100
but I'll let you guys comment on it tell
 

559
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,710
but I'll let you guys comment on it tell
me what you think as far as let's go so

560
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:47,720
me what you think as far as let's go so
 

561
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,950
me what you think as far as let's go so
for the door here I'll probably do a 3x3

562
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:50,960
for the door here I'll probably do a 3x3
 

563
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,350
for the door here I'll probably do a 3x3
piston door like I have at the potion

564
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
piston door like I have at the potion
 

565
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,740
piston door like I have at the potion
room

566
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:55,750

 

567
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,570

actually let's head down there real

568
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:58,580
actually let's head down there real
 

569
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,110
actually let's head down there real
quick so the way the potion door works

570
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,120
quick so the way the potion door works
 

571
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,170
quick so the way the potion door works
is it does a spiral I do really like it

572
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:05,180
is it does a spiral I do really like it
 

573
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,730
is it does a spiral I do really like it
with the block missing in the middle I

574
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:06,740
with the block missing in the middle I
 

575
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,570
with the block missing in the middle I
don't know why like I prefer it over a

576
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:10,580
don't know why like I prefer it over a
 

577
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,970
don't know why like I prefer it over a
solid 3 3x3 door for some reason this

578
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:15,980
solid 3 3x3 door for some reason this
 

579
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,370
solid 3 3x3 door for some reason this
one OOP it does the spiral closes like

580
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:21,380
one OOP it does the spiral closes like
 

581
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:27,520
one OOP it does the spiral closes like
that just kind of cool with this new one

582
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:27,530
that just kind of cool with this new one
 

583
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,320
that just kind of cool with this new one
I'm going to do I think I'll and then

584
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:29,330
I'm going to do I think I'll and then
 

585
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,890
I'm going to do I think I'll and then
change the pattern and make it so the

586
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:32,900
change the pattern and make it so the
 

587
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,070
change the pattern and make it so the
middle block here the lower middle one

588
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
middle block here the lower middle one
 

589
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,350
middle block here the lower middle one
and the upper middle one go up and down

590
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:38,360
and the upper middle one go up and down
 

591
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,000
and the upper middle one go up and down
and then the four corners go in with a

592
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,010
and then the four corners go in with a
 

593
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,770
and then the four corners go in with a
little bit of a delay from the middle

594
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:44,780
little bit of a delay from the middle
 

595
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,340
little bit of a delay from the middle
ones and then finally the two side ones

596
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:48,350
ones and then finally the two side ones
 

597
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,190
ones and then finally the two side ones
will go in I think that I'll have a cool

598
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,200
will go in I think that I'll have a cool
 

599
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,550
will go in I think that I'll have a cool
effect so I'll go with this one then

600
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:54,560
effect so I'll go with this one then
 

601
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,550
effect so I'll go with this one then
these two and then the side that's the

602
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:00,560
these two and then the side that's the
 

603
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,980
these two and then the side that's the
plan I don't know if I'll make it out of

604
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:02,990
plan I don't know if I'll make it out of
 

605
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,290
plan I don't know if I'll make it out of
iron and nether brick like I have here I

606
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:05,300
iron and nether brick like I have here I
 

607
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,660
iron and nether brick like I have here I
might try make this area a different

608
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:07,670
might try make this area a different
 

609
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:11,350
might try make this area a different
style than what I have over here I might

610
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,360
style than what I have over here I might
 

611
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:18,850
style than what I have over here I might
I might move away from the stone bricks

612
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:18,860
I might move away from the stone bricks
 

613
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,820
I might move away from the stone bricks
in this area and no more sandstone and

614
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:21,830
in this area and no more sandstone and
 

615
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:26,260
in this area and no more sandstone and
maybe more would look more leaves I kind

616
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,270
maybe more would look more leaves I kind
 

617
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,690
maybe more would look more leaves I kind
of think more of a warmer feeling to it

618
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:28,700
of think more of a warmer feeling to it
 

619
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,150
of think more of a warmer feeling to it
than I have over here's is more cold in

620
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:34,160
than I have over here's is more cold in
 

621
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:40,540
than I have over here's is more cold in
my opinion I don't anyway I think this

622
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:40,550
my opinion I don't anyway I think this
 

623
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,040
my opinion I don't anyway I think this
episode is actually going to be pretty

624
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,050
episode is actually going to be pretty
 

625
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,869
episode is actually going to be pretty
long after I edit that month

626
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:43,879
long after I edit that month
 

627
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:46,119
long after I edit that month
how long that will be but I recorded

628
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:46,129
how long that will be but I recorded
 

629
00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:49,569
how long that will be but I recorded
over an hour of me gaming so it might be

630
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:49,579
over an hour of me gaming so it might be
 

631
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:53,289
over an hour of me gaming so it might be
long so we will wrap it up here I did

632
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:53,299
long so we will wrap it up here I did
 

633
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:56,259
long so we will wrap it up here I did
want to go to the tree farm before we

634
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:56,269
want to go to the tree farm before we
 

635
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,839
want to go to the tree farm before we
end this actually I got a plant two

636
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:58,849
