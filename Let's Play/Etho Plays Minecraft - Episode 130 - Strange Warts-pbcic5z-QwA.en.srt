just at the blaze farm right now in the
 

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,419
just at the blaze farm right now in the
nether I think today is going to be

6
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:14,429
nether I think today is going to be
 

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,130
nether I think today is going to be
another episode what I'd like to do is

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:19,140
another episode what I'd like to do is
 

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,040
another episode what I'd like to do is
set up another word farm somewhere

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,050
set up another word farm somewhere
 

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,300
set up another word farm somewhere
around here for my another base I kind

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:26,310
around here for my another base I kind
 

13
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,300
around here for my another base I kind
of want this blaze farm to be the

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:29,310
of want this blaze farm to be the
 

15
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,280
of want this blaze farm to be the
epicenter of it so not exactly sure

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:34,290
epicenter of it so not exactly sure
 

17
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,959
epicenter of it so not exactly sure
where I want to build the farm yet I

18
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:35,969
where I want to build the farm yet I
 

19
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,020
where I want to build the farm yet I
think what I'll do is I'll just clear

20
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,030
think what I'll do is I'll just clear
 

21
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,420
think what I'll do is I'll just clear
out an area around this farm the blaze

22
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:41,430
out an area around this farm the blaze
 

23
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,760
out an area around this farm the blaze
farm and we'll take it from there

24
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:43,770
farm and we'll take it from there
 

25
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,010
farm and we'll take it from there
so I'm going to clean out a bunch of

26
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,020
so I'm going to clean out a bunch of
 

27
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,340
so I'm going to clean out a bunch of
this another rack set up some stairs or

28
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:49,350
this another rack set up some stairs or
 

29
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,700
this another rack set up some stairs or
something to get out of here I'm

30
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:52,710
something to get out of here I'm
 

31
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,319
something to get out of here I'm
thinking I should make the main floor at

32
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:57,329
thinking I should make the main floor at
 

33
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,430
thinking I should make the main floor at
least one block above these repeaters so

34
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
least one block above these repeaters so
 

35
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,000
least one block above these repeaters so
that would be at at this block level

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,010
that would be at at this block level
 

37
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,969
that would be at at this block level
here needs to be at least that high it

38
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:10,979
here needs to be at least that high it
 

39
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:17,499
here needs to be at least that high it
will probably go up another one or two

40
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:17,509

 

41
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:20,690

or so and then to get to the blaze farm

42
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:20,700
or so and then to get to the blaze farm
 

43
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,560
or so and then to get to the blaze farm
you go down some stairs or something

44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:24,570
you go down some stairs or something
 

45
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,060
you go down some stairs or something
something like that I don't know we'll

46
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,070
something like that I don't know we'll
 

47
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,899
something like that I don't know we'll
see jazz up if we're a little bit higher

48
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:29,909
see jazz up if we're a little bit higher
 

49
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,999
see jazz up if we're a little bit higher
we'll be closer to the blaze spawner and

50
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:32,009
we'll be closer to the blaze spawner and
 

51
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,490
we'll be closer to the blaze spawner and
that will make it so this thing's active

52
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:34,500
that will make it so this thing's active
 

53
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,700
that will make it so this thing's active
more often as well without having to be

54
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:37,710
more often as well without having to be
 

55
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:44,359
more often as well without having to be
quite as close to it horizontally okay

56
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:44,369
quite as close to it horizontally okay
 

57
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,130
quite as close to it horizontally okay
so I'm going to clean up around here and

58
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,140
so I'm going to clean up around here and
 

59
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,160
so I'm going to clean up around here and
figure out maybe a shape or a pattern or

60
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,170
figure out maybe a shape or a pattern or
 

61
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,620
figure out maybe a shape or a pattern or
something and then we will get to

62
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:51,630
something and then we will get to
 

63
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,630
something and then we will get to
testing and building and all that fun

64
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:53,640
testing and building and all that fun
 

65
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,889
testing and building and all that fun
stuff so I'll see you in a little while

66
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:56,899
stuff so I'll see you in a little while
 

67
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:00,319
stuff so I'll see you in a little while

00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:03,649
some space cleared out a little bit and
 

71
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:06,620
some space cleared out a little bit and
if you notice my levels jumping around

72
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:06,630
if you notice my levels jumping around
 

73
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,609
if you notice my levels jumping around
throughout this episode it's because

74
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:09,619
throughout this episode it's because
 

75
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:11,199
throughout this episode it's because
I'm kind of doing stuff in the

76
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:11,209
I'm kind of doing stuff in the
 

77
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:13,270
I'm kind of doing stuff in the
background between recordings and

78
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
background between recordings and
 

79
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,990
background between recordings and
getting food and all that stuff so when

80
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:17,000
getting food and all that stuff so when
 

81
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
getting food and all that stuff so when
I go afk I usually do annex to the blaze

82
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,010
I go afk I usually do annex to the blaze
 

83
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,000
I go afk I usually do annex to the blaze
farm so my levels might be all over the

84
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,010
farm so my levels might be all over the
 

85
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,949
farm so my levels might be all over the
place

86
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959

00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:46,609
one so we're going to do some nether
 

99
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:50,619
one so we're going to do some nether
wart experimenting because apparently

100
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:50,629
wart experimenting because apparently
 

101
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,900
wart experimenting because apparently
there's a lot of rumors that fire and

102
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:52,910
there's a lot of rumors that fire and
 

103
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:57,460
there's a lot of rumors that fire and
lava influence the growth rate as far as

104
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:57,470
lava influence the growth rate as far as
 

105
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,069
lava influence the growth rate as far as
I know they don't but I'm just going to

106
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:00,079
I know they don't but I'm just going to
 

107
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:06,520
I know they don't but I'm just going to
check it to be sure what we'll do we'll

108
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,530
check it to be sure what we'll do we'll
 

109
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:14,199
check it to be sure what we'll do we'll
try fill these rooms yeah well in these

110
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:14,209
try fill these rooms yeah well in these
 

111
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,210
try fill these rooms yeah well in these
corners like in one room we'll have fire

112
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:16,220
corners like in one room we'll have fire
 

113
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,240
corners like in one room we'll have fire
in the corner in another room we'll have

114
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,250
in the corner in another room we'll have
 

115
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,539
in the corner in another room we'll have
lava in the corners and in the third

116
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:22,549
lava in the corners and in the third
 

117
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,280
lava in the corners and in the third
room we'll have torches in the corners

118
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,290
room we'll have torches in the corners
 

119
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,650
room we'll have torches in the corners
and we'll see how the growth rates

120
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:26,660
and we'll see how the growth rates
 

121
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,860
and we'll see how the growth rates
compare after a little bit of time see

122
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:29,870
compare after a little bit of time see
 

123
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,930
compare after a little bit of time see
if there's any distinct advantage and

124
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:31,940
if there's any distinct advantage and
 

125
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,490
if there's any distinct advantage and
for the fourth room I want to make it

126
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:36,500
for the fourth room I want to make it
 

127
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,990
for the fourth room I want to make it
completely not completely dark but dim

128
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,000
completely not completely dark but dim
 

129
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,879
completely not completely dark but dim
lighting that's what we should figure

130
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:42,889
lighting that's what we should figure
 

131
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,619
lighting that's what we should figure
out first actually what lighting dude

132
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:44,629
out first actually what lighting dude
 

133
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:49,869
out first actually what lighting dude
does the nether wart need to live we're

134
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:49,879
does the nether wart need to live we're
 

135
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,319
does the nether wart need to live we're
going to figure that out right now

136
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:52,329
going to figure that out right now
 

137
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:59,410
going to figure that out right now
okay we'll set up some soul sand here

138
00:03:59,410 --> 00:03:59,420

 

139
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:05,440

like so so if the lighting is not enough

140
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,450
like so so if the lighting is not enough
 

141
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:14,090
like so so if the lighting is not enough
it'll just pop out of the ground seems

142
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,100
it'll just pop out of the ground seems
 

143
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,890
it'll just pop out of the ground seems
to be okay still maybe we should pick a

144
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:15,900
to be okay still maybe we should pick a
 

145
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,490
to be okay still maybe we should pick a
darker spot we will go I will just dig

146
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:22,500
darker spot we will go I will just dig
 

147
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,480
darker spot we will go I will just dig
further this way I guess I never use my

148
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,490
further this way I guess I never use my
 

149
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,010
further this way I guess I never use my
diamond picked in the nether because I

150
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,020
diamond picked in the nether because I
 

151
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,340
diamond picked in the nether because I
don't want it to get wasted mine another

152
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:31,350
don't want it to get wasted mine another
 

153
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,830
don't want it to get wasted mine another
rack since it breaks pretty quickly

154
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
rack since it breaks pretty quickly
 

155
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,760
rack since it breaks pretty quickly
anyway I usually will use either a

156
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:37,770
anyway I usually will use either a
 

157
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,960
anyway I usually will use either a
cobblestone or iron because I have lots

158
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:41,970
cobblestone or iron because I have lots
 

159
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:48,740
cobblestone or iron because I have lots
of iron okay we'll set it up here make

160
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:48,750
of iron okay we'll set it up here make
 

161
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,660
of iron okay we'll set it up here make

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:11,820
we'll get rid of this excuse me get rid
 

169
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,140
we'll get rid of this excuse me get rid
of that torch the lighting so this is

170
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,150
of that torch the lighting so this is
 

171
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,540
of that torch the lighting so this is
really dark in here and will actually

172
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:17,550
really dark in here and will actually
 

173
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,850
really dark in here and will actually
block off this end just to be sure you

174
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:22,860
block off this end just to be sure you
 

175
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,710
block off this end just to be sure you
guys still see I hope we'll plant nether

176
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:27,720
guys still see I hope we'll plant nether
 

177
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:35,330
guys still see I hope we'll plant nether
warts I didn't break off what am I doing

178
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:35,340
warts I didn't break off what am I doing
 

179
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:35,990
warts I didn't break off what am I doing
wrong

180
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
wrong
 

181
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,070
wrong
it should right

182
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,080

 

183
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,140

hmm I'm confused guys why isn't it

184
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,150
hmm I'm confused guys why isn't it
 

185
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,490
hmm I'm confused guys why isn't it
breaking I thought if I placed one here

186
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:54,500
breaking I thought if I placed one here
 

187
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:02,550
breaking I thought if I placed one here
they would all chain react and break hmm

188
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
they would all chain react and break hmm
 

189
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,809
they would all chain react and break hmm
okay I'm going to do some more research

190
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:04,819
okay I'm going to do some more research
 

191
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:11,640
okay I'm going to do some more research
I guess and try figure out what's wrong

192
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:11,650
I guess and try figure out what's wrong
 

193
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,230
I guess and try figure out what's wrong
yeah I'm really not understanding this

194
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
yeah I'm really not understanding this
 

195
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,339
yeah I'm really not understanding this
because I've seen it happen before if it

196
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:18,349
because I've seen it happen before if it
 

197
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:21,129
because I've seen it happen before if it
if it's a dark area the nether wart

198
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:21,139
if it's a dark area the nether wart
 

199
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:25,059
if it's a dark area the nether wart
should uproot if you if a block updates

200
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:25,069
should uproot if you if a block updates
 

201
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:28,600
should uproot if you if a block updates
next to it and it doesn't seem to matter

202
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:28,610
next to it and it doesn't seem to matter
 

203
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,550
next to it and it doesn't seem to matter
if the light changes or anything it's

204
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
if the light changes or anything it's
 

205
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,270
if the light changes or anything it's
just not doing it here for some reason

206
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
just not doing it here for some reason
 

207
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,920
just not doing it here for some reason
I've seen it happen before I've seen it

208
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:35,930
I've seen it happen before I've seen it
 

209
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,749
I've seen it happen before I've seen it
happen other people's videos like I I

210
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
happen other people's videos like I I
 

211
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,480
happen other people's videos like I I
know vex just made a video showing it I

212
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:40,490
know vex just made a video showing it I
 

213
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:48,570
know vex just made a video showing it I
saw it in one of food's videos for sure

214
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:48,580

 

215
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,999

why why in fact there's a specific spot

216
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:55,009
why why in fact there's a specific spot
 

217
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,129
why why in fact there's a specific spot
in this map we're going to go there

218
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:57,139
in this map we're going to go there
 

219
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:58,719
in this map we're going to go there
where I'm sure it happens

220
00:06:58,719 --> 00:06:58,729
where I'm sure it happens
 

221
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:04,480
where I'm sure it happens
I tried encasing the room with other

222
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,490
I tried encasing the room with other
 

223
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,519
I tried encasing the room with other
blocks besides another act and it didn't

224
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:06,529
blocks besides another act and it didn't
 

225
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,189
blocks besides another act and it didn't
work either

226
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:08,199
work either
 

227
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,510
work either
so I'm thoroughly confused right now

228
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:12,520
so I'm thoroughly confused right now
 

229
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,089
so I'm thoroughly confused right now
they will go to the original nether wart

230
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:16,099
they will go to the original nether wart
 

231
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:22,480
they will go to the original nether wart
farm where I saw it happen this is where

232
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,490
farm where I saw it happen this is where
 

233
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,390
farm where I saw it happen this is where
I originally got the nether wart from

234
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:25,400
I originally got the nether wart from
 

235
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,930
I originally got the nether wart from
these two natural farms here and in this

236
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:28,940
these two natural farms here and in this
 

237
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,850
these two natural farms here and in this
one there's one spot where I can't

238
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:30,860
one there's one spot where I can't
 

239
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,709
one there's one spot where I can't
replant it right here because it always

240
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:32,719
replant it right here because it always
 

241
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:36,100
replant it right here because it always
up roots let's see what happens if we

242
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,110
up roots let's see what happens if we
 

243
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:41,950
up roots let's see what happens if we
place a torch nothing just that one spot

244
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:41,960
place a torch nothing just that one spot
 

245
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:50,820
place a torch nothing just that one spot
it won't it won't work

246
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:50,830

 

247
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,409

like you implant it but as soon as

248
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:53,419
like you implant it but as soon as
 

249
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:55,499
like you implant it but as soon as
something updates I think it'll uproot

250
00:07:55,499 --> 00:07:55,509
something updates I think it'll uproot
 

251
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,230
something updates I think it'll uproot
if it's dark yeah there it goes

252
00:07:59,230 --> 00:07:59,240
if it's dark yeah there it goes
 

253
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:12,100
if it's dark yeah there it goes
so why why here and only there like this

254
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,110
so why why here and only there like this
 

255
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,600
so why why here and only there like this
one doesn't uproot when you break this

256
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:13,610
one doesn't uproot when you break this
 

257
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,779
one doesn't uproot when you break this
one but this one does if you break this

258
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:16,789
one but this one does if you break this
 

259
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:22,450
one but this one does if you break this
one so I don't know it can't be a

260
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:22,460
one so I don't know it can't be a
 

261
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,439
one so I don't know it can't be a
lighting issue because there's no little

262
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:26,449
lighting issue because there's no little
 

263
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:32,380
lighting issue because there's no little
difference in light is there still doing

264
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:32,390
difference in light is there still doing
 

265
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:40,909
difference in light is there still doing
it just there

266
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:40,919

 

267
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,840

what is special about the spot I know

268
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:45,850
what is special about the spot I know
 

269
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,280
what is special about the spot I know
someone probably knows and it's just

270
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,290
someone probably knows and it's just
 

271
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,520
someone probably knows and it's just
killing them that I can't figure it out

272
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:49,530
killing them that I can't figure it out
 

273
00:08:49,530 --> 00:09:00,660
killing them that I can't figure it out
J 1 negative 143 and 193 mmm when I

274
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:00,670
J 1 negative 143 and 193 mmm when I
 

275
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,280
J 1 negative 143 and 193 mmm when I
think about it for a bit there's got to

276
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,290
think about it for a bit there's got to
 

277
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,770
think about it for a bit there's got to
be a reason for this yeah this is really

278
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:07,780
be a reason for this yeah this is really
 

279
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,740
be a reason for this yeah this is really
really strange first thing I did is I

280
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:10,750
really strange first thing I did is I
 

281
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,780
really strange first thing I did is I
removed the stone brick stairs because I

282
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:12,790
removed the stone brick stairs because I
 

283
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,580
removed the stone brick stairs because I
thought maybe they were influencing it

284
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:14,590
thought maybe they were influencing it
 

285
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,120
thought maybe they were influencing it
somehow turns out they weren't then I

286
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,130
somehow turns out they weren't then I
 

287
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,220
somehow turns out they weren't then I
expanded this farm a little bit and we

288
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,230
expanded this farm a little bit and we
 

289
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,290
expanded this farm a little bit and we
can have nether warts all around this

290
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:25,300
can have nether warts all around this
 

291
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,050
can have nether warts all around this
one spot no problem doesn't break off in

292
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,060
one spot no problem doesn't break off in
 

293
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,790
one spot no problem doesn't break off in
low light it's just this one spot here

294
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
low light it's just this one spot here
 

295
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:40,980
low light it's just this one spot here
where it happens and so I'm just be

296
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:40,990
where it happens and so I'm just be
 

297
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,190
where it happens and so I'm just be
because this is a region corner or not a

298
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:44,200
because this is a region corner or not a
 

299
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,490
because this is a region corner or not a
region a chunk corner this spot right

300
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:47,500
region a chunk corner this spot right
 

301
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,050
region a chunk corner this spot right
here so I'm going to try something I'm

302
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,060
here so I'm going to try something I'm
 

303
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,140
here so I'm going to try something I'm
going to go 16 blocks over this is

304
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,150
going to go 16 blocks over this is
 

305
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,960
going to go 16 blocks over this is
negative 143 we should go 16 blocks this

306
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:00,970
negative 143 we should go 16 blocks this
 

307
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,760
negative 143 we should go 16 blocks this
way and try see if we can plant slow

308
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:05,770
way and try see if we can plant slow
 

309
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,680
way and try see if we can plant slow
sand in that spot so we need to go to

310
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:09,690
sand in that spot so we need to go to
 

311
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:18,600
sand in that spot so we need to go to
negative 159 right here oh yeah another

312
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:18,610
negative 159 right here oh yeah another
 

313
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,750
negative 159 right here oh yeah another
thing it doesn't matter what the height

314
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
thing it doesn't matter what the height
 

315
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,710
thing it doesn't matter what the height
is either by the what I can tell here if

316
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:25,720
is either by the what I can tell here if
 

317
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,690
is either by the what I can tell here if
you update next to it it still breaks

318
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:27,700
you update next to it it still breaks
 

319
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,740
you update next to it it still breaks
off even though it's higher or lower

320
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:30,750
off even though it's higher or lower
 

321
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:37,080
off even though it's higher or lower
that's interesting I'm very curious to

322
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,090
that's interesting I'm very curious to
 

323
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,160
that's interesting I'm very curious to
see if it's because of the chunk corner

324
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,170
see if it's because of the chunk corner
 

325
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,760
see if it's because of the chunk corner
maybe actually we knew this place block

326
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:46,770
maybe actually we knew this place block
 

327
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,580
maybe actually we knew this place block
okay so it didn't break

328
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:50,590
okay so it didn't break
 

329
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,880
okay so it didn't break
oh that just makes me more confused

330
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:55,890
oh that just makes me more confused
 

331
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,000
oh that just makes me more confused
we'll set up a little 3x3 here see if we

332
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,010
we'll set up a little 3x3 here see if we
 

333
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,080
we'll set up a little 3x3 here see if we
can cause one of them to break in this

334
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,090
can cause one of them to break in this
 

335
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,100
can cause one of them to break in this
area I don't know the reason I'm so

336
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,110
area I don't know the reason I'm so
 

337
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,390
area I don't know the reason I'm so
concerned about this is because I plan

338
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:09,400
concerned about this is because I plan
 

339
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,530
concerned about this is because I plan
to base my farm around that nether wart

340
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:13,540
to base my farm around that nether wart
 

341
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,560
to base my farm around that nether wart
breaking trick for auto harvesting

342
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:16,570
breaking trick for auto harvesting
 

343
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,510
breaking trick for auto harvesting
instead of using Pistons to auto harvest

344
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:18,520
instead of using Pistons to auto harvest
 

345
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,210
instead of using Pistons to auto harvest
I wanted to get rid of the lighting and

346
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:21,220
I wanted to get rid of the lighting and
 

347
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,400
I wanted to get rid of the lighting and
have them all break off in a chain

348
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,410
have them all break off in a chain
 

349
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:29,400
have them all break off in a chain
reaction type thing so I would like to

350
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,410
reaction type thing so I would like to
 

351
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,400
reaction type thing so I would like to
mimic it if I can but I don't know why

352
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,410
mimic it if I can but I don't know why
 

353
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,940
mimic it if I can but I don't know why
it works in places and like when vexing

354
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:35,950
it works in places and like when vexing
 

355
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,880
it works in places and like when vexing
goo did it it wasn't just one plant like

356
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:38,890
goo did it it wasn't just one plant like
 

357
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,940
goo did it it wasn't just one plant like
I have here that was doing it it was

358
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:41,950
I have here that was doing it it was
 

359
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,800
I have here that was doing it it was
whole fields of these things that we're

360
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:43,810
whole fields of these things that we're
 

361
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,860
whole fields of these things that we're
breaking at once hmm

362
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:48,870
breaking at once hmm
 

363
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:54,960
breaking at once hmm
so it's fine there one thing we can do

364
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:54,970
so it's fine there one thing we can do
 

365
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,170
so it's fine there one thing we can do
now since we know a specific spot where

366
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:58,180
now since we know a specific spot where
 

367
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,180
now since we know a specific spot where
it will break we can actually check the

368
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,190
it will break we can actually check the
 

369
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,940
it will break we can actually check the
lighting required to make it break I

370
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:04,950

 

371
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:12,660

think possibly I don't know that's the

372
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:12,670
think possibly I don't know that's the
 

373
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,040
think possibly I don't know that's the
other thing when they remove their

374
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,050
other thing when they remove their
 

375
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,140
other thing when they remove their
torches that's when it broke and when

376
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,150
torches that's when it broke and when
 

377
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,480
torches that's when it broke and when
I'm doing it it's not breaking for some

378
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:18,490
I'm doing it it's not breaking for some
 

379
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,600
I'm doing it it's not breaking for some
reason but if I do a block update it

380
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,610
reason but if I do a block update it
 

381
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,820
reason but if I do a block update it
does and that doesn't happen normally

382
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:26,830
does and that doesn't happen normally
 

383
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:32,280
does and that doesn't happen normally
like if we do one over I wish it was

384
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,290
like if we do one over I wish it was
 

385
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,160
like if we do one over I wish it was
brighter here pretty sure I met max yeah

386
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,170
brighter here pretty sure I met max yeah
 

387
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,980
brighter here pretty sure I met max yeah
if we do a block update over here

388
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:38,990
if we do a block update over here
 

389
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:54,670
if we do a block update over here
doesn't break them yeah so we're just

390
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:54,680
doesn't break them yeah so we're just
 

391
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,110
doesn't break them yeah so we're just
going to figure out the exact lighting

392
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:56,120
going to figure out the exact lighting
 

393
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,180
going to figure out the exact lighting
that's causing this there shouldn't be

394
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,190
that's causing this there shouldn't be
 

395
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,120
that's causing this there shouldn't be
any other lights in this area just this

396
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,130
any other lights in this area just this
 

397
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,960
any other lights in this area just this
one torch over here so we can keep

398
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:04,970
one torch over here so we can keep
 

399
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,760
one torch over here so we can keep
moving at one block closer to figure out

400
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:06,770
moving at one block closer to figure out
 

401
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:11,710
moving at one block closer to figure out
the exact distance where it breaks so

402
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:11,720
the exact distance where it breaks so
 

403
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,170
the exact distance where it breaks so
it's breaking at that distance let's

404
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:14,180
it's breaking at that distance let's
 

405
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:28,270
it's breaking at that distance let's
move it closer still breaking hmm has to

406
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:28,280
move it closer still breaking hmm has to
 

407
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,650
move it closer still breaking hmm has to
be closer than I thought there we go

408
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:32,660
be closer than I thought there we go
 

409
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,460
be closer than I thought there we go
that's the exact distance right there

410
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:38,470

 

411
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,400

so that is torches or a light level of

412
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,410
so that is torches or a light level of
 

413
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:57,310
so that is torches or a light level of
14 this would be 13 12 11 10 9 and 8 so

414
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:57,320
14 this would be 13 12 11 10 9 and 8 so
 

415
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,710
14 this would be 13 12 11 10 9 and 8 so
netherwart needs a light level of 8 to

416
00:13:59,710 --> 00:13:59,720
netherwart needs a light level of 8 to
 

417
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,790
netherwart needs a light level of 8 to
prevent it from uprooting in that

418
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:03,800
prevent it from uprooting in that
 

419
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,680
prevent it from uprooting in that
condition whatever that condition is

420
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:05,690
condition whatever that condition is
 

421
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,450
condition whatever that condition is
that's making this one uproot that

422
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:07,460
that's making this one uproot that
 

423
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,760
that's making this one uproot that
doesn't affect all these other ones for

424
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:09,770
doesn't affect all these other ones for
 

425
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:14,230
doesn't affect all these other ones for
some strange unlogical reason I don't

426
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
some strange unlogical reason I don't
 

427
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,390
some strange unlogical reason I don't
I'm really curious about this if you

428
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:16,400
I'm really curious about this if you
 

429
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,950
I'm really curious about this if you
guys know tell me what's going on

430
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:17,960
guys know tell me what's going on
 

431
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,030
guys know tell me what's going on
because you have no idea how confused

432
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,040
because you have no idea how confused
 

433
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,340
because you have no idea how confused
this is making me it doesn't seem to

434
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:24,350
this is making me it doesn't seem to
 

435
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:33,670
this is making me it doesn't seem to
follow any logic ok so light level 8 14

436
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
follow any logic ok so light level 8 14
 

437
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,310
follow any logic ok so light level 8 14
13 12 11 10 9 8 for sure

438
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320

 

439
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,280

that's not that would be light level

440
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,290
that's not that would be light level
 

441
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:53,810
that's not that would be light level
seven and it breaks okay well whatever

442
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:53,820
seven and it breaks okay well whatever
 

443
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,819
seven and it breaks okay well whatever
the deal is with that we're still going

444
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:55,829
the deal is with that we're still going
 

445
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,100
the deal is with that we're still going
to do our test here this is our lighting

446
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,110
to do our test here this is our lighting
 

447
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,579
to do our test here this is our lighting
test to see if different lighting types

448
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:01,589
test to see if different lighting types
 

449
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:05,210
test to see if different lighting types
or levels affect the growth rates so

450
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:05,220
or levels affect the growth rates so
 

451
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,850
or levels affect the growth rates so
we're going to test the fire rumor we're

452
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:07,860
we're going to test the fire rumor we're
 

453
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,300
we're going to test the fire rumor we're
going to test the lab a rumor and this

454
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,310
going to test the lab a rumor and this
 

455
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,280
going to test the lab a rumor and this
room here is torches we have them one

456
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,290
room here is torches we have them one
 

457
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,559
room here is torches we have them one
block higher than the latha in the fire

458
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:15,569
block higher than the latha in the fire
 

459
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:17,870
block higher than the latha in the fire
because they are one light level lower

460
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:17,880
because they are one light level lower
 

461
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,350
because they are one light level lower
so we want it even and this is going to

462
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
so we want it even and this is going to
 

463
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,689
so we want it even and this is going to
be our darkroom so let's fill these up

464
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:23,699
be our darkroom so let's fill these up
 

465
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:29,960
be our darkroom so let's fill these up
with nether wart will let them grow try

466
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:29,970
with nether wart will let them grow try
 

467
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,829
with nether wart will let them grow try
to find them as quickly as we can here

468
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:32,839
to find them as quickly as we can here
 

469
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:35,180
to find them as quickly as we can here
I'll let them grow I'll keep checking

470
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,190
I'll let them grow I'll keep checking
 

471
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,030
I'll let them grow I'll keep checking
them we'll seal off these rooms so the

472
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,040
them we'll seal off these rooms so the
 

473
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,960
them we'll seal off these rooms so the
outside light doesn't affect them and

474
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:43,970

 

475
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,090

see if there's any any noticeable

476
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,100
see if there's any any noticeable
 

477
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:53,420
see if there's any any noticeable
difference between the four rooms so

478
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:53,430
difference between the four rooms so
 

479
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,720
difference between the four rooms so
we're about five minutes in now let's

480
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:56,730
we're about five minutes in now let's
 

481
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,350
we're about five minutes in now let's
open up and see where they're at mark

482
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:00,360
open up and see where they're at mark
 

483
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,230
open up and see where they're at mark
the doors okay that's the fire room one

484
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
the doors okay that's the fire room one
 

485
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,480
the doors okay that's the fire room one
two three four five yeah I really should

486
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:11,490
two three four five yeah I really should
 

487
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:17,900
two three four five yeah I really should
have marked the doors and of course it's

488
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:17,910
have marked the doors and of course it's
 

489
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:25,019
have marked the doors and of course it's
random to an extent

490
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:25,029

 

491
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:29,440

that's the torch room I am noticing a

492
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,450
that's the torch room I am noticing a
 

493
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,210
that's the torch room I am noticing a
difference in the torch room compared to

494
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:31,220
difference in the torch room compared to
 

495
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,160
difference in the torch room compared to
the fire and lava could be a coincidence

496
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,170
the fire and lava could be a coincidence
 

497
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,820
the fire and lava could be a coincidence
fire seems to be the best so far and the

498
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:39,830
fire seems to be the best so far and the
 

499
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:45,160
fire seems to be the best so far and the
dark room much like the torch room very

500
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,170
dark room much like the torch room very
 

501
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,389
dark room much like the torch room very
interesting okay we'll keep them going a

502
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:49,399
interesting okay we'll keep them going a
 

503
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,370
interesting okay we'll keep them going a
little bit longer here and we'll compare

504
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:51,380
little bit longer here and we'll compare
 

505
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:57,010
little bit longer here and we'll compare
it in and if it does seem like there is

506
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,020
it in and if it does seem like there is
 

507
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,380
it in and if it does seem like there is
a difference we will do a much larger

508
00:16:59,380 --> 00:16:59,390
a difference we will do a much larger
 

509
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:05,500
a difference we will do a much larger
scale test to be sure let's check them

510
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:05,510
scale test to be sure let's check them
 

511
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,210
scale test to be sure let's check them
again quickly here we're about 10

512
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:07,220
again quickly here we're about 10
 

513
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:13,449
again quickly here we're about 10
minutes in now fire room looking pretty

514
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:13,459
minutes in now fire room looking pretty
 

515
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,650
minutes in now fire room looking pretty
good

516
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:16,660

 

517
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:26,530

lava room torch room still pretty far

518
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:26,540
lava room torch room still pretty far
 

519
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,320
lava room torch room still pretty far
behind by the looks of it the fire room

520
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:31,330
behind by the looks of it the fire room
 

521
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,150
behind by the looks of it the fire room
is likely a good 30 seconds ahead of

522
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,160
is likely a good 30 seconds ahead of
 

523
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,870
is likely a good 30 seconds ahead of
these ones just because I had the plants

524
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
these ones just because I had the plants
 

525
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,630
these ones just because I had the plants
I planted it first so there it's a

526
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
I planted it first so there it's a
 

527
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,430
I planted it first so there it's a
little bit ahead because of that but I

528
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:42,440
little bit ahead because of that but I
 

529
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,770
little bit ahead because of that but I
can't imagine it would make that big of

530
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:44,780
can't imagine it would make that big of
 

531
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:52,860
can't imagine it would make that big of
a difference okay I'll see you at 15

532
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:52,870

 

533
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,320

yeah we're just over 15 now like between

534
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,330
yeah we're just over 15 now like between
 

535
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,540
yeah we're just over 15 now like between
15 and 20 minutes this is what we're at

536
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:58,550
15 and 20 minutes this is what we're at
 

537
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:07,450
15 and 20 minutes this is what we're at
fire room lava room torch room and dark

538
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:07,460
fire room lava room torch room and dark
 

539
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,940
fire room lava room torch room and dark
room

540
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:10,950

 

541
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,330

and now we're about 30 minutes in a

542
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:14,340
and now we're about 30 minutes in a
 

543
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,820
and now we're about 30 minutes in a
little past this will probably be our

544
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:16,830
little past this will probably be our
 

545
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,440
little past this will probably be our
final check this is the fire room this

546
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:21,450
final check this is the fire room this
 

547
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:27,379
final check this is the fire room this
is the labrum again torch room over here

548
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:27,389
is the labrum again torch room over here
 

549
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:29,539
is the labrum again torch room over here
looks like the torch room's losing at

550
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:29,549
looks like the torch room's losing at
 

551
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:32,450
looks like the torch room's losing at
the moment that little that's not it

552
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:32,460
the moment that little that's not it
 

553
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,729
the moment that little that's not it
does have some tall ones in it and

554
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:34,739
does have some tall ones in it and
 

555
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,310
does have some tall ones in it and
finally this is the dark room which is

556
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,320
finally this is the dark room which is
 

557
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:44,239
finally this is the dark room which is
doing pretty good yeah I don't know to

558
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:44,249
doing pretty good yeah I don't know to
 

559
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:47,440
doing pretty good yeah I don't know to
me it seems like they're all fairly even

560
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:47,450
me it seems like they're all fairly even
 

561
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,609
me it seems like they're all fairly even
obviously some are ahead but I think

562
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:49,619
obviously some are ahead but I think
 

563
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:51,289
obviously some are ahead but I think
that's just due to the randomness I

564
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:51,299
that's just due to the randomness I
 

565
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:54,229
that's just due to the randomness I
don't think yeah they have any advantage

566
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:54,239
don't think yeah they have any advantage
 

567
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:58,129
don't think yeah they have any advantage
over each other in my opinion you guys

568
00:18:58,129 --> 00:18:58,139
over each other in my opinion you guys
 

569
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:01,940
over each other in my opinion you guys
can judge yourselves from this test well

570
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:01,950
can judge yourselves from this test well
 

571
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,080
can judge yourselves from this test well
it looks like we just found another

572
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,090
it looks like we just found another
 

573
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,690
it looks like we just found another
nether fortress as looking for some slow

574
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:05,700
nether fortress as looking for some slow
 

575
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,229
nether fortress as looking for some slow
sand like a big patch of it and stumbled

576
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:09,239
sand like a big patch of it and stumbled
 

577
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:11,989
sand like a big patch of it and stumbled
across this so that's awesome we'll have

578
00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:11,999
across this so that's awesome we'll have
 

579
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,289
across this so that's awesome we'll have
to check it out sometime but not right

580
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:15,299
to check it out sometime but not right
 

581
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:21,590
to check it out sometime but not right
now as it's looking for another patch of

582
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
now as it's looking for another patch of
 

583
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,419
now as it's looking for another patch of
the slow sand to see if we can find

584
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:25,429
the slow sand to see if we can find
 

585
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:27,889
the slow sand to see if we can find
another one of those places that causes

586
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:27,899
another one of those places that causes
 

587
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,590
another one of those places that causes
it to pop off and if we do that we might

588
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:30,600
it to pop off and if we do that we might
 

589
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,330
it to pop off and if we do that we might
be able to figure out what's actually

590
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:32,340
be able to figure out what's actually
 

591
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,799
be able to figure out what's actually
causing it to happen but doesn't seem

592
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:36,809
causing it to happen but doesn't seem
 

593
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:41,810
causing it to happen but doesn't seem
like this patch does that anywhere so

594
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:41,820
like this patch does that anywhere so
 

595
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,330
like this patch does that anywhere so
I'm going to try find some more and see

596
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:44,340
I'm going to try find some more and see
 

597
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,029
I'm going to try find some more and see
if we can replicate it again we might be

598
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
if we can replicate it again we might be
 

599
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:54,680
if we can replicate it again we might be
able to draw a connection somewhere yeah

600
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:54,690
able to draw a connection somewhere yeah
 

601
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,320
able to draw a connection somewhere yeah
I found a huge huge chunk of slow sand

602
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,330
I found a huge huge chunk of slow sand
 

603
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,720
I found a huge huge chunk of slow sand
here it wraps all the way around and

604
00:19:59,720 --> 00:19:59,730
here it wraps all the way around and
 

605
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,229
here it wraps all the way around and
trying to place it randomly in places to

606
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:03,239
trying to place it randomly in places to
 

607
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:05,029
trying to place it randomly in places to
figure out another spot where it will

608
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039
figure out another spot where it will
 

609
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,659
figure out another spot where it will
pop off but it just it's not happening I

610
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:08,669
pop off but it just it's not happening I
 

611
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:11,299
pop off but it just it's not happening I
don't know it's probably conditions I

612
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:11,309
don't know it's probably conditions I
 

613
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:12,859
don't know it's probably conditions I
can't control I just don't know what

614
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:12,869
can't control I just don't know what
 

615
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:16,009
can't control I just don't know what
they are so if you guys know please

616
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:16,019
they are so if you guys know please
 

617
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:18,499
they are so if you guys know please
please tell me because I would like to

618
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:18,509
please tell me because I would like to
 

619
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,760
please tell me because I would like to
know

620
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:20,770

 

621
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,920

I would really like to use in another

622
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:22,930
I would really like to use in another
 

623
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,700
I would really like to use in another
word farm that trick word where they pop

624
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:26,710
word farm that trick word where they pop
 

625
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,130
word farm that trick word where they pop
off because you could have like for

626
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:29,140
off because you could have like for
 

627
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,540
off because you could have like for
example if if this popped off and all

628
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:33,550
example if if this popped off and all
 

629
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,300
example if if this popped off and all
these popped off from that trick I could

630
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,310
these popped off from that trick I could
 

631
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,890
these popped off from that trick I could
just hit this and they would all break

632
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:37,900
just hit this and they would all break
 

633
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,670
just hit this and they would all break
at once and that way you won't need like

634
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:41,680
at once and that way you won't need like
 

635
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,910
at once and that way you won't need like
six Pistons to do that or if you got

636
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:44,920
six Pistons to do that or if you got
 

637
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,490
six Pistons to do that or if you got

and you can cause a chain reaction you
 

641
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,190
and you can cause a chain reaction you
just need to break one instead of like

642

just need to break one instead of like
 

643
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,290

needing a hundred Pistons to move up and
 

645
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,960
needing a hundred Pistons to move up and
down to break them which would be pretty

646
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:57,970

717
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,799
by the slow sand and the one we normally
go to is right there so they're pretty

718
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:53,809
go to is right there so they're pretty
 

719
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:54,430

spawners together that would be huge

724
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:00,470
spawners together that would be huge
 

725
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:07,899
spawners together that would be huge
I think then I would probably build my

726
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:07,909
I think then I would probably build my
 

727
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:09,850
I think then I would probably build my
base here instead so maybe it's worth

728
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:09,860
base here instead so maybe it's worth
 

729
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,730
base here instead so maybe it's worth
checking out cuz I'd hate to start

730
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:12,740
checking out cuz I'd hate to start
 

731
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,409
checking out cuz I'd hate to start
building stuff in the nether and then

732
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:14,419
building stuff in the nether and then
 

733
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:17,590
building stuff in the nether and then
find out that there's a better spot you

734
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:17,600
find out that there's a better spot you
 

735
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,320
find out that there's a better spot you
know ten minutes later or something so

736
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,330
know ten minutes later or something so
 

737
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:26,260
know ten minutes later or something so
I'm going to investigate this yeah yes

738
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,270
I'm going to investigate this yeah yes
 

739
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:31,390

what I think you know it turns out there

740
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:31,400
what I think you know it turns out there
 

741
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,919
what I think you know it turns out there
is another one so that one's right there

742
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:32,929
is another one so that one's right there
 

743
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:39,010
is another one so that one's right there
and the other ones right here so doesn't

744
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:39,020
and the other ones right here so doesn't
 

745
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,600
and the other ones right here so doesn't
get a whole lot better I think they're

746
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:40,610
get a whole lot better I think they're
 

747
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:45,880
get a whole lot better I think they're
perfectly aligned even same height one

748
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:45,890

about 16 blocks apart which is awesome
 

755
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,159
about 16 blocks apart which is awesome
so this is where we're going to do it

756
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:57,169
so this is where we're going to do it
 

757
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:03,750

yeah this is awesome so definitely we'll
 

761
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,180
yeah this is awesome so definitely we'll
have to set that up that will double our

762
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,190
have to set that up that will double our
 

763
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,110
have to set that up that will double our
XP rates which is huge because it's

764
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,120
XP rates which is huge because it's
 

765
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,940
XP rates which is huge because it's
already good with that one farm but if

766
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:15,950
already good with that one farm but if
 

767
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:20,669
already good with that one farm but if
we can get a double farm unbelievable

768
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:20,679
we can get a double farm unbelievable
 

769
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:26,080
we can get a double farm unbelievable
and I'm lost no this is it this is it

770
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,090
and I'm lost no this is it this is it
 

771
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,049
and I'm lost no this is it this is it
good okay

772
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:30,059

 

773
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:34,110

sweet okay if you have to do one thing

774
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,120
sweet okay if you have to do one thing
 

775
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,580
sweet okay if you have to do one thing
in this episode so we'll do it real

776
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:35,590
in this episode so we'll do it real
 

777
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,000
in this episode so we'll do it real
quick I didn't check if netherwart will

778
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,010
quick I didn't check if netherwart will
 

779
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,910
quick I didn't check if netherwart will
grow if a blocks above it so let's let's

780
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:41,920
grow if a blocks above it so let's let's
 

781
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,220
grow if a blocks above it so let's let's
figure that out too before we end this

782
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,230

 

783
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,600

also just in case you don't know this

784
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,610
also just in case you don't know this
 

785
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,610
also just in case you don't know this
already there are three stages of growth

786
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:50,620
already there are three stages of growth
 

787
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,940
already there are three stages of growth
so this is a small stage and if you

788
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:53,950
so this is a small stage and if you
 

789
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,440
so this is a small stage and if you
break them one there like that if you

790
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:55,450
break them one there like that if you
 

791
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,260
break them one there like that if you
only get one always which make sense

792
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:58,270
only get one always which make sense
 

793
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,020
only get one always which make sense
this is the second stage just sight here

794
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,030
this is the second stage just sight here
 

795
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:05,250
this is the second stage just sight here
I think you get two or one

796
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:05,260
I think you get two or one
 

797
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:12,060
I think you get two or one
I guess one seems to always be one and

798
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,070
I guess one seems to always be one and
 

799
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,120
I guess one seems to always be one and
then at the third stage you get it's

800
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,130
then at the third stage you get it's
 

801
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:20,450
then at the third stage you get it's
either two or three I think three three

802
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:20,460
either two or three I think three three
 

803
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:30,120
either two or three I think three three
set for three up to so I think it's two

804
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,130
set for three up to so I think it's two
 

805
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:35,760
set for three up to so I think it's two
to four we I bet you a fortune works on

806
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:35,770
to four we I bet you a fortune works on
 

807
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:42,889
to four we I bet you a fortune works on
this three four

808
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:42,899

 

809
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:46,230

hmmm I should probably check

810
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,240
hmmm I should probably check
 

811
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,960
hmmm I should probably check
I should probably test fortune two just

812
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:48,970
I should probably test fortune two just
 

813
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,789
I should probably test fortune two just
to make this a complete episode but what

814
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:50,799
to make this a complete episode but what
 

815
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,560
to make this a complete episode but what
we'll do before that we're going to set

816
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:52,570
we'll do before that we're going to set
 

817
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,950
we'll do before that we're going to set
up some fresh ones and then we're going

818
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:55,960
up some fresh ones and then we're going
 

819
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,029
up some fresh ones and then we're going
to cover them and see if that's if they

820
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:00,039
to cover them and see if that's if they
 

821
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:03,870
to cover them and see if that's if they
can still grow and I think we just got

822
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:03,880
can still grow and I think we just got
 

823
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,970
can still grow and I think we just got
our answer there but we'll we'll do it

824
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:05,980
our answer there but we'll we'll do it
 

825
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:14,070
our answer there but we'll we'll do it
anyway and the the word is you can't

826
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,080
anyway and the the word is you can't
 

827
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,259
anyway and the the word is you can't
grow this stuff in the real world maybe

828
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:16,269
grow this stuff in the real world maybe
 

829
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:20,490
grow this stuff in the real world maybe
I'll try that too real quick just to be

830
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:20,500
I'll try that too real quick just to be
 

831
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,720
I'll try that too real quick just to be
sure yeah I don't think they're going to

832
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:24,730
sure yeah I don't think they're going to
 

833
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,909
sure yeah I don't think they're going to
grow here been watching them for a while

834
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:26,919
grow here been watching them for a while
 

835
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,289
grow here been watching them for a while
nurse they're still small so in this

836
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:31,299
nurse they're still small so in this
 

837
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:34,139
nurse they're still small so in this
world they don't seem to grow you can

838
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:34,149
world they don't seem to grow you can
 

839
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:36,419
world they don't seem to grow you can
plant them for looks but that's about it

840
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:36,429
plant them for looks but that's about it
 

841
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:40,320
plant them for looks but that's about it
and you have to be in the nether for

842
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,330
and you have to be in the nether for
 

843
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,560
and you have to be in the nether for
them to grow like within viewing range I

844
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:43,570
them to grow like within viewing range I
 

845
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:47,639
them to grow like within viewing range I
think for them to grow so that if you

846
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:47,649
think for them to grow so that if you
 

847
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,409
think for them to grow so that if you
got a farm in the nether it won't be

848
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:49,419
got a farm in the nether it won't be
 

849
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:50,970
got a farm in the nether it won't be
growing while you're here you have to

850
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:50,980
growing while you're here you have to
 

851
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,119
growing while you're here you have to
actually be there and near it for it to

852
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:54,129
actually be there and near it for it to
 

853
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:59,749
actually be there and near it for it to
work and bonemeal we should try bonemeal

854
00:26:59,749 --> 00:26:59,759
work and bonemeal we should try bonemeal
 

855
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,450
work and bonemeal we should try bonemeal
does not work or at least not here we'll

856
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:03,460
does not work or at least not here we'll
 

857
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:08,789
does not work or at least not here we'll
try it in another as well so they can

858
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:08,799
try it in another as well so they can
 

859
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,259
try it in another as well so they can
grow if they're covered with a solid

860
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:10,269
grow if they're covered with a solid
 

861
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:14,810
grow if they're covered with a solid
block that's the verdict on that

862
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:14,820

 

863
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:21,210

bonemeal does not work okay and I do

864
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:21,220
bonemeal does not work okay and I do
 

865
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,980
bonemeal does not work okay and I do
have a fortune pic now fortune 3-1 so

866
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:25,990
have a fortune pic now fortune 3-1 so
 

867
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:30,090
have a fortune pic now fortune 3-1 so
I'm expecting we should get like four or

868
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,100
I'm expecting we should get like four or
 

869
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:35,610
I'm expecting we should get like four or
more often see what we get we have fifty

870
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:35,620
more often see what we get we have fifty
 

871
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:42,289
more often see what we get we have fifty
two that is yet we got four that time

872
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:42,299

 

873
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:43,950

try it again

874
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:43,960
try it again
 

875
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:51,750
try it again
oh we went beyond I think yeah I think

876
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:51,760
oh we went beyond I think yeah I think
 

877
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,630
oh we went beyond I think yeah I think
that was five

878
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,640

 

879
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:04,530

61 that was five again oops

00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:04,540
61 that was five again oops
 

881
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:12,550
61 that was five again oops
three five and I think that was five

882
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:12,560
three five and I think that was five
 

883
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,750
three five and I think that was five
right I don't I can't remember

884
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760
right I don't I can't remember
 

885

889
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,700

not that you couldn't get millions if

890
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:24,710
not that you couldn't get millions if
 

891
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:31,200
not that you couldn't get millions if
you made a big farm but good to know

892
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,210

 

893
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,800

thank you for watching sorry we didn't
build anything you know the answer to my

906
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:56,690
build anything you know the answer to my
 

907
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,220
build anything you know the answer to my
question let me know hopefully we can

908
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,230
question let me know hopefully we can
 

909
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,610
question let me know hopefully we can
get building stuff again next time but

910
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:03,620
get building stuff again next time but
 

911
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,000
get building stuff again next time but
like I said on low on time lately so

912
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,010
like I said on low on time lately so
 

913
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,360
like I said on low on time lately so
this was an easy episode to get out and

914
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,370
this was an easy episode to get out and
 

915
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,070
this was an easy episode to get out and
it's important to research things before

916
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
it's important to research things before
 

917
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,750
it's important to research things before
building so that's why we were doing

918
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:13,760
building so that's why we were doing
 

919
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,190
building so that's why we were doing
that today okay thanks for watching guys

920
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:18,200

actually before we end this I'm going to

924
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:24,380
actually before we end this I'm going to
 

925
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,200

00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,970
give you one tip to and taste this ever
happens do you like you just happen to

928
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:27,980
happens do you like you just happen to
 

929
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,760
happens do you like you just happen to
me if you get stuck in the nether like

930
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:30,770
me if you get stuck in the nether like
 

931
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,650
me if you get stuck in the nether like
if a gas shoots out your nether portal

932
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:32,660
if a gas shoots out your nether portal
 

933
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,470
if a gas shoots out your nether portal
and you don't have any flint and steel

934
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:34,480
and you don't have any flint and steel
 

935
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,740
and you don't have any flint and steel
can't make any there's another way out

936
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:38,750
can't make any there's another way out
 

937
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,160
can't make any there's another way out
without killing yourself just you can

938
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,170
without killing yourself just you can
 

939
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:46,090
without killing yourself just you can
actually make a wick on another rat if

940
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:46,100
actually make a wick on another rat if
 

941
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,240
actually make a wick on another rat if
you have a flammable block this fire

942
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,250
you have a flammable block this fire
 

943
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,540
you have a flammable block this fire
will spread to this block or to that one

944
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:52,550
will spread to this block or to that one
 

945
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:57,490
will spread to this block or to that one
and then just lead it on over to the

946
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:57,500
and then just lead it on over to the
 

947
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,760
and then just lead it on over to the
portal

948
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:01,770

 

949
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,500

so that should eventually cause the

950
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:04,510
