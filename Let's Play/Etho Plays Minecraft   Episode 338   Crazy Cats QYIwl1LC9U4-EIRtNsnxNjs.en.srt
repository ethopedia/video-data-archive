like chocolate island days i got really
 

225
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,909
like chocolate island days i got really
into mob systems and i don't have a mob

226
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
into mob systems and i don't have a mob
 

227

system
 

229
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,150
system
at the man cave here so that's what

230
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
at the man cave here so that's what
 

231
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,629
at the man cave here so that's what
we're gonna be doing today

232
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
we're gonna be doing today
 

233
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,390
we're gonna be doing today
and oh security

234
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
and oh security
 

235
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,990
and oh security
security guard we have a problem he's

236
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
security guard we have a problem he's
 

237
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,270
security guard we have a problem he's
he must have spawned there because he's

238
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
he must have spawned there because he's
 

239
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,110
he must have spawned there because he's
inside the glass

240
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
inside the glass
 

241
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,430
inside the glass
ah so this might be where we're putting

242
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
ah so this might be where we're putting
 

243
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,909
ah so this might be where we're putting
it let's just take a look

244
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
it let's just take a look
 

245
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,749
it let's just take a look
at what's in this area

246
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759

 

247
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,110

we're going to be doing one of those

248
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
we're going to be doing one of those
 

249
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,270
we're going to be doing one of those
mob systems the new ones now where you

250
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
mob systems the new ones now where you
 

251
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,790
mob systems the new ones now where you
can

252
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
can
 

253
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,350
can

around

256
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
around
 

257
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,070
around

and
 

263
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,710
and
you can make a really simple mob system

264
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
you can make a really simple mob system
 

265
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,590
you can make a really simple mob system
with very little work with the help of

266
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
with very little work with the help of
 

267
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,070
with very little work with the help of
those guys

268
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
those guys
 

269
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,150
those guys
so that's cool so we're going to try to

270
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
so that's cool so we're going to try to
 

271
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,590
so that's cool so we're going to try to
make one of those i've never done one of

272
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
make one of those i've never done one of
 

273
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,230
make one of those i've never done one of
those

274
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
those
 

275
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,469
those
styles before and

276
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479

 

277
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,590

this might be the spot

278
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
this might be the spot
 

279
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,710
this might be the spot
see where do we come out on the surface

280
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
see where do we come out on the surface
 

281
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,390
see where do we come out on the surface
or do we run into anything here is what

282
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
or do we run into anything here is what
 

283
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,110
or do we run into anything here is what
i'm checking

284
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
i'm checking
 

285
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,270
i'm checking
for looks like this is the desert

286
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
for looks like this is the desert
 

287
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,590
for looks like this is the desert
let's see desert yeah desert hmm

288
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600

 

289
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,749

uh ideally i should probably build it up

290
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
uh ideally i should probably build it up
 

291
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,110
uh ideally i should probably build it up
in the sky somewhere

292
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
in the sky somewhere
 

293
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,230
in the sky somewhere
i would get me the best rates but

294
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
i would get me the best rates but
 

295
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,430
i would get me the best rates but
i really like having like the mob system

296
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
i really like having like the mob system
 

297
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,629
i really like having like the mob system
down in the cave here i think because

298
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
down in the cave here i think because
 

299
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,550
down in the cave here i think because
uh i'll i'll see it all the time i won't

300
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
uh i'll i'll see it all the time i won't
 

301
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,710
uh i'll i'll see it all the time i won't
be like i won't have to go climb up

302
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
be like i won't have to go climb up
 

303
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,309
be like i won't have to go climb up
somewhere in the sky to go

304
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
somewhere in the sky to go
 

305
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,990
somewhere in the sky to go
visit the mob system it'll be running

306
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
visit the mob system it'll be running
 

307
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,590
visit the mob system it'll be running
all the time kind of and i can keep

308
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
all the time kind of and i can keep
 

309
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,710
all the time kind of and i can keep
checking on it

310
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
checking on it
 

311
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,309
checking on it
uh if i want um so i think we'll just

312
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
uh if i want um so i think we'll just
 

313
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,070
uh if i want um so i think we'll just
build it's maybe on the surface

314
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
build it's maybe on the surface
 

315
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,350
build it's maybe on the surface
here even

316
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360

 

317
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,070

hmm yeah that might work out okay

318
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080

 

319
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,670

about how we're gonna do this
 

323
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,950
about how we're gonna do this
trying to work out the details in my

324
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
trying to work out the details in my
 

325
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,749
trying to work out the details in my
head i don't know exactly what i'm doing

326
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
head i don't know exactly what i'm doing
 

327
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,670

mind
 

331
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,029
mind
we're going to build most of the

332
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
we're going to build most of the
 

333
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,710
we're going to build most of the
structure of this harding clay and if it

334
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
structure of this harding clay and if it
 

335
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,550
structure of this harding clay and if it
turns out well and we like it we may add

336
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
turns out well and we like it we may add
 

337
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,430
turns out well and we like it we may add
more

338

more
 

339
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,189
more
detail to it later and maybe change the

340
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
detail to it later and maybe change the
 

341
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,629
detail to it later and maybe change the
colors up i don't know

342
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
colors up i don't know
 

343
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,909
colors up i don't know
but i think it's a little nicer than

344
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
but i think it's a little nicer than
 

345
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,830
but i think it's a little nicer than
just using stone bricks like i usually

346
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
just using stone bricks like i usually
 

347
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,950
just using stone bricks like i usually
do as a

348
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
do as a
 

349
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,589
do as a
as a bulk building material and

350
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
as a bulk building material and
 

351
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,189
as a bulk building material and
this is going to be sort of the center

352
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
this is going to be sort of the center
 

353
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,550
this is going to be sort of the center
if i figured this out right and i want

354
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
if i figured this out right and i want
 

355
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,589
if i figured this out right and i want
to go

356
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599

 

357
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,749

what do i want to do guys i don't know

358
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
what do i want to do guys i don't know
 

359
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,230
what do i want to do guys i don't know
maybe we'll go up a little ways

360
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,240

 

361
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,710

is that a good plan

362
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720

 

363
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,309

this is challenging because there's a

364
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
this is challenging because there's a
 

365
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,790
this is challenging because there's a
lot of intricate details and

366
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
lot of intricate details and
 

367
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,150
lot of intricate details and
if i just if i get it wrong by one block

368
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,160
if i just if i get it wrong by one block
 

369
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,430
if i just if i get it wrong by one block
it's gonna bug me so much so i gotta get

370
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
it's gonna bug me so much so i gotta get
 

371
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,309
it's gonna bug me so much so i gotta get
it right here

372
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319

 

373
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,070

i kind of feel no i think that's right

374
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
i kind of feel no i think that's right
 

375
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,430
i kind of feel no i think that's right
that's right so

376
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440

 

377
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,510

because not all the caves are lit up in

378
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
because not all the caves are lit up in
 

379
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,029
because not all the caves are lit up in
this area it's not going to be

380
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
this area it's not going to be
 

381
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,029
this area it's not going to be
super duper efficient this is more of a

382
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
super duper efficient this is more of a
 

383
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,869
super duper efficient this is more of a
practical mob farm

384
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
practical mob farm
 

385
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,869
practical mob farm
than it is a super efficient one which

386
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
than it is a super efficient one which
 

387
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,189
than it is a super efficient one which
means it's easy to build

388
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
means it's easy to build
 

389
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,869
means it's easy to build
and and quick to build

390
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
and and quick to build
 

391
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,270
and and quick to build
of course as well there's no pistons or

392
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
of course as well there's no pistons or
 

393
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,869
of course as well there's no pistons or
anything which is nice

394
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
anything which is nice
 

395
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,469
anything which is nice
it would work a little bit better if it

396
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
it would work a little bit better if it
 

397
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,070
it would work a little bit better if it
was up in the sky because then

398
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
was up in the sky because then
 

399
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,269
was up in the sky because then
i wouldn't have to worry about lighting

400
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
i wouldn't have to worry about lighting
 

401
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,909
i wouldn't have to worry about lighting
up caves or anything but i would have to

402
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
up caves or anything but i would have to
 

403
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,310
up caves or anything but i would have to
move

404
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
move
 

405
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,750
move
my my character up in the sky for it to

406
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
my my character up in the sky for it to
 

407
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,750
my my character up in the sky for it to
function

408
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
function
 

409
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,990
function
properly uh to get the max spawn rates

410
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
properly uh to get the max spawn rates
 

411
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,230
properly uh to get the max spawn rates
um all right think for a second

412
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
um all right think for a second
 

413
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,470
um all right think for a second
i i i'm trying to make a 13.

414
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
i i i'm trying to make a 13.
 

415
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,990
i i i'm trying to make a 13.
well i guess we should go 15. 15

416
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
well i guess we should go 15. 15
 

417
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,670
well i guess we should go 15. 15
by uh

418
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
by uh
 

419
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,389
by uh
let's do i guess 8 is the number i'm

420
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
let's do i guess 8 is the number i'm
 

421
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,030
let's do i guess 8 is the number i'm
looking for

422
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
looking for
 

423
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,630
looking for
one two three four five six oh

424
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
one two three four five six oh
 

425
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,470
one two three four five six oh
seven eight and we may need to tear out

426
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
seven eight and we may need to tear out
 

427
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,030
seven eight and we may need to tear out
some of this uh sugar chain farm we got

428
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040
some of this uh sugar chain farm we got
 

429
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,630
some of this uh sugar chain farm we got
here

430
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
here
 

431
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,190
here
and this is gonna be our first pad over

432
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
and this is gonna be our first pad over
 

433
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,190
and this is gonna be our first pad over
here

434
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
here
 

435
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,550
here
oh like so

436
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
oh like so
 

437
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,470
oh like so
and then there's gonna be a water stream

438
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
and then there's gonna be a water stream
 

439
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,670
and then there's gonna be a water stream
in this middle running

440
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
in this middle running
 

441
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,030
in this middle running
this way towards the center and then

442
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
this way towards the center and then
 

443
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,150
this way towards the center and then
this way uh and then we're gonna have

444
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
this way uh and then we're gonna have
 

445
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,990
this way uh and then we're gonna have
another pad

446
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
another pad
 

447
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,550
another pad
on this side same size and shape

448
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560

 

449
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,350

let's see one two three four five six

450
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
let's see one two three four five six
 

451
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,389
let's see one two three four five six
seven

452
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
seven
 

453
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,990
seven
oh eight there we go

454
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
oh eight there we go
 

455
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,750
oh eight there we go
um we're gonna have to go find some

456
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
um we're gonna have to go find some
 

457
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,070
um we're gonna have to go find some
ocelots and tame them which is the worst

458
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
ocelots and tame them which is the worst
 

459
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,550
ocelots and tame them which is the worst
thing

460
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
thing
 

461
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,030
thing
in the world to do because it requires

462
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
in the world to do because it requires
 

463
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,949
in the world to do because it requires
fish and they run away and they

464
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
fish and they run away and they
 

465
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,630
fish and they run away and they
give you a hard time

466
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640

 

467
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,790

and i don't really have any close by

468
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
and i don't really have any close by
 

469
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,230
and i don't really have any close by
jungles either which

470
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
jungles either which
 

471
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,630
jungles either which
which makes it fun but we'll get some

472
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
which makes it fun but we'll get some
 

473
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,630
which makes it fun but we'll get some
ocelots pretty quick here

474
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640

 

475
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,910

there we go okay

476
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
there we go okay
 

477
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,910
there we go okay
this will be our first layer i'm going

478
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
this will be our first layer i'm going
 

479
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,350
this will be our first layer i'm going
to fill this in

480
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
to fill this in
 

481
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,550
to fill this in
put up some walls as well around here

482
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
put up some walls as well around here
 

483
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,550
put up some walls as well around here
and in total i'm gonna probably want

484
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
and in total i'm gonna probably want
 

485
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,710
and in total i'm gonna probably want
five layers to this farm at least maybe

486
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
five layers to this farm at least maybe
 

487
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,509
five layers to this farm at least maybe
six to get about a thousand spawning

488
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
six to get about a thousand spawning
 

489
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,230
six to get about a thousand spawning
spaces

490
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
spaces
 

491
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,870
spaces
but we'll just try to set up one layer

492
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
but we'll just try to set up one layer
 

493
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,470
but we'll just try to set up one layer
here to start off with

494
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480

 

495
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,110

okay well that's the first layer there

496
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
okay well that's the first layer there
 

497
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,310
okay well that's the first layer there
we'll have to do something with the

498
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
we'll have to do something with the
 

499
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,509
we'll have to do something with the
outside

500
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
outside
 

501
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,350
outside
because we're gonna go at least four

502
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
because we're gonna go at least four
 

503
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,790
because we're gonna go at least four
more layers on this thing so it's gonna

504
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
more layers on this thing so it's gonna
 

505
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,030
more layers on this thing so it's gonna
be a giant eyesore

506
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
be a giant eyesore
 

507
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,870
be a giant eyesore
with the way it is so we'll have to

508
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
with the way it is so we'll have to
 

509
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,870
with the way it is so we'll have to
dress up the outside somewhat

510
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880

design i'm going with here
 

545
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,829

oops yeah so we need a half slab above
 

601
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,710
oops yeah so we need a half slab above
that and then we'll put

602
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
that and then we'll put
 

603
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,269

to get yet
 

607
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,030
to get yet
um the way it works with

608
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
um the way it works with
 

609
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,990
um the way it works with
the wolf and the ocelot ai if there is a

610
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
the wolf and the ocelot ai if there is a
 

611
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,350
the wolf and the ocelot ai if there is a
creeper

612
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,360
creeper
 

613
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,629
creeper
or a skeleton within

614
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
or a skeleton within
 

615
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,750
or a skeleton within
six blocks out six blocks this way or

616
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
six blocks out six blocks this way or
 

617
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,750
six blocks out six blocks this way or
six blocks this way from

618
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:13,760
six blocks this way from
 

619
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,470
six blocks this way from
from them or alternatively six blocks

620
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
from them or alternatively six blocks
 

621
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:16,870
from them or alternatively six blocks
back

622
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
back
 

623
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,470
back
behind this wall but we're not worrying

624
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
behind this wall but we're not worrying
 

625
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,150
behind this wall but we're not worrying
about that um

626
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160

 

627
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,110

then they will try to run to a safe area

628
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
then they will try to run to a safe area
 

629
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,550
then they will try to run to a safe area
so it doesn't matter if

630
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
so it doesn't matter if
 

631
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,750
so it doesn't matter if
like a an ocelot or a skeleton not an

632
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
like a an ocelot or a skeleton not an
 

633
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,790
like a an ocelot or a skeleton not an
ocelot

634
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
ocelot
 

635
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,990
ocelot
a creeper a skeleton spawn here uh it's

636
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
a creeper a skeleton spawn here uh it's
 

637
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,670
a creeper a skeleton spawn here uh it's
not like they try to run away

638
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
not like they try to run away
 

639
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,509
not like they try to run away
from the wolf like it's not like they're

640
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
from the wolf like it's not like they're
 

641
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,030
from the wolf like it's not like they're
gonna try to run this way

642
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
gonna try to run this way
 

643
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,829
gonna try to run this way
they will try to run to a safe area so

644
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
they will try to run to a safe area so
 

645
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,150
they will try to run to a safe area so
they

646
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
they
 

647
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,790
they
will consider all of this the ocelot and

648
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:44,800
will consider all of this the ocelot and
 

649
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,990
will consider all of this the ocelot and
the wolf territory

650
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
the wolf territory
 

651
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,230
the wolf territory
so they'll try to run to this other side

652
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
so they'll try to run to this other side
 

653
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,470
so they'll try to run to this other side
to get away from it

654
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480
to get away from it
 

655
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,629
to get away from it
um is the way it works and it's not a

656
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
um is the way it works and it's not a
 

657
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,710
um is the way it works and it's not a
radius thing it seems to work in a

658
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
radius thing it seems to work in a
 

659
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,550
radius thing it seems to work in a
square shape um so it's not like if they

660
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
square shape um so it's not like if they
 

661
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,949
square shape um so it's not like if they
were eight blocks out

662
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
were eight blocks out
 

663
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,509
were eight blocks out
um that that they would see this guy

664
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
um that that they would see this guy
 

665
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,590
um that that they would see this guy
it's the full

666
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
it's the full
 

667
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,350
it's the full
full square shape so yeah

668
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360

676
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320

 

677
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,150

so they will see this as a full block

678
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
so they will see this as a full block
 

679
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,230
so they will see this as a full block
and they'll try to walk on it

680
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
and they'll try to walk on it
 

681
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,269
and they'll try to walk on it
with their path finding but as they try

682
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279
with their path finding but as they try
 

683
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,430
with their path finding but as they try
to walk on that they will fall down

684
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:29,440

 

685
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,110

let's get that going all along oops

686
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120

 

687
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,990

and that is about it so we got to copy

688
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
and that is about it so we got to copy
 

689
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,870
and that is about it so we got to copy
this

690
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880
this
 

691
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,430
this
at least four more times above here uh

692
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
at least four more times above here uh
 

693
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,189
at least four more times above here uh
the nice thing about this

694
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
the nice thing about this
 

695
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,990
the nice thing about this
is uh the next level can start right on

696
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
is uh the next level can start right on
 

697
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,629
is uh the next level can start right on
top of this

698
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
top of this
 

699
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,230
top of this
if we want or i may try to

700
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
if we want or i may try to
 

701
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,069
if we want or i may try to
hide some lights in here but that would

702
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
hide some lights in here but that would
 

703
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,829
hide some lights in here but that would
make it a little taller so i don't know

704
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
make it a little taller so i don't know
 

705
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,670
make it a little taller so i don't know
if it's worth it

706
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
if it's worth it
 

707
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,430
if it's worth it
uh to enable or disable the system

708
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,440
uh to enable or disable the system
 

709
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,550
uh to enable or disable the system
all right one second i think we should

710
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560
all right one second i think we should
 

711
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,870
all right one second i think we should
also

712
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
also
 

713
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,629
also
we'll put half slabs down this will

714
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
we'll put half slabs down this will
 

715
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,629
we'll put half slabs down this will
prevent spiders from spawning

716
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:08,639
prevent spiders from spawning
 

717
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,389
prevent spiders from spawning
because spiders need a three by three

718
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
because spiders need a three by three
 

719
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,790
because spiders need a three by three
area to spawn so if if they try to spawn

720
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:12,800
area to spawn so if if they try to spawn
 

721
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,750
area to spawn so if if they try to spawn
on this

722
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
on this
 

723
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,509
on this
block here for example it will check

724
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
block here for example it will check
 

725
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,350
block here for example it will check
this area all around it and since

726
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
this area all around it and since
 

727
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,949
this area all around it and since
there's a half slab here

728
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
there's a half slab here
 

729
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,590
there's a half slab here
it cancels the spawning when it attempts

730
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
it cancels the spawning when it attempts
 

731
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,790
it cancels the spawning when it attempts
to do it

732
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:24,800

 

733
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,829

oops not there right there and

734
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
oops not there right there and
 

735
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,670
oops not there right there and
i think i'm going to do it like this

736
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680
i think i'm going to do it like this
 

737
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,430
i think i'm going to do it like this
the only problem with these half slabs

738
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
the only problem with these half slabs
 

739
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,990
the only problem with these half slabs
is they kind of block

740
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
is they kind of block
 

741
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,430
is they kind of block
uh the mobs like sometimes they can get

742
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
uh the mobs like sometimes they can get
 

743
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,030
uh the mobs like sometimes they can get
in the way most of the time it's pretty

744
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
in the way most of the time it's pretty
 

745
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,670
in the way most of the time it's pretty
good though

746
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
good though
 

747
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,949
good though
they don't seem to cause too much

748
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
they don't seem to cause too much
 

749
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,150
they don't seem to cause too much
trouble from what i've tested anyway

750
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
trouble from what i've tested anyway
 

751
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,110
trouble from what i've tested anyway
uh so then we'll cover this all up and

752
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
uh so then we'll cover this all up and
 

753
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,949
uh so then we'll cover this all up and
for

754
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
for
 

755
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,230
for
for while i'm building this i'll

756
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
for while i'm building this i'll
 

757
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:05,510
for while i'm building this i'll
probably put torches inside

758
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:05,520

try out our horse elevator

802
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360

 

803
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,029

still works that's good i haven't used

804
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,039
still works that's good i haven't used
 

805
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,789
still works that's good i haven't used
in a while

806
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
in a while
 

807
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,750
in a while
and we need to head out kind of where my

808
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
and we need to head out kind of where my
 

809
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,350
and we need to head out kind of where my
stronghold base is

810
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
stronghold base is
 

811
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,909
stronghold base is
i think there's a jungle sort of in that

812
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
i think there's a jungle sort of in that
 

813
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,429
i think there's a jungle sort of in that
area

814
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
area
 

815
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,069
area
but instead of like the stronghold bases

816
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
but instead of like the stronghold bases
 

817
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,189
but instead of like the stronghold bases
that way

818
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,199
that way
 

819
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,350
that way
i think the jungle is like that way

820
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360

 

821
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,430

what my plans are with this mob system a

1034
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
what my plans are with this mob system a
 

1035
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,430
what my plans are with this mob system a
little bit more

1036
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,440
little bit more
 

1037
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,270
little bit more
uh so i built a couple more layers i

1038
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
uh so i built a couple more layers i
 

1039
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,789
uh so i built a couple more layers i
still need

1040
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:44,799
still need
 

1041
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,750
still need
like two more but uh the way i'm doing

1042
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
like two more but uh the way i'm doing
 

1043
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,909
like two more but uh the way i'm doing
the water stream i could make it so that

1044
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
the water stream i could make it so that
 

1045
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,789
the water stream i could make it so that
they

1046
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:50,799
they
 

1047
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,909
they
like flow to the middle have it going

1048
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:53,919
like flow to the middle have it going
 

1049
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,870
like flow to the middle have it going
this way and

1050
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:54,880
this way and
 

1051
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,110
this way and
and this way but i'm going to be making

1052
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
and this way but i'm going to be making
 

1053
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,789
and this way but i'm going to be making
it go sideways instead so

1054
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:00,799
it go sideways instead so
 

1055
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,029
it go sideways instead so
i'm putting water all along here

1056
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:05,039
i'm putting water all along here
 

1057
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,669
i'm putting water all along here
uh just for a change and also it will

1058
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
uh just for a change and also it will
 

1059
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,830
uh just for a change and also it will
help reduce travel time

1060
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:09,840
help reduce travel time
 

1061
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,590
help reduce travel time
because uh the mobs don't have to get

1062
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,600
because uh the mobs don't have to get
 

1063
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,669
because uh the mobs don't have to get
sent to the the middle the pretty much

1064
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
sent to the the middle the pretty much
 

1065
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,510
sent to the the middle the pretty much
as soon as they fall down here

1066
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
as soon as they fall down here
 

1067
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,590
as soon as they fall down here
uh fault fall again um

1068
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:23,600
uh fault fall again um
 

1069
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,990
uh fault fall again um
yeah i was just thinking is this even

1070
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,000
yeah i was just thinking is this even
 

1071
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,710
yeah i was just thinking is this even
necessary

1072
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:26,720
necessary
 

1073
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,789
necessary
but yeah it kind of is and then what i'm

1074
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:28,799
but yeah it kind of is and then what i'm
 

1075
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,909
but yeah it kind of is and then what i'm
going to be doing is uh

1076
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:31,919
going to be doing is uh
 

1077
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,149
going to be doing is uh
i'll be i want to set this up with a

1078
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
i'll be i want to set this up with a
 

1079
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,750
i'll be i want to set this up with a
portal system too kind of like we did

1080
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
portal system too kind of like we did
 

1081
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:35,990
portal system too kind of like we did
with

1082
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
with
 

1083
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,630
with
the zombie pigman farm the gold farm

1084
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:40,640
the zombie pigman farm the gold farm
 

1085
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,710
the zombie pigman farm the gold farm
except in reverse so we'll be sending

1086
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
except in reverse so we'll be sending
 

1087
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,230
except in reverse so we'll be sending
mobs to the nether

1088
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
mobs to the nether
 

1089
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,669
mobs to the nether
just for an experiment i don't know if

1090
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:47,679
just for an experiment i don't know if
 

1091
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,590
just for an experiment i don't know if
i'm going to actually use it that way

1092
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
i'm going to actually use it that way
 

1093
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,310
i'm going to actually use it that way
but i want to have the option so we're

1094
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,320
but i want to have the option so we're
 

1095
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,909
but i want to have the option so we're
going to put a giant portal here

1096
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:53,919
going to put a giant portal here
 

1097
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,630
going to put a giant portal here
oh darn it

1098
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640

 

1099
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,310

there we go right

1100
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,320
there we go right
 

1101
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,470
there we go right
which we have the option of having on or

1102
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
which we have the option of having on or
 

1103
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,390
which we have the option of having on or
not uh if it's off

1104
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
not uh if it's off
 

1105
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,750
not uh if it's off
i want the mobs to flow and then

1106
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
i want the mobs to flow and then
 

1107
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,390
i want the mobs to flow and then
fall down a strip here and this will

1108
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
fall down a strip here and this will
 

1109
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,310
fall down a strip here and this will
go down to a room that i plan on setting

1110
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
go down to a room that i plan on setting
 

1111
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,990
go down to a room that i plan on setting
up down below here about 32

1112
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,000
up down below here about 32
 

1113
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,269
up down below here about 32
blocks down um

1114
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:21,279
blocks down um
 

1115
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,830
blocks down um
that we saw at the start of this episode

1116
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
that we saw at the start of this episode
 

1117
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,830
that we saw at the start of this episode
in the man cave there

1118
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840
in the man cave there
 

1119
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,149
in the man cave there
um so yeah that's kind of the general

1120
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:28,159
um so yeah that's kind of the general
 

1121
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,230
um so yeah that's kind of the general
plan to it

1122
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,240
plan to it
 

1123
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,909
plan to it
it turns out good this is kind of like a

1124
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:33,919
it turns out good this is kind of like a
 

1125
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,510
it turns out good this is kind of like a
just a fun experiment

1126
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:35,520
just a fun experiment
 

1127
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,070
just a fun experiment
try a new mob system out it's always

1128
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,080
try a new mob system out it's always
 

1129
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,430
try a new mob system out it's always
cool

1130
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
cool
 

1131
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,350
cool
and i guess we'll have to have signs

1132
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360
and i guess we'll have to have signs
 

1133
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,190
and i guess we'll have to have signs
going all along here to hold the water

1134
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
going all along here to hold the water
 

1135
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,669
going all along here to hold the water
in place if the portal is not there

1136
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
in place if the portal is not there
 

1137
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,269
in place if the portal is not there
although if the portal is not there it's

1138
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:49,279
although if the portal is not there it's
 

1139
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,370
although if the portal is not there it's
going to fall down here

1140
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:51,380
going to fall down here
 

1141
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,549
going to fall down here

see i may want to lower this one more
block because of that

1146
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
block because of that
 

1147
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,310
block because of that
anyway so that's that's the general plan

1148
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,320
anyway so that's that's the general plan
 

1149
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,950
anyway so that's that's the general plan
for this

1150
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960

map making in this game which

1238
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
map making in this game which
 

1239
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,230
map making in this game which
i haven't seen a lot done with yet but i

1240
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:42,240
i haven't seen a lot done with yet but i
 

1241
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,789
i haven't seen a lot done with yet but i
think it has a lot of potential

1242
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799
think it has a lot of potential
 

1243
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,590
think it has a lot of potential
because you can basically program now

1244
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
because you can basically program now
 

1245
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,510
because you can basically program now
with map making in this game

1246
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
with map making in this game
 

1247
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,310
with map making in this game
and they even recently added a feature

1248
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
and they even recently added a feature
 

1249
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,430
and they even recently added a feature
where you can do

1250
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:53,440
where you can do
 

1251
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,950
where you can do
arithmetic operations with command

1252
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:56,960
arithmetic operations with command
 

1253
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,909
arithmetic operations with command
blocks so you can do

1254
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
blocks so you can do
 

1255
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,390
blocks so you can do
adding and subtracting multiplying

1256
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400
adding and subtracting multiplying
 

1257
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,029
adding and subtracting multiplying
dividing and

1258
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:03,039
dividing and
 

1259
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,909
dividing and
yeah i see a lot of potential with

1260
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:05,919
yeah i see a lot of potential with
 

1261
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,350
yeah i see a lot of potential with
something like that that's something i

1262
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:07,360
something like that that's something i
 

1263
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,549
something like that that's something i
really wanted

1264
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:08,559
really wanted
 

1265
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,230
really wanted
in this game and i think a lot of cool

1266
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,240
in this game and i think a lot of cool
 

1267
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,070
in this game and i think a lot of cool
maps will take advantage of that in the

1268
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,080
maps will take advantage of that in the
 

1269
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,430
maps will take advantage of that in the
future

1270
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:13,440
future
 

1271
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,190
future

along with all the other cool new
 

1273
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,630
along with all the other cool new
features so

1274
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:16,640
features so
 

1275
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,470
features so
it's true redstone and that may have

1276
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
it's true redstone and that may have
 

1277
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,310
it's true redstone and that may have
gotten easier and it's not as

1278
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,320
gotten easier and it's not as
 

1279
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,590
gotten easier and it's not as
challenging for certain things

1280
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:23,600
challenging for certain things
 

1281
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,750
challenging for certain things
it does allow you to take it to another

1282
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:25,760
it does allow you to take it to another

level
which kind of adds the challenge back

1286
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
which kind of adds the challenge back
 

1287
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,590
which kind of adds the challenge back
