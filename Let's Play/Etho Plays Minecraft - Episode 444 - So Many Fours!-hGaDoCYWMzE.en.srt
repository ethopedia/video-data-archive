this lab right but if you look at our
lighting the lighting is good

20
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,050
lighting the lighting is good
 

21
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,950
lighting the lighting is good
the lighting is just fine like most mobs

22
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
the lighting is just fine like most mobs
 

23
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,770

need 7 or less to spawn we're at like 9

24
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:41,780
need 7 or less to spawn we're at like 9
 

25

need 7 or less to spawn we're at like 9
10 11 you know I made sure when I built

26
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:45,780
10 11 you know I made sure when I built
 

27
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,319
10 11 you know I made sure when I built
this thing we were good but I'm still

28
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:48,329
this thing we were good but I'm still
 

29
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,940
this thing we were good but I'm still
getting zombies spawning in it only

30
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:49,950
getting zombies spawning in it only
 

31
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,709
getting zombies spawning in it only
zombies because I'm pretty sure it's due

32
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
zombies because I'm pretty sure it's due
 

33
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,049
zombies because I'm pretty sure it's due
to this mob system over here when the

34
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:57,059
to this mob system over here when the
 

35
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,660
to this mob system over here when the
zombies fall down if they survive or

36
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:02,670
zombies fall down if they survive or
 

37
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,830
zombies fall down if they survive or
maybe even if they die

38
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
maybe even if they die
 

39
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,719
maybe even if they die
I think only if they survive they have a

40
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:05,729
I think only if they survive they have a
 

41
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:08,899
I think only if they survive they have a
chance of calling a reinforcements those

42
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:08,909
chance of calling a reinforcements those
 

43
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,600
chance of calling a reinforcements those
can spawn at light level 9 or less so a

44
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:11,610
can spawn at light level 9 or less so a
 

45
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,390
can spawn at light level 9 or less so a
little bit brighter area which is why

46
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
little bit brighter area which is why
 

47
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,760
little bit brighter area which is why

system so he can express his motions or

144
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:25,780
system so he can express his motions or
 

145
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,690
system so he can express his motions or
his a state of well-being right now he's

146
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:27,700
his a state of well-being right now he's
 

147
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,990
his a state of well-being right now he's
dead I think he has six different faces

148

there which is depleted he has a weight

152
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,040
there which is depleted he has a weight
 

153
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,539
there which is depleted he has a weight
um so if I over feed him he gains weight

154
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:39,549
um so if I over feed him he gains weight
 

155
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:41,069
um so if I over feed him he gains weight
if I under feed him he loses weights

156
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:41,079
if I under feed him he loses weights
 

157
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,620
if I under feed him he loses weights
he's got a happiness meter up there and

he's got a happiness meter up there and
a hunger meter right there alright so

160
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:47,079
a hunger meter right there alright so
 

161
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,319
a hunger meter right there alright so
the goal is to keep all all these bars

162
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:49,329
the goal is to keep all all these bars
 

163
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,830
the goal is to keep all all these bars
in tip-top shape so that he doesn't die

164
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:52,840
in tip-top shape so that he doesn't die
 

165
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,270
in tip-top shape so that he doesn't die
on us and that I he's a healthy pet

166
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
on us and that I he's a healthy pet
 

167
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,349
on us and that I he's a healthy pet
basically all right so couple issues

168
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:01,359
basically all right so couple issues
 

169
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:01,920
basically all right so couple issues
with

170
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:01,930
with
 

171
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,130
with
our Wilson guy here though I think

172
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:05,140
our Wilson guy here though I think
 

173
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,610
our Wilson guy here though I think
that's how we turn him back on okay

174
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:08,620
that's how we turn him back on okay
 

175
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,509
that's how we turn him back on okay
that's a sick face right now he's sick

176
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
that's a sick face right now he's sick
 

177
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,449
that's a sick face right now he's sick
uh-huh

178
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:14,459
uh-huh
 

179
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,770
uh-huh
we ran a beta test to this guy and like

180
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:19,780
we ran a beta test to this guy and like
 

181
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,960
we ran a beta test to this guy and like
it does work the system but it's just a

182
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:21,970
it does work the system but it's just a
 

183
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,090
it does work the system but it's just a
little bit plain right now and there's a

184
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:24,100
little bit plain right now and there's a
 

185
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,379
little bit plain right now and there's a
couple things I want to change like

186
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:25,389
couple things I want to change like
 

187
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,540
couple things I want to change like
right now his facial expression is

188
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:27,550
right now his facial expression is
 

189
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,090
right now his facial expression is
linked to his happiness meter which

190
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,100
linked to his happiness meter which
 

191
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,710
linked to his happiness meter which
doesn't make sense because he can be in

192
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
doesn't make sense because he can be in
 

193
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,050
doesn't make sense because he can be in
the best of moods like smiling and then

194
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,060
the best of moods like smiling and then
 

195
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,200
the best of moods like smiling and then
he can be dead the next second so I want

196
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,210
he can be dead the next second so I want
 

197
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,120
he can be dead the next second so I want
to change his facial expression to link

198
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,130
to change his facial expression to link
 

199
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,810
to change his facial expression to link
up to his health bar makes more sense to

200
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:45,820
up to his health bar makes more sense to
 

201
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,480
up to his health bar makes more sense to
me and we just have to add more variety

202
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:48,490
me and we just have to add more variety
 

203
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,480
me and we just have to add more variety
to the Wilson game because as it was it

204
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:51,490
to the Wilson game because as it was it
 

205
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,180
to the Wilson game because as it was it
seemed a little bit plain we need more

206
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,190
seemed a little bit plain we need more
 

207
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,629
seemed a little bit plain we need more
things like we need to make it so at

208
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:57,639
things like we need to make it so at
 

209
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,879
things like we need to make it so at
night time he gets angry at us if we

210
00:04:59,879 --> 00:04:59,889
night time he gets angry at us if we
 

211
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:01,499
night time he gets angry at us if we
wake him up that kind of stuff maybe

212
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:01,509
wake him up that kind of stuff maybe
 

213
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,710
wake him up that kind of stuff maybe
make it so he poops and gets sick easier

214
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
make it so he poops and gets sick easier
 

215
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,180
make it so he poops and gets sick easier
you know little little things like that

216
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,190
you know little little things like that
 

217
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,980
you know little little things like that
all right I'm going to start tearing

218
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:10,990
all right I'm going to start tearing
 

219
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,980
all right I'm going to start tearing
stuff outs mmm

220
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:13,990
stuff outs mmm
 

221
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,089
stuff outs mmm
that shouldn't be he's very angry right

222
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:18,099
that shouldn't be he's very angry right
 

223
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:24,230
that shouldn't be he's very angry right
now come on Wilson you can die it's okay

224
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240

 

225
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,629

there we go good boy he's dead yep so

226
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
there we go good boy he's dead yep so
 

227
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,580
there we go good boy he's dead yep so
I've been working on Wilson here for a

228
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:32,590
I've been working on Wilson here for a
 

229
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,020
I've been working on Wilson here for a
little while now making very good

230
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,030
little while now making very good
 

231
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,050
little while now making very good
progress I'm happy to say we did not

232
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,060
progress I'm happy to say we did not
 

233
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,960
progress I'm happy to say we did not
have to destroy all the wiring I found a

234
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:39,970
have to destroy all the wiring I found a
 

235
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,779
have to destroy all the wiring I found a
way to do what I wanted to do without

236
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:42,789
way to do what I wanted to do without
 

237
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:46,110
way to do what I wanted to do without
tearing it all out because this is more

238
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,120
tearing it all out because this is more
 

239
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,909
tearing it all out because this is more
complicated than I remember I was going

240
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
complicated than I remember I was going
 

241
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,560
complicated than I remember I was going
through some of this stuff it's like no

242
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:49,570
through some of this stuff it's like no
 

243
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,730
through some of this stuff it's like no
I can't rebuild this there is no way dig

244
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:53,740
I can't rebuild this there is no way dig
 

245
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,670
I can't rebuild this there is no way dig
way too long but yeah I just did a I

246
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:56,680
way too long but yeah I just did a I
 

247
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,499
way too long but yeah I just did a I
found a way to do a patch job just to

248
00:05:58,499 --> 00:05:58,509
found a way to do a patch job just to
 

249
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,930
found a way to do a patch job just to
add another wiring another wire into

250
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:00,940
add another wiring another wire into
 

251
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,760
add another wiring another wire into
into Wilson to make it work

252
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:02,770
into Wilson to make it work
 

253
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,310
into Wilson to make it work
so now his face is hooked up to the

254
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:05,320
so now his face is hooked up to the
 

255
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,200
so now his face is hooked up to the
health meter instead of the happiness

256
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,210
health meter instead of the happiness
 

257
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,570
health meter instead of the happiness
meter which sounds like a simple thing

258
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:09,580
meter which sounds like a simple thing
 

259
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,659
meter which sounds like a simple thing
but it was a bit tricky actually it's

260
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:12,669
but it was a bit tricky actually it's
 

261
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,430
but it was a bit tricky actually it's
funny when I'm looking at my wiring now

262
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:14,440
funny when I'm looking at my wiring now
 

263
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,600
funny when I'm looking at my wiring now
in the

264
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:15,610
in the
 

265
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,409
in the
future here I think I have learned a few

266
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:19,419
future here I think I have learned a few
 

267
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:22,589
future here I think I have learned a few
things like very rarely in my wiring did

268
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:22,599
things like very rarely in my wiring did
 

269
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,469
things like very rarely in my wiring did
I use this this little trick with the

270
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:25,479
I use this this little trick with the
 

271
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:28,080
I use this this little trick with the
slabs you know where you can go up very

272
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,090
slabs you know where you can go up very
 

273
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,230
slabs you know where you can go up very
compactly I don't think I knew how to do

274
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:31,240
compactly I don't think I knew how to do
 

275
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,670
compactly I don't think I knew how to do
that when we first built Wilson because

276
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:32,680
that when we first built Wilson because
 

277
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,350
that when we first built Wilson because
we built Wilson when the redstone update

278
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:34,360
we built Wilson when the redstone update
 

279
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,170
we built Wilson when the redstone update
first came out so like hoppers renew

280
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:37,180
first came out so like hoppers renew
 

281
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,659
first came out so like hoppers renew
droppers comparators all that stuff I'm

282
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:39,669
droppers comparators all that stuff I'm
 

283
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:42,809
droppers comparators all that stuff I'm
pretty sure I did not know how to pass a

284
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:42,819
pretty sure I did not know how to pass a
 

285
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,350
pretty sure I did not know how to pass a
comparator signal as well so you can go

286
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:46,360
comparator signal as well so you can go
 

287
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,529
comparator signal as well so you can go
comparator redstone dust block

288
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:48,539
comparator redstone dust block
 

289
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,149
comparator redstone dust block
comparator block redstone dust you can

290
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:51,159
comparator block redstone dust you can
 

291
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,529
comparator block redstone dust you can
move it up to three blocks before you

292
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:52,539
move it up to three blocks before you
 

293
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:57,209
move it up to three blocks before you
need another comparator um and yeah so

294
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:57,219
need another comparator um and yeah so
 

295
00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:00,629
need another comparator um and yeah so
we have a signal of two or one that'll

296
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
we have a signal of two or one that'll
 

297
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,820
we have a signal of two or one that'll
be one and see it carries it all the way

298
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:02,830
be one and see it carries it all the way
 

299
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,279
be one and see it carries it all the way
through which is pretty cool so it's

300
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:05,289
through which is pretty cool so it's
 

301
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:07,140
through which is pretty cool so it's
like a comparator repeater basically

302
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,150
like a comparator repeater basically
 

303
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,719
like a comparator repeater basically
keeps the analog signal and that's what

304
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:09,729
keeps the analog signal and that's what
 

305
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,800
keeps the analog signal and that's what
I had to do here to get this to work so

306
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:13,810
I had to do here to get this to work so
 

307
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,830
I had to do here to get this to work so
from the health memory this is the

308
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:16,840
from the health memory this is the
 

309
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,869
from the health memory this is the
hell's over here

310
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:18,879
hell's over here
 

311
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,079
hell's over here
I went I added in another wire down

312
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:22,089
I went I added in another wire down
 

313
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:24,350
I went I added in another wire down
below here so the comparator goes down

314
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:24,360
below here so the comparator goes down
 

315
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,659
below here so the comparator goes down
then we got comparator comparator does

316
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:27,669
then we got comparator comparator does
 

317
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:29,700
then we got comparator comparator does
like a zig zag here comparator

318
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:29,710
like a zig zag here comparator
 

319
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,189
like a zig zag here comparator
comparator kind of repeats the signal

320
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:32,199
comparator kind of repeats the signal
 

321
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,850
comparator kind of repeats the signal
all the way down to over here I did have

322
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:35,860
all the way down to over here I did have
 

323
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,469
all the way down to over here I did have
to move a bunch of wiring to make this

324
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:37,479
to move a bunch of wiring to make this
 

325
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,050
to move a bunch of wiring to make this
work though otherwise it would have went

326
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:40,060
work though otherwise it would have went
 

327
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,920
work though otherwise it would have went
through it and not worked properly that

328
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:43,930
through it and not worked properly that
 

329
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,469
through it and not worked properly that
took a bit of time but before this is

330
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
took a bit of time but before this is
 

331
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,390
took a bit of time but before this is
the happiness memory over here this is

332
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
the happiness memory over here this is
 

333
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,909
the happiness memory over here this is
what used to control the face and all

334
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:50,919
what used to control the face and all
 

335
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,679
what used to control the face and all
that stuff and I had like a comparator

336
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:52,689
that stuff and I had like a comparator
 

337
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,809
that stuff and I had like a comparator
here doing that but I was able to get

338
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:54,819
here doing that but I was able to get
 

339
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:57,480
here doing that but I was able to get
rid of it and just pass a signal some

340
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:57,490
rid of it and just pass a signal some
 

341
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,670
rid of it and just pass a signal some
distance to over here from the the

342
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
distance to over here from the the
 

343
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,550
distance to over here from the the
health and all is good so basically we

344
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
health and all is good so basically we
 

345
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,610
health and all is good so basically we
did what I wanted to do the main tricky

346
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:05,620
did what I wanted to do the main tricky
 

347
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,459
did what I wanted to do the main tricky
thing now we can add like other stuff

348
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:08,469
thing now we can add like other stuff
 

349
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:13,740
thing now we can add like other stuff
and dispatch that into so three three

350
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:13,750
and dispatch that into so three three
 

351
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,679
and dispatch that into so three three
lights this is his neutral face seems to

352
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:16,689
lights this is his neutral face seems to
 

353
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:20,579
lights this is his neutral face seems to
be working okay now so what should we do

354
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:20,589
be working okay now so what should we do
 

355
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:22,730
be working okay now so what should we do
next good question

356
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:22,740
next good question
 

357
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,620
next good question
I'll have to think about it

358
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:26,630
I'll have to think about it
 

359
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,680
I'll have to think about it
I was just doing some testing here like

360
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:29,690
I was just doing some testing here like
 

361
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,840
I was just doing some testing here like
right now Wilson is sick I tried to give

362
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:31,850
right now Wilson is sick I tried to give
 

363
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,700
right now Wilson is sick I tried to give
him his medicine this is what cures them

364
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:33,710
him his medicine this is what cures them
 

365
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,500
him his medicine this is what cures them
right so I throw it in his food thing

366
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:35,510
right so I throw it in his food thing
 

367
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,339
right so I throw it in his food thing
and look at that it gets stuck on the

368
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:39,349
and look at that it gets stuck on the
 

369
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:45,880
and look at that it gets stuck on the
hopper like any block except for that

370
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:45,890
hopper like any block except for that
 

371
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,790
hopper like any block except for that
one if you throw it into the middle of

372
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,800
one if you throw it into the middle of
 

373
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,680
one if you throw it into the middle of
the hopper it falls down like it doesn't

374
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:50,690
the hopper it falls down like it doesn't
 

375
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,600
the hopper it falls down like it doesn't
pick up a full block has that always

376
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:52,610
pick up a full block has that always
 

377
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,060
pick up a full block has that always
been a thing or and I just never noticed

378
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,070
been a thing or and I just never noticed
 

379
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,280
been a thing or and I just never noticed
or is that new 21.9 I wonder that's an

380
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:00,290
or is that new 21.9 I wonder that's an
 

381
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:05,130
or is that new 21.9 I wonder that's an
issue though definitely an issue um if

382
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:05,140
issue though definitely an issue um if
 

383
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,540
issue though definitely an issue um if
you run it along the side of the hopper

384
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:07,550
you run it along the side of the hopper
 

385
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,040
you run it along the side of the hopper
I got a hopper right here that's being

386
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,050
I got a hopper right here that's being
 

387
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,830
I got a hopper right here that's being
powered so it won't pick up any items

388
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:11,840
powered so it won't pick up any items
 

389
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,870
powered so it won't pick up any items
but they should flow or top it but if

390
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:13,880
but they should flow or top it but if
 

391
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,550
but they should flow or top it but if
they go down the middle they sink down

392
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:15,560
they go down the middle they sink down
 

393
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,180
they go down the middle they sink down
into the hopper model you know doesn't

394
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,190
into the hopper model you know doesn't
 

395
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,140
into the hopper model you know doesn't
take up a full block now okay well we're

396
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,150
take up a full block now okay well we're
 

397
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,790
take up a full block now okay well we're
going to take this opportunity since our

398
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
going to take this opportunity since our
 

399
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,950
going to take this opportunity since our
feeding system is broken I never really

400
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:26,960
feeding system is broken I never really
 

401
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,840
feeding system is broken I never really
liked it over here to be honest this

402
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:28,850
liked it over here to be honest this
 

403
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,390
liked it over here to be honest this
doesn't make a lot of sense is this like

404
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:31,400
doesn't make a lot of sense is this like
 

405
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,220
doesn't make a lot of sense is this like
a random hole over here that we feed

406
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:33,230
a random hole over here that we feed
 

407
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,450
a random hole over here that we feed
Wilson with ideally I would like to have

408
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:37,460
Wilson with ideally I would like to have
 

409
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,370
Wilson with ideally I would like to have
to throw the food into his mouth but due

410
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:39,380
to throw the food into his mouth but due
 

411
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,580
to throw the food into his mouth but due
to the complicated Redstone behind the

412
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:42,590
to the complicated Redstone behind the
 

413
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,890
to the complicated Redstone behind the
whole facial system here we can't really

414
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:44,900
whole facial system here we can't really
 

415
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,240
whole facial system here we can't really
do something like that so I thought

416
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,250
do something like that so I thought
 

417
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,250
do something like that so I thought
maybe a good alternative would be to

418
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,260
maybe a good alternative would be to
 

419
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,210
maybe a good alternative would be to
have like an offering hole over here to

420
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:52,220
have like an offering hole over here to
 

421
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,770
have like an offering hole over here to
Wilson so if we ever want to give them

422
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:53,780
Wilson so if we ever want to give them
 

423
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,840
Wilson so if we ever want to give them
something you got to throw it into there

424
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:55,850
something you got to throw it into there
 

425
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,300
something you got to throw it into there
then we could have like a piston a

426
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,310

 

427
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:05,740

piston oh yes this is working it did not

428
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:05,750
piston oh yes this is working it did not
 

429
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,930
piston oh yes this is working it did not
work

430
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:06,940
work
 

431
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,630
work
piston yeah that extends here so if we

432
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
piston yeah that extends here so if we
 

433
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,550
piston yeah that extends here so if we
just fed them we have to wait a little

434
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
just fed them we have to wait a little
 

435
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,170
just fed them we have to wait a little
bit of time before we feed them again we

436
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:14,180
bit of time before we feed them again we
 

437
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,850
bit of time before we feed them again we
could just have this block come out so

438
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:15,860
could just have this block come out so
 

439
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,570
could just have this block come out so
that we can't keep feeding them you know

440
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:18,580
that we can't keep feeding them you know
 

441
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,860
that we can't keep feeding them you know
because it takes some time to eat you

442
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:20,870
because it takes some time to eat you
 

443
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,360
because it takes some time to eat you
know you can't just throw a million

444
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,370
know you can't just throw a million
 

445
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,240
know you can't just throw a million
steak at them and expect them to eat it

446
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,250
steak at them and expect them to eat it
 

447
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,270
steak at them and expect them to eat it
right alright so that is the new plan

448
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:28,280
right alright so that is the new plan
 

449
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,570
right alright so that is the new plan
I'm going to move all this food system

450
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:31,580
I'm going to move all this food system
 

451
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,130
I'm going to move all this food system
stuff all this stuff controlling its

452
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:33,140
stuff all this stuff controlling its
 

453
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,650
stuff all this stuff controlling its
hunger so these item filters these are

454
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:35,660
hunger so these item filters these are
 

455
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,570
hunger so these item filters these are
old-school item filters by the way there

456
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:37,580
old-school item filters by the way there
 

457
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,870
old-school item filters by the way there
they're too wide instead of the

458
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:39,880
they're too wide instead of the
 

459
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,960
they're too wide instead of the
the classic one wide design we use

460
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:42,970
the classic one wide design we use
 

461
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,830
the classic one wide design we use
nowadays so all this has to be moved we

462
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:46,840
nowadays so all this has to be moved we
 

463
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,100
nowadays so all this has to be moved we
have some hopper clocks over here that

464
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,110
have some hopper clocks over here that
 

465
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,360
have some hopper clocks over here that
have to be moved as well and that will

466
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,370
have to be moved as well and that will
 

467
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,860
have to be moved as well and that will
free up some space back here if we want

468
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:52,870
free up some space back here if we want
 

469
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,940
free up some space back here if we want
to add anything else okay so I got that

470
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:56,950
to add anything else okay so I got that
 

471
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,890
to add anything else okay so I got that
done we're gonna go check it out in just

472
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:58,900
done we're gonna go check it out in just
 

473
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,740
done we're gonna go check it out in just
a second but first something very

474
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:01,750
a second but first something very
 

475
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,640
a second but first something very
exciting here we are collecting clay oh

476
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:04,650
exciting here we are collecting clay oh
 

477
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,960
exciting here we are collecting clay oh

things all the time and you guys might
 

489
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,090
things all the time and you guys might
not see it for many many videos so I

490
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:24,100
not see it for many many videos so I

thought I'd give you a little update on
our our clay outpost here we built this

494
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:27,700
our our clay outpost here we built this
 

495
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,480
our our clay outpost here we built this
a few episodes ago this hole in the

496
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:30,490
a few episodes ago this hole in the
 

497
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,380
a few episodes ago this hole in the
ground is getting quite a bit bigger we

498
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:34,390
ground is getting quite a bit bigger we
 

499
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,270
ground is getting quite a bit bigger we
are grabbing the clay because we're

500
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:36,280
are grabbing the clay because we're
 

501
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,300
are grabbing the clay because we're
probably going to try do some work on

502
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,310
probably going to try do some work on
 

503
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,950
probably going to try do some work on
Wilson like some actual building as well

504
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:40,960
Wilson like some actual building as well

down lower sure - yeah and I think even
 

513
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,600
down lower sure - yeah and I think even
lower maybe oh maybe not so I definitely

514
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:54,610
lower maybe oh maybe not so I definitely
 

515
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,300
lower maybe oh maybe not so I definitely
want to use red clay I think for Wilson

516
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,310
want to use red clay I think for Wilson
 

517
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,600
want to use red clay I think for Wilson
I like red clay a lot probably my

518
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:00,610
I like red clay a lot probably my
 

519
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,070

good too though
 

523
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,150
good too though
and what else I think we might build

524
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,160
and what else I think we might build
 

525
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,160
and what else I think we might build
Wilson out of either yellow or this

526
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,170
Wilson out of either yellow or this
 

527
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,670
Wilson out of either yellow or this
white stuff I don't like the spice stuff

so much because it's got like a pinkish

530
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:16,420
so much because it's got like a pinkish
 

531
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,690
so much because it's got like a pinkish
hue to it but it might look okay

532
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:21,700
hue to it but it might look okay
 

533
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,420
hue to it but it might look okay
because if we're building with red it'll

534
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:24,430
because if we're building with red it'll
 

535
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,040
because if we're building with red it'll
go with that a little bit better - we'll

536
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,050
go with that a little bit better - we'll
 

537
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,580
go with that a little bit better - we'll
see we'll try it out all right fantastic

538
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:29,590
see we'll try it out all right fantastic
 

539
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,070
see we'll try it out all right fantastic
so we went we got some clay and stuff

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
going to do some building on Wilson here
 

547
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,380

long before we can feed them again if we
 

603
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,569
long before we can feed them again if we
want to add a delay to that right now I

the food goes over here then there's one

610
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,070
the food goes over here then there's one
 

611
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,370
the food goes over here then there's one
hopper here for the steak item filter

612

it it can catch that too um there's
 

621
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,880
it it can catch that too um there's
another hopper timer over here that's

622
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:17,890
another hopper timer over here that's
 

623
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,710
another hopper timer over here that's
what makes that block come out up there

624
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:19,720
what makes that block come out up there
 

625
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,840
what makes that block come out up there
for the feeding delay I think I want to

626
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:21,850
for the feeding delay I think I want to
 

627
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,470
for the feeding delay I think I want to
make that wait a bit longer

628
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:25,480
make that wait a bit longer
 

629
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,510
make that wait a bit longer
maybe I'll just throw a full stack and

630
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:27,520
maybe I'll just throw a full stack and
 

631
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,530
maybe I'll just throw a full stack and
see what that's like um we'll be out of

632
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:31,540
see what that's like um we'll be out of
 

633
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,650
see what that's like um we'll be out of
which nearby each of these item filters

634

635
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,610
which nearby each of these item filters
branches off to one of those item what

636
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:38,620
branches off to one of those item what
 

637
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,639
branches off to one of those item what
are they called popper clocks yeah over

638
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:41,649
are they called popper clocks yeah over
 

639
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:44,040
are they called popper clocks yeah over
here this is a good trick by the way if

640
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,050
here this is a good trick by the way if
 

641
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,689
here this is a good trick by the way if
you guys ever do hopper clocks or

642
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:45,699
you guys ever do hopper clocks or
 

643
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:48,480
you guys ever do hopper clocks or
anything with hoppers if you can put

644
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:48,490
anything with hoppers if you can put
 

645
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,759
anything with hoppers if you can put
blocks over top those hoppers you may as

646
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:50,769
blocks over top those hoppers you may as
 

647
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:52,079
blocks over top those hoppers you may as
well do it because I think that helps

648
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:52,089
well do it because I think that helps
 

649
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:54,210
well do it because I think that helps
lower the laid you get from them it

650
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:54,220
lower the laid you get from them it
 

651
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,100
lower the laid you get from them it
doesn't have to check tipping and pull

652
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,110
doesn't have to check tipping and pull
 

653
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,160
doesn't have to check tipping and pull
items in and also if you're like digging

654
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,170
items in and also if you're like digging
 

655
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,900
items in and also if you're like digging
in that area you don't have to worry

656
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:00,910
in that area you don't have to worry
 

657
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,180
in that area you don't have to worry
about blocks falling into your hoppers

658
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,190
about blocks falling into your hoppers
 

659
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,699
about blocks falling into your hoppers
that happens to me quite often I'll

660
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:05,709
that happens to me quite often I'll
 

661
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:06,900
that happens to me quite often I'll
return to a bill

662
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:06,910
return to a bill
 

663
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,770
return to a bill
project later and I'll start like mining

664
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:10,780
project later and I'll start like mining
 

665
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,360
project later and I'll start like mining
out some of the area and then stuff

666
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,370
out some of the area and then stuff
 

667
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,680
out some of the area and then stuff
falls in the hopper and I don't notice

668
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:13,690
falls in the hopper and I don't notice
 

669
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,630
falls in the hopper and I don't notice
it and wrecks the timing on everything

670
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:15,640
it and wrecks the timing on everything
 

671
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,160
it and wrecks the timing on everything
and oh it's good just to block it off

672
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,170
and oh it's good just to block it off
 

673
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,320
and oh it's good just to block it off
alright let's do some building so I want

674
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,330
alright let's do some building so I want
 

675
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,640
alright let's do some building so I want
to put some quartz here I think alright

676
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:26,650
to put some quartz here I think alright
 

677
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,150
to put some quartz here I think alright
um yeah I think last time we worked on

678
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
um yeah I think last time we worked on
 

679
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,680
um yeah I think last time we worked on
Wilson actually I asked you guys what I

680
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:31,690
Wilson actually I asked you guys what I
 

681
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,170
Wilson actually I asked you guys what I
should do with the look here I saw some

682
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:34,180
should do with the look here I saw some
 

683
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,640
should do with the look here I saw some
of the responses there were some good

684
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:35,650
of the responses there were some good
 

685
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:40,380
of the responses there were some good
ones um some people like change the red

686
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:40,390
ones um some people like change the red
 

687
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,020
ones um some people like change the red
clay here with wood I saw some where

688
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,030
clay here with wood I saw some where
 

689
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,630
clay here with wood I saw some where
they kind of mixed like half and half

690
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:45,640
they kind of mixed like half and half
 

691
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,570
they kind of mixed like half and half
they did green on one side then another

692
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:48,580
they did green on one side then another
 

693
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,310
they did green on one side then another
color on another one I think I think

694
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:53,320
color on another one I think I think
 

695
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,370
color on another one I think I think
what I want to do with this is keep it

696
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:56,380
what I want to do with this is keep it
 

697
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,370
what I want to do with this is keep it
very simple you know the focus should be

698
00:15:59,370 --> 00:15:59,380
very simple you know the focus should be
 

699
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,210
very simple you know the focus should be
on Wilson not so much on our our frame

700
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:03,220
on Wilson not so much on our our frame
 

701
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,730
on Wilson not so much on our our frame
here are the look of the the room I

702
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:05,740
here are the look of the the room I
 

703
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,800
here are the look of the the room I
don't want to keep it this nature theme

704
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:07,810
don't want to keep it this nature theme
 

705
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,630
don't want to keep it this nature theme
I think it deserves like a technical

706
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:09,640
I think it deserves like a technical
 

707
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,330
I think it deserves like a technical
theme like a nice smooth clean look that

708
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:12,340
theme like a nice smooth clean look that
 

709
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,030
theme like a nice smooth clean look that
the clay gives us um

710
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
the clay gives us um
 

711
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,120
the clay gives us um
I don't like the sandstone for example

712
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,130
I don't like the sandstone for example
 

713
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,270
I don't like the sandstone for example
because it's got a strong texture to it

714
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:21,280
because it's got a strong texture to it
 

715
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,830
because it's got a strong texture to it
right it's got that cobble look we don't

716
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:22,840
right it's got that cobble look we don't
 

717
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,220
right it's got that cobble look we don't
want that we want a clean look um we're

718
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:26,230
want that we want a clean look um we're
 

719
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,870
want that we want a clean look um we're
gonna take advantage of the way the eye

720
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:27,880
gonna take advantage of the way the eye
 

721
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,790
gonna take advantage of the way the eye
works you know like if you have a blank

722
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:29,800
works you know like if you have a blank
 

723
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,400
works you know like if you have a blank
sheet of paper with a dot a black dot on

724
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,410
sheet of paper with a dot a black dot on
 

725
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,540
sheet of paper with a dot a black dot on
it you will instinctively maybe not

726
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:36,550
it you will instinctively maybe not
 

727
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,190
it you will instinctively maybe not
instinctively but you will look at that

728
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:38,200
instinctively but you will look at that
 

729
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,370
instinctively but you will look at that
black dot on the paper right so likewise

730
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:41,380
black dot on the paper right so likewise
 

731
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,020
black dot on the paper right so likewise
we're I think I'm going to use white

732
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,030
we're I think I'm going to use white
 

733
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,760
we're I think I'm going to use white
clay here as like our blank sheet of

734
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:44,770
clay here as like our blank sheet of
 

735
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:49,680
clay here as like our blank sheet of
paper and we want to focus well I just

736
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:49,690
paper and we want to focus well I just
 

737
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,410
paper and we want to focus well I just
destroyed that lamp we want to focus on

738
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:52,420
destroyed that lamp we want to focus on
 

739
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,000
destroyed that lamp we want to focus on
these lamps when we walked in right

740
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,010
these lamps when we walked in right
 

741
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,270
these lamps when we walked in right
these are our black dots on our paper

742
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:56,280
these are our black dots on our paper
 

743
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,830
these are our black dots on our paper
that we want our eyes to to draw

744
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:58,840
that we want our eyes to to draw
 

745
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,620
that we want our eyes to to draw
attention to so clay is very good it's a

746
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:01,630
attention to so clay is very good it's a
 

747
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,510
attention to so clay is very good it's a
clean clean texture block and I think

748
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:06,520
clean clean texture block and I think
 

749
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,189
clean clean texture block and I think
it'll work out pretty good here I'll try

750
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:08,199
it'll work out pretty good here I'll try
 

751
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,470
it'll work out pretty good here I'll try
it out and to see what it looks like the

752
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
it out and to see what it looks like the
 

753
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,390
it out and to see what it looks like the
other option is yellow did I bring any

754
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
other option is yellow did I bring any
 

755
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,490
other option is yellow did I bring any
yellow I do not

756
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:16,500
yellow I do not
 

757
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,569
yellow I do not
yeah let's quickly go get some yellow

758
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:18,579
yeah let's quickly go get some yellow
 

759
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,270
yeah let's quickly go get some yellow
we'll just try it out

760
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:20,280
we'll just try it out
 

761
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,740
we'll just try it out
yellow is a good choice as well it's

762
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:21,750
yellow is a good choice as well it's
 

763
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,319
yellow is a good choice as well it's
kind of a brighter color but I think it

764
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:24,329
kind of a brighter color but I think it
 

765
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:27,559
kind of a brighter color but I think it
will distract a little bit from from the

766
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:27,569
will distract a little bit from from the
 

767
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,210
will distract a little bit from from the
lamps got a little bit yellow orange it

768
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:32,220
lamps got a little bit yellow orange it
 

769
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,390
lamps got a little bit yellow orange it
could be another good choice

770
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
could be another good choice
 

771
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,680
could be another good choice
but honestly white is probably going to

772
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:36,690
but honestly white is probably going to
 

773
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,940
but honestly white is probably going to
be the best I just want to check it out

774
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:37,950
be the best I just want to check it out
 

775
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,919
be the best I just want to check it out
though really quick here whoa I love how

776
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:42,929
though really quick here whoa I love how
 

777
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,840
though really quick here whoa I love how
you can activate the wings now whenever

778
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:44,850
you can activate the wings now whenever
 

779
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:49,029
you can activate the wings now whenever
you want that was a really good change

780
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039

 

781
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,370

the yellow kind of goes because it's a

782
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:52,380
the yellow kind of goes because it's a
 

783
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,409
the yellow kind of goes because it's a
little closer in color to the lamps but

784
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:54,419
little closer in color to the lamps but
 

785
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,419
little closer in color to the lamps but
also because of that I think it will

786
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:56,429
also because of that I think it will
 

787
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:00,169
also because of that I think it will
distract from them but it goes well with

788
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:00,179
distract from them but it goes well with
 

789
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,760
distract from them but it goes well with
red I think I'm gonna go with the white

790
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:04,770
red I think I'm gonna go with the white
 

791
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,880
red I think I'm gonna go with the white
we'll try the white out uh-huh so that

792
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:07,890
we'll try the white out uh-huh so that
 

793
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,060
we'll try the white out uh-huh so that
is the white clay look I'm happy with it

794
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,070
is the white clay look I'm happy with it
 

795

use it does achieve the effect I want to
so I think I'm going to keep it as that

804
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:24,350
so I think I'm going to keep it as that
 

805
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,380
so I think I'm going to keep it as that
so maybe we will try change out some

806
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:27,390
so maybe we will try change out some
 

807
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,390
so maybe we will try change out some
more stuff here um let's just try to

808
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
more stuff here um let's just try to
 

809
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,860
more stuff here um let's just try to
break up the floor a little bit so I

810
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:33,870
break up the floor a little bit so I
 

811
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,560
break up the floor a little bit so I
think we want to mix red clay and maybe

812
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:36,570
think we want to mix red clay and maybe
 

813
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,549
think we want to mix red clay and maybe
one other block I'll try white clay and

814
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:39,559
one other block I'll try white clay and
 

815
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:45,370
one other block I'll try white clay and
just see what it's like oh whoops

of a problem I think we can build around

826
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:57,179
of a problem I think we can build around
 

827
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,370
of a problem I think we can build around
it um also since there's no white clay

828
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:01,380
it um also since there's no white clay
 

829
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,710
it um also since there's no white clay

the age meter on Wilson by the way I

832
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:05,669
the age meter on Wilson by the way I
 

833
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:07,940
the age meter on Wilson by the way I
don't think I mentioned that today or

834
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:07,950
don't think I mentioned that today or
 

835

basically the goal or the winning
 

839
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,529
basically the goal or the winning
condition of Wilson is to get that bar

840
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:15,539
condition of Wilson is to get that bar
 

841
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,169
condition of Wilson is to get that bar
to fill up all the way to live out is

849
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,600
alive here right now see if I can't I'm
having trouble with it so because when I

850
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:32,610
having trouble with it so because when I
 

851
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,190
having trouble with it so because when I
feed them I don't think it's giving them

852
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,200
feed them I don't think it's giving them
 

853
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,870
feed them I don't think it's giving them
food I think it's less than one light

854
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
food I think it's less than one light
 

855
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,670
food I think it's less than one light
every time at the moment which is not

856
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:40,680
every time at the moment which is not
 

857
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,960
every time at the moment which is not
enough so I'm gonna have to bump that up

858
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:41,970
enough so I'm gonna have to bump that up
 

859
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,130
enough so I'm gonna have to bump that up
a bit and also when his weight goes up I

860
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:46,140
a bit and also when his weight goes up I
 

861
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,020
a bit and also when his weight goes up I
have no way of getting it down so maybe

862
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,030
have no way of getting it down so maybe
 

863
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,590
have no way of getting it down so maybe
what we should do is have some exercise

864
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:50,600
what we should do is have some exercise
 

865
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,590
what we should do is have some exercise
option we can we make Wilson exercise so

866
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:54,600
option we can we make Wilson exercise so
 

867
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,790
option we can we make Wilson exercise so
if he exercises ideally I think his food

868
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:58,800
if he exercises ideally I think his food
 

869
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,050
if he exercises ideally I think his food
should go down weight should go down

870
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:02,060
should go down weight should go down
 

871
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,060
should go down weight should go down
health maybe goes up a couple points and

872
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,070
health maybe goes up a couple points and
 

873
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,340
health maybe goes up a couple points and
Happiness people don't really like

874
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:07,350
Happiness people don't really like
 

875
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,260
Happiness people don't really like
exercising so maybe it should go down

876
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,270
exercising so maybe it should go down
 

877
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,570
exercising so maybe it should go down
they feel good afterwards though so

878
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:11,580
they feel good afterwards though so
 

879
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,070
they feel good afterwards though so
maybe it should go up I don't know but

880
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
maybe it should go up I don't know but
 

881
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,840
maybe it should go up I don't know but
that might be one cool thing we could do

882
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:17,850
that might be one cool thing we could do
 

883
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,810
that might be one cool thing we could do
that's a more variety uh what else I

884
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:20,820
that's a more variety uh what else I
 

885
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,560
that's a more variety uh what else I
thought of an idea with a mood meter

886
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:24,570
thought of an idea with a mood meter
 

887
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,330
thought of an idea with a mood meter
maybe we have any lamps no we don't for

888
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:29,340
maybe we have any lamps no we don't for
 

889
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,090
maybe we have any lamps no we don't for
the mood meter I was thinking we could

890
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:32,100
the mood meter I was thinking we could
 

891
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,450
the mood meter I was thinking we could
have five lamps and randomize what what

892
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:35,460
have five lamps and randomize what what
 

893
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,530
have five lamps and randomize what what
light level they're at so if he's in a

894
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:39,540
light level they're at so if he's in a
 

895
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,360
light level they're at so if he's in a
bad mood his happiness will go down

896
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,370
bad mood his happiness will go down
 

897
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,440
bad mood his happiness will go down
quicker than normal

898
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,450
quicker than normal
 

899
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,720
quicker than normal
he's in a good mood it'll do the

900
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:44,730
he's in a good mood it'll do the
 

901
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,700
he's in a good mood it'll do the
opposite it'll it'll kind of go up

902
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:46,710
opposite it'll it'll kind of go up
 

903
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,010
opposite it'll it'll kind of go up
quicker than normal you know that way

904
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,020
quicker than normal you know that way
 

905
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,560
quicker than normal you know that way
like because I don't want it so that

906
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:51,570
like because I don't want it so that
 

907
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,450
like because I don't want it so that
when we when we go to take care of

908
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:53,460
when we when we go to take care of
 

909
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,550
when we when we go to take care of
Wilson like right now it would be like

910
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:58,560
Wilson like right now it would be like
 

911
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,770
Wilson like right now it would be like
give them food and then do something to

912
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:00,780
give them food and then do something to
 

913
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,230
give them food and then do something to
make this happiness clothes go up and it

914
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,240
make this happiness clothes go up and it
 

915
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,150
make this happiness clothes go up and it
will the food and the happiness would be

916
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,160
will the food and the happiness would be
 

917
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,130
will the food and the happiness would be
pretty consistent with each other we

918
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:07,140
pretty consistent with each other we
 

919
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,960
pretty consistent with each other we
want some variation with them we don't

920
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:08,970
want some variation with them we don't
 

921
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,610
want some variation with them we don't
want it just to be another thing to top

922
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:10,620
want it just to be another thing to top
 

923
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,970
want it just to be another thing to top
off so if like sometimes is happiness

924
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:13,980
off so if like sometimes is happiness
 

925
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,940
off so if like sometimes is happiness
goes down quicker than his food and

926
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:15,950
goes down quicker than his food and
 

927
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,530
goes down quicker than his food and
vice-versa I think that would be a good

928
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:18,540
vice-versa I think that would be a good
 

929
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,040
vice-versa I think that would be a good
idea if you know what I mean that was

930
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,050
idea if you know what I mean that was
 

931
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,620
idea if you know what I mean that was
probably complicated and not very well

932
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:24,630
probably complicated and not very well
 

933
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,580
probably complicated and not very well
well said all right there is a pathway

934
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:28,590
well said all right there is a pathway
 

935
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,900
well said all right there is a pathway
over here this sort of connects to where

936
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:32,910
over here this sort of connects to where
 

937
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,880
over here this sort of connects to where
does this go I got the firework room

938
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:34,890
does this go I got the firework room
 

939
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,580
does this go I got the firework room
over here I want to keep this open

940
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:37,590
over here I want to keep this open
 

941
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,050
over here I want to keep this open
though let's build around it and I guess

942
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,060
though let's build around it and I guess
 

943
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,730
though let's build around it and I guess
we should go in a bit more

944
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:45,740

 

945
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,389

yeah I think we'll have a border here do

946
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:49,399
yeah I think we'll have a border here do
 

947
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:50,799
yeah I think we'll have a border here do
that and then maybe make it a little

948
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:50,809
that and then maybe make it a little
 

949
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,560
that and then maybe make it a little
door frame here so it'll go up and

950
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:53,570
door frame here so it'll go up and
 

951
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:58,330
door frame here so it'll go up and
around kind of like that back down keep

952
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:58,340
around kind of like that back down keep
 

953
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,860
around kind of like that back down keep
it all red clay and then connect it to

954
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:02,870
it all red clay and then connect it to
 

955
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,490
it all red clay and then connect it to
these stairs I'll do some some building

something with it yeah so we're going to
 

993
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,419
something with it yeah so we're going to
do one more project really quickly here

do one more project really quickly here
I need pack dice forts so we're gonna

996
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:10,149
I need pack dice forts so we're gonna
 

997
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:13,149
I need pack dice forts so we're gonna
get it from the Nexus here I want to do

998
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:13,159
get it from the Nexus here I want to do
 

999
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,590
get it from the Nexus here I want to do
this because a lot of you say I never

1000
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:14,600
this because a lot of you say I never
 

1001
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,149
this because a lot of you say I never
use it which is not true

1002
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159
use it which is not true
 

1003
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,060
use it which is not true
I just don't use it on camera a lot

1004
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,070
I just don't use it on camera a lot
 

1005
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,950
I just don't use it on camera a lot
because this is a long-term storage room

1006
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:20,960
because this is a long-term storage room
 

1007
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,060
because this is a long-term storage room
guys it's not like when I use constantly

1008
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,070
guys it's not like when I use constantly
 

1009
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,519
guys it's not like when I use constantly
so whenever I I need a spot for like

1010
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:27,529
so whenever I I need a spot for like
 

1011
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:30,990
so whenever I I need a spot for like
several chests of ice for example

1012
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,000
several chests of ice for example
 

1013
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,110
several chests of ice for example
hopefully that's right I think that's

1014
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,120
hopefully that's right I think that's
 

1015
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,659
hopefully that's right I think that's
right I don't have like a spot for a

1016
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:37,669
right I don't have like a spot for a
 

1017
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:39,760
right I don't have like a spot for a
double chest the fact ice in the man

1018
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:39,770
double chest the fact ice in the man
 

1019
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,620
double chest the fact ice in the man
cave for example so that goes into the

1020
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:41,630
cave for example so that goes into the
 

1021
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,510
cave for example so that goes into the
Nexus whenever we get like a whole bunch

1022
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:43,520
Nexus whenever we get like a whole bunch
 

1023
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,860
Nexus whenever we get like a whole bunch
of something yeah there it is good yeah

1024
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:47,870
of something yeah there it is good yeah
 

1025
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,919
of something yeah there it is good yeah
so the Pat ice is four and not a super

1026
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:50,929
so the Pat ice is four and not a super
 

1027
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,649
so the Pat ice is four and not a super
exciting project but it's what I want to

1028
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:53,659
exciting project but it's what I want to
 

1029
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:57,370
exciting project but it's what I want to
get done nonetheless I want to down all

1030
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:57,380
get done nonetheless I want to down all
 

1031
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,440
get done nonetheless I want to down all
my nether tunnels have a three-wide

1032
00:23:59,440 --> 00:23:59,450
my nether tunnels have a three-wide
 

1033
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,159
my nether tunnels have a three-wide
thing of

1034
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:00,169
thing of
 

1035
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:03,310
thing of
a pat dice and this stuff is great

1036
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:03,320
a pat dice and this stuff is great
 

1037
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,549
a pat dice and this stuff is great
because you can put tracks on them right

1038
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559
because you can put tracks on them right
 

1039
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,700
because you can put tracks on them right
let's double check yeah yeah of course I

1040
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:09,710
let's double check yeah yeah of course I
 

1041
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,009
let's double check yeah yeah of course I
can of course you can I knew that so

1042
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:12,019
can of course you can I knew that so
 

1043
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:14,649
can of course you can I knew that so
yeah we can ride a minecart over top of

1044
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:14,659
yeah we can ride a minecart over top of
 

1045
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:17,139
yeah we can ride a minecart over top of
it if we want we can have horses run

1046
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:17,149
it if we want we can have horses run
 

1047
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:19,690
it if we want we can have horses run
down here still we get the super speed

1048
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:19,700
down here still we get the super speed
 

1049
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,619
down here still we get the super speed
boost if we jump down the tunnel and in

1050
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:23,629
boost if we jump down the tunnel and in
 

1051
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,930
boost if we jump down the tunnel and in
the game currently we have speed boats

1052
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:25,940
the game currently we have speed boats
 

1053
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,359
the game currently we have speed boats
and if that is a feature that's gonna

1054
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:28,369
and if that is a feature that's gonna
 

1055
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,970
and if that is a feature that's gonna
stay this is going to be amazing

1056
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:30,980
stay this is going to be amazing
 

1057
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,389
stay this is going to be amazing
I definitely I would be a fool not to do

1058
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:34,399
I definitely I would be a fool not to do
 

1059
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:36,999
I definitely I would be a fool not to do
this honestly because those boats are I

1060
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:37,009
this honestly because those boats are I
 

1061
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,519
this honestly because those boats are I
think at least I can't remember what it

1062
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:39,529
think at least I can't remember what it
 

1063
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:40,690
think at least I can't remember what it
was back it's at least three times

1064
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:40,700
was back it's at least three times
 

1065
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,989
was back it's at least three times
faster than minecart so it's insane and

1066
00:24:45,989 --> 00:24:45,999
faster than minecart so it's insane and
 

1067
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:51,039
faster than minecart so it's insane and
a lot of my another tunnels here need

1068
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,049
a lot of my another tunnels here need
 

1069
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:54,759
a lot of my another tunnels here need
need work anyway like I have to go about

1070
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:54,769
need work anyway like I have to go about
 

1071

ice that's where my my ice bike biome is
 

1075
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:03,970

to do that I have to travel most of that

1076
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:03,980
to do that I have to travel most of that
 

1077

still be a nice tunnel so I'm going to
 

1093
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,590
still be a nice tunnel so I'm going to
work on it for a bit then we'll try it

1094
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:29,600
work on it for a bit then we'll try it
 

1095
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,460
work on it for a bit then we'll try it
out we'll see if the boats are going to

1096
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:33,470
out we'll see if the boats are going to
 

1097
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,749
out we'll see if the boats are going to
work or not because I'm worried

1098
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:34,759
work or not because I'm worried
