potion
dispenser thing that automatically

292
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
dispenser thing that automatically
 

293
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,029
dispenser thing that automatically
refills itself

294
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
refills itself
 

295
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,749
refills itself
like this thing here i don't use this

296
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
like this thing here i don't use this
 

297
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,430
like this thing here i don't use this
thing all that often to be honest and

298
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
thing all that often to be honest and
 

299
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,150
thing all that often to be honest and
the reason

300
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
the reason
 

301
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,909
the reason
is because i know when i use it i have

302
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
is because i know when i use it i have
 

303
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,950
is because i know when i use it i have
to refill it and

304
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
to refill it and
 

305
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,430
to refill it and
even even though i have the potions here

306
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
even even though i have the potions here
 

307
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,350
even even though i have the potions here
just the fact that i have to constantly

308
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
just the fact that i have to constantly
 

309
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,350
just the fact that i have to constantly
refill it

310
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
refill it
 

311
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,749
refill it
kind of bugs me but the idea with this

312
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
kind of bugs me but the idea with this
 

313
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,430
kind of bugs me but the idea with this
is you just walk in

314
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
is you just walk in
 

315
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,830
is you just walk in
and then you get potioned for six

316
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
and then you get potioned for six
 

317
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,430
and then you get potioned for six
minutes

318
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
minutes
 

319
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,830
minutes
although speed two is over compensating

320
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
although speed two is over compensating
 

321
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,909
although speed two is over compensating
for it

322
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919

 

323
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,430

so yeah that's that's kind of the plan

324
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
so yeah that's that's kind of the plan
 

325
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,710

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
i don't build stuff and then show it
 

337
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,469

that's a bad habit
uh at least i think

340
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
uh at least i think
 

341
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,469
uh at least i think
viewers would rather watch me build it

342
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
viewers would rather watch me build it
 

343
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,629
viewers would rather watch me build it
and overcome the problems i

344
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
and overcome the problems i
 

345
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,550
and overcome the problems i
have when building it and see how i

346
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
have when building it and see how i
 

347
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,909
have when building it and see how i
design it and that

348
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
design it and that
 

349
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,270
design it and that
that kind of thing so that's what we're

350

actual positions

408
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
actual positions
 

409
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,269
actual positions
does matter quite a bit so we'll have a

410
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
does matter quite a bit so we'll have a
 

411
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:39,750
does matter quite a bit so we'll have a
little

412
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
little
 

413
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,949
little
entrance thing like we have downstairs

414
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
entrance thing like we have downstairs
 

415
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,550
entrance thing like we have downstairs
we'll put our dispenser at head level

416
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
we'll put our dispenser at head level
 

417
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,630
we'll put our dispenser at head level
again

418
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
again
 

419
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,470
again
there's a like i do have this somewhat

420
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
there's a like i do have this somewhat
 

421
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,630
there's a like i do have this somewhat
planned out but once we get to the

422
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
planned out but once we get to the
 

423
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,350
planned out but once we get to the
actual

424
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
actual
 

425
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,230
actual
automating and stuff i have no clue i

426
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
automating and stuff i have no clue i
 

427
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,350
automating and stuff i have no clue i
just know the look

428
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
just know the look
 

429
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,150
just know the look
i want to start out with here um

430
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
i want to start out with here um
 

431
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,310
i want to start out with here um
so yeah walk up step on pressure plates

432
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
so yeah walk up step on pressure plates
 

433
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,590
so yeah walk up step on pressure plates
get potion

434
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
get potion
 

435
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,630
get potion
um so the next idea i had

436
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
um so the next idea i had
 

437
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,550
um so the next idea i had
try to take the that block out

438
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560

 

439
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,350

and we will

440
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
and we will
 

441
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,269
and we will
wait wait we need a hopper that's what

442
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
wait wait we need a hopper that's what
 

443
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,710
wait wait we need a hopper that's what
we need

444
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
we need
 

445
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,070
we need
get our hopper

446
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080

 

447
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,269

and we're gonna try put one right there

448
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
and we're gonna try put one right there
 

449
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,630
and we're gonna try put one right there
i can't remember if they fixed it where

450
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
i can't remember if they fixed it where
 

451
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,550
i can't remember if they fixed it where
if stuff lands on the rim does it go in

452
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
if stuff lands on the rim does it go in
 

453
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,670
if stuff lands on the rim does it go in
now

454
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
now
 

455
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,470
now
or is that still not fixed

456
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480

 

457
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,550

i think it might be fixed

458
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
i think it might be fixed
 

459
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,150
i think it might be fixed
come on rim throw it over here

460
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
come on rim throw it over here
 

461
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,590
come on rim throw it over here
this will tell us yeah okay it seems to

462
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
this will tell us yeah okay it seems to
 

463
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,350
this will tell us yeah okay it seems to
be fixed

464
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
be fixed
 

465
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,550
be fixed
so we'll have a hopper there and

466
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
so we'll have a hopper there and
 

467
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,829
so we'll have a hopper there and
we need a way of entering water bottles

468
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
we need a way of entering water bottles
 

469
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,350
we need a way of entering water bottles
into our system because there i don't

470
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
into our system because there i don't
 

471
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,509
into our system because there i don't
think there's any way of automating that

472
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
think there's any way of automating that
 

473
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,430
think there's any way of automating that
process we still have to feed it water

474
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
process we still have to feed it water
 

475
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,030
process we still have to feed it water
bottles

476
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
bottles
 

477
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,509
bottles
so i thought it would be cool to

478
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519

 

479
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,949

do something like this have a water

480
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
do something like this have a water
 

481
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,310
do something like this have a water
stream

482
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
stream
 

483
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,750
stream
an infinite spring here

484
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
an infinite spring here
 

485
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,509
an infinite spring here
grab one of these and we'll use this to

486
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
grab one of these and we'll use this to
 

487
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,350
grab one of these and we'll use this to
fill up our water bottles

488
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
fill up our water bottles
 

489
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,110
fill up our water bottles
and it also doubles in function we have

490
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
and it also doubles in function we have
 

491
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,389
and it also doubles in function we have
an infinite spring

492
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
an infinite spring
 

493
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,710
an infinite spring
wherever we build this which you can

494
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
wherever we build this which you can
 

495
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,230
wherever we build this which you can
never have too many of those let's be

496
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
never have too many of those let's be
 

497
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,430
never have too many of those let's be
honest

498
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
honest
 

499
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,790
honest
uh so i think we'll do this and then

500
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
uh so i think we'll do this and then
 

501
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,230
uh so i think we'll do this and then
when somebody wants to fill up their

502
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
when somebody wants to fill up their
 

503
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,829
when somebody wants to fill up their
water bottles

504
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839

 

505
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,910

should work out okay i know if they

506
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
should work out okay i know if they
 

507
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,190
should work out okay i know if they
right click on the hopper

508
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
right click on the hopper
 

509
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,870
right click on the hopper

runs out of water bottles
 

543
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,110
runs out of water bottles
uh hopefully if we can get stuff to work

uh hopefully if we can get stuff to work
 

545
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,710
uh hopefully if we can get stuff to work
that way as far as like for speed

but just for simplicity i'm going to

570
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
but just for simplicity i'm going to
 

571
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,470
but just for simplicity i'm going to
skip that all and just have chess

572
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
skip that all and just have chess
 

573

up in various places not like a big

632
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
up in various places not like a big
 

633
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,829
up in various places not like a big
thing to build

634
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
thing to build
 

635
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,509

okay that's a pretty good look
oh yeah and we would want one for the

642
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
oh yeah and we would want one for the
 

643
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,629
oh yeah and we would want one for the
actual speed potion we could probably

644
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
actual speed potion we could probably
 

645
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,710
actual speed potion we could probably
put that right on the dispenser

646
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
put that right on the dispenser
 

647
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,069

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
okay so that's the first thing now what
 

651
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,389
okay so that's the first thing now what
we got to figure out

652
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
we got to figure out
 

653
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,389
we got to figure out
how do the brewing stands actually work

654
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
how do the brewing stands actually work
 

655
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,430

face the brewing stand then we'll throw
 

671
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,629
face the brewing stand then we'll throw
some items in and see what it does

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,069
oh maybe there is a tail engine
intelligence to it

680
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
intelligence to it
 

681
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,350
intelligence to it
ah i grabbed the glass bottles i swear

682
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
ah i grabbed the glass bottles i swear
 

683

684
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880

 

685
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,990

they disappear

686
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000

 

687
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,750

where'd my glass bottle go

688
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760

 

689
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,590

are they actually disappearing

690
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600

 

691
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,230

what wait no i'm missing

692
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
what wait no i'm missing
 

693
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,269
what wait no i'm missing
six aren't i

694
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279

 

695
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,710

they're going in oh right because the

698
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
they're going in oh right because the
 

699
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,150
they're going in oh right because the
first item

700
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
first item
 

701
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,150
first item
there yeah right if the first item can't

702
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
there yeah right if the first item can't
 

703
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,189
there yeah right if the first item can't
go in the next one won't go either

704
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
go in the next one won't go either
 

705
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,350
go in the next one won't go either
hey hey

706
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360

 

707
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,189

just casually taking the stroll

708
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199

 

709
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,350

all right um

710
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
all right um
 

711
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,710
all right um
although if the chest is there

712
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720

 

713
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,509

um well yeah if we have a hopper there

714
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
um well yeah if we have a hopper there
 

715
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,389
um well yeah if we have a hopper there
that'll hold it

716
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
that'll hold it
 

717
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,990
that'll hold it
properly the water okay

718
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
properly the water okay
 

719
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,069
properly the water okay
so there does seem to be some actual

720
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
so there does seem to be some actual
 

721
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,310
so there does seem to be some actual
intelligence to it that's good news

722
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
intelligence to it that's good news
 

723
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,749
intelligence to it that's good news
um

724
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759

 

725
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,910

with the setup it would be better if we

726
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
with the setup it would be better if we
 

727
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,230
with the setup it would be better if we
have four

728
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
have four
 

729
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,069
have four
brewing stands total instead of just

730
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
brewing stands total instead of just
 

731
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,670
brewing stands total instead of just
like trying to

732
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
like trying to
 

733
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,430
like trying to
get get to awkward potions and saying

734
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
get get to awkward potions and saying
 

735
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,509
get get to awkward potions and saying
them back to one brewing stand and

736
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
them back to one brewing stand and
 

737
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,189
them back to one brewing stand and
then getting speed potions and sending

738
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:03,199
then getting speed potions and sending
 

739
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,790
then getting speed potions and sending
them back and then doing the redstone

740
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
them back and then doing the redstone
 

741
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,629
them back and then doing the redstone
instead of doing that all in one

742
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:06,639
instead of doing that all in one
 

743
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,590
instead of doing that all in one
if we have it going in four it'll

744
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
if we have it going in four it'll
 

745
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,990
if we have it going in four it'll
probably be simpler and

746
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
probably be simpler and
 

747
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,829
probably be simpler and
it will make the brewing faster because

748
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
it will make the brewing faster because
 

749
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,430
it will make the brewing faster because
we only have to wait for one stage

750
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
we only have to wait for one stage
 

751
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,310
we only have to wait for one stage
instead of all

752
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
instead of all
 

753
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,150
instead of all
four um

754
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,160
four um
 

755
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,189
four um
i'm not sure for the glass the water

756
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
i'm not sure for the glass the water
 

757
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,150
i'm not sure for the glass the water
bottles

758
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
bottles
 

759
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,829
bottles
since they don't stack we should have at

760
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
since they don't stack we should have at
 

761
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,150
since they don't stack we should have at
least three double chests

762
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
least three double chests
 

763
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,710
least three double chests
full or for them um

764
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
full or for them um
 

765
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,790
full or for them um
hmm okay i'm going to stop for a second

766
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
hmm okay i'm going to stop for a second
 

767
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,670
hmm okay i'm going to stop for a second
just think a bit here

768
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
just think a bit here
 

769
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,509
just think a bit here
actually before we get any further here

770
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
actually before we get any further here
 

771
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,030
actually before we get any further here
what we really need to figure out

772
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
what we really need to figure out
 

773
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,670
what we really need to figure out
is uh how they these brewing stands

774
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
is uh how they these brewing stands
 

775
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,509
is uh how they these brewing stands
interact with the hoppers because

776
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:49,519
interact with the hoppers because
 

777
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,110
interact with the hoppers because
i've heard they just always eject

778
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120
i've heard they just always eject
 

779
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,350
i've heard they just always eject
stuff into the hopper

780
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360

 

781
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,590

you can't actually put that in the slot

782
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
you can't actually put that in the slot
 

783
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,150
you can't actually put that in the slot
that's interesting or in that slot

784
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
that's interesting or in that slot
 

785
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,029
that's interesting or in that slot
they must have changed that um

786
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039
they must have changed that um
 

787
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,789
they must have changed that um
yeah so i just got taken out so that

788
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
yeah so i just got taken out so that
 

789
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,789
yeah so i just got taken out so that
means we're gonna have to do some timing

790
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
means we're gonna have to do some timing
 

791
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,750
means we're gonna have to do some timing
stuff

792
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
stuff
 

793
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,990
stuff
to make sure that doesn't happen i think

794
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
to make sure that doesn't happen i think
 

795
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,669
to make sure that doesn't happen i think
the way people have been doing that

796
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:15,679
the way people have been doing that
 

797
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,909
the way people have been doing that
or dealing with that from what i've seen

798
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
or dealing with that from what i've seen
 

799
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,990
or dealing with that from what i've seen
is they've been

800
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
is they've been
 

801
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,510
is they've been
they have like a storage minecarts that

802
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
they have like a storage minecarts that
 

803
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,110
they have like a storage minecarts that
will only stay there for so long

804
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
will only stay there for so long
 

805
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,230
will only stay there for so long
and then leave

806
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,240

 

807
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,470

and only be there at certain times i

808
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
and only be there at certain times i
 

809
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,310
and only be there at certain times i
think that's what we have to do

810
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
think that's what we have to do
 

811
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,470
think that's what we have to do
and just time it right i need another

812
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
and just time it right i need another
 

813
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,630
and just time it right i need another
chest

814
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
chest
 

815
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,789
chest
can't make a chest in that window oh and

816
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
can't make a chest in that window oh and
 

817

859
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,669
kind of bug me so i'm hoping that
doesn't happen with this

860
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
doesn't happen with this
 

861
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,310
doesn't happen with this
so far it's it puts a smile on my face

00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120

 

865
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,830

okay so i think if we do this

866
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
okay so i think if we do this
 

867
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,870
okay so i think if we do this
glass bottle i grab the glass bottle i

868
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:46,880
glass bottle i grab the glass bottle i
 

869
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,110
glass bottle i grab the glass bottle i
think if we do this

870
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120

 

871
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,390

yeah it only puts it in when the

872
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
yeah it only puts it in when the
 

873
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,789
yeah it only puts it in when the
minecraft goes there

874
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:54,799
minecraft goes there
 

875
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,549
minecraft goes there
that shouldn't be too hard to time

876
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
that shouldn't be too hard to time
 

877
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,070
that shouldn't be too hard to time
uh the other thing we got to do before

878
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
uh the other thing we got to do before
 

879
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,070
uh the other thing we got to do before
we get any further here we go to

880
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
we get any further here we go to
 

881
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,950
we get any further here we go to
wire up our dispenser i think and sort

882
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:04,960
wire up our dispenser i think and sort
 

883
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,710
wire up our dispenser i think and sort
of plan things around that

884
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:08,720

 

885
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,549

uh that might be a bit tricky with the

886
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
uh that might be a bit tricky with the
 

887
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,990
uh that might be a bit tricky with the
water

888
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,000

 

889
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,470

and not being able to see where i am

890
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480

 

891
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,750

oops oh darn it

892
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:27,760

 

893
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,350

ah one second i think i'll just do this

894
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360
ah one second i think i'll just do this
 

895
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,669
ah one second i think i'll just do this
off camera

896
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:31,679
off camera
 

897
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,750
off camera
i might do it like this wiring have the

898
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
i might do it like this wiring have the
 

899
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,070
i might do it like this wiring have the
redstone dust below

900
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
redstone dust below
 

901
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,270
redstone dust below
that points into

902
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:39,280
that points into
 

903
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,830
that points into
this block with one torch then it goes

904
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
this block with one torch then it goes
 

905
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,510
this block with one torch then it goes
up to another torch

906
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
up to another torch
 

907
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,710
up to another torch
and up and up like that i could have ran

908
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
and up and up like that i could have ran
 

909
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,950
and up and up like that i could have ran
the redstone torch right here

910
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
the redstone torch right here
 

911
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,390
the redstone torch right here
where this block is but then the water

912
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:52,400
where this block is but then the water
 

913
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,150
where this block is but then the water
would have flowed into it so i have to

914
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
would have flowed into it so i have to
 

915
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,870
would have flowed into it so i have to
go one block

916
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:54,880
go one block
 

917
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,549
go one block
out oops problem with doing that though

918
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
out oops problem with doing that though
 

919
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,789
out oops problem with doing that though
is now the hopper

920
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
is now the hopper
 

921
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,070
is now the hopper
is going to have to go to one of these

922
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
is going to have to go to one of these
 

923
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,630
is going to have to go to one of these
sides instead of

924
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640

 

925
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,230

yeah because this is the block here with

926
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
yeah because this is the block here with
 

927
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,909
yeah because this is the block here with
the redstone torch on

928
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919

 

929
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,510

all right so i had to rip this up a

930
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:17,520
all right so i had to rip this up a
 

931
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,990
all right so i had to rip this up a
little bit i was having some trouble i

932
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
little bit i was having some trouble i
 

933
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,830
little bit i was having some trouble i
finally figure out how to place a hopper

934
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:21,840
finally figure out how to place a hopper
 

935
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,590
finally figure out how to place a hopper
the direction you want though

936
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,600
the direction you want though
 

937
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,390
the direction you want though
uh what it is is it it connects to

938
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
uh what it is is it it connects to
 

939
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,510
uh what it is is it it connects to
whatever block

940
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:27,520
whatever block
 

941
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,590
whatever block
your cursor is facing so right now i'm

942
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600
your cursor is facing so right now i'm
 

943
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,830
your cursor is facing so right now i'm
facing this side of the block

944
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
facing this side of the block
 

945
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,470
facing this side of the block
so it will connect to that block if i'm

946
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
so it will connect to that block if i'm
 

947
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,110
so it will connect to that block if i'm
facing

948
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
facing
 

949
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,630
facing
the grass when i place it it'll go down

950
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
the grass when i place it it'll go down
 

951
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,390
the grass when i place it it'll go down
towards the grass

952
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
towards the grass
 

953

961
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,110

actually let's put a block here we're

962
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,120
actually let's put a block here we're
 

963
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,789
actually let's put a block here we're
going to run a second hopper

964
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:54,799
going to run a second hopper
 

965
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,230

we gotta do some more testing i think
 

991
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,950
we gotta do some more testing i think
to see how the brewing stands interact

992
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
to see how the brewing stands interact
 

993
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,789
to see how the brewing stands interact
with the hoppers there's a few things

994
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:40,799
with the hoppers there's a few things
 

995
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,750
with the hoppers there's a few things
that

996
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
that
 

997
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,190
that
oops still still need to figure out here

998
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,200

 

999
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,710

all right just want to double check this

1000
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
all right just want to double check this
 

1001
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,630
all right just want to double check this
if i have like a stack of nether wart in

1002
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
if i have like a stack of nether wart in
 

1003
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,669
if i have like a stack of nether wart in
here is it going to

1004
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
here is it going to
 

1005
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,789
here is it going to
pump it through oh the whole stack all

1006
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
pump it through oh the whole stack all
 

1007
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,830
pump it through oh the whole stack all
at once

1008
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840
at once
 

1009
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,549
at once
interesting that's a little scary

1010
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:02,559

 

1011
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,230

hmm

1012
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,240

 

1013
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,909

why is the pump so fast

1014
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919

 

1015
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,789

i thought

1016
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799

 

1017
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,950

oh boy i thought it would pump one at a

1018
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:18,960
oh boy i thought it would pump one at a
 

1019
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,669
oh boy i thought it would pump one at a
time at least

1020
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:19,679
time at least
 

1021
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:26,549
time at least
it went the whole thing

1022
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:26,559
it went the whole thing
 

1023
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,510
it went the whole thing
okay so it goes to the hopper instantly

1024
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:29,520
okay so it goes to the hopper instantly
 

1025
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,630
okay so it goes to the hopper instantly
but then it goes to

1026
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
but then it goes to
 

1027
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,909
but then it goes to
minecart one at a time uh

1028
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919
minecart one at a time uh
 

1029
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,750
minecart one at a time uh
that's a bit scary we might have to fill

1030
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:37,760
that's a bit scary we might have to fill
 

1031
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,950
that's a bit scary we might have to fill
the hopper up with stuff to stop that

1032
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:40,960
the hopper up with stuff to stop that
 

1033
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,950
the hopper up with stuff to stop that
or just fill in the oh yeah we might

1034
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:42,960
or just fill in the oh yeah we might
 

1035
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,630
or just fill in the oh yeah we might
just have to fill in the last uh

1036
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640
just have to fill in the last uh
 

1037
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,950
just have to fill in the last uh
four slots or something to stop that

1038
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:48,960
four slots or something to stop that
 

1039
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,710
four slots or something to stop that
with something you can't

1040
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:50,720
with something you can't
 

1041
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,390
with something you can't
use well i don't know

1042
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400
use well i don't know
 

1043
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,990
use well i don't know
all right i'll think about that next

1044
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
all right i'll think about that next
 

1045
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,310
all right i'll think about that next
thing gotta figure out will a hopper

1046
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,320
thing gotta figure out will a hopper
 

1047
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,870
thing gotta figure out will a hopper
pick stuff

1048
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
pick stuff
 

1049
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,909
pick stuff
up if there's a rail over top from the

1050
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
up if there's a rail over top from the
 

1051
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,750
up if there's a rail over top from the
mine carts

1052
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:03,760
mine carts
 

1053
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,950
mine carts
so we will

1054
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960

 

1055
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,270

we'll do this oops

1056
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,280

 

1057
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,110

run a rail line over top

1058
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
run a rail line over top
 

1059
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,830
run a rail line over top
and a block and do we have another chest

1060
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:19,840
and a block and do we have another chest
 

1061
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,750
and a block and do we have another chest
no let's just use a dispenser

1062
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:23,760
no let's just use a dispenser
 

1063
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,230
no let's just use a dispenser
okay so stuff we put in here

1064
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,240
okay so stuff we put in here
 

1065
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,430
okay so stuff we put in here
is this empty yeah stuff we put in here

1066
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
is this empty yeah stuff we put in here
 

1067
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,870
is this empty yeah stuff we put in here
should hopefully go into that dispenser

1068
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
should hopefully go into that dispenser
 

1069
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,909
should hopefully go into that dispenser
go go man

1070
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
go go man
 

1071
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,149
go go man
awesome okay that might be a good way of

1072
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
awesome okay that might be a good way of
 

1073
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,909
awesome okay that might be a good way of
doing the brewing stands have like

1074
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:43,919
doing the brewing stands have like
 

1075
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,870
doing the brewing stands have like
brewing stand hopper then to the left

1076
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
brewing stand hopper then to the left
 

1077
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,830
brewing stand hopper then to the left
have a rail line

1078
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:48,840
have a rail line
 

1079
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,149
have a rail line
then then hopper

1080
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:52,159
then then hopper
 

1081
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,669
then then hopper
brewing stand and

1082
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:55,679
brewing stand and
 

1083
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,390
brewing stand and
yeah i might do a staircase shape if we

1084
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
yeah i might do a staircase shape if we
 

1085
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,190
yeah i might do a staircase shape if we
do that

1086
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200

 

1087
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,269

hmm i wonder if there's a better way

1088
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:07,279

 

1089
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,430

uh i've been thinking about this and i'm

1090
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,440
uh i've been thinking about this and i'm
 

1091
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,630
uh i've been thinking about this and i'm
pretty sure

1092
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:10,640
pretty sure
 

1093
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,470
pretty sure
we have to have the brewing stand on top

1094
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,480
we have to have the brewing stand on top
 

1095
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,549
we have to have the brewing stand on top
of a hopper the problem is

1096
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
of a hopper the problem is
 

1097
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,230
of a hopper the problem is
then it's always pulling the potions and

1098
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,240
then it's always pulling the potions and
 

1099
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,149
then it's always pulling the potions and
stuff out

1100
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:18,159
stuff out
 

1101
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,230
stuff out
so i think we have to jam it up with

1102
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,240
so i think we have to jam it up with
 

1103
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,190
so i think we have to jam it up with
stuff

1104
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,200
stuff
 

1105
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,390
stuff
and have one spot with whatever it

1106
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
and have one spot with whatever it
 

1107
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,390
and have one spot with whatever it
normally brews

1108
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,400
normally brews
 

1109
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,789
normally brews
and then just time it right

1110
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:30,799

 

1111
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,190

so that's the cart is only there

1112
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,200
so that's the cart is only there
 

1113
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,750
so that's the cart is only there
actually let's try something here too

1114
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:35,760
actually let's try something here too
 

1115
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,070
actually let's try something here too
uh wait what i want to try

1116
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080

 

1117
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,070

oh yeah i want to see what order they

1118
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
oh yeah i want to see what order they
 

1119
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,230
oh yeah i want to see what order they
enter the cart is it going to be

1120
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,240
enter the cart is it going to be
 

1121
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,830
enter the cart is it going to be

1125
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,029
water bottle or is it going to be water
bottle combo couple cup a cup of water

1126
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,039
bottle combo couple cup a cup of water
 

1127
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,070
bottle combo couple cup a cup of water

1128
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
bottle water bottle you know what i mean
 

1129
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,830
bottle water bottle you know what i mean
let's check that out

1130
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:57,840

 

1131
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,830

hello minecarts did they go to the

1132
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
hello minecarts did they go to the
 

1133
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,029
hello minecarts did they go to the
oh they went down yeah

1134
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:05,039
oh they went down yeah
 

1135
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:11,190
oh they went down yeah
okay water bottle first that's good news

1136
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200

 

1137
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,269

i i think next update they're probably

1138
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
i i think next update they're probably
 

1139
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,630
i i think next update they're probably
going to change it where

1140
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
going to change it where
 

1141
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,390
going to change it where
the hopper will work off of red a

1142
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,400
the hopper will work off of red a
 

1143
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,230
the hopper will work off of red a
redstone signal or at least i hope they

1144
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
redstone signal or at least i hope they
 

1145
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,149
redstone signal or at least i hope they
do because

1146
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
do because
 

1147
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,510
do because
uh it's really hard to control it if you

1148
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:23,520
uh it's really hard to control it if you
 

1149
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,830
uh it's really hard to control it if you
if you can't use redstone like how long

1150
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:25,840
if you can't use redstone like how long
 

1151
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,190
if you can't use redstone like how long
you want it to be on for

1152
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200
you want it to be on for
 

1153
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,630
you want it to be on for
it's a work in progress so i'm sure

1154
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,640
it's a work in progress so i'm sure
 

1155
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,269
it's a work in progress so i'm sure
they'll do something to make it better

1156
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:33,279
they'll do something to make it better
 

1157
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,310
they'll do something to make it better
but what i'm doing now got that filled

1158
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
but what i'm doing now got that filled
 

1159
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,430
but what i'm doing now got that filled
up

1160
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:37,440
up
 

1161
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,830
up
there's three potions so when this

1162
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:40,840
there's three potions so when this
 

1163
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,230
there's three potions so when this
finishes

1164
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,240
finishes
 

1165
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,710
finishes
somehow we have to tell the cart it's

1166
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,720
somehow we have to tell the cart it's
 

1167
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,470
somehow we have to tell the cart it's
done and it's going to come

1168
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,480
done and it's going to come
 

1169
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,710
done and it's going to come
and hopefully only pick up three potions

1170
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
and hopefully only pick up three potions
 

1171
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,710
and hopefully only pick up three potions
here

1172
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,720
here
 

1173
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,110
here
if it picks up less that's fine we can

1174
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,120
if it picks up less that's fine we can
 

1175
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,430
if it picks up less that's fine we can
adjust it so that it stays longer

1176
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:55,440
adjust it so that it stays longer
 

1177
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,590
adjust it so that it stays longer
if it picks up more than three though i

1178
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,600
if it picks up more than three though i
 

1179
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,630
if it picks up more than three though i
don't know how to make it

1180
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
don't know how to make it
 

1181
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,070
don't know how to make it
quicker to be honest oh

1182
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,080

 

1183
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,269

oh it only picked up one okay

1184
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:07,279
oh it only picked up one okay
 

1185
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,950
oh it only picked up one okay
so we need to slow it down

1186
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960
so we need to slow it down
 

1187
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,789
so we need to slow it down
uh the easiest way of me to figure out

1188
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:12,799
uh the easiest way of me to figure out
 

1189
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,470
uh the easiest way of me to figure out
the timing is probably just do something

1190
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
the timing is probably just do something
 

1191
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,110
the timing is probably just do something
like this

1192
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,120
like this
 

1193
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,070
like this
set up a chest hopper another chest put

1194
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
set up a chest hopper another chest put
 

1195
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,149
set up a chest hopper another chest put
items in

1196
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
items in
 

1197
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,549
items in
and then i go to my recording software

1198
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:22,559
and then i go to my recording software
 

1199
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,590
and then i go to my recording software
afterwards and take

1200
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600
afterwards and take
 

1201
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,549
afterwards and take
and count how long it takes for three

1202
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:26,559
and count how long it takes for three
 

1203
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,549
and count how long it takes for three
three items to leave here

1204
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:28,559
three items to leave here
 

1205
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,149
three items to leave here
and i should have my exact time needed

1206
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:34,159

 

1207
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,630

and i just did that and it looks like

1208
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
and i just did that and it looks like
 

1209
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,990
and i just did that and it looks like
each item

1210
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,000
each item
 

1211
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,190
each item
moves through the hopper at a rate of 1

1212
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,200
moves through the hopper at a rate of 1
 

1213
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,549
moves through the hopper at a rate of 1
every 0.35 seconds

1214
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559
every 0.35 seconds
 

1215
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,190
every 0.35 seconds
so just about a third of a second so

1216
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:47,200
so just about a third of a second so
 

1217
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,710
so just about a third of a second so
three items is probably going to be

1218
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
three items is probably going to be
 

1219
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,789
three items is probably going to be
one second or 1.05 seconds

1220
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
one second or 1.05 seconds
 

1221
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,230
one second or 1.05 seconds
or in repeater language

1222
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,240
or in repeater language
 

1223
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,430
or in repeater language
somewhere between

1224
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,440

 

1225
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,590

that and that i think

1226
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
that and that i think
 

1227
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,070
that and that i think
however curt travel time also adds that

1228
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,080
however curt travel time also adds that
 

1229
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,630
however curt travel time also adds that
delay so i just have

1230
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:12,640
delay so i just have
 

1231
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,230
delay so i just have
i have like two seconds worth of delay

1232
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,240
i have like two seconds worth of delay
 

1233
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,390
i have like two seconds worth of delay
there and i have the hopper with

1234
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,400
there and i have the hopper with
 

1235
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,909
there and i have the hopper with
some stuff in we can see and adjust it

1236
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:19,919
some stuff in we can see and adjust it
 

1237
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,789
some stuff in we can see and adjust it
pretty easily just by doing this

1238
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:22,799
pretty easily just by doing this
 

1239
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,710
pretty easily just by doing this
seeing how much it picks up from that so

1240
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
seeing how much it picks up from that so
 

1241
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,470
seeing how much it picks up from that so
we got six

1242
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480
we got six
 

1243
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,070
we got six
let's shorten this a little bit

1244
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,080
let's shorten this a little bit
 

1245
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,830
let's shorten this a little bit
see what it takes next time

1246
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:33,840

 

1247
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,669

three okay that's what we want three is

1248
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:35,679
three okay that's what we want three is
 

1249
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,710
three okay that's what we want three is
the number we want can we repeat that

1250
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:38,720
the number we want can we repeat that
 

1251
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,830
the number we want can we repeat that
three

1252
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:43,840

 

1253
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,110

four oh that's bad

1254
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,120
four oh that's bad
 

1255
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,549
four oh that's bad
uh it's inconsistent uh let's

1256
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:50,559
uh it's inconsistent uh let's
 

1257
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,669
uh it's inconsistent uh let's
let's shorten that one more tick

1258
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679
let's shorten that one more tick
 

1259
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,029
let's shorten that one more tick
try it again

1260
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:57,039

 

1261
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,269

three

1262
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:01,279

 

1263
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,630

four hmm

1264
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:04,640

 

1265
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,950

why so inconsistent

1266
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:08,960

 

1267
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,230

uh shorten it one more

1268
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:14,240

 

1269
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,470

well you know it's probably possible

1270
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:16,480
well you know it's probably possible
 

1271
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,269
well you know it's probably possible
then

1272
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:17,279
then
 

1273
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,310
then
get the in between i would

1274
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,320
get the in between i would
 

1275
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,470
get the in between i would
think

1276
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480

 

1277
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,669

oh i might press that button too soon

1278
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:29,679

 

1279
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,710

four again no way

1280
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:32,720
four again no way
 

1281
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,430
four again no way
all right whoops well that's gonna mess

1282
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,440
all right whoops well that's gonna mess
 

1283
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,070
all right whoops well that's gonna mess
everything up

1284
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,080
everything up
 

1285
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,750
everything up
darn it uh one more timing thing i want

1286
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:39,760
darn it uh one more timing thing i want
 

1287
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,470
darn it uh one more timing thing i want
to figure out

1288
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:40,480
to figure out
 

1289
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,070
to figure out
is how long it takes to actually brew

1290
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080
is how long it takes to actually brew
 

1291
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,590
is how long it takes to actually brew
stuff that's pretty important

1292
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,600
stuff that's pretty important
 

1293
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,750
stuff that's pretty important
is there anything in there let's just

1294
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:47,760
is there anything in there let's just
 

1295
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,909
is there anything in there let's just
fill this up

1296
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:49,919
fill this up
 

1297
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,269
fill this up
so let's brew let's brew some potions

1298
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:53,279
so let's brew let's brew some potions
 

1299
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,830
so let's brew let's brew some potions
here and i'll time it

1300
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:55,840
here and i'll time it
 

1301
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,630
here and i'll time it
this is i guess we'll just brew two

1302
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:58,640
this is i guess we'll just brew two
 

1303
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,830
this is i guess we'll just brew two
because that's all the bottles we have

1304
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:01,840
because that's all the bottles we have
 

1305
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,950
because that's all the bottles we have
okay and

1306
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:04,960
okay and
 

1307
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,149
okay and
here it goes so i'm gonna go back to my

1308
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
here it goes so i'm gonna go back to my
 

1309
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,230
here it goes so i'm gonna go back to my
editing software and just check how long

1310
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,240
editing software and just check how long
 

1311
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,830
editing software and just check how long
this takes i think it's the same for

1312
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:11,840
this takes i think it's the same for
 

1313
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,190
this takes i think it's the same for
every

1314
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
every
 

1315
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,389
every
like no matter what you're brewing

1316
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:16,399
like no matter what you're brewing
 

1317
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,470
like no matter what you're brewing
um we got to figure out how we're going

1318
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
um we got to figure out how we're going
 

1319
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,070
um we got to figure out how we're going
to activate everything as a problem

1320
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
to activate everything as a problem
 

1321
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,070
to activate everything as a problem
oh why'd the cart just move that was

1322
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,080
oh why'd the cart just move that was
 

1323
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,510
oh why'd the cart just move that was
weird

1324
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:25,520
weird
 

1325
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,230
weird
okay so that's what we got or that's

1326
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,240
okay so that's what we got or that's
 

1327
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,590
okay so that's what we got or that's
what we needed

1328
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:29,600
what we needed
 

1329
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,430
what we needed
uh to act or to time things

1330
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,440
uh to act or to time things
 

1331
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,350
uh to act or to time things
properly i think what we have to do is

1332
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
properly i think what we have to do is
 

1333
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,950
properly i think what we have to do is
have one of these

1334
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:38,960

 

1335
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,950

this will tell us how many things are in

1336
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
this will tell us how many things are in
 

1337
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,149
this will tell us how many things are in
a brewing stand

1338
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:44,159

 

1339
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,110

well we'll just steal these we're always

1340
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,120
well we'll just steal these we're always
 

1341
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,350
well we'll just steal these we're always
going to be doing three though

1342
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,360

 

1343
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,389

so it'll put out a redstone signal based

1344
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:54,399
so it'll put out a redstone signal based
 

1345
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,830
so it'll put out a redstone signal based
on how many items are in it

1346
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,840
on how many items are in it
 

1347
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,590
on how many items are in it
so if there's only one item it goes

1348
00:29:59,590 --> 00:29:59,600
so if there's only one item it goes
 

1349
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,110
so if there's only one item it goes
three blocks if there's

1350
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
three blocks if there's
 

1351
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,710
three blocks if there's
two

1352
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720

 

1353
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,070

seven seven blocks uh we'll

1354
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,080
seven seven blocks uh we'll
 

1355
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:15,110
seven seven blocks uh we'll
have to invert that i think

1356
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,120

 

1357
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,710

right i don't know uh and if there's

1358
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:18,720
right i don't know uh and if there's
 

1359
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,029
right i don't know uh and if there's
three things in we want it to turn on

1360
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:25,039

 

1361
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,710

maybe it wants all

1362
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:28,720

 

1363
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,789

no

1364
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:32,799

 

1365
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,149

we have to subtract okay that's on now

1366
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159

 

1367
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:45,510

one item turns it off hmm

1368
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,520

 

1369
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,710

i don't know if that's really what we

1370
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:46,720
i don't know if that's really what we
 

1371
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,789
i don't know if that's really what we
want i guess i could probably work too

1372
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:50,799
want i guess i could probably work too
 

1373
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,470
want i guess i could probably work too
i don't know all right so based on that

1374
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:54,480
i don't know all right so based on that
 

1375
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,549
i don't know all right so based on that
we can tell if we need

1376
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:56,559
we can tell if we need
 

1377
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,669
we can tell if we need
to make stuff happen and

1378
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
to make stuff happen and
 

1379
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,190
to make stuff happen and
when we make stuff happen we have to

1380
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,200
when we make stuff happen we have to
 

1381
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,950
when we make stuff happen we have to
figure out how long

1382
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:02,960
figure out how long
 

1383
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,710
figure out how long
in between making stuff happen so i'm

1384
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:04,720
in between making stuff happen so i'm
 

1385
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,789
in between making stuff happen so i'm
gonna check the editing

1386
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:08,799

 

1387
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,830

well it looks like it takes potions 20

1388
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
well it looks like it takes potions 20
 

1389
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,870
well it looks like it takes potions 20
seconds to brew

1390
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:12,880
seconds to brew
 

1391
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,750
seconds to brew
each each stage here so four stages

1392
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:15,760
each each stage here so four stages
 

1393
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,029
each each stage here so four stages
that's 80 seconds to brew a batch

1394
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:19,039
that's 80 seconds to brew a batch
 

1395
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,549
that's 80 seconds to brew a batch
of speed potions uh

1396
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:22,559
of speed potions uh
 

1397
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,909
of speed potions uh
this thing here i think i got this

1398
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:23,919
this thing here i think i got this
 

1399
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,149
this thing here i think i got this
timing correct now

1400
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:26,159
timing correct now
 

1401
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,389
timing correct now
so there's there's some blocks in there

1402
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:28,399
so there's there's some blocks in there
 

1403
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,269
so there's there's some blocks in there
i i changed it to 11

1404
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:31,279
i i changed it to 11
 

1405
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,590
i i changed it to 11
11 seems to be the trick number i

1406
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:33,600
11 seems to be the trick number i
 

1407
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,590
11 seems to be the trick number i
haven't seen it fail yet

1408
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:35,600
haven't seen it fail yet
 

1409
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,870
haven't seen it fail yet
there's three

1410
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:38,880

 

1411
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,990

six

1412
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,000

 

1413
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,669

nine so it's going up by three every

1414
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:43,679
nine so it's going up by three every
 

1415
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,830
nine so it's going up by three every
time pretty consistently it looks like

1416
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:45,840
time pretty consistently it looks like
 

1417
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,549
time pretty consistently it looks like
12.

1418
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:48,559

 

1419
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,590

so this is good i'm glad this works

1420
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:51,600
so this is good i'm glad this works
 

1421
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,110
so this is good i'm glad this works
it's very simple too

1422
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,120

 

1423
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,350

and all this is doing is acting as a

1424
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,360
and all this is doing is acting as a
 

1425
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,590
and all this is doing is acting as a
control to turn the hopper on and off so

1426
00:31:59,590 --> 00:31:59,600
control to turn the hopper on and off so
 

1427
00:31:59,600 --> 00:31:59,990
control to turn the hopper on and off so
it'll go

1428
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,000
it'll go
 

1429
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,310
it'll go
from it'll go through the cart and down

1430
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,320
from it'll go through the cart and down
 

1431
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,950
from it'll go through the cart and down
into this one

1432
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:04,960
into this one
 

1433
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,590
into this one
when we want it to 7

1434
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,600
when we want it to 7
 

1435
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,590
when we want it to 7
30 let's just go all the way make sure

1436
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
30 let's just go all the way make sure
 

1437
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,190
30 let's just go all the way make sure
i've done i've done a bunch of testing

1438
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
i've done i've done a bunch of testing
 

1439
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,950
i've done i've done a bunch of testing
before this too and i haven't seen a

1440
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:16,960
before this too and i haven't seen a
 

1441
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,110
before this too and i haven't seen a
fail

1442
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,120
fail
 

1443
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,310
fail
that's good that's going to be our

1444
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,320
that's good that's going to be our
 

1445
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,509
that's good that's going to be our
unloader i'm pretty sure

1446
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:23,519
unloader i'm pretty sure
 

1447
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,990
unloader i'm pretty sure
i have done a lot of rethinking here

1448
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,000
i have done a lot of rethinking here
 

1449
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,350
i have done a lot of rethinking here
though

1450
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
though
 

1451
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,590
though
it might like it looks like it's gonna

1452
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:29,600
it might like it looks like it's gonna
 

1453
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,909
it might like it looks like it's gonna
be extremely complicated

1454
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:31,919
be extremely complicated
 

1455
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,990
be extremely complicated
having four brewing stands so we should

1456
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,000
having four brewing stands so we should
 

1457
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,310
having four brewing stands so we should
probably switch to one

1458
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,320
probably switch to one
 

1459
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,070
probably switch to one
and yeah i wasn't really thinking about

1460
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,080
and yeah i wasn't really thinking about
 

1461
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,789
and yeah i wasn't really thinking about
this right

1462
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:40,799
this right
 

1463
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,310
this right
uh if we if we have our bottles

1464
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,320
uh if we if we have our bottles
 

1465
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,830
uh if we if we have our bottles
first and then we give

1466
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:47,840
first and then we give
 

1467
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,430
first and then we give
nether warts and then we give

1468
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:51,440
nether warts and then we give
 

1469
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,070
nether warts and then we give
our sugar and a redstone

1470
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,080
our sugar and a redstone
 

1471
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,830
our sugar and a redstone
this stuff going

1472
00:32:59,830 --> 00:32:59,840

 

1473
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,590

what the heck oh it's stacking okay

1474
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:03,600
what the heck oh it's stacking okay
 

1475
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,430
what the heck oh it's stacking okay
sugar redstone gunpowder

1476
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:09,440

 

1477
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,509

oh it's going through

1478
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:15,519

 

1479
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,350

well maybe i'm not overthinking oh yeah

1480
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:17,360
well maybe i'm not overthinking oh yeah
 

1481
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,269
well maybe i'm not overthinking oh yeah
because the slots will all be full

1482
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:19,279
because the slots will all be full
 

1483
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,190
because the slots will all be full
so they'll go into this one at a time so

1484
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
so they'll go into this one at a time so
 

1485
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,310
so they'll go into this one at a time so
when it finishes with the netherward

1486
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,320
when it finishes with the netherward
 

1487
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,990
when it finishes with the netherward
there'll be a slot open for the sugar to

1488
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,000
there'll be a slot open for the sugar to
 

1489
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,950
there'll be a slot open for the sugar to
go in then they'll take the sugar out

1490
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:28,960
go in then they'll take the sugar out
 

1491
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,990
go in then they'll take the sugar out
and the hopper will act as our buffer

1492
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,000
and the hopper will act as our buffer
 

1493
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,830
and the hopper will act as our buffer
it'll do it one by one

1494
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:36,840

 

1495
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,230

bedtime

1496
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,240

 

1497
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,669

oh no it wasn't quite night time again i

1498
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:45,679
oh no it wasn't quite night time again i
 

1499
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:46,950
oh no it wasn't quite night time again i
did it again

1500
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:46,960
did it again
 

1501
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,830
did it again
uh also we can't have the chest like

1502
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:49,840
uh also we can't have the chest like
 

1503
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,750
uh also we can't have the chest like
this we have to have a hopper underneath

1504
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:51,760
this we have to have a hopper underneath
 

1505
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,269
this we have to have a hopper underneath
chest to take items out

1506
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:53,279
chest to take items out
 

1507
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,230
chest to take items out
that's a rule and i think it would be

1508
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,240
that's a rule and i think it would be
 

1509
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,470
that's a rule and i think it would be
better to use dispensers here

1510
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:00,480

 

1511
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,549

instead oh my gun powder

1512
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:04,559
instead oh my gun powder
 

1513
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,389
instead oh my gun powder
precious gunpowder what did i just throw

1514
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399
precious gunpowder what did i just throw
 

1515
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,349
precious gunpowder what did i just throw
away

1516
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:09,359

 

1517
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,550

uh have four dispensers here facing

1518
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,560
uh have four dispensers here facing
 

1519
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,230
uh have four dispensers here facing
this way

1520
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,240

 

1521
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,349

with our items in so we'll still be able

1522
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:19,359
with our items in so we'll still be able
 

1523
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:19,990
with our items in so we'll still be able
to interact

1524
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,000
to interact
 

1525
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,190
to interact
with it on this side doesn't look quite

1526
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,200
with it on this side doesn't look quite
 

1527
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,629
with it on this side doesn't look quite
as good

1528
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:24,639
as good
 

1529
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,430
as good
as the chess i have to say but it'll

1530
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:27,440
as the chess i have to say but it'll
 

1531
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,349
as the chess i have to say but it'll
work better

1532
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:29,359
work better
 

1533
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,589
work better
and then we'll have redstone we'll

1534
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:31,599
and then we'll have redstone we'll
 

1535
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,950
and then we'll have redstone we'll
probably have to get rid of our infinite

1536
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:32,960
probably have to get rid of our infinite
 

1537
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,109
probably have to get rid of our infinite
spring too i hate to say

1538
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:37,119

 

1539
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,669

then have a water stream here which will

1540
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:39,679
then have a water stream here which will
 

1541
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,629
then have a water stream here which will
take

1542
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:40,639
take
 

1543
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,669
take
take the items to our brewing stand

1544
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:43,679
take the items to our brewing stand
 

1545
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,510
take the items to our brewing stand
hopper

1546
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,520
hopper
 

1547
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,510
hopper
and we'll just time these so that they

1548
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520
and we'll just time these so that they
 

1549
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,950
and we'll just time these so that they
go out in the right order we'll also

1550
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:48,960
go out in the right order we'll also
 

1551
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,629
go out in the right order we'll also
have to have one for

1552
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:50,639
have to have one for
 

1553
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,909
have to have one for
the water bottles which will get fired

1554
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:53,919
the water bottles which will get fired
 

1555
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,190
the water bottles which will get fired
first

1556
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,200
first
 

1557
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,109
first
that will go to our brewing stand hopper

1558
00:34:57,109 --> 00:34:57,119
that will go to our brewing stand hopper
 

1559
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,470
that will go to our brewing stand hopper
and then the plan i have with that

1560
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,480
and then the plan i have with that
 

1561
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,750
and then the plan i have with that
i was messing around with it here

1562
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:03,760
i was messing around with it here
 

1563
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,270
i was messing around with it here
uh basically this is kind of cool

1564
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,280
uh basically this is kind of cool
 

1565
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,630
uh basically this is kind of cool
this isn't going to brew but if we have

1566
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:12,640
this isn't going to brew but if we have
 

1567
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,390
this isn't going to brew but if we have
we have our order here

1568
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:16,400
we have our order here
 

1569
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,710
we have our order here
sugar redstone gunpowder we have a

1570
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:18,720
sugar redstone gunpowder we have a
 

1571
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,069
sugar redstone gunpowder we have a
comparator here

1572
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:22,079

 

1573
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:28,069

um let's just get rid of this

1574
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:28,079

 

1575
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,310

oh darn i should have showed you this

1576
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:30,320
oh darn i should have showed you this
 

1577
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,829
oh darn i should have showed you this
first darn

1578
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:33,839

 

1579
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,349

ah so much junk so hard to move items

1580
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:37,359
ah so much junk so hard to move items
 

1581
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,710
ah so much junk so hard to move items
around

1582
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:38,720
around
 

1583
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,750
around
so if there's only three items in here

1584
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:41,760
so if there's only three items in here
 

1585
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,990
so if there's only three items in here
the signal only reaches this far

1586
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,000

 

1587
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,310

so it doesn't go to this block here if

1588
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:48,320
so it doesn't go to this block here if
 

1589
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,750
so it doesn't go to this block here if
we have a fourth item like the

1590
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:49,760
we have a fourth item like the
 

1591
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,190
we have a fourth item like the
netherward in here

1592
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200

 

1593
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,390

it will go all the way and

1594
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:56,400
it will go all the way and
 

1595
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,270
it will go all the way and
when stuff is brewing

1596
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:01,280

 

1597
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,470

it'll go all the way and

1598
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:04,480
it'll go all the way and
 

1599
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,150
it'll go all the way and
what i plan to do once this finishes

1600
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,160
what i plan to do once this finishes
 

1601
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,310
what i plan to do once this finishes
this nether wart

1602
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,320
this nether wart
 

1603
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,510
this nether wart
right right um if you look closely at

1604
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520
right right um if you look closely at
 

1605
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,030
right right um if you look closely at
the end of this wire while i'm in the

1606
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,040
the end of this wire while i'm in the
 

1607
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,310
the end of this wire while i'm in the
window here

1608
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,320
window here
 

1609
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,630
window here
it's going to pulse once once this

1610
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:20,640
it's going to pulse once once this
 

1611
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,150
it's going to pulse once once this
finishes the netherwood's going to

1612
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,160
finishes the netherwood's going to
 

1613
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,990
finishes the netherwood's going to
disappear it's going to open up a free

1614
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,000
disappear it's going to open up a free
 

1615
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,230
disappear it's going to open up a free
slot for a moment a brief moment

1616
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,240
slot for a moment a brief moment
 

1617
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,510
slot for a moment a brief moment
and the gunpowder goes in i don't know

1618
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,520
and the gunpowder goes in i don't know
 

1619
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,910
and the gunpowder goes in i don't know
if you saw but it pulsed there

1620
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:31,920
if you saw but it pulsed there
 

1621
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,990
if you saw but it pulsed there
and what i plan on you doing is using

1622
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,000
and what i plan on you doing is using
 

1623
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,790
and what i plan on you doing is using
that little pulse

1624
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:36,800
that little pulse
 

1625
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,069
that little pulse
and a redstone locking counter

1626
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:40,079
and a redstone locking counter
 

1627
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,069
and a redstone locking counter
thing so uh i don't have the setup

1628
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:44,079
thing so uh i don't have the setup
 

1629
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:44,790
thing so uh i don't have the setup
though i

1630
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:44,800
though i
 

1631
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,069
though i
unfortunately but you can use locking

1632
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:48,079
unfortunately but you can use locking
 

1633
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,230
unfortunately but you can use locking
repeaters as a good counter you send a

1634
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,240
repeaters as a good counter you send a
 

1635
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,670
repeaters as a good counter you send a
quick pulse

1636
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:51,680
quick pulse
 

1637
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,670
quick pulse
to this line here then you lock it

1638
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,680
to this line here then you lock it
 

1639
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,069
to this line here then you lock it
so that the signal can't get through and

1640
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:58,079
so that the signal can't get through and
 

1641
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,829
so that the signal can't get through and
every time you pulse it it'll go through

1642
00:36:59,829 --> 00:36:59,839
every time you pulse it it'll go through
 

1643
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,670
every time you pulse it it'll go through
one more repeater

1644
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:01,680
one more repeater
 

1645
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,430
one more repeater
until it finally makes it out the end

1646
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:03,440
until it finally makes it out the end
 

1647
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,710
until it finally makes it out the end
and when it gets to here

1648
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:04,720
and when it gets to here
 

1649
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,230
and when it gets to here
it's going to automatically

1650
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,240
it's going to automatically
 

1651
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,430
it's going to automatically
restarts the process of shooting out

1652
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:11,440
restarts the process of shooting out
 

1653
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,030
restarts the process of shooting out
water bottles

1654
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,040
water bottles
 

1655
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,069
water bottles
and then the ingredients

1656
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:16,079
and then the ingredients
 

1657
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,349
and then the ingredients
and it will restart everything if

1658
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:19,359
and it will restart everything if
 

1659
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,950
and it will restart everything if
it'll do a check as well if there's

1660
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:20,960
it'll do a check as well if there's
 

1661
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,790
it'll do a check as well if there's
enough water bottles in the chest we'll

1662
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
enough water bottles in the chest we'll
 

1663
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,190
enough water bottles in the chest we'll
use a comparator for that

1664
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
use a comparator for that
 

1665
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,870
use a comparator for that
then it will do all that stuff otherwise

1666
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:26,880
then it will do all that stuff otherwise
 

1667
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,790
then it will do all that stuff otherwise
we'll have to restart it with a button

1668
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:30,800

 

1669
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,310

that's my concept thing is

1670
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:34,320
that's my concept thing is
 

1671
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,150
that's my concept thing is
there might be a new patch tomorrow i'm

1672
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,160
there might be a new patch tomorrow i'm
 

1673
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,390
there might be a new patch tomorrow i'm
not sure what the plan is with that

1674
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:38,400
not sure what the plan is with that
 

1675
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,470
not sure what the plan is with that
uh and for all i know hoppers are

1676
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:40,480
uh and for all i know hoppers are
 

1677
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,310
uh and for all i know hoppers are
probably going to change

1678
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:42,320
probably going to change
 

1679
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,630
probably going to change
so i and the episode's getting longer so

1680
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:44,640
so i and the episode's getting longer so
 

1681
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,750
so i and the episode's getting longer so
i think we're just going to leave it at

1682
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:45,760
i think we're just going to leave it at
 

1683
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,910
i think we're just going to leave it at
this for today i have the concept

1684
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:47,920
this for today i have the concept
 

1685
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,270
this for today i have the concept
