not really altering the shape of the
 

139
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,509
not really altering the shape of the
cave too much unless there's

140
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
cave too much unless there's
 

141
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,350
cave too much unless there's
there's no cave then we sometimes need

142
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
there's no cave then we sometimes need
 

143
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,150
there's no cave then we sometimes need
to dig dig out areas but

144
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
to dig dig out areas but
 

145
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,390
to dig dig out areas but
we're also trying to avoid using torches

146
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
we're also trying to avoid using torches
 

147
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,790
we're also trying to avoid using torches
wherever possible so we have hidden

148
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
wherever possible so we have hidden
 

149
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,869
wherever possible so we have hidden
lighting throughout this whole place

150
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
lighting throughout this whole place
 

151
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,470
lighting throughout this whole place
the very first thing we built in the

152
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
the very first thing we built in the
 

153
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,309
the very first thing we built in the
world is the creeper face i'm pretty

154
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319

00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
sure
 

157
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,630
sure
and then we set set up like a storage

158
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
and then we set set up like a storage
 

159
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,630
and then we set set up like a storage
room area over here where our horse

160
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
room area over here where our horse
 

161

and then right after that i think we

164
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
and then right after that i think we
 

165
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,309
and then right after that i think we
started settling in

166
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
started settling in
 

167
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,350
started settling in
this area up here because it was around

168
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
this area up here because it was around
 

169
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,509
this area up here because it was around
the time

170
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
the time
 

171
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,030
the time
uh what was it it was around the

172
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
uh what was it it was around the
 

173
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,430
uh what was it it was around the
adventure update actually when like

174
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
adventure update actually when like
 

175
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,270
adventure update actually when like
bannon mine shafts and all that came out

176
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
bannon mine shafts and all that came out
 

177
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,470
bannon mine shafts and all that came out
so

178
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
so
 

179
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,309
so
there was some cave spider spawners here

180
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
there was some cave spider spawners here
 

181
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,070
there was some cave spider spawners here
which really caught my attention and we

182
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
which really caught my attention and we
 

183
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,430
which really caught my attention and we
built like

184
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
built like
 

185
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,830
built like
a cave spider exp farm for the for the

186
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
a cave spider exp farm for the for the
 

187
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,949
a cave spider exp farm for the for the
first time

188
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
first time
 

189
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,949
first time
and that's what this is over here this

190
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
and that's what this is over here this
 

191
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,990
and that's what this is over here this
this is a

192
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
this is a
 

193
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,750
this is a
water staircase that would bring the

194
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
water staircase that would bring the
 

195
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,270
water staircase that would bring the
spiders up

196
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
spiders up
 

197
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,750
spiders up
into the ceiling and they would get

198
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
into the ceiling and they would get
 

199
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,630
into the ceiling and they would get
dropped down over here

200
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
dropped down over here
 

201
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,149
dropped down over here
to this gizmo

202
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159

 

203
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,830

and i think it's totally disabled now it

204
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
and i think it's totally disabled now it
 

205
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,390
and i think it's totally disabled now it
seems but this used to crush them and

206
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
seems but this used to crush them and
 

207
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,830
seems but this used to crush them and
or no i wouldn't crush them i think i

208
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
or no i wouldn't crush them i think i
 

209
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,390
or no i wouldn't crush them i think i
would throw damage potions at them

210
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
would throw damage potions at them
 

211
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,470
would throw damage potions at them
or something but they would all gather

212
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
or something but they would all gather
 

213
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,149
or something but they would all gather
to this area here

214
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
to this area here
 

215
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,589
to this area here
at one point i even installed a timer to

216
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
at one point i even installed a timer to
 

217
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,830
at one point i even installed a timer to
keep them from spawning hundreds and

218
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
keep them from spawning hundreds and
 

219
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,270
keep them from spawning hundreds and
hundreds of them

220
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
hundreds of them
 

221
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,429
hundreds of them
uh it's got some random chests around

222
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
uh it's got some random chests around
 

223
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,270
uh it's got some random chests around
here

224
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
here
 

225
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,030
here
then i think the next thing we built was

226
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
then i think the next thing we built was
 

227
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,309
then i think the next thing we built was
probably this

228
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
probably this
 

229
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,589
probably this
this is a mushroom farm i think i called

230
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
this is a mushroom farm i think i called
 

231
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,229
this is a mushroom farm i think i called
it the

232
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
it the
 

233
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,910
it the
mini mushroom farm or something i can't

234
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
mini mushroom farm or something i can't
 

235
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,390
mini mushroom farm or something i can't
remember but there's like a brown

236
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
remember but there's like a brown
 

237
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,229
remember but there's like a brown
mushroom under the stone brick there and

238
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
mushroom under the stone brick there and
 

239
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,310
mushroom under the stone brick there and
a red one under that one and they

240
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
a red one under that one and they
 

241
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,150
a red one under that one and they
it just grows a couple mushrooms every

242
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
it just grows a couple mushrooms every
 

243
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,590
it just grows a couple mushrooms every
time almost useless

244
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
time almost useless
 

245
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,510
time almost useless
this farm here though this is one we've

246
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
this farm here though this is one we've
 

247
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,270
this farm here though this is one we've
used quite a bit

248
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
used quite a bit
 

249
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,150
used quite a bit
every single pumpkin and watermelon in

250
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
every single pumpkin and watermelon in
 

251
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,710
every single pumpkin and watermelon in
our world has come from this farm

252
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
our world has come from this farm
 

253
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,870
our world has come from this farm
and we've got quite a few of them saved

254
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
and we've got quite a few of them saved
 

255
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,870
and we've got quite a few of them saved
up here

256
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
up here
 

257
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,390
up here
because we never use them and

258
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
because we never use them and
 

259
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,990
because we never use them and
i think later we probably built the

260
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
i think later we probably built the
 

261
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,670
i think later we probably built the
slime farm next year so

262
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
slime farm next year so
 

263
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,830
slime farm next year so
we had this design so that the small

264
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
we had this design so that the small
 

265
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,230
we had this design so that the small
ones would land into here

266
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
ones would land into here
 

267
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,070
ones would land into here
medium ones and then the large ones

268
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
medium ones and then the large ones
 

269
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,870
medium ones and then the large ones
there's actually uh

270
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
there's actually uh
 

271
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,230
there's actually uh
a separating mechanic over here

272
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
a separating mechanic over here
 

273
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,870
a separating mechanic over here
uh there was a change at that time

274
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
uh there was a change at that time
 

275
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,830
uh there was a change at that time
because before

276
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
because before
 

277
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,590
because before
slimes used to only spawn below

278
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
slimes used to only spawn below
 

279
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,070
slimes used to only spawn below
y level 16 they then they changed it so

280
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
y level 16 they then they changed it so
 

281
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,430
y level 16 they then they changed it so
that they could spawn up to

282
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
that they could spawn up to
 

283
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,990
that they could spawn up to
y40 so we made this this little farm

284
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
y40 so we made this this little farm
 

285
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,310
y40 so we made this this little farm
and the spawning pad is all the way down

286
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
and the spawning pad is all the way down
 

287
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,150
and the spawning pad is all the way down
here

288
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
here
 

289
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,550
here
just a single chunk at

290
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:25,560
just a single chunk at
 

291
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,430
just a single chunk at
y-39 so right at the level they spawn

292
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
y-39 so right at the level they spawn
 

293
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,430
y-39 so right at the level they spawn
and they fall into the water streams

294
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
and they fall into the water streams
 

295
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,469
and they fall into the water streams
here and they

296
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
here and they
 

297
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,189
here and they
they make their way up uh later here

298
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
they make their way up uh later here
 

299
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,029
they make their way up uh later here
we've added hoppers in that to sort of

00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
we've added hoppers in that to sort of

episode here
anyway let's get out of the slime farm

320
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
anyway let's get out of the slime farm
 

321
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,909
anyway let's get out of the slime farm
we also added a way to pick the slimes

322
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
we also added a way to pick the slimes
 

323
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,230
we also added a way to pick the slimes
up with a minecart to the big slimes

324
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
up with a minecart to the big slimes
 

325
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,590
up with a minecart to the big slimes
over here

326
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
over here
 

327
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,749
over here
but i don't think it's working again

328
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
but i don't think it's working again

they they like step on a

330

they they like step on a
 

331
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,909
they they like step on a
or they fall on a pressure plate and a

332
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
or they fall on a pressure plate and a
 

333
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,510
or they fall on a pressure plate and a
minecart would come out to the corner

334
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520

00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
and then there was a small transition
 

353
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,749
and then there was a small transition

remember them and there's even
more somewhere else in our world which

00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
more somewhere else in our world which
 

375
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,350
more somewhere else in our world which
we'll probably check out

376
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
we'll probably check out
 

377
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,070
we'll probably check out
in just a second uh later

378
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
in just a second uh later
 

379
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,110
in just a second uh later
actually you know one of the first

380
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
actually you know one of the first
 

381
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,870
actually you know one of the first
things we actually we built here was

382
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
things we actually we built here was
 

383
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,550

probably the cow farm as well let's go
down here

386
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
down here
 

387
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,189
down here
so this was one of those square rooms

388
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
so this was one of those square rooms
 

389
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,870
so this was one of those square rooms
you see in abandoned mine shafts i don't

390
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
you see in abandoned mine shafts i don't
 

391
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,629
you see in abandoned mine shafts i don't
know if those still spawn or not

392
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
know if those still spawn or not
 

393
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,909
know if those still spawn or not
i think they do and i just sort of

394
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
i think they do and i just sort of
 

395
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,830
i think they do and i just sort of
hollowed it out and made a

396
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
hollowed it out and made a
 

397
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,070
hollowed it out and made a
cow farm in this area got some pixel art

398
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
cow farm in this area got some pixel art
 

399

big map of our area here and there's

400
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
big map of our area here and there's
 

401
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,589
big map of our area here and there's
also some controls that we don't really

402
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
also some controls that we don't really
 

403
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,870
also some controls that we don't really
use too often anymore

404
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880

 

405
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,029

but i think that releases the water to

406
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
but i think that releases the water to
 

407
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,909
but i think that releases the water to
gather all the

408
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
gather all the
 

409
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,110
gather all the

411
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,950
the drops to the middle this used to be
a wheat farm it was a dual purpose thing

416
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
there was a trick in the game for us a
 

417
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,110
there was a trick in the game for us a
very short period of time

418
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
very short period of time
 

419
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,189
very short period of time
if you put fences underneath tilled soil

420
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
if you put fences underneath tilled soil
 

421
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,710

nothing was able to trample it
 

425
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,070
nothing was able to trample it
but that got fixed eventually

426
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080

 

427
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,110

up here let's see if we can get in there
 

453
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,230
up here let's see if we can get in there
which

454
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
which
 

455
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,269
which
uh i think the ladder is over here yeah

456
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
uh i think the ladder is over here yeah
 

457
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,029
uh i think the ladder is over here yeah
what what we used to be able to do i

458
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
what what we used to be able to do i
 

459
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,269
what what we used to be able to do i
don't think it works anymore

460
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
don't think it works anymore
 

461
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,990
don't think it works anymore
but we got like fishing rods here you go

462
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
but we got like fishing rods here you go
 

463
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,870
but we got like fishing rods here you go
down into the ufo

464
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
down into the ufo
 

465
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,949
down into the ufo
and it was positioned just right so that

466
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
and it was positioned just right so that
 

467
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,550
and it was positioned just right so that
you could fish the cows

468
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560

 

469
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,949

and like pull them up into the water up

470
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
and like pull them up into the water up
 

471
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,150
and like pull them up into the water up
above here

472
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
above here
 

473
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,269
above here
and then they would all get funneled

474
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279
and then they would all get funneled
 

475
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,350
and then they would all get funneled
into an area but it's just a little bit

476
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
into an area but it's just a little bit
 

477
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,829
into an area but it's just a little bit
short

478
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
short
 

479
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,829
short
of uh getting them up here now it seems

480
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
of uh getting them up here now it seems
 

481
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,230
of uh getting them up here now it seems
unfortunately but that was a fun little

482
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
unfortunately but that was a fun little
 

483
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,509
unfortunately but that was a fun little
thing we might try to fix that

484
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
thing we might try to fix that
 

485
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,509
thing we might try to fix that
eventually

486
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
eventually
 

487
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,110
eventually
we've got project pokemon here our

488
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
we've got project pokemon here our
 

489
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,949
we've got project pokemon here our
original goal was to collect one of

490
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
original goal was to collect one of
 

491
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,389
original goal was to collect one of
every type of villager

492
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399

 

493
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,430

original villagers not bred ones but of

494
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
original villagers not bred ones but of
 

495
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,790
original villagers not bred ones but of
course

496
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
course
 

497
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,630
course
villages and villagers have changed

498
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
villages and villagers have changed
 

499
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,230
villages and villagers have changed
since then so we've

500
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
since then so we've
 

501
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,670
since then so we've

nearly fully automated system like we
 

541
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,550
nearly fully automated system like we
could request certain

the nether we might
 

2557
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,430
the nether we might
go back and check those out but let's go

2558
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:11,440
go back and check those out but let's go
 

2559
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,670
go back and check those out but let's go
to the end first

so at the end of the eats road here we

2596
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:03,119
so at the end of the eats road here we
 

2597
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,910
so at the end of the eats road here we
come down into this glass tunnel

2598
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:05,920
come down into this glass tunnel
 

2599
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,030
come down into this glass tunnel
and down the whole way we have a rail

2600
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:09,040
and down the whole way we have a rail
 

2601
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,309
and down the whole way we have a rail
line running too

ender pearls in this

2606
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:13,520
ender pearls in this
 

2607
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,990
ender pearls in this
minecart chest and it would

2608
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:16,000
minecart chest and it would
 

2609
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,349
minecart chest and it would
automatically go back

2610
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:17,359
automatically go back
 

2611
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,309
automatically go back
and drop them off near the portal if you

2612
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:20,319
and drop them off near the portal if you
 

2613
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:20,950
and drop them off near the portal if you
wanted to

2614
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:20,960
wanted to
 

2615
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,750
wanted to
transport them easily but yeah this is

2616
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:23,760
transport them easily but yeah this is
 

2617
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,470
transport them easily but yeah this is
the original ender ender

2618
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:26,480
the original ender ender
 

2619
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,990
the original ender ender
and as you can see it does not stack

2620
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,000
and as you can see it does not stack
 

2621
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,549
and as you can see it does not stack
it's totally flat but they spawn up

2622
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:32,559
it's totally flat but they spawn up
 

2623
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,309
it's totally flat but they spawn up
there and then pistons push them down

2624
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:34,319
there and then pistons push them down
 

2625
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,270
there and then pistons push them down
and

2626
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:35,280
and
 

2627
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,349
and
and they drop down is that

2628
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:39,359
and they drop down is that
 

2629
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,190
and they drop down is that
yeah that is wool up there okay i wasn't

for those yellow blocks but that's

2634
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:44,880
for those yellow blocks but that's
 

2635
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,309
for those yellow blocks but that's
that's yellow wool

2636
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:48,319

 

2637
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,430

spent a lot of time here back when i

2638
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:51,440
spent a lot of time here back when i
 

2639
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,750
spent a lot of time here back when i
built this i didn't even realize like

2640
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:53,760
built this i didn't even realize like
 

2641
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,069
built this i didn't even realize like
this was going to be an xp farm i just

2642
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079
this was going to be an xp farm i just
 

2643
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,670
this was going to be an xp farm i just
wanted ender pearls

2644
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:57,680
wanted ender pearls
 

2645
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,589
wanted ender pearls
and it kind of caught on that hey this

2646
00:52:59,589 --> 00:52:59,599
and it kind of caught on that hey this
 

2647
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,630
and it kind of caught on that hey this
is a really good way of getting xp

2648
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:02,640
is a really good way of getting xp
 

2649
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,750
is a really good way of getting xp
and eventually people figured out how to

2650
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:05,760
and eventually people figured out how to
 

2651
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,230
and eventually people figured out how to
stack the layers and

2652
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:08,240
stack the layers and
 

2653
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,430
stack the layers and
yeah and now today we have even better

2654
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:11,440
yeah and now today we have even better
 

2655
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,069
yeah and now today we have even better
ones that use endermites

2656
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:14,079
ones that use endermites
 

2657
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,870
ones that use endermites
but i did make a second ender farm so

2658
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:16,880
but i did make a second ender farm so
 

2659
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,589
but i did make a second ender farm so
let's go check that out it's out

2660
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:19,599
let's go check that out it's out
 

2661
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,549
let's go check that out it's out
that way you can see the other path over

2662
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:22,559
that way you can see the other path over
 

2663
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,109
that way you can see the other path over
there in the distance

2664
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:25,119
there in the distance
 

2665
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,109
there in the distance
that's the old ender ender out there and

2666
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:27,119
that's the old ender ender out there and
 

2667
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,109
that's the old ender ender out there and
it comes back and then we come down and

2668
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:29,119
it comes back and then we come down and
 

2669
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,390
it comes back and then we come down and
we have this long

2670
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:30,400
we have this long
 

2671
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,670
we have this long
path going off from the island

2672
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:33,680
path going off from the island
 

2673
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,030
path going off from the island
this took a long time to make but

2674
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:37,040
this took a long time to make but
 

2675
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,030
this took a long time to make but
i think it looks pretty cool and then we

2676
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:39,040
i think it looks pretty cool and then we
 

2677
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,390
i think it looks pretty cool and then we
arrive to the ender ender 2.0

2678
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:42,400
arrive to the ender ender 2.0
 

2679
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,710
arrive to the ender ender 2.0
a little bit more sophisticated than the

2680
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:44,720
a little bit more sophisticated than the
 

2681
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,030
a little bit more sophisticated than the
original one over there

2682
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:47,040
original one over there
 

2683
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,990
original one over there

got a little enchanting area here let's
 

2689
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,150
got a little enchanting area here let's
turn them down because you know how that

2690
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:56,160
turn them down because you know how that
 

2691
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,430
turn them down because you know how that
is

2692

up tnt
 

2697
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,390
up tnt

off into these chests
they automatically filter type of clay

2812
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:33,599
they automatically filter type of clay
 

2813
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,470
they automatically filter type of clay
to the one it belongs in and you can

2814
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:36,480
to the one it belongs in and you can
 

2815
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,349
to the one it belongs in and you can
ride it out yourself

2816
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:41,359

 

2817
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:44,470

and then up here up on the surface is

2818
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:44,480
and then up here up on the surface is
 

2819
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,670
and then up here up on the surface is
where the rube goldberg machine is

2820
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:47,680
where the rube goldberg machine is
 

2821
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,750
where the rube goldberg machine is
and there's not a lot to it right now

2822
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:49,760
and there's not a lot to it right now
 

2823
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,789
and there's not a lot to it right now

00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:17,280
nether past that mesa
 

2883
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,349
nether past that mesa
outpost we have the amplified terrain

2884
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:21,359
outpost we have the amplified terrain
 

2885
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,870
outpost we have the amplified terrain
um our amplified base this is a

2886
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:24,880
um our amplified base this is a
 

2887
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,990
um our amplified base this is a
very much work in progress

2888
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:28,000
very much work in progress
 

2889

already i can't remember
 

2907
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,230
already i can't remember

yeah i think the boat launcher is gone
 

2909
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,510

uh but we're
 

2911
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,109
uh but we're
we're basically trying to build a base

2912
00:58:55,109 --> 00:58:55,119
we're basically trying to build a base
 

2913
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,589
we're basically trying to build a base
here and we've done a little bit of work

2914
00:58:57,589 --> 00:58:57,599
here and we've done a little bit of work
 

2915
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,829
here and we've done a little bit of work
on it but there's a lot left to do

on it but there's a lot left to do
 

2917
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,950
on it but there's a lot left to do
there's a chicken farm

00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,960
there's a chicken farm
 

2919
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,750
there's a chicken farm
up there the chickens will automatically

2920
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:05,760
up there the chickens will automatically
 

2921
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,109
up there the chickens will automatically
get shot out and then they

2922
00:59:07,109 --> 00:59:07,119
get shot out and then they
 

2923
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:10,870
get shot out and then they
float down down here and

2924
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:10,880
float down down here and
 

2925
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,349
float down down here and

saplings here they grow and then they
 

2975
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,589
saplings here they grow and then they
automatically get clumped together in a

2976
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:13,599
automatically get clumped together in a
 

2977
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,150
automatically get clumped together in a
a big thing here and the leaves get

2978
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:16,160
a big thing here and the leaves get
 

2979
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,910
a big thing here and the leaves get
crushed so you get the saplings back

2980
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:17,920
crushed so you get the saplings back
 

2981
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,670
crushed so you get the saplings back

from them
 

2983
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,750
from them
uh-huh but that's the amplified base in

2984
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:21,760
uh-huh but that's the amplified base in
 

2985
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,309
uh-huh but that's the amplified base in
a nutshell

2986
01:00:24,309 --> 01:00:24,319
a nutshell
 

2987
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,470
a nutshell
okay so back in the nether now from the

2988
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:26,480

blaze farm
 

3083
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,470
blaze farm
and i think it still works

3084
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:36,480
and i think it still works
 

3085
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,870
and i think it still works
let's see one of my most popular videos

3086
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:40,880
let's see one of my most popular videos
 

3087
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,029
let's see one of my most popular videos
actually is the blaze farm tutorial for

3088
01:02:43,029 --> 01:02:43,039
actually is the blaze farm tutorial for
 

3089
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,069
actually is the blaze farm tutorial for
some reason

3090
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:44,079
some reason
 

3091
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:48,710
some reason
i don't know why

3092
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:48,720
i don't know why
 

3093
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,349
i don't know why
that that seems to work still so i never

3094
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:51,359
that that seems to work still so i never
 

3095
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,990
that that seems to work still so i never
did find a good way of uh

3096
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:54,000
did find a good way of uh
 

3097
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,510
did find a good way of uh
moving them around but i think

3098
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:57,520

 

3099
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,150

this should do the trick still there was

3100
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:00,160
this should do the trick still there was
 

3101
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,230
this should do the trick still there was
uh switches for turning the stuff all on

3102
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:02,240
uh switches for turning the stuff all on
 

3103
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:07,270
uh switches for turning the stuff all on
and off this is working right

3104
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:07,280
and off this is working right
 

3105
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,750
and off this is working right
that turns it off so it puts out enough

3106
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:09,760
that turns it off so it puts out enough
 

3107
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,309
that turns it off so it puts out enough
light that they won't spawn

3108
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:12,319
light that they won't spawn
 

3109
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:16,630
light that they won't spawn
but otherwise i think it does work

3110
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:16,640
but otherwise i think it does work
 

3111
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,870
but otherwise i think it does work
and that conveyor belt system basically

3112
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:18,880
and that conveyor belt system basically
 

3113
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,390
and that conveyor belt system basically
moves them up to the lava

3114
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:20,400
moves them up to the lava
 

3115
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,589
moves them up to the lava
and then they swim up into this

3116
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:23,599
and then they swim up into this
 

3117
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,150
and then they swim up into this
this holding room here and there was a

3118
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:26,160
this holding room here and there was a
 

3119
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,349
this holding room here and there was a
special timer i built

3120
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:29,359
special timer i built
 

3121
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:32,230
special timer i built
which was way more complicated than it

3122
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:32,240
which was way more complicated than it
 

3123
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,829
which was way more complicated than it
needed to be

3124
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:33,839
needed to be
 

3125
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,750
needed to be
nowadays because you just use a hopper

3126
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:35,760
nowadays because you just use a hopper

timer
 

3129
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,829
timer
but this was a pulse extender a very

3130
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:39,839
but this was a pulse extender a very
 

3131
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,150
but this was a pulse extender a very
fancy one

3132
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:42,160
fancy one
 

3133
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,190
fancy one
um that had like no delay it was it was
