I'd like the roof forest a lot
 

15
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:30,620
I'd like the roof forest a lot
especially with all the hills

16
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:30,630
especially with all the hills
 

17
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,190

episode we kinda gave up looking for it

24
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,320
episode we kinda gave up looking for it
 

25
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,880
episode we kinda gave up looking for it
because I explored everything out that

26
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:46,890
because I explored everything out that
 

27
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,680
because I explored everything out that
direction up to the ocean and so I

28
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:51,690
direction up to the ocean and so I
 

29
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,170
direction up to the ocean and so I
decided to go 500 blocks in the nether

30
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:54,180
decided to go 500 blocks in the nether
 

31
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,869
decided to go 500 blocks in the nether
another direction threw down a portal

32
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
another direction threw down a portal
 

33
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,180
another direction threw down a portal
and lucky lucky I came out rates right

34
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,190
and lucky lucky I came out rates right
 

35
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,579
and lucky lucky I came out rates right
into mush right into a roof forced I

36
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:04,589
into mush right into a roof forced I
 

37
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,859
into mush right into a roof forced I
always want to close a mushroom forest

38
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:06,869
always want to close a mushroom forest
 

39
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,870
always want to close a mushroom forest
for some reason but we could has

40
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
for some reason but we could has
 

41
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,240
for some reason but we could has
mushrooms in so yes I got the dark oak

42
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,250
mushrooms in so yes I got the dark oak
 

43
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,570
mushrooms in so yes I got the dark oak
saplings and the wood and and I'm using

44
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:14,580
saplings and the wood and and I'm using
 

45
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,140
saplings and the wood and and I'm using
it and everything is good in the world

46
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,150
it and everything is good in the world
 

47
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,550
it and everything is good in the world
stop moving the camera so fast why is

48
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:19,560
stop moving the camera so fast why is
 

49
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,910
stop moving the camera so fast why is
this I don't think I noticed that before

50
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:22,920
this I don't think I noticed that before
 

51
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,190
this I don't think I noticed that before
I didn't realize water was pouring in my

52
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
I didn't realize water was pouring in my
 

53
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,670
I didn't realize water was pouring in my
portal here so yeah we went 500 blocks

54
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:28,680
portal here so yeah we went 500 blocks
 

55
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,469
portal here so yeah we went 500 blocks
out in the nether got really lucky and

56
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
out in the nether got really lucky and
 

57
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,749
out in the nether got really lucky and
came out right at one of those things so

58
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:32,759
came out right at one of those things so
 

59
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,270
came out right at one of those things so
that was cool we were going to head back

60
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
that was cool we were going to head back
 

61
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,190
that was cool we were going to head back
so I just wanted to show you that I have

62
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
so I just wanted to show you that I have
 

63
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,960
so I just wanted to show you that I have
something else to show you

64
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:38,970
something else to show you
 

65
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,230
something else to show you
with our nether portal network system I

66
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
with our nether portal network system I
 

67
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,719
with our nether portal network system I
have been working on it and it is

68
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:44,729
have been working on it and it is
 

69
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,600
have been working on it and it is
working properly now so let's go check

70
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:47,610
working properly now so let's go check
 

71
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,859
working properly now so let's go check
that out

72
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:50,869

 

73
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:53,960

yes so very good news guys the portal

74
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:53,970
yes so very good news guys the portal
 

75
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,390
yes so very good news guys the portal
network idea looks like it's gonna work

76
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:56,400
network idea looks like it's gonna work
 

77
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,340
network idea looks like it's gonna work
out

78
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:57,350
out
 

79
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,469
out
it's gonna be pretty cool I think one I

80
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
it's gonna be pretty cool I think one I
 

81
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,590
it's gonna be pretty cool I think one I
I get it all done and polished up okay

82
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
I get it all done and polished up okay
 

83
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,630
I get it all done and polished up okay
these guys get life now no they're still

84
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
these guys get life now no they're still
 

85
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,500
these guys get life now no they're still
they're still all the way off all the

86
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:12,510
they're still all the way off all the
 

87
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,320
they're still all the way off all the
way off zip your lips all right if you

88
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,330
way off zip your lips all right if you
 

89
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,350
way off zip your lips all right if you
listened I mean I mean I think I'm in

90
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
listened I mean I mean I think I'm in
 

91
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,970
listened I mean I mean I think I'm in
peaceful mode now because I can't hear

92
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:22,980
peaceful mode now because I can't hear
 

93
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,009
peaceful mode now because I can't hear
them and then I'm just going to get shot

94
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:25,019
them and then I'm just going to get shot
 

95
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,440
them and then I'm just going to get shot
at when I'm over top lab or something on

96
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,450
at when I'm over top lab or something on
 

97
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,930
at when I'm over top lab or something on
some little bridge so don't forget I

98
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:29,940
some little bridge so don't forget I
 

99
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,530
some little bridge so don't forget I
can't forget but yeah this idea it's

100
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:33,540
can't forget but yeah this idea it's
 

101
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,300
can't forget but yeah this idea it's
going to turn out good I think so I got

102
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,310
going to turn out good I think so I got
 

103
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,280
going to turn out good I think so I got
three three portals hooked up to the

104
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,290
three three portals hooked up to the
 

105
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,289
three three portals hooked up to the
network right now and last time we we

106
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:42,299
network right now and last time we we
 

107
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:44,479
network right now and last time we we
checked this out I hit a big snag with

108
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:44,489
checked this out I hit a big snag with
 

109
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,300
checked this out I hit a big snag with
the two-way repeaters see like this

110
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,310
the two-way repeaters see like this
 

111
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,309
the two-way repeaters see like this
right now I feel like there's no gas I

112
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:49,319
right now I feel like there's no gas I
 

113
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,370
right now I feel like there's no gas I
would just be out and open and getting

114
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:52,380
would just be out and open and getting
 

115
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,330
would just be out and open and getting
shot at and yeah all right I don't think

116
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:56,340
shot at and yeah all right I don't think
 

117
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,750
shot at and yeah all right I don't think
they're around but the two a repeater

118
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
they're around but the two a repeater
 

119
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,090
they're around but the two a repeater
was creating instant wire unexpectedly

120
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,100
was creating instant wire unexpectedly
 

121
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,780
was creating instant wire unexpectedly
and I got rid of that design I have

122
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:05,790
and I got rid of that design I have
 

123
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,310
and I got rid of that design I have
replaced all the two-way repeaters with

124
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:07,320
replaced all the two-way repeaters with
 

125
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,380
replaced all the two-way repeaters with
this design this one uses a comparator

126
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:09,390
this design this one uses a comparator
 

127
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,580
this design this one uses a comparator
and repeater and you can see if I send

128
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:13,590
and repeater and you can see if I send
 

129
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,640
and repeater and you can see if I send
power here all the way down there all

130
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:16,650
power here all the way down there all
 

131
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,289
power here all the way down there all
the lights came on so it sends a signal

132
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:18,299
the lights came on so it sends a signal
 

133
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,349
the lights came on so it sends a signal
all the way down that way if I power it

134
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:21,359
all the way down that way if I power it
 

135
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:24,140
all the way down that way if I power it
from here everything this way gets lit

136
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,150
from here everything this way gets lit
 

137
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,770
from here everything this way gets lit
up so it goes both ways no problem I saw

138
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:27,780
up so it goes both ways no problem I saw
 

139
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,509
up so it goes both ways no problem I saw
another good design to that use locking

140
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
another good design to that use locking
 

141
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,890
another good design to that use locking
repeaters but apparently it could get

142
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:33,900
repeaters but apparently it could get
 

143
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,420
repeaters but apparently it could get
stuck like the signal would let it light

144
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:38,430
stuck like the signal would let it light
 

145
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,710
stuck like the signal would let it light
if it got powered from both directions

146
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:39,720
if it got powered from both directions
 

147
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,110
if it got powered from both directions
it could get stuck in a permanent on

148
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,120
it could get stuck in a permanent on
 

149
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,500
it could get stuck in a permanent on
state so this one I tried it out it

150
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:45,510
state so this one I tried it out it
 

151
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,140
state so this one I tried it out it
doesn't do that I think it will be

152
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,150
doesn't do that I think it will be
 

153
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,050
doesn't do that I think it will be
really good now

154
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,060
really good now
 

155
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,970
really good now
we solved that problem there was also

156
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:54,980
we solved that problem there was also
 

157
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,090
we solved that problem there was also
another another big improvement I did

158
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,100
another another big improvement I did
 

159
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,920
another another big improvement I did
here oh well please don't wake up more

160
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:02,930
here oh well please don't wake up more
 

161
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,510
here oh well please don't wake up more
yes I can get out of here

162
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:04,520
yes I can get out of here
 

163
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,240
yes I can get out of here
I got all the Redstone encased in these

164
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,250
I got all the Redstone encased in these
 

165
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,300
I got all the Redstone encased in these
boxes and I was able to get rid of my

166
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,310
boxes and I was able to get rid of my
 

167
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,530
boxes and I was able to get rid of my
redstone for detecting if the signal was

168
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:17,540
redstone for detecting if the signal was
 

169
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,199
redstone for detecting if the signal was
longer than a certain amount I got rid

170
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:20,209
longer than a certain amount I got rid
 

171
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,849
longer than a certain amount I got rid
of like I had two Pistons here and all

172
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:21,859
of like I had two Pistons here and all
 

173
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:23,080
of like I had two Pistons here and all
that I was able to get rid of all that

174
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,090
that I was able to get rid of all that
 

175
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,830
that I was able to get rid of all that
and replace it with a comparator and

176
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
and replace it with a comparator and
 

177
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,090
and replace it with a comparator and
this this was shown to me by let me

178
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,100
this this was shown to me by let me
 

179
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,650
this this was shown to me by let me
check double check his name I want to

180
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:32,660
check double check his name I want to
 

181
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,760
check double check his name I want to
give him credit because this is an

182
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:33,770
give him credit because this is an
 

183
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:39,370
give him credit because this is an
awesome improvement to the circuit here

184
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:39,380

 

185
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,340

his name is Charteris I hope I said that

186
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,350
his name is Charteris I hope I said that
 

187
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,640
his name is Charteris I hope I said that
right

188
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:42,650
right
 

189
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,590
right
so thank you Charteris for showing me

190
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:44,600
so thank you Charteris for showing me
 

191
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,620
so thank you Charteris for showing me
this he took the circuit I had and was

192
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:47,630
this he took the circuit I had and was
 

193
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,840
this he took the circuit I had and was
able to get rid of my pistons and and

194
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:49,850
able to get rid of my pistons and and
 

195
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,150
able to get rid of my pistons and and
just simplified the whole thing by

196
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
just simplified the whole thing by
 

197
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,409
just simplified the whole thing by
replacing the pistons the logic for

198
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:56,419
replacing the pistons the logic for
 

199
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:58,930
replacing the pistons the logic for
detecting if the signal was longer in a

200
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:58,940
detecting if the signal was longer in a
 

201
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,730
detecting if the signal was longer in a
certain amount with just a single

202
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:00,740
certain amount with just a single
 

203
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,659
certain amount with just a single
comparator so it's quite a bit smaller

204
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:04,669
comparator so it's quite a bit smaller
 

205
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,330
comparator so it's quite a bit smaller
no piston noise anymore and I think

206
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:07,340
no piston noise anymore and I think
 

207
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,909
no piston noise anymore and I think
it'll lag a little bit less because if

208
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:09,919
it'll lag a little bit less because if
 

209
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,100
it'll lag a little bit less because if
there's no piston movement and that kind

210
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,110
there's no piston movement and that kind
 

211
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,170
there's no piston movement and that kind
of thing these repeaters they don't do

212
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,180
of thing these repeaters they don't do
 

213
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,020
of thing these repeaters they don't do
anything and this is just to get by the

214
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,030
anything and this is just to get by the
 

215
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,409
anything and this is just to get by the
wire here so it doesn't connect so yeah

216
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:20,419
wire here so it doesn't connect so yeah
 

217
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:21,280
wire here so it doesn't connect so yeah
that is awesome

218
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,290
that is awesome
 

219
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:28,090
that is awesome
thanks again Taurus and I'm come on I'm

220
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,100
thanks again Taurus and I'm come on I'm
 

221
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,210
thanks again Taurus and I'm come on I'm
doing that a lot today down to four

222
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:31,220
doing that a lot today down to four
 

223
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,580
doing that a lot today down to four
anchor pearls oh let's see what I mean

224
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:33,590
anchor pearls oh let's see what I mean
 

225
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,800
anchor pearls oh let's see what I mean
and it was going to happen

226
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:35,810
and it was going to happen
 

227
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:44,920
and it was going to happen
Oh Gigi maybe you know I have a bow I

228
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:44,930
Oh Gigi maybe you know I have a bow I
 

229
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,520
Oh Gigi maybe you know I have a bow I
can fight back what am i doing well if I

230
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:48,530
can fight back what am i doing well if I
 

231
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,600
can fight back what am i doing well if I
I could hit something I could fight back

232
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:51,610
I could hit something I could fight back
 

233
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:58,540
I could hit something I could fight back
wait for it wait for it no so he's

234
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:58,550
wait for it wait for it no so he's
 

235
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,180
wait for it wait for it no so he's
hiding behind that pillar really well

236
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,190

 

237
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,280

man I mean she's pretty good shot

238
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,290
man I mean she's pretty good shot
 

239
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,409
man I mean she's pretty good shot
against guess there's not that day

240
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:08,419
against guess there's not that day
 

241
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:12,370
against guess there's not that day
though all right so all in all the

242
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:12,380
though all right so all in all the
 

243
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,690
though all right so all in all the
circuitry has been improved

244
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:13,700
circuitry has been improved
 

245
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,350
circuitry has been improved
significantly in this oh I don't want to

246
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
significantly in this oh I don't want to
 

247
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,930
significantly in this oh I don't want to
get in through here I guess oh man this

248
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:22,940
get in through here I guess oh man this
 

249
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,710
get in through here I guess oh man this
is a this is quite the challenge not

250
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
is a this is quite the challenge not
 

251
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,760
is a this is quite the challenge not
being able to tear mom's know I missed

252
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:30,770
being able to tear mom's know I missed
 

253
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,980
being able to tear mom's know I missed
oh man that scared me I was minding my

254
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:35,990
oh man that scared me I was minding my
 

255
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,980
oh man that scared me I was minding my
own business and they just just attacked

256
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:38,990
own business and they just just attacked
 

257
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:45,630
own business and they just just attacked
me through here okay right right so

258
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:45,640
me through here okay right right so
 

259
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,710
me through here okay right right so
demonstration time let me show you how

260
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:47,720
demonstration time let me show you how
 

261
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,630
demonstration time let me show you how
to do how this works I'm wasting too

262
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:49,640
to do how this works I'm wasting too
 

263
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,630
to do how this works I'm wasting too
much time in this episode so I just have

264
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:52,640
much time in this episode so I just have
 

265
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,930
much time in this episode so I just have
a cheat sheet over here because I

266
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:55,940
a cheat sheet over here because I
 

267
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,000
a cheat sheet over here because I
couldn't remember what settings to do so

268
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,010
couldn't remember what settings to do so
 

269
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,050
couldn't remember what settings to do so
if I want to go to the strongholds I set

270
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,060
if I want to go to the strongholds I set
 

271
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,520
if I want to go to the strongholds I set
it to ten so four five six seven eight

272
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:06,530
it to ten so four five six seven eight
 

273
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:12,190
it to ten so four five six seven eight
let's add two more and that one goes on

274
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,200
let's add two more and that one goes on
 

275
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,080
let's add two more and that one goes on
that's the stronghold this one here is

276
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,090
that's the stronghold this one here is
 

277
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,350
that's the stronghold this one here is
to the zombie purifier thing so that's

278
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
to the zombie purifier thing so that's
 

279
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,720
to the zombie purifier thing so that's
11 we add one

280
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:21,730

 

281
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,930

like that's and I also have the sandpit

282
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:24,940
like that's and I also have the sandpit
 

283
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,340
like that's and I also have the sandpit
connected right now so that's eight so

284
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,350
connected right now so that's eight so
 

285
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:36,150
connected right now so that's eight so
minus three uh-huh so it's using just as

286
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
minus three uh-huh so it's using just as
 

287
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,030
minus three uh-huh so it's using just as
a recap to how this thing works it's

288
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,040
a recap to how this thing works it's
 

289
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,940
a recap to how this thing works it's
using the length of the redstone pulse

290
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:41,950
using the length of the redstone pulse
 

291
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,080
using the length of the redstone pulse
to determine which portal to turn on so

292
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,090
to determine which portal to turn on so
 

293
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,840
to determine which portal to turn on so
that turned this one on here so now if I

294
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:48,850
that turned this one on here so now if I
 

295
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,670
that turned this one on here so now if I
want to go to the stronghold or to send

296
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:50,680
want to go to the stronghold or to send
 

297
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,690
want to go to the stronghold or to send
things to the stronghold not what was it

298
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:54,700
things to the stronghold not what was it
 

299
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,230
things to the stronghold not what was it
I think it's ten ten right so one two

300
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
I think it's ten ten right so one two
 

301
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,110
I think it's ten ten right so one two
three seven eleven ten that's ten we hit

302
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,120
three seven eleven ten that's ten we hit
 

303
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,750
three seven eleven ten that's ten we hit
this button that turns a stronghold

304
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:06,760
this button that turns a stronghold
 

305
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,020
this button that turns a stronghold
portal on and then we go through like

306
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,030
portal on and then we go through like
 

307
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,380
portal on and then we go through like
this we activate the timer so this will

308
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:13,390
this we activate the timer so this will
 

309
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,290
this we activate the timer so this will
close behind us

310
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:15,300
close behind us
 

311
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,940
close behind us
here the piston activate just as we went

312
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:17,950
here the piston activate just as we went
 

313
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,760
here the piston activate just as we went
through I hope and now anything we send

314
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:20,770
through I hope and now anything we send
 

315
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,320
through I hope and now anything we send
through this portal is going to go to

316
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,330
through this portal is going to go to
 

317
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,870
through this portal is going to go to
that stronghold portal so if I throw

318
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:24,880
that stronghold portal so if I throw
 

319
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,630
that stronghold portal so if I throw
stick sir or send storage of mine carts

320
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:27,640
stick sir or send storage of mine carts

house would go up just a tiny bit which

496
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:01,180
house would go up just a tiny bit which
 

497
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,730
house would go up just a tiny bit which
would bring him back to life and keep

498
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:02,740
would bring him back to life and keep
 

499
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,710
would bring him back to life and keep
the whole thing running so he would keep

500
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
the whole thing running so he would keep
 

501

can definitely kill him when he dies so

506
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:14,470
can definitely kill him when he dies so
 

507
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,130
can definitely kill him when he dies so
this controls if he's alive or not if

508
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:17,140
this controls if he's alive or not if
 

509
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,630
this controls if he's alive or not if
this is empty he's dead

510
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:18,640
this is empty he's dead
 

511
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,800
this is empty he's dead
so that's here let's put some in here

512
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:24,810
so that's here let's put some in here
 

513
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,269
so that's here let's put some in here
when there is stuff in there that power

514
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
when there is stuff in there that power
 

515
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,060
when there is stuff in there that power
is this and makes that piston extend

516
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,070
is this and makes that piston extend
 

517
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,750
is this and makes that piston extend
here when it's empty this retracts and

518
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
here when it's empty this retracts and
 

519
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,329
here when it's empty this retracts and
this is the line of wire that adds to

520
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:36,339
this is the line of wire that adds to
 

521
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:38,670
this is the line of wire that adds to
his health so increases his health and

522

his health so increases his health and
 

523

his health so increases his health and
if that block is not there the signal

524
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,200
if that block is not there the signal
 

525
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,260
if that block is not there the signal
can't pass through so it's just a little

526
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,270
can't pass through so it's just a little
 

527
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,440
can't pass through so it's just a little
safety net to make sure he doesn't

that was weird let's see if we can hook
 

825
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,520
that was weird let's see if we can hook
one up here maybe nope we need a lot of

826
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:31,530
one up here maybe nope we need a lot of
 

827
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:36,380
one up here maybe nope we need a lot of
height I think that's going to work if

828
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:36,390
height I think that's going to work if
 

829
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:42,860
height I think that's going to work if
we can pull it up from from here oh that

830
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:42,870
we can pull it up from from here oh that
 

831
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,880
we can pull it up from from here oh that
was close that was really close

832
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:45,890
was close that was really close
 

833
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:55,370
was close that was really close
where did you land oh that's gonna be

834
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:55,380
where did you land oh that's gonna be
 

835
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,110
where did you land oh that's gonna be
really tough if we we do this with our

836
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,120
really tough if we we do this with our
 

837
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:06,460
really tough if we we do this with our
hook no need more height is the thing

838
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:06,470
hook no need more height is the thing
 

839
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,260
hook no need more height is the thing
maybe this will work now

the fishing hook so it's the wrong
height and when I pull them they don't

height and when I pull them they don't
 

893
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,610
height and when I pull them they don't
reach all the way up so the fact I

894
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:03,620
reach all the way up so the fact I

go down there cooperate this is not
going to work out too well

904
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:27,940

 

905
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,490

cows are really big so that usually

906
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:30,500
cows are really big so that usually
 

907
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,430
cows are really big so that usually
they'll just go over the whole like

908
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:33,440
they'll just go over the whole like
 

909
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,940
they'll just go over the whole like
they're really fat you're really fat you

910
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:36,950

915
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,780
pushed it too far no no don't move don't
move so the easier way of doing this I

916
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:49,790
move so the easier way of doing this I
 

917
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,930
move so the easier way of doing this I
guess would be like this probably a lot

918

so she's activating this redstone here

948
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:53,879
so she's activating this redstone here
 

949
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:58,549
so she's activating this redstone here
constantly she's looking for an area

950
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:58,559
constantly she's looking for an area
 

951
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,339
constantly she's looking for an area
outside of here to walk and when she

952
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:00,349
outside of here to walk and when she
 

953
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:03,609
outside of here to walk and when she
tries to move she gets pushed right back

954
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:03,619
tries to move she gets pushed right back
 

955
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:06,139
tries to move she gets pushed right back
but there is times also where she just

956
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:06,149
but there is times also where she just
 

957
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:12,499
but there is times also where she just
stands still like this so it might take

958
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:12,509
stands still like this so it might take
 

959
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:15,739
stands still like this so it might take
a while to detect the flare when I'm up

960
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:15,749
a while to detect the flare when I'm up
 

961
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:19,009
a while to detect the flare when I'm up
there but I don't think she'll be able

962
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:19,019
there but I don't think she'll be able
 

963
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:20,739
there but I don't think she'll be able
to get out of there

964
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:20,749
to get out of there
 

965
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:26,149
to get out of there

967
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,539

hook this wire up to a timer so that if

968
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:29,549
hook this wire up to a timer so that if
 

969
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:31,759
hook this wire up to a timer so that if
it's not pressed like in 30 seconds or a

970
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:31,769
it's not pressed like in 30 seconds or a
 

971
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:39,080
it's not pressed like in 30 seconds or a
minute it considers me gone otherwise if

972
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,090
minute it considers me gone otherwise if
 

973
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,139
minute it considers me gone otherwise if
it's been pressed within a minute it's

974
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:42,149
it's been pressed within a minute it's
 

975
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:44,330
it's been pressed within a minute it's
going to think that I'm up by Wilson

976
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:44,340
going to think that I'm up by Wilson

here is the way I'm going to rig it

978
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:46,639
here is the way I'm going to rig it
 

979
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,830
here is the way I'm going to rig it
somehow so we've got to run the wire up

980
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:48,840
somehow so we've got to run the wire up
 

981
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,089
somehow so we've got to run the wire up
here and then figure out ways to use it

982
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:53,099
here and then figure out ways to use it
 

983
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:59,440
here and then figure out ways to use it
in a cool cool awesome fashion I guess

984
00:26:59,440 --> 00:26:59,450

 

985
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,080

but anyway I guess that's going to be it

986
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,090
but anyway I guess that's going to be it
 

987
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,359
but anyway I guess that's going to be it
