I just added some trapdoors here so that

110
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:33,530
I just added some trapdoors here so that
 

111
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,820
I just added some trapdoors here so that
hopefully when we walk along here I was

112
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:36,830
hopefully when we walk along here I was
 

113
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,260
hopefully when we walk along here I was
having issues with a couple random

114

I'm hoping this will make it a bit more

118
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,290
I'm hoping this will make it a bit more
 

119
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,480
I'm hoping this will make it a bit more
uniform and so far it's looking really

120
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:46,490
uniform and so far it's looking really
 

121
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:52,300
uniform and so far it's looking really
good actually let's take a gander down

122

here once we get to the end yeah that's

124
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:54,980
here once we get to the end yeah that's
 

125
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,830
here once we get to the end yeah that's
way more consistent now is these trap

126
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:56,840
way more consistent now is these trap
 

127
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,150
way more consistent now is these trap
doors because they bring us forward a

128
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,160
doors because they bring us forward a
 

129
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,470
doors because they bring us forward a
little bits and I can just like light

130
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
little bits and I can just like light
 

131
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,600
little bits and I can just like light
along them too as we go here I don't

132
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:04,610
along them too as we go here I don't
 

133
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,070
along them too as we go here I don't
have to worry about my positioning deal

134
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
have to worry about my positioning deal
 

135
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,540
have to worry about my positioning deal
being a little bit too forward or a

136
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:07,550
being a little bit too forward or a
 

137
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,940
being a little bit too forward or a
little bit too back now

138
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:08,950
little bit too back now
 

139
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:15,370
little bit too back now
so that's all good all right we've got

140
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:15,380
so that's all good all right we've got
 

141
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,170
so that's all good all right we've got
all the middle stalks chopped down so

142
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,180
all the middle stalks chopped down so
 

143
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,030
all the middle stalks chopped down so
now we run over here we we finished the

144
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
now we run over here we we finished the
 

145
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,650
now we run over here we we finished the
harvest process and we just have to hit

146
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:20,660
harvest process and we just have to hit
 

147
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,449
harvest process and we just have to hit
that button to collect all the drops

148

that button to collect all the drops
 

149
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,740
that button to collect all the drops
together so that does two things it

150
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:26,750
together so that does two things it
 

151
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,130
together so that does two things it
ejects the water which also retracts it

152
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:30,140
ejects the water which also retracts it
 

153
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,320
ejects the water which also retracts it
after a certain amount of time and then

154
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,330
after a certain amount of time and then
 

155
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,170
after a certain amount of time and then
it also dispatches the minecarts to pick

156
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,180
it also dispatches the minecarts to pick
 

157
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,470
it also dispatches the minecarts to pick
up the drops you hear him go down you

158
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
up the drops you hear him go down you
 

159
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,380
up the drops you hear him go down you

that was interesting kind of a mistake
but now I know what kind of damage did

332
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
but now I know what kind of damage did
 

333
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,689
but now I know what kind of damage did
he do here I got to tear this thing down

334

but they the old ether out here I don't
want to repair seems fine seems okay

340
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:28,680
want to repair seems fine seems okay
 

341
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,259
want to repair seems fine seems okay
yeah cuz we we took this and rebuilt it

342
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:31,269
yeah cuz we we took this and rebuilt it
 

343
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:36,239
yeah cuz we we took this and rebuilt it
there the Enderman farm anyway you

344
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:36,249
there the Enderman farm anyway you
 

345
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:39,869
there the Enderman farm anyway you
really did any damage this is double

346
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:39,879
really did any damage this is double
 

347
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:48,600
really did any damage this is double
check down here Q looks okay yeah I

348
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:48,610
check down here Q looks okay yeah I
 

349
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,129
check down here Q looks okay yeah I
don't see any damage on that bridge

350
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:50,139
don't see any damage on that bridge
 

351
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:51,679
don't see any damage on that bridge
either so I think we're good

352
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:51,689
either so I think we're good
 

353
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:54,480
either so I think we're good
you know what I thought fighting the

354
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:54,490
you know what I thought fighting the
 

355
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,679
you know what I thought fighting the
wither in the end there was gonna be

356
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:55,689
wither in the end there was gonna be
 

357
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:57,989
wither in the end there was gonna be
really tough but I think it's actually

358
00:09:57,989 --> 00:09:57,999
really tough but I think it's actually
 

359
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:01,079
really tough but I think it's actually
easier to fight the wither in the end

360
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:01,089
easier to fight the wither in the end
 

361
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:03,629
easier to fight the wither in the end
than the overworld like I thought I was

362
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:03,639
than the overworld like I thought I was
 

363
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,860
than the overworld like I thought I was
gonna look at all the Enderman and then

364
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:04,870
gonna look at all the Enderman and then
 

365
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,389
gonna look at all the Enderman and then
they were gonna kill me well while the

366
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
they were gonna kill me well while the
 

367
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,030
they were gonna kill me well while the
way there also kills me but they seem to

368
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
way there also kills me but they seem to
 

369
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,499
way there also kills me but they seem to
go after the wither more than anything

370
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:10,509
go after the wither more than anything
 

371
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,710
go after the wither more than anything
and the wither easily got distracted

372
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:13,720
and the wither easily got distracted
 

373
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,410
and the wither easily got distracted
with them and stopped attacking me and

374
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:16,420
with them and stopped attacking me and
 

375
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,470
with them and stopped attacking me and
plus like in stone has high blast

376
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:19,480
plus like in stone has high blast
 

377
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,990
plus like in stone has high blast
resistance so normally get stuck in

378
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,000
resistance so normally get stuck in
 

379
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,730
resistance so normally get stuck in
holes while fighting the wither and then

380
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:23,740
holes while fighting the wither and then
 

381
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,220
holes while fighting the wither and then
that's what kills you but anyways guys

382
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,230
that's what kills you but anyways guys
 

383
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,610
that's what kills you but anyways guys
I'm pretty excited about today you know

384
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:29,620
I'm pretty excited about today you know
 

385
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,960
I'm pretty excited about today you know

386
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:30,970
what's special about today it's my
 

387
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,290
what's special about today it's my
favorite day its new project day that's

388
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:34,300
favorite day its new project day that's
 

389
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:34,920
favorite day its new project day that's
right

390
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:34,930
right
 

391
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,689
right
so by the way with his ice farm you guys

392
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:39,699
so by the way with his ice farm you guys
 

393
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:41,490
so by the way with his ice farm you guys
said if I real aughh it will fix the

394
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:41,500
said if I real aughh it will fix the
 

395
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,160
said if I real aughh it will fix the
invisible minecart glitch and yeah that

396
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,170
invisible minecart glitch and yeah that
 

397
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:44,639
invisible minecart glitch and yeah that
works

398
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:44,649
works
 

399
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,790
works
came back to it it was fine but I was

400
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:47,800
came back to it it was fine but I was
 

401
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,710
came back to it it was fine but I was
thinking about it there's an item in the

402
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:49,720
thinking about it there's an item in the
 

403
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,439
thinking about it there's an item in the
game now where you cannot possibly farm

404
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:52,449
game now where you cannot possibly farm
 

405
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:53,730
game now where you cannot possibly farm
enough of it I don't think and that's

406
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:53,740
enough of it I don't think and that's
 

407
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,350
enough of it I don't think and that's
ice like this farm takes a couple hours

408
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:58,360
ice like this farm takes a couple hours
 

409
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,780
ice like this farm takes a couple hours
to fill up I think to get the 10 by 10

410
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:00,790
to fill up I think to get the 10 by 10
 

411
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,110
to fill up I think to get the 10 by 10
by 10 cube 1000 nice blocks you know I'm

412
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:04,120
by 10 cube 1000 nice blocks you know I'm
 

413
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,150
by 10 cube 1000 nice blocks you know I'm
a blue ice you'll get from that when

414
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
a blue ice you'll get from that when
 

415
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,869
a blue ice you'll get from that when
this is fully filled up twelve twelve

416
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:09,879
this is fully filled up twelve twelve
 

417
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,629
this is fully filled up twelve twelve
blue ice blocks because it's 81 regular

418
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:12,639
blue ice blocks because it's 81 regular
 

419
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,580
blue ice blocks because it's 81 regular
ice each one

420
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:14,590
ice each one
 

421
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,870
ice each one
so our agenda is to build a new massive

422
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880
so our agenda is to build a new massive
 

423
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,790
so our agenda is to build a new massive
scale ice farm that's what I want to do

424
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800
scale ice farm that's what I want to do
 

425
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,660
scale ice farm that's what I want to do
so I'm trying to think of like how to do

426
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:24,670
so I'm trying to think of like how to do
 

427
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,110
so I'm trying to think of like how to do
it right now maybe we'll talk about some

428
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,120
it right now maybe we'll talk about some
 

429
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,390
it right now maybe we'll talk about some
some design aspects and making a nice

430
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:30,400
some design aspects and making a nice
 

431
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,470
some design aspects and making a nice
farm because I think it's a pretty

432
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:31,480
farm because I think it's a pretty
 

433
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,680
farm because I think it's a pretty
interesting thing actually so let's talk

434
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:34,690
interesting thing actually so let's talk
 

435
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,690
interesting thing actually so let's talk
about this I want to build the best

436
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:36,700
about this I want to build the best
 

437
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,510
about this I want to build the best
possible ice farm right well how do you

438
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:39,520
possible ice farm right well how do you
 

439
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,380
possible ice farm right well how do you
define best I think in Minecraft when it

440
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:43,390
define best I think in Minecraft when it
 

441
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,300
define best I think in Minecraft when it
comes to building farms there is no best

442
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,310
comes to building farms there is no best
 

443
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,350
comes to building farms there is no best
really I think that's a subjective term

444
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:48,360
really I think that's a subjective term
 

445
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,269
really I think that's a subjective term
it comes down to maybe five main

446
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
it comes down to maybe five main
 

447
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,610
it comes down to maybe five main
categories and then you pick aspects of

448
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:53,620
categories and then you pick aspects of
 

449
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,490
categories and then you pick aspects of
those categories you're looking for and

450
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:56,500
those categories you're looking for and
 

451
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,170
those categories you're looking for and
those are the size of the farm

452
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:58,180
those are the size of the farm
 

453
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,840
those are the size of the farm
how difficult is it to build how

454
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:00,850
how difficult is it to build how
 

455
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,460
how difficult is it to build how
efficient is it in terms of production

456
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:02,470
efficient is it in terms of production
 

457
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,530
efficient is it in terms of production
how efficient is that in terms of

458
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:04,540
how efficient is that in terms of
 

459
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,079
how efficient is that in terms of
harvest and use those two are kind of

460
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:07,089
harvest and use those two are kind of
 

461
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:08,579
harvest and use those two are kind of
related to each other so maybe just

462
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:08,589
related to each other so maybe just
 

463
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,140
related to each other so maybe just
efficiencies that category

464
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,150
efficiencies that category
 

465
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,180
efficiencies that category
it gets broken down and then there's

466
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,190
it gets broken down and then there's
 

467
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,280
it gets broken down and then there's
that creative aspect of a farm as well

468
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,290
that creative aspect of a farm as well
 

469
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,170
that creative aspect of a farm as well
so sighs let's let's give this as an

470
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:19,180
so sighs let's let's give this as an
 

471
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,390
so sighs let's let's give this as an
example I have a five by five by five

472
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:21,400
example I have a five by five by five
 

473
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,329
example I have a five by five by five
farm that produces a hundred items and I

474
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:24,339
farm that produces a hundred items and I
 

475
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:25,860
farm that produces a hundred items and I
got a four by four by four farm that

476
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:25,870
got a four by four by four farm that
 

477
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,010
got a four by four by four farm that
produces only one which of those farms

478
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,020
produces only one which of those farms
 

479
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,400
produces only one which of those farms
is the best well if you only have a four

480
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,410
is the best well if you only have a four
 

481
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,260
is the best well if you only have a four
by four by four space available it's the

482
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:34,270
by four by four space available it's the
 

483
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,050
by four by four space available it's the
one that only makes one because you

484
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:37,060
one that only makes one because you
 

485
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,510
one that only makes one because you
can't use the other one right so that's

486
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:39,520
can't use the other one right so that's
 

487
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,000
can't use the other one right so that's
that's how you got to think about it so

488
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,010
that's how you got to think about it so
 

489
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,700
that's how you got to think about it so
in terms of size with ice farms doesn't

490
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:44,710
in terms of size with ice farms doesn't
 

491
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,260
in terms of size with ice farms doesn't
really matter because you can freeze

492
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,270
really matter because you can freeze
 

493
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,440
really matter because you can freeze
water in a one by one just a single

494
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,450
water in a one by one just a single
 

495
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,360
water in a one by one just a single
block space right so it's just how much

496
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,370
block space right so it's just how much
 

497
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,480
block space right so it's just how much
do you want to scale the ice farm in

498
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:54,490
do you want to scale the ice farm in
 

499
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,290
do you want to scale the ice farm in
terms of difficulty to builds let's look

500
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:58,300
terms of difficulty to builds let's look
 

501
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,470
terms of difficulty to builds let's look
at this farm for example lots of bist

502
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:01,480
at this farm for example lots of bist
 

503
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,720
at this farm for example lots of bist
ins right it's expensive there's lots of

504
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:03,730
ins right it's expensive there's lots of
 

505
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,590
ins right it's expensive there's lots of
rails so in terms of cost it's not very

506
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
rails so in terms of cost it's not very
 

507
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,540
rails so in terms of cost it's not very
good in terms of like intricate design

508
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:09,550
good in terms of like intricate design
 

509
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,860
good in terms of like intricate design
does it take a long time to put together

510
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:10,870
does it take a long time to put together
 

511
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,960
does it take a long time to put together
I would say so

512
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:12,970
I would say so
 

513
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,960
I would say so
so this farm kind of isn't very good in

514
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:15,970
so this farm kind of isn't very good in
 

515
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,290
so this farm kind of isn't very good in
terms of building rights efficiency of

516
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:19,300
terms of building rights efficiency of
 

517
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,960
terms of building rights efficiency of
production let's analyze that we have

518
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:21,970
production let's analyze that we have
 

519
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,810
production let's analyze that we have
only 20 water spaces where that the ice

520
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:24,820
only 20 water spaces where that the ice
 

521
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,120
only 20 water spaces where that the ice
can actually be produced and then they

522
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,130
can actually be produced and then they
 

523
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,020
can actually be produced and then they
get pushed over and

524
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,030
get pushed over and
 

525
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:32,340
get pushed over and
up in like a 14 by 10 area so we're not

526
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:32,350
up in like a 14 by 10 area so we're not
 

527
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,280
up in like a 14 by 10 area so we're not
making good use of the space which

528
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,290
making good use of the space which
 

529
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,630
making good use of the space which
matters a lot when you're trying to

530
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:36,640
matters a lot when you're trying to
 

531
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,980
matters a lot when you're trying to
produce a lot of ice there's only a

532
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:37,990
produce a lot of ice there's only a
 

533
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,080
produce a lot of ice there's only a
certain amount of space around you where

534
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,090
certain amount of space around you where
 

535
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,560
certain amount of space around you where
the ice will freeze so how much does

536
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:43,570
the ice will freeze so how much does
 

537
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,680
the ice will freeze so how much does
that matter I'm not sure yet but this

538
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:46,690
that matter I'm not sure yet but this
 

539
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,780
that matter I'm not sure yet but this
farm is not very good in that terms in

540
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:48,790
farm is not very good in that terms in
 

541
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,020
farm is not very good in that terms in
those terms also when the ice is

542
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,030
those terms also when the ice is
 

543
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,080
those terms also when the ice is
produced it doesn't instantly get pushed

544
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,090
produced it doesn't instantly get pushed
 

545
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,100
produced it doesn't instantly get pushed
over you see that

546
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,110
over you see that
 

547
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,710
over you see that
so that spot right there is not being

548
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:58,720
so that spot right there is not being
 

549
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,920
so that spot right there is not being
used once the ice is made until it gets

550
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:01,930
used once the ice is made until it gets
 

551
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,710
used once the ice is made until it gets
moved to side right so it's not good in

552
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
moved to side right so it's not good in
 

553
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,450
moved to side right so it's not good in
that way either in terms of efficiency

554
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:09,460
that way either in terms of efficiency
 

555
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,510
that way either in terms of efficiency
of harvest or use it doesn't have any

556
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:12,520
of harvest or use it doesn't have any
 

557
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,220
of harvest or use it doesn't have any
auto collection systems like it doesn't

558
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,230
auto collection systems like it doesn't
 

559
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,610
auto collection systems like it doesn't
bunch the ice into chests and and that

560
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:17,620
bunch the ice into chests and and that
 

561
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,020
bunch the ice into chests and and that
you have to pick all the ice up manually

562
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,030
you have to pick all the ice up manually
 

563
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,750
you have to pick all the ice up manually
but it is really quick to harvest

564
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,760
but it is really quick to harvest
 

565
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,460
but it is really quick to harvest
because all the ice gets pushed into a

566
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,470
because all the ice gets pushed into a
 

567
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,820
because all the ice gets pushed into a
bit cube so you don't have to like run

568
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:26,830
bit cube so you don't have to like run
 

569
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,020
bit cube so you don't have to like run
around harvesting ice it's all in one

570
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,030
around harvesting ice it's all in one
 

571
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,360
around harvesting ice it's all in one
place all condensed right so it's really

572
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,370
place all condensed right so it's really
 

573
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,980
place all condensed right so it's really
that's where this farm really shines

574
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:34,990
that's where this farm really shines
 

575
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,550
that's where this farm really shines
that's it's its key aspect and then

576
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,560
that's it's its key aspect and then
 

577
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,800
that's it's its key aspect and then
creativity you know you might want a

578
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:40,810
creativity you know you might want a
 

579
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,420
creativity you know you might want a
really efficient farm but you might want

580
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:42,430
really efficient farm but you might want
 

581
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,790
really efficient farm but you might want
a farm where your farming slimes and

582
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
a farm where your farming slimes and
 

583
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,530
a farm where your farming slimes and
you're making them fall out of a nose so

584
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:46,540
you're making them fall out of a nose so
 

585
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,930
you're making them fall out of a nose so
it looks like they're boogers there's

586
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:48,940
it looks like they're boogers there's
 

587
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,760
it looks like they're boogers there's
there's things like that to consider as

588
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:50,770
there's things like that to consider as
 

589
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,550
there's things like that to consider as
well when making a firm right yeah so

590
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:53,560
well when making a firm right yeah so
 

591
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,230
well when making a firm right yeah so
with all of that in mind guys what is

592
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:55,240
with all of that in mind guys what is
 

593
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,420
with all of that in mind guys what is
going to be the best possible farm for

594
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:57,430
going to be the best possible farm for
 

595
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,850
going to be the best possible farm for
us what are we gonna design around well

596
00:14:59,850 --> 00:14:59,860
us what are we gonna design around well
 

597
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,130
us what are we gonna design around well
we want efficiency of production and

598
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:02,140
we want efficiency of production and
 

599
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,580
we want efficiency of production and
harvest we want to basically produce as

600
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:05,590
harvest we want to basically produce as
 

601
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,230
harvest we want to basically produce as
much ice as possible with the least

602
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,240
much ice as possible with the least
 

603
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,820
much ice as possible with the least
amount of effort that's our goal and

604
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:08,830
amount of effort that's our goal and
 

605
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,220
amount of effort that's our goal and
anything like the size of the firm and

606
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,230
anything like the size of the firm and
 

607
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,890
anything like the size of the firm and
how difficult is it to build any

608
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:13,900
how difficult is it to build any
 

609
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,600
how difficult is it to build any
creative aspects of it are gonna come

610
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:15,610
creative aspects of it are gonna come
 

611
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,530
creative aspects of it are gonna come
second place

612
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:16,540
second place
 

613
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,830
second place
we just want a lot of ice okay so I

614
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:19,840
we just want a lot of ice okay so I
 

615
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,880
we just want a lot of ice okay so I
thought we would look at the original

616
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:20,890
thought we would look at the original
 

617
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,850
thought we would look at the original
ice farm here as well the ice tray as a

618
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:23,860
ice farm here as well the ice tray as a
 

619
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,300
ice farm here as well the ice tray as a
good example for us what do we need to

620
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,310
good example for us what do we need to
 

621
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,130
good example for us what do we need to
actually make ice we need that cold

622
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:29,140
actually make ice we need that cold
 

623
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,160
actually make ice we need that cold
biome this biome got switched to taiga

624
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,170
biome this biome got switched to taiga
 

625
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,420
biome this biome got switched to taiga
so this farm doesn't work anymore

626
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:33,430
so this farm doesn't work anymore
 

627
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,880
so this farm doesn't work anymore
actually so we need to find a cold biome

628
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:35,890
actually so we need to find a cold biome
 

629
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,180
actually so we need to find a cold biome
and then you need water with access to

630
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,190
and then you need water with access to
 

631
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:39,900
and then you need water with access to
the sky

632
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:39,910
the sky
 

633
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,730
the sky
you can't stack the water

634
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:41,740
you can't stack the water
 

635
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,010
you can't stack the water
on top of each other vertically and if

636
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,020
on top of each other vertically and if
 

637
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,600
on top of each other vertically and if
you have like any blocks above the water

638
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:45,610
you have like any blocks above the water
 

639
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,380
you have like any blocks above the water
then it won't freeze so you need you

640
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:49,390
then it won't freeze so you need you
 

641
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,000
then it won't freeze so you need you
need to spread out horizontally pretty

642
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,010
need to spread out horizontally pretty
 

643
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,940
need to spread out horizontally pretty
much in order to make the firm bigger

644
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:52,950
much in order to make the firm bigger
 

645
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:57,890
much in order to make the firm bigger
and then you also need a seed block so

646
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:57,900
and then you also need a seed block so
 

647
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,720
and then you also need a seed block so
if you have just a big open water source

648
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:00,730
if you have just a big open water source
 

649
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,670
if you have just a big open water source
like this the ice isn't gonna start

650
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:02,680
like this the ice isn't gonna start
 

651
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,740
like this the ice isn't gonna start
forming in the middle at all it'll start

652
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:04,750
forming in the middle at all it'll start
 

653
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,210
forming in the middle at all it'll start
at the edges and then go towards the

654
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:06,220
at the edges and then go towards the
 

655
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,010
at the edges and then go towards the
middle because you have to have water

656
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:11,020
middle because you have to have water
 

657
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,920
middle because you have to have water
with at least one non water block next

658
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:13,930
with at least one non water block next
 

659
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,050
with at least one non water block next
to it so if there's ice or something

660
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:16,060
to it so if there's ice or something
 

661
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,970
to it so if there's ice or something
else next to this water block here then

662
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:17,980
else next to this water block here then
 

663
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,300
else next to this water block here then
it'll freeze but if and horizontally I

664
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,310
it'll freeze but if and horizontally I
 

665
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,180
it'll freeze but if and horizontally I
mean so if you're standing here this

666
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:24,190
mean so if you're standing here this
 

667
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,610
mean so if you're standing here this
water block has water here here here and

668
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:26,620
water block has water here here here and
 

669
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,950
water block has water here here here and
here so it can't freeze but if you're

670
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:28,960
here so it can't freeze but if you're
 

671
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,010
here so it can't freeze but if you're
standing here water water nope nope no

672
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:32,020
standing here water water nope nope no
 

673
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,600
standing here water water nope nope no
good but we have a dispenser here so

674
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:33,610
good but we have a dispenser here so
 

675
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,570
good but we have a dispenser here so
this will freeze all right those are

676
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:36,580
this will freeze all right those are
 

677
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,130
this will freeze all right those are
kind of the criteria we got to think

678
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,140
kind of the criteria we got to think
 

679
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,440
kind of the criteria we got to think
about so this pattern here that I did

680
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:40,450
about so this pattern here that I did
 

681
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,660
about so this pattern here that I did
with this original farm is actually the

682
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:42,670
with this original farm is actually the
 

683
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,840
with this original farm is actually the
most efficient in terms of like every

684
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:45,850
most efficient in terms of like every
 

685
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,480
most efficient in terms of like every
water block has at least one non water

686
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:48,490
water block has at least one non water
 

687
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,750
water block has at least one non water
block next to it so all these waters can

688
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:51,760
block next to it so all these waters can
 

689
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,420
block next to it so all these waters can
freeze at the same time they don't have

690
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:54,430
freeze at the same time they don't have
 

691
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,950
freeze at the same time they don't have
to wait for the ice to spread at all

692
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:55,960
to wait for the ice to spread at all
 

693
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,020
to wait for the ice to spread at all
alright everybody so now that we got

694
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,030
alright everybody so now that we got
 

695
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,790
alright everybody so now that we got
that all covered let's start designing

696
00:16:59,790 --> 00:16:59,800
that all covered let's start designing
 

697
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,190
that all covered let's start designing
our ice farm here how are we gonna put

698
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:02,200
our ice farm here how are we gonna put
 

699
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,190
our ice farm here how are we gonna put
it together one thing I realized is I

700
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,200
it together one thing I realized is I
 

701
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,320
it together one thing I realized is I
don't think we can have both perfect ice

702
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,330
don't think we can have both perfect ice
 

703
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,960
don't think we can have both perfect ice
production and and harvest speed I think

704
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:09,970
production and and harvest speed I think
 

705
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,610
production and and harvest speed I think
we gotta choose which one we would

706
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:11,620
we gotta choose which one we would
 

707
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,520
we gotta choose which one we would
prefer cuz perfect ice production is

708
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:14,530
prefer cuz perfect ice production is
 

709
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,080
prefer cuz perfect ice production is
that pattern we saw at the ice tray

710
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,090
that pattern we saw at the ice tray
 

711
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,000
that pattern we saw at the ice tray
there with the cedar blocks mixed in and

712
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,010
there with the cedar blocks mixed in and
 

713
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,090
there with the cedar blocks mixed in and
that kind of spiral pattern while if

714
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:21,100
that kind of spiral pattern while if
 

715
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,430
that kind of spiral pattern while if
we're going for perfect harvests speeds

716
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:23,440
we're going for perfect harvests speeds
 

717
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,650
we're going for perfect harvests speeds
we want like a solid sheet of ice here

718
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:25,660
we want like a solid sheet of ice here
 

719
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,190
we want like a solid sheet of ice here
with no other blocks mixed in we just

720
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
with no other blocks mixed in we just
 

721
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,260
with no other blocks mixed in we just
want solid ice rights and I think we're

722
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:31,270
want solid ice rights and I think we're
 

723
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,690
want solid ice rights and I think we're
gonna want it at at eye level here one

724
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:33,700
gonna want it at at eye level here one
 

725
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,730
gonna want it at at eye level here one
issue I had with the ice farm always if

726
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:35,740
issue I had with the ice farm always if
 

727
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,780
issue I had with the ice farm always if
it is if it's one block lower you got to

728
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:39,790
it is if it's one block lower you got to
 

729
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,390
it is if it's one block lower you got to
tilt the camera down and then you like

730
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
tilt the camera down and then you like
 

731
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,890
tilt the camera down and then you like
constantly have to swing the camera

732
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:43,900
constantly have to swing the camera
 

733
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,150
constantly have to swing the camera
around to like get the blocks right it's

734
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,160
around to like get the blocks right it's
 

735
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,220
around to like get the blocks right it's
it's a bit annoying so we want it at eye

736
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,230
it's a bit annoying so we want it at eye
 

737
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,250
it's a bit annoying so we want it at eye
level so we can just move that move left

738
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:53,260
level so we can just move that move left
 

739
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,090
level so we can just move that move left
and right and not worry about the

740
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:55,100
and right and not worry about the
 

741
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,520
and right and not worry about the
the camera position as we're harvesting

742
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:56,530
the camera position as we're harvesting
 

743
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:01,600
the camera position as we're harvesting
right so let's do let's do a little test

744
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:01,610
right so let's do let's do a little test
 

745
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,070
right so let's do let's do a little test
here how far can we actually reach

746
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,080
here how far can we actually reach
 

747
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,750
here how far can we actually reach
because I think we're gonna go for

748
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:04,760
because I think we're gonna go for
 

749
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,289
because I think we're gonna go for
perfect harvest speeds how far can we

750
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:08,299
perfect harvest speeds how far can we
 

751
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:11,620
perfect harvest speeds how far can we
reach here so it's four blocks one two

752
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:11,630
reach here so it's four blocks one two
 

753
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,840
reach here so it's four blocks one two
three four yeah I think yeah if we're

754
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:13,850
three four yeah I think yeah if we're
 

755
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,520
three four yeah I think yeah if we're
aligned to the front here the very

756
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:15,530
aligned to the front here the very
 

757
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,770
aligned to the front here the very
fronts we can reach one extra so we

758
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:17,780
fronts we can reach one extra so we
 

759
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,850
fronts we can reach one extra so we
might want to try get all five but let's

760
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:21,860
might want to try get all five but let's
 

761
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,760
might want to try get all five but let's
just see how a sweep goes here okay

762
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:24,770
just see how a sweep goes here okay
 

763
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,850
just see how a sweep goes here okay
you're ready for this

764
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:26,860
you're ready for this
 

765
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,460
you're ready for this
[Music]

766
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:29,470

okay so kind of like with the mushroom

768
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:33,230
okay so kind of like with the mushroom
 

769
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,720
okay so kind of like with the mushroom
farm we're leaving some blocks behind

770
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:34,730
farm we're leaving some blocks behind
 

771
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,510
farm we're leaving some blocks behind
we're not even getting all four four

772
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
we're not even getting all four four
 

773
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,000
we're not even getting all four four
rows there so I don't think we're gonna

774
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,010
rows there so I don't think we're gonna
 

775
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,720
rows there so I don't think we're gonna
try to get all five we'll try to just do

776
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:43,730
try to get all five we'll try to just do
 

777
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,360
try to get all five we'll try to just do
a solid four and just thinker with our

778
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,370
a solid four and just thinker with our
 

779
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,560
a solid four and just thinker with our
settings here so right now we have

780
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:47,570
settings here so right now we have
 

781
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,500
settings here so right now we have
efficiency five hey Stu and speed two

782
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:50,510
efficiency five hey Stu and speed two
 

783
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,310
efficiency five hey Stu and speed two
maybe let's try decrease down to speed

784
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,320
maybe let's try decrease down to speed
 

785
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,049
maybe let's try decrease down to speed
one so we go a little bit slower and

786
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:56,059
one so we go a little bit slower and
 

787
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:58,740
one so we go a little bit slower and
maybe we'll get all all four blocks

788
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:58,750
maybe we'll get all all four blocks
 

789
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,899
maybe we'll get all all four blocks
perfectly you know excellent alright

790
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:01,909
perfectly you know excellent alright
 

791
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,430
perfectly you know excellent alright
we're gonna do another sweep here this

792
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,440
we're gonna do another sweep here this
 

793
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,490
we're gonna do another sweep here this
time with speed one and haste too so

794
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:06,500
time with speed one and haste too so
 

795
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:13,690
time with speed one and haste too so
it's gonna be a bit slower okay we

796
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:13,700
it's gonna be a bit slower okay we
 

797
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,850
it's gonna be a bit slower okay we
almost got them all but there's three

798
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:15,860
almost got them all but there's three
 

799
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,850
almost got them all but there's three
stray box left here yeah so this time no

800
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:18,860
stray box left here yeah so this time no
 

801
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,980
stray box left here yeah so this time no
speed just tastes - and efficiency five

802
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:20,990
speed just tastes - and efficiency five
 

803
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:27,659
speed just tastes - and efficiency five
let's go again

804
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:27,669

 

805
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:30,370

perfect we missed one at the start there

806
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:30,380
perfect we missed one at the start there
 

807
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,110
perfect we missed one at the start there
but just because I think the clay block

808
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,120
but just because I think the clay block
 

809
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,480
but just because I think the clay block
was there and let's just do one more

810
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:34,490
was there and let's just do one more
 

811
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,159
was there and let's just do one more
test here this time I got rid of the hey

812
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:36,169
test here this time I got rid of the hey
 

813
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:38,200
test here this time I got rid of the hey
stop the beacons so no speed no haste

814
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,210
stop the beacons so no speed no haste
 

815
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:45,240
stop the beacons so no speed no haste
just efficiency five let's try it out

816
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,250

 

817
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,800

it kind of stuttered that start there oh

818
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:47,810
it kind of stuttered that start there oh
 

819
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:54,850
it kind of stuttered that start there oh
why are we getting even more now wait a

820
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:54,860
why are we getting even more now wait a
 

821
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,440
why are we getting even more now wait a
minute I did not expect that we

822
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:58,450
minute I did not expect that we
 

823
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,790
minute I did not expect that we
obliterated four rows and we're starting

824
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:00,800
obliterated four rows and we're starting
 

825
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,610
obliterated four rows and we're starting
at five even I'm guessing I just wasn't

826
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:03,620
at five even I'm guessing I just wasn't
 

827
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,290
at five even I'm guessing I just wasn't
aligned to the front of the the block

828
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:05,300
aligned to the front of the the block
 

829
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,640
aligned to the front of the the block
when we had haste to on so I'm just

830
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:06,650
when we had haste to on so I'm just
 

831
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,130
when we had haste to on so I'm just
double-checking again I'm gonna make

832
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:09,140
double-checking again I'm gonna make
 

833
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,630
double-checking again I'm gonna make
sure I glide along the front so we can

834
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640
sure I glide along the front so we can
 

835
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:18,330
sure I glide along the front so we can
reach all five and see if it's the same

836
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:18,340

 

837
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,090

yeah so is this a faulty test so they're

838
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:22,100
yeah so is this a faulty test so they're
 

839
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,600
yeah so is this a faulty test so they're
they're the same winter without beacons

840
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:24,610
they're the same winter without beacons
 

841
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,130
they're the same winter without beacons
so that's kind of good we don't need to

842
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:27,140
so that's kind of good we don't need to
 

843
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,480
so that's kind of good we don't need to
have a beacon with our firm then that's

844
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:28,490
have a beacon with our firm then that's
 

845
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,250
have a beacon with our firm then that's
gonna save a lot of costs and set-up

846
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:30,260
gonna save a lot of costs and set-up
 

847
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,980
gonna save a lot of costs and set-up
time all right so next up here let's

848
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:32,990
time all right so next up here let's
 

849
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,020
time all right so next up here let's
consider how we're gonna do the auto

850
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,030
consider how we're gonna do the auto
 

851
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,640
consider how we're gonna do the auto
collection system because we don't want

852
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:36,650
collection system because we don't want
 

853
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,680
collection system because we don't want
to pick up all the ice drops manually

854
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:38,690
to pick up all the ice drops manually
 

855
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,150
to pick up all the ice drops manually
our inventory is gonna fill up very

856
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:40,160
our inventory is gonna fill up very
 

857
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,450
our inventory is gonna fill up very
quickly we want to be able to pick it up

858
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:43,460
quickly we want to be able to pick it up
 

859
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,980
quickly we want to be able to pick it up
automatically and drop it off in chess

860
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:44,990
automatically and drop it off in chess
 

861
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,660
automatically and drop it off in chess
without us having to think about it

862
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:46,670
without us having to think about it
 

863
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,590
without us having to think about it
ideally so I think there's gonna be two

864
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:50,600
ideally so I think there's gonna be two
 

865
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,810
ideally so I think there's gonna be two
main options either we use hopper

866
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:52,820
main options either we use hopper
 

867
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,410
main options either we use hopper
minecarts

868
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:53,420
minecarts
 

869
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,280
minecarts
or we use water streams so this is one

870
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,290
or we use water streams so this is one
 

871
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,250
or we use water streams so this is one
possible way we could set up the ice so

872
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:00,260
possible way we could set up the ice so
 

873
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,650
possible way we could set up the ice so
you stand on the trap the trap doors

874
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:02,660
you stand on the trap the trap doors
 

875
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,120
you stand on the trap the trap doors
here right and kind of like we did there

876
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,130
here right and kind of like we did there
 

877
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,150
here right and kind of like we did there
you just jump across or whatever all the

878
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:10,160
you just jump across or whatever all the
 

879
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,830
you just jump across or whatever all the
ice is gonna fall and trap doors and

880
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
ice is gonna fall and trap doors and
 

881
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,660
ice is gonna fall and trap doors and
then the hopper minecart will run

882
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:13,670
then the hopper minecart will run
 

883
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:18,700
then the hopper minecart will run
underneath them can I do the can i push

884
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:18,710
underneath them can I do the can i push
 

885
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,150
underneath them can I do the can i push
it around

886
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:21,160

 

887
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,940

yeah so you see it picked up the dice or

888
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:23,950
yeah so you see it picked up the dice or
 

889
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,610
yeah so you see it picked up the dice or
hopefully you saw that so that's one

890
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:26,620
hopefully you saw that so that's one
 

891
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,920
hopefully you saw that so that's one
idea let's try maybe a water stream

892
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:28,930
idea let's try maybe a water stream
 

893
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,360
idea let's try maybe a water stream
method as well because I kind of think

894
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:30,370
method as well because I kind of think
 

895
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,780
method as well because I kind of think
that's gonna be better hmm

896
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:33,790
that's gonna be better hmm
 

897
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,040
that's gonna be better hmm
you know I thought this was a good idea

898
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,050
you know I thought this was a good idea
 

899
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,400
you know I thought this was a good idea
I thought this is gonna be our final

900
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:38,410
I thought this is gonna be our final
 

901
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,320
I thought this is gonna be our final
final plan but now I'm thinking about it

902
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,330
final plan but now I'm thinking about it
 

903
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,930
final plan but now I'm thinking about it
it's got a couple flaws but we might be

904
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:42,940
it's got a couple flaws but we might be
 

905
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,760
it's got a couple flaws but we might be
able to make it work so I thought we

906
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:44,770
able to make it work so I thought we
 

907
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,430
able to make it work so I thought we
would have like water that doesn't

908
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,440
would have like water that doesn't
 

909
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,470
would have like water that doesn't
freeze over here running all along and

910
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:51,480
freeze over here running all along and
 

911
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,100
freeze over here running all along and
then when you remove the ice it'll it'll

912
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,110
then when you remove the ice it'll it'll
 

913
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,790
then when you remove the ice it'll it'll
flood the pool automatically right but

914
00:21:59,790 --> 00:21:59,800
flood the pool automatically right but
 

915
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,160
flood the pool automatically right but
also hopefully when the water rushes

916
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,170
also hopefully when the water rushes
 

917
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,050
also hopefully when the water rushes
back it'll push the items over the edge

918
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:04,060
back it'll push the items over the edge
 

919
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,750
back it'll push the items over the edge
you might need to replace the red clay

920
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:06,760
you might need to replace the red clay
 

921
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,060
you might need to replace the red clay
floor here with the ice as well just so

922
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,070
floor here with the ice as well just so
 

923
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,530
floor here with the ice as well just so
the items move better but one big issue

924
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:13,540
the items move better but one big issue
 

925
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,930
the items move better but one big issue
with this I just realized is since

926
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:15,940
with this I just realized is since
 

927
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,490
with this I just realized is since
there's no seed block there it's only

928
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:20,500
there's no seed block there it's only
 

929
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,380
there's no seed block there it's only
gonna spread from this no it won't

930
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:22,390
gonna spread from this no it won't
 

931
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,910
gonna spread from this no it won't
spread from the sides it will only

932
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:23,920
spread from the sides it will only
 

933
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:29,100
spread from the sides it will only
spread and maybe from the trapdoors hmm

934
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,110
spread and maybe from the trapdoors hmm
 

935
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,840
spread and maybe from the trapdoors hmm
I don't know if trapdoors count as a

936
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:30,850
I don't know if trapdoors count as a
 

937
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,640
I don't know if trapdoors count as a
seed block though it might need to be a

938
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:32,650
seed block though it might need to be a
 

939
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,910
seed block though it might need to be a
solid block I'm gonna watch it for a sec

940
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:35,920
solid block I'm gonna watch it for a sec
 

941
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,570
solid block I'm gonna watch it for a sec
oh yeah we got ice here so trapdoors can

942
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:39,580
oh yeah we got ice here so trapdoors can
 

943
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,030
oh yeah we got ice here so trapdoors can
spread the ice well just for now let's

944
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,040
spread the ice well just for now let's
 

945
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,370
spread the ice well just for now let's
not worry how the ice is going to spread

946
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:44,380
not worry how the ice is going to spread
 

947
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,080
not worry how the ice is going to spread
and how though the water is gonna refill

948
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,090
and how though the water is gonna refill
 

949
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,760
and how though the water is gonna refill
here and all that stuff let's just try

950
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:47,770
here and all that stuff let's just try
 

951
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,240
here and all that stuff let's just try
to test if the water will push the ice

952
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,250
to test if the water will push the ice
 

953
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,180
to test if the water will push the ice
over the edge here after its harvested

954
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,190
over the edge here after its harvested
 

955
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,460
over the edge here after its harvested
so yeah so touch we're gonna do a sweep

956
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:56,470
so yeah so touch we're gonna do a sweep
 

957
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:03,100
so yeah so touch we're gonna do a sweep
across here

958
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,110

 

959
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:08,139

okay oh so you see some got stuck there

960
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:08,149
okay oh so you see some got stuck there
 

961
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:10,580
okay oh so you see some got stuck there
okay so I guess let's give this a try I

962
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:10,590
okay so I guess let's give this a try I
 

963
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,440
okay so I guess let's give this a try I
think it has some potential I got rid of

964
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:12,450
think it has some potential I got rid of
 

965
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,830
think it has some potential I got rid of
the wall of water that doesn't freeze

966
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:14,840
the wall of water that doesn't freeze
 

967
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,060
the wall of water that doesn't freeze
along the edges and instead we're gonna

968
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,070
along the edges and instead we're gonna
 

969
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,700
along the edges and instead we're gonna
try use dispensers full of water buckets

970
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:19,710
try use dispensers full of water buckets
 

971
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:23,509
try use dispensers full of water buckets
right so the advantage of that is the

972
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:23,519
right so the advantage of that is the
 

973
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,070
right so the advantage of that is the
ice will actually be able to spawn along

974
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,080
ice will actually be able to spawn along
 

975
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,669
ice will actually be able to spawn along
the edges so you can spawn here it can

976
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:28,679
the edges so you can spawn here it can
 

977
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:29,989
the edges so you can spawn here it can
spawn here and then it just has to

978
00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:29,999
spawn here and then it just has to
 

979
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,609
spawn here and then it just has to
spread from here to here and from here

980
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:31,619
spread from here to here and from here
 

981
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,460
spread from here to here and from here
to here so to spreading --zz which means

982
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:34,470
to here so to spreading --zz which means
 

983
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,320
to here so to spreading --zz which means
ice production should be reasonably be

984
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:36,330
ice production should be reasonably be
 

985
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,889
ice production should be reasonably be
reasonably fast with this method as well

986
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:38,899
reasonably fast with this method as well
 

987
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:44,289
reasonably fast with this method as well
so as we as we run along here to harvest

988
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:44,299
so as we as we run along here to harvest
 

989
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,430
so as we as we run along here to harvest
when we get to the end of a section

990
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:46,440
when we get to the end of a section
 

991
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,519
when we get to the end of a section
we'll step on a pressure plate and then

992
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:49,529
we'll step on a pressure plate and then
 

993
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,879
we'll step on a pressure plate and then
that pressure plates can activate a

994
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:51,889
that pressure plates can activate a
 

995
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,489
that pressure plates can activate a
double pulse here which will eject the

996
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:55,499
double pulse here which will eject the
 

997
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:57,080
double pulse here which will eject the
water from the dispenser and then pick

998
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,090
water from the dispenser and then pick
 

999
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,560
water from the dispenser and then pick
it up right after that'll work right

1000
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:00,570
it up right after that'll work right
 

1001
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,349
it up right after that'll work right
yeah just thinking about it

1002
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:03,359
yeah just thinking about it
 

1003
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,139
yeah just thinking about it
and then the redstone goes all along

1004
00:24:06,139 --> 00:24:06,149
and then the redstone goes all along
 

1005
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:08,090
and then the redstone goes all along
here's all the dispensers then we have a

1006
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,100
here's all the dispensers then we have a
 

1007
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,159
here's all the dispensers then we have a
bit of a weight here I got eight ticks

1008
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:10,169
bit of a weight here I got eight ticks
 

1009
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:11,840
bit of a weight here I got eight ticks
hopefully that's gonna be long enough so

1010
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:11,850
hopefully that's gonna be long enough so
 

1011
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,599
hopefully that's gonna be long enough so
that it'll just the water will just come

1012
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:14,609
that it'll just the water will just come
 

1013
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:17,779
that it'll just the water will just come
out on the the edge there first which

1014
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:17,789
out on the the edge there first which
 

1015
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,190
out on the the edge there first which
means they'll give it a bit of time to

1016
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
means they'll give it a bit of time to
 

1017
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,560
means they'll give it a bit of time to
push the items over and then after a

1018
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:21,570
push the items over and then after a
 

1019
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,109
push the items over and then after a
little bit's these two dispensers will

1020
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:24,119
little bit's these two dispensers will
 

1021
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:26,779
little bit's these two dispensers will
activate and then the the pool will

1022
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:26,789
activate and then the the pool will
 

1023
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:30,529
activate and then the the pool will
refill hopefully unless it freezes we

1024
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:30,539
refill hopefully unless it freezes we
 

1025
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:31,999
refill hopefully unless it freezes we
might need to add some freeze protection

1026
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:32,009
might need to add some freeze protection
 

1027
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:35,180
might need to add some freeze protection
to this to while the sequence is going

1028
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,190
to this to while the sequence is going
 

1029
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,019
to this to while the sequence is going
on but I guess we can give it a try

1030
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:39,029
on but I guess we can give it a try
 

1031
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:43,070
on but I guess we can give it a try
right did I forget anything I think

1032
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,080
right did I forget anything I think
 

1033
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,229
right did I forget anything I think
we're okay this automatically just step

1034
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:48,239
we're okay this automatically just step
 

1035
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:59,859
we're okay this automatically just step
on the pressure plate why hmm

1036
00:24:59,859 --> 00:24:59,869
on the pressure plate why hmm
 

1037
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:05,749
on the pressure plate why hmm
maybe the timing wasn't right I get

1038
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:05,759
maybe the timing wasn't right I get
 

1039
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,729
maybe the timing wasn't right I get
dejected the water and picked it up

1040
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:07,739
dejected the water and picked it up
 

1041
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:14,410
dejected the water and picked it up
before it

1042
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:14,420

 

1043
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,140

look good let's do another test here so

1044
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,150
look good let's do another test here so
 

1045
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,880
look good let's do another test here so
I replaced the bottom here that used to

1046
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:19,890
I replaced the bottom here that used to
 

1047
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,160
I replaced the bottom here that used to
be clay with ice so the items will slide

1048
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,170
be clay with ice so the items will slide
 

1049
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,520
be clay with ice so the items will slide
across faster the downside so we gotta

1050
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:25,530
across faster the downside so we gotta
 

1051
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,770
across faster the downside so we gotta
be careful we don't mind it right so

1052
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:27,780
be careful we don't mind it right so
 

1053
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,940
be careful we don't mind it right so
we'll see how this goes

1054
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:28,950
we'll see how this goes
 

1055
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,700
we'll see how this goes
hopefully I got the water fixed now I'm

1056
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:31,710
hopefully I got the water fixed now I'm
 

1057
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:37,360
hopefully I got the water fixed now I'm
not sure yet

1058
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,370

 

1059
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,430

beautiful we see all the ice is kind of

1060
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:40,440
beautiful we see all the ice is kind of
 

1061
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,190
beautiful we see all the ice is kind of
scattered throughout step on this yeah I

1062
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:46,200
scattered throughout step on this yeah I
 

1063
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:57,670
scattered throughout step on this yeah I
got the water perfect now oh my goodness

1064
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:57,680

 

1065
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:03,560

hmm Paul didn't get flushed off all

1066
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:03,570
hmm Paul didn't get flushed off all
 

1067
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,820
hmm Paul didn't get flushed off all
right everybody so I think we're getting

1068
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:04,830
right everybody so I think we're getting
 

1069
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,310
right everybody so I think we're getting
pretty close to a good design here you

1070
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:07,320
pretty close to a good design here you
 

1071
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,750
pretty close to a good design here you
might have noticed some of the ice

1072
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:08,760
might have noticed some of the ice
 

1073
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,000
might have noticed some of the ice
blocks were jumping outside landing on

1074
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,010
blocks were jumping outside landing on
 

1075
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,770
blocks were jumping outside landing on
the trapdoors and stuff so I've added a

1076
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:12,780
the trapdoors and stuff so I've added a
 

1077
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,440
the trapdoors and stuff so I've added a
lip all-around raise it up one block so

1078
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:15,450
lip all-around raise it up one block so
 

1079
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,630
lip all-around raise it up one block so
hopefully all the ice stays within the

1080
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:17,640
hopefully all the ice stays within the
 

1081
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,210
hopefully all the ice stays within the
rectangle now I think that the water

1082
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:20,220
rectangle now I think that the water
 

1083
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,980
rectangle now I think that the water
streams figured out hopefully maybe

1084
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:21,990
streams figured out hopefully maybe
 

1085
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,820
streams figured out hopefully maybe
we'll see and kind of the idea with this

1086
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:25,830
we'll see and kind of the idea with this
 

1087
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,820
we'll see and kind of the idea with this
is we perfect one of these sections and

1088
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:28,830
is we perfect one of these sections and
 

1089
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,010
is we perfect one of these sections and
then we take it and we copy it like 50

1090
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:31,020
then we take it and we copy it like 50
 

1091
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,570
then we take it and we copy it like 50
times or whatever and hopefully by the

1092
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:32,580
times or whatever and hopefully by the
 

1093
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,630
times or whatever and hopefully by the
time we get to harvesting the fiftieth

1094
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:35,640
time we get to harvesting the fiftieth
 

1095
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,280
time we get to harvesting the fiftieth
section when we get back to the first

1096
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,290
section when we get back to the first
 

1097
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,610
section when we get back to the first
one all the water will be frozen and you

1098
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:40,620
one all the water will be frozen and you
 

1099
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,460
one all the water will be frozen and you
just go in a constant loop of of

1100
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:42,470
just go in a constant loop of of
 

1101
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,930
just go in a constant loop of of
constant harvesting rights that's kind

1102
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:44,940
constant harvesting rights that's kind
 

1103
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,320
constant harvesting rights that's kind
of though the goal is this so let's give

1104
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,330
of though the goal is this so let's give
 

1105
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,450
of though the goal is this so let's give
it another try here I've been doing lots

1106
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:50,460
it another try here I've been doing lots
 

1107
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,940
it another try here I've been doing lots
and lots of trial of their trial and

1108
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:52,950
and lots of trial of their trial and
 

1109
00:26:52,950 --> 00:27:02,660
and lots of trial of their trial and
error here I think we're getting close

1110
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:02,670

 

1111
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:07,050

yep so they all got washed down make

1112
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,060
yep so they all got washed down make
 

1113
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,060
yep so they all got washed down make
sure all the waters are proper so again

1114
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:09,070
sure all the waters are proper so again
 

1115
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,520
sure all the waters are proper so again
I don't know if it's an issue with like

1116
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:11,530
I don't know if it's an issue with like
 

1117
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,010
I don't know if it's an issue with like
the water freezing before the dispensers

1118
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:14,020
the water freezing before the dispensers
 

1119
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,540
the water freezing before the dispensers
pick picked it up again

1120
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:15,550
pick picked it up again
 

1121
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,110
pick picked it up again
that's the one thing I'm concerned about

1122
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:18,120
that's the one thing I'm concerned about
 

1123
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,730
that's the one thing I'm concerned about
but if that's not an issue I think we

1124
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:20,740
but if that's not an issue I think we
 

1125
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,010
but if that's not an issue I think we
got just about figured out here so

1126
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:23,020
got just about figured out here so
 

1127
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,980
got just about figured out here so
that's cool if that is an issue what we

1128
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:25,990
that's cool if that is an issue what we
 

1129
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,930
that's cool if that is an issue what we
might end up doing is like adding

1130
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:27,940
might end up doing is like adding
 

1131
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:33,540
might end up doing is like adding
Pistons above the dispensers so that the

1132
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:33,550
Pistons above the dispensers so that the
 

1133
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,050
Pistons above the dispensers so that the
piston head extends while the water is

1134
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:37,060
piston head extends while the water is
 

1135
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,090
piston head extends while the water is
ejected and then it retracts when the

1136
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:39,100
ejected and then it retracts when the
 

1137
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,100
ejected and then it retracts when the
Spencer gets the water again so make

1138
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,110
Spencer gets the water again so make
 

1139
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,050
Spencer gets the water again so make
sure it doesn't freeze before it picks

1140
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:43,060
sure it doesn't freeze before it picks
 

1141
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,630
sure it doesn't freeze before it picks
it up because the piston head should

1142
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:45,640
it up because the piston head should
 

1143
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,550
it up because the piston head should
stop the water from freezing cuz it

1144
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:47,560
stop the water from freezing cuz it
 

1145
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,850
stop the water from freezing cuz it
blocks the skylight all right but I'm

1146
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:50,860
blocks the skylight all right but I'm
 

1147
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,850
blocks the skylight all right but I'm
not sure if it's an issue but anyways

1148
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:53,860
not sure if it's an issue but anyways
 

1149
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,100
not sure if it's an issue but anyways
guys I think we are about out of time

1150
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,110
guys I think we are about out of time
 

1151
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,070
guys I think we are about out of time
here for today so we're gonna wrap up

1152
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,080
here for today so we're gonna wrap up
 

1153
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,140
here for today so we're gonna wrap up
we'll try finish that next episode or or

1154
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,150
we'll try finish that next episode or or
 

1155
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,170
we'll try finish that next episode or or
at least build a lot of it unless the

1156
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:04,180
at least build a lot of it unless the
 

1157
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,850
at least build a lot of it unless the
update comes out then we might focus on

1158
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:05,860
update comes out then we might focus on
 

1159
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,460
update comes out then we might focus on
that instead correct me if I'm wrong

1160
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:08,470
that instead correct me if I'm wrong
 

1161
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,680
that instead correct me if I'm wrong
though does does update break any of the

1162
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:10,690
though does does update break any of the
 

1163
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,300
though does does update break any of the
water mechanics with what we just did

1164
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:12,310
water mechanics with what we just did
 

1165
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,940
water mechanics with what we just did
today hopefully not I don't think it

1166
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:14,950
today hopefully not I don't think it
 

1167
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,370
today hopefully not I don't think it
does right I should probably test it

1168
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:17,380
does right I should probably test it
 

1169
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,580
does right I should probably test it
before I go large steel but anyways the

1170
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:20,590
before I go large steel but anyways the
 

1171
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,050
before I go large steel but anyways the
comment of the day says you talked about

1172
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:22,060
comment of the day says you talked about
 

1173
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,350
comment of the day says you talked about
boat roads being the best for long term

1174
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:24,360
boat roads being the best for long term
 

1175
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,060
boat roads being the best for long term
long-distance nether travel have you

1176
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,070
long-distance nether travel have you
 

1177
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,370
long-distance nether travel have you
seen side crafts piston bolts they're

1178
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:29,380
seen side crafts piston bolts they're
 

1179
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,320
seen side crafts piston bolts they're
much faster than boat roads even blue

1180
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:31,330
much faster than boat roads even blue
 

1181
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,510
much faster than boat roads even blue
ice but they require huge amounts of

1182
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:33,520
ice but they require huge amounts of
 

1183
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,190
ice but they require huge amounts of
infrastructure and are extremely

1184
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
infrastructure and are extremely
 

1185
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,930
infrastructure and are extremely
complicated to build relative to boat

1186
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:36,940
complicated to build relative to boat
 

1187
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,320
complicated to build relative to boat
roads thoughts yeah I've seen them

1188
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,330
roads thoughts yeah I've seen them
 

1189
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:44,130
roads thoughts yeah I've seen them
they're really cool I think for the last

1190
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:44,140
they're really cool I think for the last
 

1191
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,570
they're really cool I think for the last
few years there's always been like a

1192
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:45,580
few years there's always been like a
 

1193
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,290
few years there's always been like a
fast method of travel in Minecraft like

1194
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:49,300
fast method of travel in Minecraft like
 

1195
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,150
fast method of travel in Minecraft like
a really fast method but they're all

1196
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:51,160
a really fast method but they're all
 

1197
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,460
a really fast method but they're all
like based on glitches right correct me

1198
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:53,470
like based on glitches right correct me
 

1199
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,430
like based on glitches right correct me
if I'm wrong so I've pretty much always

1200
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:56,440
if I'm wrong so I've pretty much always
 

1201
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,510
if I'm wrong so I've pretty much always
avoided them and even though Mojang say

1202
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:00,520
avoided them and even though Mojang say
 

1203
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,340
avoided them and even though Mojang say
they're not changing or tampering with

1204
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:02,350
they're not changing or tampering with
 

1205
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,270
they're not changing or tampering with
pistons anymore

1206
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,280
pistons anymore
 

1207
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,860
pistons anymore
they still are so I'm a hesitant to do

1208
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:07,870
they still are so I'm a hesitant to do
 

1209
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,660
they still are so I'm a hesitant to do
anything like that because I'm pretty

1210
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:09,670
anything like that because I'm pretty
 

1211
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,750
anything like that because I'm pretty
sure it'll break eventually I might be

1212
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:12,760
sure it'll break eventually I might be
 

1213
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,200
sure it'll break eventually I might be
wrong about

1214
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,210
wrong about
 

1215
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,720
wrong about
that that's why I've always avoided that

1216
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:15,730
that that's why I've always avoided that
 

1217
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,820
that that's why I've always avoided that
kind of fast travel stuff I'd rather get

1218
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:17,830
kind of fast travel stuff I'd rather get
 

1219
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,470
kind of fast travel stuff I'd rather get
something more reliable that I know will

1220
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:19,480
something more reliable that I know will
 

1221
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,870
something more reliable that I know will
work long term because this is a long

1222
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:21,880
work long term because this is a long
 

1223
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,440
work long term because this is a long
term world right uh-huh

1224
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,450
term world right uh-huh
 

1225
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,789
term world right uh-huh
