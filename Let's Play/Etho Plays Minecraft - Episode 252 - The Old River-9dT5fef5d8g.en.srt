75
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,690
want to do today for this episode and I
got a few random plans that we might do

76
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:58,700
got a few random plans that we might do
 

77
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,220
got a few random plans that we might do
but I think maybe maybe to start off

78
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,230
but I think maybe maybe to start off
 

79
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,009
but I think maybe maybe to start off
with work on Wilson for a bit because we

80
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:06,019
with work on Wilson for a bit because we
 

81
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,530
with work on Wilson for a bit because we

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:10,540

 

83
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,360

what I kind of want to do is start

84
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,370
what I kind of want to do is start
 

85
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,850
what I kind of want to do is start
working on what we got to put in a clock

86
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:15,860
working on what we got to put in a clock
 

87
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,610
working on what we got to put in a clock
a master clock for keeping track of the

88
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:18,620
a master clock for keeping track of the
 

89
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,930
a master clock for keeping track of the
age I want to start maybe setting up

90
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:22,940
age I want to start maybe setting up
 

91
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,539
age I want to start maybe setting up
some of these interactive features with

92
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:25,549
some of these interactive features with
 

93
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:31,150
some of these interactive features with
them so one idea was to have a way of

94
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,160
them so one idea was to have a way of
 

95
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,100
them so one idea was to have a way of
feeding him feeding our pets through

96
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,110
feeding him feeding our pets through
 

97
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,930
feeding him feeding our pets through
hoppers so the way that would work and I

98
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:40,940
hoppers so the way that would work and I
 

99
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,229
hoppers so the way that would work and I
got a lot of this stuff don't I I'm

100
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
got a lot of this stuff don't I I'm
 

101
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,259
got a lot of this stuff don't I I'm
going to put these in here too the way

102
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:47,269
going to put these in here too the way
 

103
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,030
going to put these in here too the way
this would work is we would kind of have

104
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
this would work is we would kind of have
 

105
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,500
this would work is we would kind of have
just like a slot where we could throw

106
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:50,510
just like a slot where we could throw
 

107
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,060
just like a slot where we could throw
food probably something like this so

108
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,070
food probably something like this so
 

109
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,100
food probably something like this so
when he's hungry

110
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,110
when he's hungry
 

111
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,319
when he's hungry
we can we can feed them just by throwing

112
00:03:59,319 --> 00:03:59,329
we can we can feed them just by throwing
 

113
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:03,640
we can we can feed them just by throwing
a food item into the hopper and then the

114
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:03,650
a food item into the hopper and then the
 

115
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,110
a food item into the hopper and then the
hoppers going to work out what type of

116
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
hoppers going to work out what type of
 

117
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,860
hoppers going to work out what type of
food item it is and affect the stats

118
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:08,870
food item it is and affect the stats
 

119
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,949
food item it is and affect the stats
that way like certain foods might

120
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
that way like certain foods might
 

121
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,440
that way like certain foods might
recover more hunger some some might add

122
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,450
recover more hunger some some might add
 

123
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,320
recover more hunger some some might add
other boosts like the happiness or or

124
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,330
other boosts like the happiness or or
 

125
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,289
other boosts like the happiness or or
something else in

126
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:19,299
something else in
 

127
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,210
something else in
stats but at the expense of maybe

128
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:21,220
stats but at the expense of maybe
 

129
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,700
stats but at the expense of maybe
something else like maybe it adds a lot

130
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:23,710
something else like maybe it adds a lot
 

131
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,249
something else like maybe it adds a lot
more weight to our pet or something like

132
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:26,259
more weight to our pet or something like
 

133
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:26,520
more weight to our pet or something like
that

134
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:26,530
that
 

135
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,300
that
I'm not exactly sure it will probably be

136
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,310
I'm not exactly sure it will probably be
 

137
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,219
I'm not exactly sure it will probably be
fairly complicated so I don't think I'm

138
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:32,229
fairly complicated so I don't think I'm
 

139
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:33,899
fairly complicated so I don't think I'm
going to do too many different types of

140
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:33,909
going to do too many different types of
 

141
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:41,309
going to do too many different types of
food what do we want we want something

142
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:41,319
food what do we want we want something
 

143
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,350
food what do we want we want something
to feed our pets so we'll have a slot

144
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
to feed our pets so we'll have a slot
 

145
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,100
to feed our pets so we'll have a slot
for that and maybe next to it will have

146
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,110
for that and maybe next to it will have
 

147
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:55,770
for that and maybe next to it will have
another slots I think at once oh you

148
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:55,780
another slots I think at once oh you
 

149
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,350
another slots I think at once oh you
know what we'll do because I also want

150
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,360
know what we'll do because I also want
 

151
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,999
know what we'll do because I also want
to add the ability for our pet to get

152
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:00,009
to add the ability for our pet to get
 

153
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:03,420
to add the ability for our pet to get
sick if his health is low he has an

154
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:03,430
sick if his health is low he has an
 

155
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,770
sick if his health is low he has an
increased chance of getting sick

156
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:04,780
increased chance of getting sick
 

157
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:11,309
increased chance of getting sick
randomly um what we should do I guess

158
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:11,319
randomly um what we should do I guess
 

159
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,800
randomly um what we should do I guess
with our hunger slot here we'll add the

160
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:13,810
with our hunger slot here we'll add the
 

161
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,450
with our hunger slot here we'll add the
option of giving him medicine like

162
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:15,460
option of giving him medicine like
 

163
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,730
option of giving him medicine like
instant health potions and that will

164
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:19,740
instant health potions and that will
 

165
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:26,399
instant health potions and that will
take him out of being six states um how

166
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,409
take him out of being six states um how
 

167
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,080
take him out of being six states um how
would that work but if we give him one

168
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,090
would that work but if we give him one
 

169
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,870
would that work but if we give him one
when he's not sick it's gonna negatively

170
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
when he's not sick it's gonna negatively
 

171
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,309
when he's not sick it's gonna negatively
affect him yeah something like that so

172
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:35,319
affect him yeah something like that so
 

173
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,730
affect him yeah something like that so
we can do that in this slot itself we

174
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:38,740
we can do that in this slot itself we
 

175
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,370
we can do that in this slot itself we
need indicator lights for when he's sick

176
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:41,380
need indicator lights for when he's sick
 

177
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:48,029
need indicator lights for when he's sick
and when he's sleeping so we might put

178
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:48,039
and when he's sleeping so we might put
 

179
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,529
and when he's sleeping so we might put
that down here we also need a way of

180
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:49,539
that down here we also need a way of
 

181
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:53,249
that down here we also need a way of
interacting with him like by playing

182
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:53,259
interacting with him like by playing
 

183
00:05:53,259 --> 00:06:01,249
interacting with him like by playing
with him not sure how to do that yet

184
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:01,259

 

185
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,580

let's see was this workout - oh you know

186
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:05,590
let's see was this workout - oh you know
 

187
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,839
let's see was this workout - oh you know
what I'm gonna do actually I'm going to

188
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:06,849
what I'm gonna do actually I'm going to
 

189
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,399
what I'm gonna do actually I'm going to
make this water I'm going to extend this

190
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:08,409
make this water I'm going to extend this
 

191
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,379
make this water I'm going to extend this
one block wider because the way it is

192
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:10,389
one block wider because the way it is
 

193
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:13,350
one block wider because the way it is
right now if I did this it would be an

194
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
right now if I did this it would be an
 

195
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,999
right now if I did this it would be an
even number and I want an odd number

196
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:15,009
even number and I want an odd number
 

197
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,279
even number and I want an odd number
because this is six blocks across if we

198
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:17,289
because this is six blocks across if we
 

199
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:21,899
because this is six blocks across if we
add one more block it will become oh no

200
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:21,909
add one more block it will become oh no
 

201
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:25,630
add one more block it will become oh no
no wait a minute

202
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:25,640

 

203
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:32,720

maybe that won't work yeah yeah we'll do

204
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:32,730
maybe that won't work yeah yeah we'll do
 

205
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,000
maybe that won't work yeah yeah we'll do
it that way yeah I'm going to add one

206
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,010
it that way yeah I'm going to add one
 

207
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,430
it that way yeah I'm going to add one
more block to the width on both sides of

208
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
more block to the width on both sides of
 

209
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,380
more block to the width on both sides of
this thing I've been trying to think how

210
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:42,390

extra bordered on both sides so it's
going to be an odd number base now we

280
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:28,610
going to be an odd number base now we
 

281
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,100
going to be an odd number base now we
could do something like this where we

up with cobblestone and we have our
locking mechanic up here I set up the

320
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
locking mechanic up here I set up the
 

321
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,449
locking mechanic up here I set up the
hopper timer here this is our master

322
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:39,459
hopper timer here this is our master
 

323
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:41,949
hopper timer here this is our master
master timer for the whole system so we

324
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:41,959
master timer for the whole system so we
 

325
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,930
master timer for the whole system so we
can control the speed

326
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:43,940
can control the speed
 

327
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,269
can control the speed
everything works from this how many

328
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:46,279
everything works from this how many
 

329
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,400
everything works from this how many
items we put in here so it'll be easy to

330
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:48,410
items we put in here so it'll be easy to
 

331
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,210
items we put in here so it'll be easy to
configure or even change in the future

332
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:52,220
configure or even change in the future
 

333
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,240
configure or even change in the future
I'll probably have to move this so but I

334
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,250
I'll probably have to move this so but I
 

335
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,679
I'll probably have to move this so but I
just want to do a simple little test

336
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:58,689
just want to do a simple little test
 

337
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:03,970
just want to do a simple little test
here maybe we'll just put in let's put

338
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:03,980
here maybe we'll just put in let's put
 

339
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,609
here maybe we'll just put in let's put
in eight items dope wrong one there we

340
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:09,619
in eight items dope wrong one there we
 

341
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:13,239
in eight items dope wrong one there we
go put in eight items I'm going to just

342
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:13,249
go put in eight items I'm going to just
 

343
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,869
go put in eight items I'm going to just
temporarily hook this up to the age

344
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:15,879
temporarily hook this up to the age
 

345
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:22,929
temporarily hook this up to the age
statin we'll see how it works give us an

346
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:22,939
statin we'll see how it works give us an
 

347
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:25,659
statin we'll see how it works give us an
idea of how long we want that pulse to

348
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:25,669
idea of how long we want that pulse to
 

349
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:29,049
idea of how long we want that pulse to
be just not switching

350
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:29,059
be just not switching
 

351
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:33,579
be just not switching
oh no it's switch okay ah yeah I'll just

352
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:33,589
oh no it's switch okay ah yeah I'll just
 

353
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:43,809
oh no it's switch okay ah yeah I'll just
do maybe I'll do this like that but yeah

354
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:43,819
do maybe I'll do this like that but yeah
 

355
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,349
do maybe I'll do this like that but yeah
I'll definitely have to move this later

356
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:46,359
I'll definitely have to move this later
 

357
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,579
I'll definitely have to move this later
dad just run wire is it not going to

358
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:48,589
dad just run wire is it not going to
 

359
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:52,900
dad just run wire is it not going to
make the torch switch oh it pulsed very

360
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:52,910
make the torch switch oh it pulsed very
 

361
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,869
make the torch switch oh it pulsed very
very quickly there no item got through

362
00:10:57,869 --> 00:10:57,879
very quickly there no item got through
 

363
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:04,090
very quickly there no item got through
no item might be too fast for most of

364
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,100
no item might be too fast for most of
 

365
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,429
no item might be too fast for most of
these variable things I don't want the

366
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:06,439
these variable things I don't want the
 

367
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:11,289
these variable things I don't want the
timing to be very long like probably

368
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:11,299
timing to be very long like probably
 

369
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:14,919
timing to be very long like probably
somewhere between 1 1 and 10 ticks for

370
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:14,929
somewhere between 1 1 and 10 ticks for
 

371
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:18,970
somewhere between 1 1 and 10 ticks for
all the variables if we make it really

372
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:18,980
all the variables if we make it really
 

373
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,350
all the variables if we make it really
long it's going to take up a lot of

374
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:20,360
long it's going to take up a lot of
 

375
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,579
long it's going to take up a lot of
space so it's not really ideal we got to

376
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:24,589
space so it's not really ideal we got to
 

377
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:30,170
space so it's not really ideal we got to
do this

378
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:30,180

 

379
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,210

I wonder if we'll go through now oh it

380
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:32,220
I wonder if we'll go through now oh it
 

381
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,200
I wonder if we'll go through now oh it
didn't switch at all now

382
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,210
didn't switch at all now
 

383
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,600
didn't switch at all now
okay I'm going to switch at now let's

384
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:35,610
okay I'm going to switch at now let's
 

385
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,980
okay I'm going to switch at now let's
get this to three and down we go

386
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:38,990
get this to three and down we go
 

387
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,290
get this to three and down we go
darn it's so hard building this oh

388
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:44,300
darn it's so hard building this oh
 

389
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:52,070
darn it's so hard building this oh
there's just no space no space and go do

390
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:52,080
there's just no space no space and go do
 

391
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,630
there's just no space no space and go do
parkour all the time okay it should be

392
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:55,640
parkour all the time okay it should be
 

393
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,560
parkour all the time okay it should be
no line items through oh you know what

394
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:00,570
no line items through oh you know what
 

395
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,830
no line items through oh you know what
it is I bet you this is set the wrong

396
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:02,840
it is I bet you this is set the wrong
 

397
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,880
it is I bet you this is set the wrong
let's change this picture that's what it

398
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:07,890
let's change this picture that's what it
 

399
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,700
let's change this picture that's what it
is

400
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,710

 

401
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,420

so now Oh No still inlet one through

402
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:15,430
so now Oh No still inlet one through
 

403
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,240
so now Oh No still inlet one through
they've been changing the timings and

404
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,250
they've been changing the timings and
 

405
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,150
they've been changing the timings and
stuff on everything so maybe hoppers are

406
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
stuff on everything so maybe hoppers are
 

407
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,570
stuff on everything so maybe hoppers are
more specific now I like takes three and

408
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:25,580
more specific now I like takes three and
 

409
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,060
more specific now I like takes three and
a half ticks or at least it did to send

410
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,070
a half ticks or at least it did to send
 

411
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,650
a half ticks or at least it did to send
an item through but occasionally if you

412
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:29,660
an item through but occasionally if you
 

413
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,740
an item through but occasionally if you
did a time shorter than that it would

414
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:32,750
did a time shorter than that it would
 

415
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,389
did a time shorter than that it would
randomly let one through every now and

416
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
randomly let one through every now and
 

417
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,430
randomly let one through every now and
then but maybe it's very specific now

418
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:36,440
then but maybe it's very specific now
 

419
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,150
then but maybe it's very specific now
since this is less than three-and-a-half

420
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,160
since this is less than three-and-a-half
 

421
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,190
since this is less than three-and-a-half
say three maybe it's not going to let

422
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:42,200
say three maybe it's not going to let
 

423
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:51,269
say three maybe it's not going to let
any through ever so we'll try four well

424
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279

 

425
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,920

this torch might be locking it could

426
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:56,930
this torch might be locking it could
 

427
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,380
this torch might be locking it could
that be it why isn't it working

428
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:01,390

 

429
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,050

I'm confused

430
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:04,060
I'm confused
 

431
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,930
I'm confused
okay well yeah it should be this way

432
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:07,940
okay well yeah it should be this way
 

433
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,860
okay well yeah it should be this way
yeah okay there we go so now it's

434
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:11,870
yeah okay there we go so now it's
 

435
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,449
yeah okay there we go so now it's
letting one item through every time it

436
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:13,459
letting one item through every time it
 

437
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,980
letting one item through every time it
seems like it's more specific now that's

438
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:14,990
seems like it's more specific now that's
 

439
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,890
seems like it's more specific now that's
good I'll be easier to control things so

440
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:17,900
good I'll be easier to control things so
 

441
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,329
good I'll be easier to control things so
if it's a three it's not going to let an

442
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:19,339
if it's a three it's not going to let an
 

443
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:22,900
if it's a three it's not going to let an
item through is it now if it's at four

444
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:22,910
item through is it now if it's at four
 

445
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:29,140
item through is it now if it's at four
should do it every time yeah okay cool

446
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,150
should do it every time yeah okay cool
 

447
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,829
should do it every time yeah okay cool
so that's the shortest delay we can have

448
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:32,839
so that's the shortest delay we can have
 

449
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,660
so that's the shortest delay we can have
for the variables for ticks

450
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:39,670

 

451
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,710

all right I've just been kind of

452
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:41,720
all right I've just been kind of
 

453
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,570
all right I've just been kind of
watching this for a little bit here I

454
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:43,580
watching this for a little bit here I
 

455
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,210
watching this for a little bit here I
went FD for 15 minutes with this set at

456
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:46,220
went FD for 15 minutes with this set at
 

457
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,240
went FD for 15 minutes with this set at
3:00 just to make sure no items were

458
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,250
3:00 just to make sure no items were
 

459
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,150
3:00 just to make sure no items were
randomly passing through over time and

460
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
randomly passing through over time and
 

461
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,870
randomly passing through over time and
good news they're not so yeah hoppers

462
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:55,880
good news they're not so yeah hoppers
 

463
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,449
good news they're not so yeah hoppers
are very very much more stable now than

464
00:13:58,449 --> 00:13:58,459
are very very much more stable now than
 

465
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,420
are very very much more stable now than
they used to be I'm using oh six eighty

466
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:01,430
they used to be I'm using oh six eighty
 

467
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,880
they used to be I'm using oh six eighty
now so somewhere along the line they

468
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:03,890
now so somewhere along the line they
 

469
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,140
now so somewhere along the line they
they made them more stable which is good

470
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,150
they made them more stable which is good
 

471
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,870
they made them more stable which is good
and I'll be able to fine-tune control

472
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
and I'll be able to fine-tune control
 

473
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,470
and I'll be able to fine-tune control
everything that means and this here is

474
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
everything that means and this here is
 

475
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,699
everything that means and this here is
going to be our lowest common

476
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:17,709
going to be our lowest common
 

477
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:20,170
going to be our lowest common
denominator basically in this whole set

478
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:20,180
denominator basically in this whole set
 

479
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,810
denominator basically in this whole set
up the age variable is going to move the

480
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:22,820
up the age variable is going to move the
 

481
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,060
up the age variable is going to move the
slowest out of everything just one item

update from our main clock here while
 

487
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,819

the other things like the hunger and

00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:31,829
the other things like the hunger and
 

489
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,970

whatever we might want one two three

490
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:34,980
whatever we might want one two three
 

491
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,840
whatever we might want one two three
four

492
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:35,850
four
 

493
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,689
four
you know items passing through per

494
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:38,699
you know items passing through per
 

495
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:43,280
you know items passing through per
update but no less than one so nothing

496
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,290
update but no less than one so nothing
 

497
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,900
update but no less than one so nothing
nothing is going to be less than this

498
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:44,910
nothing is going to be less than this
 

499
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,780
nothing is going to be less than this
one and it's just a big balancing act to

500
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:47,790
one and it's just a big balancing act to
 

501
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,569
one and it's just a big balancing act to
get them to change at a rate we want

502
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:50,579
get them to change at a rate we want
 

503
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:56,259
get them to change at a rate we want
them to based off of this one so yeah

504
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:56,269
them to based off of this one so yeah
 

505
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:59,930
them to based off of this one so yeah
that's about it we're going to go do

506
00:14:59,930 --> 00:14:59,940
that's about it we're going to go do
 

507
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,400
that's about it we're going to go do
something else so we've spent quite a

508
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:01,410
something else so we've spent quite a
 

509
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,800
something else so we've spent quite a
bit of time on this today more than I

510
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:03,810
bit of time on this today more than I
 

511
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,550
bit of time on this today more than I
expected

512
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
expected
 

513
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,680
expected
oh man he's going to kill me I do need

514
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:09,690
oh man he's going to kill me I do need
 

515
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,160
oh man he's going to kill me I do need
to add a main reset to this as well so

516
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,170
to add a main reset to this as well so
 

517
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,699
to add a main reset to this as well so
like if I if I pull a lever this is

518
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:16,709
like if I if I pull a lever this is
 

519
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,769
like if I if I pull a lever this is
going to drain down to zero this is

520
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:18,779
going to drain down to zero this is
 

521
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,780
going to drain down to zero this is
going to go up to five this will go up

522
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:20,790
going to go up to five this will go up
 

523
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,290
going to go up to five this will go up
to five this will go to three or and

524
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,300
to five this will go to three or and
 

525
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,170
to five this will go to three or and
stop that will go up to five that will

526
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:27,180
stop that will go up to five that will
 

527
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,970
stop that will go up to five that will
go up to five and it will be like a new

528
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:28,980
go up to five and it will be like a new
 

529
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,250
go up to five and it will be like a new
pet in case it dies or something we need

530
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:31,260
pet in case it dies or something we need
 

531
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,059
pet in case it dies or something we need
a way of resetting it so that will be

532
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:35,069
a way of resetting it so that will be
 

533
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:38,030
a way of resetting it so that will be
fun we're going to head over to my

534
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,040
fun we're going to head over to my
 

535
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,430
fun we're going to head over to my
stronghold base alright guys here we are

536
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
stronghold base alright guys here we are
 

537
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,769
stronghold base alright guys here we are
at the stronghold base and it's been

538
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:45,779
at the stronghold base and it's been
 

539
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,199
at the stronghold base and it's been
quite a while since we were last year

540
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:48,209
quite a while since we were last year
 

541
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:52,269
quite a while since we were last year
I've been neglecting it's not gonna lie

542
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:52,279
I've been neglecting it's not gonna lie
 

543
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:55,129
I've been neglecting it's not gonna lie
it's kind of giving me like if

544
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:55,139
it's kind of giving me like if
 

545
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,689
it's kind of giving me like if
something's not going good in this team

546
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:56,699
something's not going good in this team
 

547
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,490
something's not going good in this team
I like to step back and think about it

548
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:58,500
I like to step back and think about it
 

549
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,449
I like to step back and think about it
for a bit and I've decided now I

550
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:01,459
for a bit and I've decided now I
 

551
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:04,030
for a bit and I've decided now I
definitely want to do some major

552
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,040
definitely want to do some major
 

553
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,840
definitely want to do some major
replanting with this because not that

554
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:08,850
replanting with this because not that
 

555
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,269
replanting with this because not that
this is necessarily bad what I was doing

556
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279
this is necessarily bad what I was doing
 

557
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,670
this is necessarily bad what I was doing
here but everything kind of feels dated

558
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
here but everything kind of feels dated
 

559
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,550
here but everything kind of feels dated
to me with this build and I would build

560
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
to me with this build and I would build
 

561
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,319
to me with this build and I would build
it differently but I was to redo it so

562
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:20,329
it differently but I was to redo it so
 

563
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:22,999
it differently but I was to redo it so
rather than continuing it and then be

564
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:23,009
rather than continuing it and then be
 

565
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:24,740
rather than continuing it and then be
unhappy we should just take a couple

566
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:24,750
unhappy we should just take a couple
 

567
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,920
unhappy we should just take a couple
steps back and replant some stuff I

568
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:27,930
steps back and replant some stuff I
 

569
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,240
steps back and replant some stuff I
think like the storage room for example

570
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,250
think like the storage room for example
 

571
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,090
think like the storage room for example
I did I did really like this storage

572
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:35,100
I did I did really like this storage
 

573
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,059
I did I did really like this storage
system at the time but now we have

574
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:37,069
system at the time but now we have
 

575
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:39,190
system at the time but now we have
trapped chests

576
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:39,200
trapped chests
 

577
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,380
trapped chests
and there's automatic sorting methods

578
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:41,390
and there's automatic sorting methods
 

579
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,850
and there's automatic sorting methods
and that kind of thing we could

580
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:42,860
and that kind of thing we could
 

581
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,970
and that kind of thing we could
definitely have a lot more fun if we

582
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:45,980
definitely have a lot more fun if we
 

583
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:51,220
definitely have a lot more fun if we
were to do something like that here I've

584
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,230
were to do something like that here I've
 

585
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,870
were to do something like that here I've
mentioned this before but I'm getting

586
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
mentioned this before but I'm getting
 

587
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,360
mentioned this before but I'm getting
sick of the symmetrical building style

588
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,370
sick of the symmetrical building style
 

589
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,910
sick of the symmetrical building style
I've been doing a lot of like like

590
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:00,920
I've been doing a lot of like like
 

591
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,750
I've been doing a lot of like like
there's my main problem with it is it

592
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:04,760
there's my main problem with it is it
 

593
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,579
there's my main problem with it is it
doesn't look different from other angles

594
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:06,589
doesn't look different from other angles
 

595
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,569
doesn't look different from other angles
like if I was to look here and then if I

596
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:10,579
like if I was to look here and then if I
 

597
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,280
like if I was to look here and then if I
was go to if I was to go to the other

598
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,290
was go to if I was to go to the other
 

599
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,840
was go to if I was to go to the other
side here it would be pretty much the

600
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:13,850
side here it would be pretty much the
 

601
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,090
side here it would be pretty much the
same thing I'm looking at like there's

602
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:16,100
same thing I'm looking at like there's
 

603
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,780
same thing I'm looking at like there's
no there's no character to it so we

604
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:19,790
no there's no character to it so we
 

605
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,680
no there's no character to it so we
should change that up not that some

606
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:23,690
should change that up not that some
 

607
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,840
should change that up not that some
symmetry is bad I do like some symmetry

608
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:25,850
symmetry is bad I do like some symmetry
 

609
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,310
symmetry is bad I do like some symmetry
in what I'm building but not this

610
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:27,320
in what I'm building but not this
 

611
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,810
in what I'm building but not this
perfect four quadrant circular thing we

612
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:31,820
perfect four quadrant circular thing we
 

613
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,050
perfect four quadrant circular thing we
got going here we need to change that

614
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,060
got going here we need to change that
 

615
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:39,070
got going here we need to change that
the mob system is actually good I think

616
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,080
the mob system is actually good I think
 

617
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,810
the mob system is actually good I think
we'll still use it but we might build a

618
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:40,820
we'll still use it but we might build a
 

619
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,430
we'll still use it but we might build a
second one and use this one if we want

620
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
second one and use this one if we want
 

621
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,100
second one and use this one if we want
to keep the mobs alive and use a second

622
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,110
to keep the mobs alive and use a second
 

623
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,410
to keep the mobs alive and use a second
one if we just want the item drops so it

624
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:50,420
one if we just want the item drops so it
 

625
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,080
one if we just want the item drops so it
will auto kill them and it will be a

626
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,090
will auto kill them and it will be a
 

627
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,670
will auto kill them and it will be a
higher efficiency one and you know

628
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:57,680
higher efficiency one and you know
 

629
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,590
higher efficiency one and you know
there's other stuff too like we were

630
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
there's other stuff too like we were
 

631
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,020
there's other stuff too like we were
putting ice underneath here and we don't

632
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,030
putting ice underneath here and we don't
 

633
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,170
putting ice underneath here and we don't
need to do this like we have beacons now

634
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:04,180
need to do this like we have beacons now
 

635
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,810
need to do this like we have beacons now
this is just like this gives you a speed

636

there was a lot of it's like it's a big
 

665
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,480
there was a lot of it's like it's a big
surface area so I got that all out just

666
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:49,490
surface area so I got that all out just
 

667
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,780
surface area so I got that all out just
the first step towards renovating I

668
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:51,790
the first step towards renovating I
 

669
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,240

don't know exactly how much I'm changing

670
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,250
don't know exactly how much I'm changing
 

671
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,100
don't know exactly how much I'm changing
it but probably quite a bit we might

672
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,110
it but probably quite a bit we might
 

673
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,290
it but probably quite a bit we might
even just completely redo the whole

674
00:18:59,290 --> 00:18:59,300
even just completely redo the whole
 

675
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,560
even just completely redo the whole
thing

676
00:18:59,560 --> 00:18:59,570
thing
 

677
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:06,390
thing
and maybe change the style as well I

678
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,400
and maybe change the style as well I
 

679
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,500
and maybe change the style as well I
really want to make something with

really want to make something with
 

681
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,940
really want to make something with
quartz so maybe we'll do I know quartz

682
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:12,950
quartz so maybe we'll do I know quartz
 

683
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,380
quartz so maybe we'll do I know quartz
another brick look really good together

684
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:14,390
another brick look really good together
 

685
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,360
another brick look really good together
so we might do that or we might do

686
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,370
so we might do that or we might do
 

687
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,320
so we might do that or we might do
quartz and sandstone and maybe a darker

688
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,330
quartz and sandstone and maybe a darker
 

689
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,570
quartz and sandstone and maybe a darker
block mixed in or I don't know exactly

block mixed in or I don't know exactly
 

691
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,580
block mixed in or I don't know exactly
what what we're going to do yet we won't

692
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:24,590
what what we're going to do yet we won't
 

693
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,510
what what we're going to do yet we won't
get too far into it but if you know a

694
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:28,520
get too far into it but if you know a
 

695
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,000
get too far into it but if you know a
good color combo for quartz blocks let

696
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,010
good color combo for quartz blocks let
 

697
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,810
good color combo for quartz blocks let
me know and we might go with that but

698
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:34,820
me know and we might go with that but
 

699
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,350
me know and we might go with that but
anyway moving on let's head back to the

anyway moving on let's head back to the
 

701
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,330
anyway moving on let's head back to the
other base and maybe do a little project

702
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:40,340
other base and maybe do a little project
 

703
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:46,590

there is a lot of wiring this way so it
 

793
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,560
there is a lot of wiring this way so it
would be tough to do that to make it go

794
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:29,570
would be tough to do that to make it go
 

795
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,370
would be tough to do that to make it go
to this part of the cave but it might be

796
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:33,380
to this part of the cave but it might be
 

797
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:42,659
to this part of the cave but it might be
possible what now I'm lost now I am lost

798
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:42,669
possible what now I'm lost now I am lost
 

799
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:46,049
possible what now I'm lost now I am lost
okay here we are underneath the stairs

800
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:46,059
okay here we are underneath the stairs
 

801
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:48,580
okay here we are underneath the stairs
but since that water has been there for

802
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:48,590
but since that water has been there for
 

803
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,650
but since that water has been there for
so long I can't upstairs anymore now

804
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:52,660
so long I can't upstairs anymore now
 

805
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,180
so long I can't upstairs anymore now
since that water is there for so long I

806
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,190
since that water is there for so long I
 

807
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,860
since that water is there for so long I
don't feel right it's getting rid of it

808
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:56,870
don't feel right it's getting rid of it
 

809
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,430
don't feel right it's getting rid of it
so what I want to do is try make that

810
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:00,440
so what I want to do is try make that
 

811
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,370
so what I want to do is try make that
work and maybe we'll have like a boat

812
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:03,380
work and maybe we'll have like a boat
 

813
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,380
work and maybe we'll have like a boat
access only area part of the base that

814
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:08,390
access only area part of the base that
 

815
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,970
access only area part of the base that
could be cool so maybe we'll try to get

816
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:09,980
could be cool so maybe we'll try to get
 

817
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,890
could be cool so maybe we'll try to get
the rest to spread over here and then

818
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:11,900
the rest to spread over here and then
 

819
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,960
the rest to spread over here and then
we'll start terraforming this a bit

820
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:15,970
we'll start terraforming this a bit
 

821
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:21,520
we'll start terraforming this a bit
we got Pistons up here so we want to if

822
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:21,530
we got Pistons up here so we want to if
 

823
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,500
we got Pistons up here so we want to if
we do have water down here we want to

824
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:23,510
we do have water down here we want to
 

825
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,250
we do have water down here we want to
cut down a little bit give it a little

826
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:26,260
cut down a little bit give it a little
 

827
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,790
cut down a little bit give it a little
more Headroom and we'll just see how

828
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:29,800
more Headroom and we'll just see how
 

829
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,850
more Headroom and we'll just see how
this goes and maybe we'll make it branch

830
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:32,860
this goes and maybe we'll make it branch
 

831
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,540
this goes and maybe we'll make it branch
off mmm where would we want it to branch

832
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:36,550
off mmm where would we want it to branch
 

833
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,520
off mmm where would we want it to branch
off maybe to branch off to the right

834
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:38,530
off maybe to branch off to the right
 

835
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:43,110
off maybe to branch off to the right
somehow um there's also all this space

836
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
somehow um there's also all this space
 

837
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,450
somehow um there's also all this space
here where I could put a bedroom or

838
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:45,460
here where I could put a bedroom or
 

839
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,370
here where I could put a bedroom or
something because I still haven't built

840
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:47,380
something because I still haven't built
 

841
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,200
something because I still haven't built
one of those I know there's that little

842
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,210
one of those I know there's that little
 

843
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,380
one of those I know there's that little
area at the top of the stairs there

844
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:52,390
area at the top of the stairs there
 

845
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,850
area at the top of the stairs there
where people keep telling me to put a

846
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:53,860
where people keep telling me to put a
 

847
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,450
where people keep telling me to put a
bedroom or a place for my bed but I

848
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:57,460
bedroom or a place for my bed but I
 

849
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,640
bedroom or a place for my bed but I
might want to do something fancy with

850
00:23:59,640 --> 00:23:59,650
might want to do something fancy with
 

851
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,650
might want to do something fancy with
that I'm not entirely sure yet Saul

852
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:01,660
that I'm not entirely sure yet Saul
 

853
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,870
that I'm not entirely sure yet Saul
wants an area where I can do some wiring

854
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:05,880
wants an area where I can do some wiring
 

855
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:13,140
wants an area where I can do some wiring
which would be over here oh okay I know

856
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,150
which would be over here oh okay I know
 

857
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,470
which would be over here oh okay I know
what that is that is my other storage

858
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:15,480
what that is that is my other storage
 

859
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:23,820
what that is that is my other storage
area there's nothing wrong with those no

860
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:23,830
area there's nothing wrong with those no
 

861
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,210
area there's nothing wrong with those no
blocks guys by the way it's just leaving

862
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:27,220
blocks guys by the way it's just leaving
 

863
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,880
blocks guys by the way it's just leaving
the world and coming back it does that

864
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:28,890
the world and coming back it does that
 

865
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:34,050
the world and coming back it does that
it's just an issue with no box Keane

866
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,060
it's just an issue with no box Keane
 

867
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:39,110
it's just an issue with no box Keane
updated let's go down at least one more

868
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
updated let's go down at least one more
 

869
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,470
updated let's go down at least one more
probably at least two more actually I

870
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,480
probably at least two more actually I
 

871
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,120
probably at least two more actually I
want the water to be at this level here

872
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,130
want the water to be at this level here
 

873
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,280
want the water to be at this level here
so water rate where I'm placing this

874
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,290
so water rate where I'm placing this
 

875
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,680
so water rate where I'm placing this
block I want that to be the surface and

876
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:52,690
block I want that to be the surface and
 

877
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,140
block I want that to be the surface and
make it come up to the stairs here I

878
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,150
make it come up to the stairs here I
 

879
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,020
make it come up to the stairs here I
think that would look cool if there was

880
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,030
think that would look cool if there was
 

881
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,700
think that would look cool if there was
water to the left of the stairs when you

882
00:24:59,700 --> 00:24:59,710
water to the left of the stairs when you
 

883
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:06,220
water to the left of the stairs when you
come down here

884
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,230

 

885
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,320

so yeah i'll terraform this a bit

886
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,330
so yeah i'll terraform this a bit
 

887
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,550
so yeah i'll terraform this a bit
off-camera and see where we get with it

888
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:11,560
off-camera and see where we get with it
 

889
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,570
off-camera and see where we get with it
okay so up here I also want a little bit

890
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:16,580
okay so up here I also want a little bit
 

891
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,110
okay so up here I also want a little bit
of grass over here not too much not too

892
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,120
of grass over here not too much not too
 

893
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,250
of grass over here not too much not too
much is something like that there'll be

894
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:24,260
much is something like that there'll be
 

895
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,020
much is something like that there'll be
a we need a boat dispenser could put one

896
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,030
a we need a boat dispenser could put one
 

897
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,490
a we need a boat dispenser could put one
over there maybe under the water

898
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:32,500
over there maybe under the water
 

899
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,060
over there maybe under the water
yeah then we get to this parts I guess

900
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,070
yeah then we get to this parts I guess
 

901
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,160
yeah then we get to this parts I guess
because we have the enchanting room up

902
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,170
because we have the enchanting room up
 

903
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,780
because we have the enchanting room up
there remember there's some Pistons I

904
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:40,790
there remember there's some Pistons I
 

905
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,810
there remember there's some Pistons I
got that covered now we'll actually want

906
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:43,820
got that covered now we'll actually want
 

907
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,630
got that covered now we'll actually want
the water at this level so that we can

908
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:46,640
the water at this level so that we can
 

909
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,210
the water at this level so that we can
have a three high clearance here because

910
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:49,220
have a three high clearance here because
 

911
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,680
have a three high clearance here because
if it's too high it's going to be really

912
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:50,690
if it's too high it's going to be really
 

913
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,780
if it's too high it's going to be really
crap feeling so we'll have the water at

914
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:52,790
crap feeling so we'll have the water at
 

915
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:59,140
crap feeling so we'll have the water at
this level actually we could keep going

916
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,150
this level actually we could keep going
 

917
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,230
this level actually we could keep going
here we might want to keep going and

918
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,240
here we might want to keep going and
 

919
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,650
here we might want to keep going and
make it go down eventually I want to

920
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:05,660
make it go down eventually I want to
 

921
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,840
make it go down eventually I want to
start working underneath all this stuff

922
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:07,850
start working underneath all this stuff
 

923
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,620
start working underneath all this stuff
like we have a heavily a downstairs area

924
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:11,630
like we have a heavily a downstairs area
 

925
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:17,590
like we have a heavily a downstairs area
we've never really reached yet so at

926
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
we've never really reached yet so at
 

927
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,780
we've never really reached yet so at
some point we might want to expand our

928
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:19,790
some point we might want to expand our
 

929
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,530
some point we might want to expand our
cave downwards and this water route

930
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:23,540
cave downwards and this water route
 

931
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:29,400
cave downwards and this water route
could be a good way of accessing it in

932
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:29,410
could be a good way of accessing it in
 

933
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,900
could be a good way of accessing it in
fact the original plan was to have a

934
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:31,910
fact the original plan was to have a
 

935
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,980
fact the original plan was to have a
pool water here and we might still do

936
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:35,990
pool water here and we might still do
 

937
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,450
pool water here and we might still do
that if we did that we could have like a

938
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:37,460
that if we did that we could have like a
 

939
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,850
that if we did that we could have like a
water elevator that shot up here from

940
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:39,860
water elevator that shot up here from
 

941
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:47,030
water elevator that shot up here from
the lower levels

942
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,040

 

943
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:53,490

hmm so basically what I'm doing here is

944
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:53,500
hmm so basically what I'm doing here is
 

945
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,700
hmm so basically what I'm doing here is
I'm trying to make layout little grassy

946
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:56,710
I'm trying to make layout little grassy
 

947
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm trying to make layout little grassy
area next to the river so we're all this

948
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,010
area next to the river so we're all this
 

949
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,460
area next to the river so we're all this
soil is that I'm placing oh what's up

950
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:02,470
soil is that I'm placing oh what's up
 

951
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:09,360
soil is that I'm placing oh what's up
here what is this oh this is behind the

952
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:09,370
here what is this oh this is behind the
 

953
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,510
here what is this oh this is behind the
enchanting room okay a little bit of a

954
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:12,520
enchanting room okay a little bit of a
 

955
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,310
enchanting room okay a little bit of a
cave there still yes for for grass and

956
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:17,320
cave there still yes for for grass and
 

957
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,720
cave there still yes for for grass and
reeds and that kind of thing maybe

958
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:18,730
reeds and that kind of thing maybe
 

959
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:22,800
reeds and that kind of thing maybe
flowers if I can get a tree or two in

960
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:22,810
flowers if I can get a tree or two in
 

961
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,890
flowers if I can get a tree or two in
that would look really cool too

962
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:25,900
that would look really cool too
 

963
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,620
that would look really cool too
then all this this area here is where

964
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:28,630
then all this this area here is where
 

965
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:34,230
then all this this area here is where
the water is going to be so much gravel

966
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,240
the water is going to be so much gravel
 

967
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,350
the water is going to be so much gravel
down here in my way it's terrible so I

968
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:40,360
down here in my way it's terrible so I
 

969
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,470
down here in my way it's terrible so I
guess we can try this out see how it

970
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:43,480
guess we can try this out see how it
 

971
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,420
guess we can try this out see how it
goes wait a second

972
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:47,430
goes wait a second
 

973
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,650
goes wait a second
it's going to be a lot easier to modify

974
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:49,660
it's going to be a lot easier to modify
 

975
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,390
it's going to be a lot easier to modify
it without the water and so I'm trying

976
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:51,400
it without the water and so I'm trying
 

977
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,810
it without the water and so I'm trying
to get it going to get that going we're

978
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:54,820
to get it going to get that going we're
 

979
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,010
to get it going to get that going we're
trying to get things figured out before

980
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:56,020
trying to get things figured out before
 

981
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,560
trying to get things figured out before
I do this part but we'll see how this

982
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:58,570
I do this part but we'll see how this
 

983
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,650
I do this part but we'll see how this
looks I'm going to make the water too

984
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:01,660
looks I'm going to make the water too
 

985
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:07,650
looks I'm going to make the water too
thick so if we break all these should

986
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:07,660
thick so if we break all these should
 

987
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,820
thick so if we break all these should
fill up pretty good I love ice blocks

988
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:11,830
fill up pretty good I love ice blocks
 

989
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,960
fill up pretty good I love ice blocks
man they're so cool all right get a

990
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:15,970
man they're so cool all right get a
 

991
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,790
man they're so cool all right get a
couple more in here OOP OOP and I'm just

992
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:20,800
couple more in here OOP OOP and I'm just
 

993
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,580
couple more in here OOP OOP and I'm just
placing all over the place

994
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:24,590

 

995
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:30,380

sweet just a couple more and that's

996
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:30,390
sweet just a couple more and that's
 

997
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,240
sweet just a couple more and that's
that's the bottom layer now we want it

998
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,250
that's the bottom layer now we want it
 

999
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:40,790
that's the bottom layer now we want it
to go up one more whoo smash be tough to

1000
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:40,800
to go up one more whoo smash be tough to
 

1001
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:48,830
to go up one more whoo smash be tough to
do yeah we'll do this I love like they

1002
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:48,840
do yeah we'll do this I love like they
 

1003
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,170
do yeah we'll do this I love like they
changed it now where you can create

1004
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:51,180
changed it now where you can create
 

1005
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,800
changed it now where you can create
source blocks on top of water blocks so

1006
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:53,810
source blocks on top of water blocks so
 

1007
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:58,250
source blocks on top of water blocks so
much much easier to fill water area like

1008
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:58,260
much much easier to fill water area like
 

1009
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:03,320
much much easier to fill water area like
this I'm going to make it come over to

1010
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,330
this I'm going to make it come over to
 

1011
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,960
this I'm going to make it come over to
the other edge see if we do a diagonal

1012
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:07,970
the other edge see if we do a diagonal
 

1013
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:16,960
the other edge see if we do a diagonal
here it's the easiest way of doing it

1014
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:16,970

 

1015
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:22,370

that now it should join right oh yeah

1016
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:22,380
that now it should join right oh yeah
 

1017
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,950
that now it should join right oh yeah
beautiful that is so cool

1018
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
beautiful that is so cool
 

1019
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:35,390
beautiful that is so cool
all right we got an empty spot here and

1020
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:35,400
all right we got an empty spot here and
 

1021
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,490
all right we got an empty spot here and
that was easy

1022
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:36,500
that was easy
 

1023
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,490
that was easy
that's that is so cool okay that's our

1024
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:40,500
that's that is so cool okay that's our
 

1025
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,030
that's that is so cool okay that's our
general water area

1026
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,040
general water area
 

1027
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,300
general water area
we'll definitely want some lights I'll

1028
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:47,310
we'll definitely want some lights I'll
 

1029
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,890
we'll definitely want some lights I'll
probably make this come out some more

1030
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:48,900
probably make this come out some more
 

1031
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:58,010
probably make this come out some more
yet as well see now this is the

1032
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:58,020
yet as well see now this is the
 

1033
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,340
yet as well see now this is the
challenging part trying to make a water

1034
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:00,350
challenging part trying to make a water
 

1035
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,890
challenging part trying to make a water
track to get up and down here in the

1036
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:03,900
track to get up and down here in the
 

1037
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:09,140
track to get up and down here in the
boats so don't really want flowing water

1038
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,150
boats so don't really want flowing water
 

1039
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,760
boats so don't really want flowing water
like we could do this but it would be

1040
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:10,770
like we could do this but it would be
 

1041
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:17,979
like we could do this but it would be
flowing

1042
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:17,989

 

1043
00:30:17,989 --> 00:30:19,789

tell you what I'm going to close this

1044
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:19,799
tell you what I'm going to close this
 

1045
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:20,720
tell you what I'm going to close this
off for now

1046
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:20,730
off for now
 

1047
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,729
off for now
I'll try lay out the icebox in a way

1048
00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:22,739
I'll try lay out the icebox in a way
 

1049
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:29,869
I'll try lay out the icebox in a way
that'll work and here is where we're at

1050
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:29,879
that'll work and here is where we're at
 

1051
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:31,580
that'll work and here is where we're at
I'll take you through it

1052
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:31,590
I'll take you through it
 

1053
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:36,019
I'll take you through it
I built a framework for my water here

1054
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:36,029
I built a framework for my water here
 

1055
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:37,930
I built a framework for my water here
that's what these ice blocks are about

1056
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:37,940
that's what these ice blocks are about
 

1057
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,419
that's what these ice blocks are about
and we're going to fill this in from the

1058
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:41,429
and we're going to fill this in from the
 

1059
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:43,580
and we're going to fill this in from the
bottom up and then we're going to melt

1060
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:43,590
bottom up and then we're going to melt
 

1061
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,190
bottom up and then we're going to melt
all the ice blocks still got to do a lot

1062
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,200
all the ice blocks still got to do a lot
 

1063
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,139
all the ice blocks still got to do a lot
of shaping too like I'm I'm going to try

1064
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:48,149
of shaping too like I'm I'm going to try
 

1065
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:52,249
of shaping too like I'm I'm going to try
put a tree here I believe there will

1066
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:52,259
put a tree here I believe there will
 

1067
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:54,200
put a tree here I believe there will
probably be a fork off in this water

1068
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,210
probably be a fork off in this water
 

1069
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,489
probably be a fork off in this water
somewhere as well I haven't decided

1070
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:55,499
somewhere as well I haven't decided
 

1071
00:30:55,499 --> 00:31:01,729
somewhere as well I haven't decided
where yeah so what we got to do take our

1072
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:01,739
where yeah so what we got to do take our
 

1073
00:31:01,739 --> 00:31:05,690
where yeah so what we got to do take our
ice see where's the bottom layer bottom

1074
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:05,700
ice see where's the bottom layer bottom
 

1075
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,229
ice see where's the bottom layer bottom
layer bottom layer bottom layer here

1076
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:08,239
layer bottom layer bottom layer here
 

1077
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:11,989
layer bottom layer bottom layer here
this is our bottom layer we're gonna

1078
00:31:11,989 --> 00:31:11,999
this is our bottom layer we're gonna
 

1079
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:21,820
this is our bottom layer we're gonna
flood this they're actually really

1080
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:21,830
flood this they're actually really
 

1081
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,560
flood this they're actually really
challenging to work work out the water

1082
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:24,570
challenging to work work out the water
 

1083
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,169
challenging to work work out the water
mechanics till all this hopefully it

1084
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:27,179
mechanics till all this hopefully it
 

1085
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:32,029
mechanics till all this hopefully it
turns out okay so that bottom is solid

1086
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:32,039
turns out okay so that bottom is solid
 

1087
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,859
turns out okay so that bottom is solid
then we go up another one and do the

1088
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:33,869
then we go up another one and do the
 

1089
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:38,299
then we go up another one and do the
same thing and the ice blocks are

1090
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:38,309
same thing and the ice blocks are
 

1091
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:40,789
same thing and the ice blocks are
holding the water in place for each

1092
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:40,799
holding the water in place for each
 

1093
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:50,149
holding the water in place for each
layer all right see is that right they

1094
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:50,159
layer all right see is that right they
 

1095
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,720
layer all right see is that right they
come out further and we need one there

1096
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:55,730
come out further and we need one there
 

1097
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,820
come out further and we need one there
okay so that's another layer I'm going

1098
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:58,830
okay so that's another layer I'm going
 

1099
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,979
okay so that's another layer I'm going
to get to the top here and then I'm

1100
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:00,989
to get to the top here and then I'm
 

1101
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:03,499
to get to the top here and then I'm
going to melt them all this one's

1102
00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:03,509
going to melt them all this one's
 

1103
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:09,499
going to melt them all this one's
actually really big layer the thing is I

1104
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:09,509
actually really big layer the thing is I
 

1105
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:11,239
actually really big layer the thing is I
can't put the ice blocks next to each

1106
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:11,249
can't put the ice blocks next to each
 

1107
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:12,769
can't put the ice blocks next to each
other like they have to be diagonally

1108
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:12,779
other like they have to be diagonally
 

1109
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:16,779
other like they have to be diagonally
like that otherwise when they melt

1110
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:16,789
like that otherwise when they melt
 

1111
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:19,430
like that otherwise when they melt
they're going to update each other and

1112
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:19,440
they're going to update each other and
 

1113
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,220
they're going to update each other and
it's all just gonna fall to pieces

1114
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:22,230
it's all just gonna fall to pieces
 

1115
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,560
it's all just gonna fall to pieces
which might be a big problem with this

1116
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:24,570
which might be a big problem with this
 

1117
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,270
which might be a big problem with this
I'm not sure like if an Enderman ever

I'm not sure like if an Enderman ever
 

1119
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,400
I'm not sure like if an Enderman ever
came down here and place the block next

1120
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,410
came down here and place the block next
 

1121
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:32,090
came down here and place the block next
to the water and updated it oh I would

1122
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:32,100
to the water and updated it oh I would
 

1123
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,650
to the water and updated it oh I would
be upset I tell ya but we'll see how it

1127
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,300
goes all right and the reason I want
this extra pushin area behind the ice is

1128
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,310
this extra pushin area behind the ice is
 

1129
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,860
this extra pushin area behind the ice is
so when we drive the boat up we don't

1130
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:45,870
so when we drive the boat up we don't
 

1131

hopefully it'll be a smooth smooth the
 

1135
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:56,510
hopefully it'll be a smooth smooth the
transition to come up here because it'll

1136
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:56,520
transition to come up here because it'll
 

1137
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,340
transition to come up here because it'll
be all this water cushion yeah this is

1138
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:01,350
be all this water cushion yeah this is
 

1139
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,660
be all this water cushion yeah this is
what it's like all filled up and now

1140
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:02,670
what it's like all filled up and now
 

1141
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,350
what it's like all filled up and now
oops

1142

oops
 

1143
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,200
oops
basically we just need to melt all these

1144
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,210
basically we just need to melt all these
 

1145
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,480
basically we just need to melt all these
ice blocks and it should be all done I

1146
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:10,490
ice blocks and it should be all done I
 

1147
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,680
ice blocks and it should be all done I
believe so we're going to put torches

1148
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:12,690
believe so we're going to put torches
 

1149
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,100
believe so we're going to put torches
next to the ice and try melt them as

1150
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,110
next to the ice and try melt them as
 

1151
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:24,620
next to the ice and try melt them as
quick as possible and I'll come back to

1152
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:24,630
quick as possible and I'll come back to
 

1153

00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,040
you once it's all done and hopefully it
doesn't get updated and see they're

1156
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,050
doesn't get updated and see they're
 

1157
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,670
doesn't get updated and see they're
starting to transform I will just have a

1158
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:31,680
starting to transform I will just have a
 

1159
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,300
starting to transform I will just have a
flow though all right that's right I

1160
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:35,310
flow though all right that's right I
 

1161
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,340
flow though all right that's right I
forgot about that hopefully it's not too

1162
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:37,350
forgot about that hopefully it's not too
 

1163
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:45,020

big of a deal all right guys here is our

1164
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,030
big of a deal all right guys here is our
 

1165
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,730
big of a deal all right guys here is our
water stream it looks pretty cool

1166
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:46,740
water stream it looks pretty cool
 

1167
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,880
water stream it looks pretty cool
actually I like it with the with the

1168
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:49,890
actually I like it with the with the
 

1169
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,190
actually I like it with the with the
flow aspect to it it looks neat but it

1170
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:52,200
flow aspect to it it looks neat but it
 

1171
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,680
flow aspect to it it looks neat but it
doesn't make that constant flowing water

1172
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:54,690
doesn't make that constant flowing water
 

1173
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:57,170
doesn't make that constant flowing water
sound which is also nice I don't know if

1174

it though because of this I forgot if
there's water below it that it'll do

1180
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,170
there's water below it that it'll do
 

1181
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,380
there's water below it that it'll do
that or near it

1182

00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,330
um the other thing is we should make
 

1185
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,350
um the other thing is we should make
another water stream a waterfall come to

1186
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:12,360
another water stream a waterfall come to
 

1187
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,119
another water stream a waterfall come to
here so it looks like this pond is being

1188
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:14,129
here so it looks like this pond is being
 

1189
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:16,399
here so it looks like this pond is being
filled up from somewhere because as it

1190
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:16,409
filled up from somewhere because as it
 

1191
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:18,550
filled up from somewhere because as it
is right now it looks a little strange

1192
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:18,560
is right now it looks a little strange
 

1193
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,460
is right now it looks a little strange

should add music to your montages that

1246
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:58,950
should add music to your montages that
 

1247
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,130
should add music to your montages that
makes them more interesting and besides

1248
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:01,140
makes them more interesting and besides
 

1249
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,040
makes them more interesting and besides
I and many others I'm sure would like to

1250
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,050
I and many others I'm sure would like to
 

1251
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,040
I and many others I'm sure would like to
know what kind of music you like I do

1252
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,050
know what kind of music you like I do
 

1253
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,230
know what kind of music you like I do
add music every once in a while to my

1254
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,240
add music every once in a while to my
 

1255
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,349
add music every once in a while to my
montages and pens uh uh how how the

1256
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:15,359
montages and pens uh uh how how the
 

1257
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,900
montages and pens uh uh how how the
montages work out I guess those quick

1258
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:17,910
montages work out I guess those quick
 

1259
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,760
montages work out I guess those quick
cut ones are really easy to put together
