there was a stair missing i don't know
when that happened but

122
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
when that happened but
 

123
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,430
when that happened but
uh i'm guessing it was affecting it for

124
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
uh i'm guessing it was affecting it for
 

125
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,589
uh i'm guessing it was affecting it for
a long time

126
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
a long time
 

127
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,910

i was looking at the numbers for
 

131
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,509
i was looking at the numbers for
like the probability and all that for

132
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
like the probability and all that for
 

133
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,790
like the probability and all that for
the different levels for bow

134
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
the different levels for bow
 

135
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,309
the different levels for bow
enchantments

136
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
enchantments
 

137
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,309
enchantments
and apparently you don't want to go over

138
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
and apparently you don't want to go over
 

139
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,150
and apparently you don't want to go over
level 41 otherwise

140
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
level 41 otherwise
 

141
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,790
level 41 otherwise
you're going to get something worse so

142
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
you're going to get something worse so
 

143
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,430
you're going to get something worse so
41

144
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
41
 

145
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,509
41
is the number to go for maximum

146
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
is the number to go for maximum
 

147
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,830
is the number to go for maximum
and i will skip ahead here

148
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840

 

149
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,070

that's still better than

164
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
that's still better than
 

165
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,270
that's still better than
any bow i had before so that's probably

166
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
any bow i had before so that's probably
 

167
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,390
any bow i had before so that's probably
the one we'll use for the dragon

168
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
the one we'll use for the dragon
 

169

00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
going by memory i think it is roughly at
 

555
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,750
going by memory i think it is roughly at
x negative 300 z 200

556
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
x negative 300 z 200
 

557
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,949

741
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,110

pretty sure

742
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120

 

743
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,190

on the record stopped no

744
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200

 

745
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:57,110

yes just barely in range of it

746
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120

 

747
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,510

this is one of the best songs

748
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520

 

749
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,270

um yeah we'll save that one for later

750
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280

 

751
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,710

get a little closer that one was really

752
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
get a little closer that one was really
 

753
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,190
get a little closer that one was really
far away

754
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200

 

755
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,430

it's going to be hard to hit

756
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440

 

757
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,510

so basically we just have to go all the

758
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
so basically we just have to go all the
 

759
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,430
so basically we just have to go all the
way around and shoot

760
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
way around and shoot
 

761
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,750
way around and shoot
all these things it's very challenging

762
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:33,760

 

763
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,950

very challenging to stay awake

764
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:40,960

 

765
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,150

oh come on this is actually pretty

766
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
oh come on this is actually pretty
 

767
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,390
oh come on this is actually pretty
challenging i'm not doing too well here

768
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
challenging i'm not doing too well here
 

769
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,630
challenging i'm not doing too well here
i need to get higher can't get the right

i need to get higher can't get the right
angle on it

772
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640

 

773
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,390

might be able to hit from here

774
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
might be able to hit from here
 

775
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,150
might be able to hit from here
so this is actually going to be my

776
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
so this is actually going to be my
 

777
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,830
so this is actually going to be my
second time killing the dragon

778
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
know if we will end up releasing video
 

807
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,390

809
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,830
of it or not
but it was going to be about five

810
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
but it was going to be about five
 

811
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,669
but it was going to be about five
episodes or so

812
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
episodes or so
 

813
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:54,950

a real real lp ish type thing

814
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960

 

815
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,430

but there were a few pretty funny

816
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:57,440
but there were a few pretty funny
 

817
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,230
but there were a few pretty funny
moments in it

818
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
moments in it
 

819
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,909
moments in it
so hopefully we'll get at least some

820
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
so hopefully we'll get at least some
 

821
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,390
so hopefully we'll get at least some
video out of it

822
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
video out of it
 

823
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,870
video out of it
and they work they do work awesome i

824
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:04,880
and they work they do work awesome i
 

825
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,950
and they work they do work awesome i
think that i think they damaged the

826
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:06,960
think that i think they damaged the
 

827
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,669
think that i think they damaged the
dragon too

828
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:09,679
dragon too
 

829
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,590
dragon too
i don't know how much probably not a

830
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:11,600
i don't know how much probably not a
 

831
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,789
i don't know how much probably not a
whole lot

832
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:14,799

 

833
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,830

got it

834
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840

 

835
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,630

we should go revamp the jukebox

836
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:24,640

 

837
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,029

so for the fight i'm going to switch to

838
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:27,039
so for the fight i'm going to switch to
 

839
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,270
so for the fight i'm going to switch to
my powerboat

840
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280

 

841
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,510

swoop down any moment

842
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:35,520
swoop down any moment
 

843
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,350
swoop down any moment
missed yeah i think we just about got

844
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:39,360
missed yeah i think we just about got
 

845
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:48,230
missed yeah i think we just about got
all these

846
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
all these
 

847
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,270
all these
i think this would be about 100 times

848
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,280
i think this would be about 100 times
 

849
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,190
i think this would be about 100 times
more entertaining if the dragon actually

850
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,200
more entertaining if the dragon actually
 

851
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,029
more entertaining if the dragon actually
shot something at you or blew fire or

852
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039
shot something at you or blew fire or
 

853
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,310
shot something at you or blew fire or
did something

854
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,320
did something
 

855
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,270
did something
though and there's code in the game to

856
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
though and there's code in the game to
 

857
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,110
though and there's code in the game to
make mobs do that kind of stuff

858
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
make mobs do that kind of stuff
 

859
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:09,350
make mobs do that kind of stuff
but whatever

860
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,360

 

861
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,590

because he actually has range on you so

all right one thing i'm thinking with
 

937
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,430

00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
these snow golems
 

939
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,510

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,520
i've never tried them before but i think
 

941
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,870
i've never tried them before but i think
it's possible they

942
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:26,880
it's possible they
 

943
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,870
it's possible they
might uh start attacking the enderman

944
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:30,880
might uh start attacking the enderman
 

945
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,029
might uh start attacking the enderman
and then all the endermen might go after

946
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,039
and then all the endermen might go after
 

947
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,710
and then all the endermen might go after
me instead of them i'm not sure

948
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:36,720
me instead of them i'm not sure
 

949
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,990
me instead of them i'm not sure
if that's the case i will

950
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
if that's the case i will
 

951
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,470
if that's the case i will
be in a lot of trouble here because i'll

952
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
be in a lot of trouble here because i'll
 

953
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,510
be in a lot of trouble here because i'll
have

954
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:43,520

955
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,870

00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:48,880

 

957
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,470

but they might target the snow golems i

958
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
but they might target the snow golems i
 

959
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,590
but they might target the snow golems i

time this i don't know if we can

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:17,600

 

1157
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,470

have to try to

1158
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:22,480
have to try to
 

1159
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:29,350
have to try to
get him on a swoop

1160
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360

 

1161
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,230

because he kind of hovers above the
 

1165
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,350

1169
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,789

so he's most of the time going to be out

1170
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:48,799
so he's most of the time going to be out
 

1171
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:56,789
so he's most of the time going to be out

1173
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,950

00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:58,960
you can increase your chances by laying
 

1175
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,070
you can increase your chances by laying

down more
 

1177
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:09,669

the long pathway we have going to it
 

1277
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:52,550
the long pathway we have going to it
from a distance

1278
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:52,560

 

1279
00:34:52,560 --> 00:35:02,230

still don't see it maybe it's this side

1280
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,240
still don't see it maybe it's this side

it right next to the enderman farm
 

1285
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:05,510
it right next to the enderman farm
though

but just on
 

1289
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,829
but just on
the side of the island it's at at least

1290
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:11,839
the side of the island it's at at least
 

1291
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,030
the side of the island it's at at least
we can make a railroad track or

1292
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,040
we can make a railroad track or
 

1293
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,030
we can make a railroad track or
eats road or something to get from the

1294

eats road or something to get from the
 

1295
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,550
eats road or something to get from the
island to the enderman farm there it is

1296
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:20,560
island to the enderman farm there it is
 

1297
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,390
island to the enderman farm there it is
okay so maybe around here would be good

music or sound effect
that's the portal that'll let us go from

1334
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:27,520
that's the portal that'll let us go from
 

1335
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,870
that's the portal that'll let us go from
here to

1336
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:30,880

 

1337
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,069

the regular world or whatever back and

1338
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:34,079
the regular world or whatever back and
 

1339
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:34,950
the regular world or whatever back and
forth

1340
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:34,960
forth
 

1341
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,069
forth
and yeah i forgot my diamonds and

1342

otherwise it would did the enchanting

1344
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:39,839
otherwise it would did the enchanting
 

1345
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,670
otherwise it would did the enchanting
here

1346
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:41,680
here
 

1347
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,310
here
because otherwise you waste quite a bit

1348
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:44,320
because otherwise you waste quite a bit
 

1349
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,950
because otherwise you waste quite a bit
of xp

1350
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:44,960
of xp
 

1351
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,069
of xp
doing it two big enchantments at once

1352
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:48,079
doing it two big enchantments at once
 

1353
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,670
doing it two big enchantments at once
instead of doing getting like 50 xp

1354
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:51,680
instead of doing getting like 50 xp
 

1355
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,069
instead of doing getting like 50 xp
then collecting more

1356
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:56,079

 

1357
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,310

cool and there's the egg

1358
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:00,320
cool and there's the egg
 

1359
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,470

1364
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,160
i'm gonna try make a platform for it
 

1365
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,069
i'm gonna try make a platform for it
down here

1366
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:16,079

 

1367
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,470

hopefully i do it right not that it
 

1377
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,390
hopefully i do it right not that it

1378
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,400
matters much it's just
 

1379
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,630
matters much it's just
an ornamental thing

00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:49,520

 

1489
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:57,270

sounds like it's raining

1490
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:57,280

 

1491
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,430

cool

1492
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:01,440

 

1493
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,710

i thought it stopped for a second

1494
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:04,720
i thought it stopped for a second
 

1495
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,069
i thought it stopped for a second
oh yeah and then you guys can see how to

1496
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:06,079
oh yeah and then you guys can see how to
 

1497
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,750
oh yeah and then you guys can see how to
get back did i bring more

1498
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:09,760
get back did i bring more
 

1499
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,109
get back did i bring more
i did awesome we might run a part of the

1500
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:13,119
i did awesome we might run a part of the
 

1501
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,710
i did awesome we might run a part of the
way too

1502
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:14,720
way too
 

1503
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,069
way too
so we head this way

1504
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:20,079
so we head this way
 

1505
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,630
so we head this way
ideally throw it at a 45 degree angle i

1506
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:22,640
ideally throw it at a 45 degree angle i
 

1507
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,069
ideally throw it at a 45 degree angle i
would assume

1508
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:26,079

 

1509
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,829

does two and a half hearts damage every

1510
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:27,839
does two and a half hearts damage every
 

1511
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,990
does two and a half hearts damage every
time so

1512
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,000

 

1513
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,030

okay we are at uh 7.75

1514
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,040
okay we are at uh 7.75
 

1515
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,589
okay we are at uh 7.75
let's see how far this takes us with one

1516
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:37,599
let's see how far this takes us with one
 

1517
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,910
let's see how far this takes us with one
pearl

1518
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:39,920
pearl
 

1519
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,950
pearl
at roughly a 45.

1520
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:44,960

 

1521
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,710

775 726 so roughly 50 blocks every

1522
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:48,720
775 726 so roughly 50 blocks every
 

1523
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,750
775 726 so roughly 50 blocks every
every throw that's pretty good

1524
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:51,760
every throw that's pretty good
 

1525
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,069
every throw that's pretty good
it does take a little bit of time to

1526
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:54,079
it does take a little bit of time to
 

1527
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,829
it does take a little bit of time to
land

1528
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:55,839
land
 

1529
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,829
land
uh speed two potions are probably still

1530
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:00,839

 

1531
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:08,630

faster

1532
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:08,640

 

1533
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,589

yeah actually i think running is quicker

1534
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:11,599
yeah actually i think running is quicker
 

1535
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,190
yeah actually i think running is quicker
too bad

1536
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:17,200
too bad
 

1537
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,030
too bad
speed two is definitely quicker

1538
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,040

 

1539
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,790

just because it takes so long for the

1540
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:22,800
just because it takes so long for the
 

1541
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,829
just because it takes so long for the
pearls to land

1542
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:28,839

 

1543
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,829

hmm actually we can test this let's

1544
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:31,839
hmm actually we can test this let's
 

1545
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:32,870
hmm actually we can test this let's
throw

1546
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:32,880
throw
 

1547
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,390
throw
let's see who gets there first

1548
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:36,400
let's see who gets there first
 

1549
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,710
let's see who gets there first
i think it is quicker actually yeah

1550
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:40,720

 

1551
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:48,470

of course oh my goodness

1552
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:48,480

 

1553
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,990

105 levels down the drain i

1554
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,000
105 levels down the drain i
 

1555
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,069
105 levels down the drain i
