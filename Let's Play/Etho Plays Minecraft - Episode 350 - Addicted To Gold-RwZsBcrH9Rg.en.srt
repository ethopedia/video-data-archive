hatred against the end stone I couldn't
believe it I really think I I might just

364
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,040
believe it I really think I I might just
 

365
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,180

00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:32,970
my opinion but not many people share
 

373
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,020
my opinion but not many people share
that apparently so I tried changing here

374
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,030
that apparently so I tried changing here
 

375
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,340

I put some nether brick a lot of people

376
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:40,350
I put some nether brick a lot of people

a lot of you guys weren't too happy with
 

379
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
a lot of you guys weren't too happy with
the whole thing though so I'm probably

380
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:44,850
the whole thing though so I'm probably
 

381
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,840
the whole thing though so I'm probably
gonna have to rethink what I'm doing

382
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:47,850
gonna have to rethink what I'm doing
 

383
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,850
gonna have to rethink what I'm doing
here which I'm not doing today by the

384
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:49,860
here which I'm not doing today by the
 

385
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,950
here which I'm not doing today by the
way don't don't you worry yeah so here's

386
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:54,960
way don't don't you worry yeah so here's
 

387
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,620
way don't don't you worry yeah so here's
the thing I wanted to do this style the

388
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:57,630
the thing I wanted to do this style the
 

389
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,780
the thing I wanted to do this style the
ruins because I thought it would be easy

390
00:10:59,780 --> 00:10:59,790
ruins because I thought it would be easy
 

391
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,290
ruins because I thought it would be easy
I thought it would save me time that I

392
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:03,300
I thought it would save me time that I
 

393
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,650
I thought it would save me time that I
could build something that's like I want

394
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:06,660
could build something that's like I want
 

395
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,110
could build something that's like I want
something that looks organic that that's

396
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
something that looks organic that that's
 

397
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,460
something that looks organic that that's
not symmetrical that I that each thing I

398
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:13,470
not symmetrical that I that each thing I
 

399
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,090
not symmetrical that I that each thing I
build is gonna look different basically

400
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:16,100
build is gonna look different basically
 

401
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,090
build is gonna look different basically
which this definitely accomplishes and I

402
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,100
which this definitely accomplishes and I
 

403
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,920
which this definitely accomplishes and I
was hoping it would be quick and easy to

404
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:21,930
was hoping it would be quick and easy to
 

405
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,300
was hoping it would be quick and easy to
build I just throw a bunch of blocks

406
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:23,310
build I just throw a bunch of blocks
 

407
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,950
build I just throw a bunch of blocks
down doesn't matter if it's messy

408
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:24,960
down doesn't matter if it's messy
 

409
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,610
down doesn't matter if it's messy
because it's it's wrecked it's ruined

410
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:27,620
because it's it's wrecked it's ruined
 

411
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,860
because it's it's wrecked it's ruined
but no everybody's telling me I have to

412
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:32,870
but no everybody's telling me I have to
 

413
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,140
but no everybody's telling me I have to
build a proper stretcher all perfect and

414
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,150
build a proper stretcher all perfect and
 

415
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,830
build a proper stretcher all perfect and
nice whoops I killed it it's trying to

416
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:39,840
nice whoops I killed it it's trying to
 

417
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,150
nice whoops I killed it it's trying to
point there we go yeah I got to build a

418
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
point there we go yeah I got to build a
 

419
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,300
point there we go yeah I got to build a
structure all nice and then I

420
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,310
structure all nice and then I
 

421
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,270
structure all nice and then I
very carefully destroy it and and make

422
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:50,280
very carefully destroy it and and make
 

423
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,250
very carefully destroy it and and make
it look like it's liked it was wrecked

424
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:52,260
it look like it's liked it was wrecked
 

425
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,640
it look like it's liked it was wrecked
and and weathered and so basically I got

426
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:55,650
and and weathered and so basically I got
 

427
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,000
and and weathered and so basically I got
to build the structure tear it down

428
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,010
to build the structure tear it down
 

429
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,200
to build the structure tear it down
that's not really what I want to do

430
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,210
that's not really what I want to do
 

431
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,670
that's not really what I want to do
that's the opposite of what I'm trying

432
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
that's the opposite of what I'm trying
 

433
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,810
that's the opposite of what I'm trying
to do that's that's extra work I don't

434
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:05,820
to do that's that's extra work I don't
 

435
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,200
to do that's that's extra work I don't
really want to I want like I want to

436
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,210
really want to I want like I want to
 

437
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,330
really want to I want like I want to
build a lot of stuff really quickly

438
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:11,340
build a lot of stuff really quickly
 

439
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,450
build a lot of stuff really quickly
basically and I'm gonna have to rethink

440
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:14,460
basically and I'm gonna have to rethink
 

441
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,550
basically and I'm gonna have to rethink
of how to do that because I don't think

442
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
of how to do that because I don't think
 

443
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,070
of how to do that because I don't think
the ruins at least that way of doing

444
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,080
the ruins at least that way of doing
 

445
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,130
the ruins at least that way of doing
them is gonna work anyway

446
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:22,140
them is gonna work anyway
 

447
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,770
them is gonna work anyway
let's head on back to the build

448
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:26,780
let's head on back to the build
 

449
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,360
let's head on back to the build
all right cool so things are going

450
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,370
all right cool so things are going
 

451
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,460
all right cool so things are going
really good here guys I am over halfway

452
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:31,470
really good here guys I am over halfway
 

453
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,360
really good here guys I am over halfway
done and this is a tough half to putting

454
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,370
done and this is a tough half to putting
 

455
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:40,700
done and this is a tough half to putting
down all these rails so many rails so

456
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:40,710
down all these rails so many rails so
 

457
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,500
down all these rails so many rails so
yeah that's that's the main cost of this

458
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:42,510
yeah that's that's the main cost of this
 

459
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,330
yeah that's that's the main cost of this
whole thing you have I have about

460
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:44,340
whole thing you have I have about
 

461
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,840
whole thing you have I have about
thousand rails here and that's like 16

462
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:47,850
thousand rails here and that's like 16
 

463
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,440
thousand rails here and that's like 16
stacks and also we're gonna get neat

464
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,450
stacks and also we're gonna get neat
 

465
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,840
stacks and also we're gonna get neat
about a stack of iron blocks to make the

466
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:53,850
about a stack of iron blocks to make the
 

467
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,310
about a stack of iron blocks to make the
iron golems later but then nothing but

468
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
iron golems later but then nothing but
 

469
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,650
iron golems later but then nothing but
gold from there on out down below nice a

in the nether you can't see it when you

478
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:11,670
in the nether you can't see it when you
 

479

487
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,330
up like that all right and now I'm gonna
test out the carts I'm hoping we can get

488
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:26,340
test out the carts I'm hoping we can get
 

489
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:32,090
test out the carts I'm hoping we can get
away with just one minecarts these guys

490
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,100
away with just one minecarts these guys
 

491
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,580
away with just one minecarts these guys
are all in the way though it has to make

492
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:34,590
are all in the way though it has to make
 

493
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,890
are all in the way though it has to make
the trip there and back think within

494
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:36,900
the trip there and back think within
 

495
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,610
the trip there and back think within
five minutes for this to really work

496
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:39,620
five minutes for this to really work
 

497
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,250
five minutes for this to really work
if it takes longer we will need to

498
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:42,260
if it takes longer we will need to
 

499
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:49,600
if it takes longer we will need to
minecarts and these guys are kind of in

500
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:49,610
minecarts and these guys are kind of in
 

501
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,830
minecarts and these guys are kind of in
the way now don't really want to anger

502
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:53,840
the way now don't really want to anger
 

503

00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,100
helps a lot alright cool so second layer
 

509
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,550
helps a lot alright cool so second layer
I decided I would make out of this white

510
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:09,560
I decided I would make out of this white
 

511
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,800
I decided I would make out of this white
stain clay because I have a bunch of it

512
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:11,810
stain clay because I have a bunch of it
 

513
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,840
stain clay because I have a bunch of it
from the Mesa biome that's already white

514
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:13,850
from the Mesa biome that's already white
 

515
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,540
from the Mesa biome that's already white
and in the nether I want something that

516
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:16,550
and in the nether I want something that
 

517
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,870
and in the nether I want something that
stands out nice and bright so we will

518
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:19,880
stands out nice and bright so we will
 

519
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,190
stands out nice and bright so we will
put this over top and here let's let's

520
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,200
put this over top and here let's let's
 

521
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,710
put this over top and here let's let's
test up the head here we'll throw some

522
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
test up the head here we'll throw some
 

523
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,560
test up the head here we'll throw some
stuff on top and make sure it picks it

524
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:29,570
stuff on top and make sure it picks it
 

525
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,170
stuff on top and make sure it picks it
up through the blocks otherwise we're

526
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:32,180
up through the blocks otherwise we're
 

527
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,360
up through the blocks otherwise we're
gonna have a lot of trouble and I'm

528
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,370
gonna have a lot of trouble and I'm
 

529
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,340
gonna have a lot of trouble and I'm
gonna feel really dumb that I wasted all

530
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,350
gonna feel really dumb that I wasted all
 

531
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,580
gonna feel really dumb that I wasted all
this time on something that doesn't work

532
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:41,590

 

533
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,820

alright
 

535
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,120
alright
oh I may as well remove them they'll be

536
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,130
oh I may as well remove them they'll be
 

537
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,690
oh I may as well remove them they'll be
in the way otherwise so I'm gonna

538
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:48,700
in the way otherwise so I'm gonna
 

539
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,120
in the way otherwise so I'm gonna
continue on here guys looks like it made

540
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,130
continue on here guys looks like it made
 

541
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,110
continue on here guys looks like it made
half the trip already that felt like a

542
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,120
half the trip already that felt like a
 

543
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,320
half the trip already that felt like a
minute or two so it'll be really close

544
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,330
minute or two so it'll be really close
 

545
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:25,620
minute or two so it'll be really close
oh this is not gonna end well for me

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:25,630

 

547
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:33,070

take you all on I realized it's probably

548
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:33,080
take you all on I realized it's probably
 

549
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,230
take you all on I realized it's probably
easier to place the blocks going this

550
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:35,240
easier to place the blocks going this
 

551
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,640
easier to place the blocks going this
this way instead of horizontally and

552
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:38,650
this way instead of horizontally and
 

553
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:44,920
this way instead of horizontally and
yeah much quicker much easier

554
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:44,930

fine well that's gonna be a funny
 

611
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,960
fine well that's gonna be a funny
sheet-iron Golan if I do that okay so

612
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:47,970
sheet-iron Golan if I do that okay so
 

613
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,390
sheet-iron Golan if I do that okay so
yeah as oh and good we're getting

yeah as oh and good we're getting
zombies actually kind of wanted them I

616
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:53,510
zombies actually kind of wanted them I
 

617
00:17:53,510 --> 00:18:00,350
zombies actually kind of wanted them I
figured we would get them yes as as we

618
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:00,360
figured we would get them yes as as we
 

619
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,790
figured we would get them yes as as we
set the stuff up maybe I'll explain a

620
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:01,800
set the stuff up maybe I'll explain a
 

621
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,470
set the stuff up maybe I'll explain a
few things about how this works

622
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:03,480
few things about how this works
 

623
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,410
few things about how this works
so this farm does not work in 1.7 I'm

624
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:09,420
so this farm does not work in 1.7 I'm
 

625
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,720
so this farm does not work in 1.7 I'm
pretty sure I haven't tried the latest

626
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:11,730
pretty sure I haven't tried the latest
 

627
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,070
pretty sure I haven't tried the latest
like 1.7.10 but it doesn't work because

628
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
like 1.7.10 but it doesn't work because
 

629
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,930
like 1.7.10 but it doesn't work because
the zombie pigmen will kill the iron

630
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:17,940
the zombie pigmen will kill the iron
 

631
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,130
the zombie pigmen will kill the iron
golems which isn't good because then you

632
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:22,140
golems which isn't good because then you
 

633
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,440
golems which isn't good because then you
got to either heal them up or replace

634
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,450
got to either heal them up or replace
 

635
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,290
got to either heal them up or replace
them which costs tons of iron in the

636
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:27,300
them which costs tons of iron in the
 

637
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,010
them which costs tons of iron in the
snapshots though for some reason the

638
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,020
snapshots though for some reason the
 

639
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,930
snapshots though for some reason the
zombie pigmen do not attack the iron

640
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:32,940
zombie pigmen do not attack the iron
 

641
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,310
zombie pigmen do not attack the iron
golems anymore they have new AI which is

642
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,320
golems anymore they have new AI which is
 

643
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,850
golems anymore they have new AI which is
probably the reason for that and also

644
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:40,860
probably the reason for that and also
 

645
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,420
probably the reason for that and also
the zombies don't the gas don't and the

646
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:44,430
the zombies don't the gas don't and the
 

647
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,210
the zombies don't the gas don't and the
magma tubes all of which get farmed in

648
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:47,220
magma tubes all of which get farmed in
 

649
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,190
magma tubes all of which get farmed in
here will not attack the iron golems

650
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
here will not attack the iron golems
 

651
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,770
here will not attack the iron golems
that might change in the future though

652
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:51,780
that might change in the future though
 

653
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,080
that might change in the future though
so I don't exactly recommend other

654
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,090
so I don't exactly recommend other
 

655
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,870
so I don't exactly recommend other
people build this farm you can if you

656
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
people build this farm you can if you
 

657
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,660
people build this farm you can if you
want you can see we also get XP from it

658
00:18:59,660 --> 00:18:59,670
want you can see we also get XP from it
 

659
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:07,040
want you can see we also get XP from it
which is kind of cool least I think we

660
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,050
which is kind of cool least I think we
 

661
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,710
which is kind of cool least I think we
do I don't think we did before so I

662
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:09,720
do I don't think we did before so I
 

663
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,270
do I don't think we did before so I
think that's a new change with this

664
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,280
think that's a new change with this
 

665
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,800
think that's a new change with this
current snapshot I'm using although it

666
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:15,810
current snapshot I'm using although it
 

667
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,440
current snapshot I'm using although it
might stop now that they aren't a grow

668
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:18,450
might stop now that they aren't a grow
 

669
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,690
might stop now that they aren't a grow
or something yeah that one didn't drop

670
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:20,700
or something yeah that one didn't drop
 

671
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,330
or something yeah that one didn't drop
any or did he

672
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:23,340
any or did he
 

673
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,720
any or did he
oh yeah you're still dropping okay

674
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:26,730
oh yeah you're still dropping okay
 

675
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,440
oh yeah you're still dropping okay
that's good if I want to pick it up but

676
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,450
that's good if I want to pick it up but
 

677
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,380
that's good if I want to pick it up but
for most of the time I have to stand up

678
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,390
for most of the time I have to stand up
 

679
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,690
for most of the time I have to stand up
on that platform there I built and while

680
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:35,700
on that platform there I built and while
 

681
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,730
on that platform there I built and while
I stand there I will automatically just

682
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:37,740
I stand there I will automatically just
 

683
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,530
I stand there I will automatically just
get gold essentially oh yeah I'm like

684
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:42,540
get gold essentially oh yeah I'm like
 

685
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,020

man you guys are doing a good job they

686
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,030
man you guys are doing a good job they
 

687
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,450
man you guys are doing a good job they
killed all the Pigman why why are they

688
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:47,460
killed all the Pigman why why are they
 

689
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,310
killed all the Pigman why why are they
so efficient it's cuz none responding

690
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,320
so efficient it's cuz none responding
 

691
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,930

while I'm down here so maybe we'll just

692
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:50,940
while I'm down here so maybe we'll just
 

693
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,390
while I'm down here so maybe we'll just
get a few of these guys going and we'll

694
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:53,400
get a few of these guys going and we'll
 

695
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,570
get a few of these guys going and we'll
go up to our little hideaway there and

696
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:56,580
go up to our little hideaway there and
 

697
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,620
go up to our little hideaway there and
watch things happen

698
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:57,630
watch things happen
 

699
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,040
watch things happen
apparently zombie pigman also break down

700
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,050
apparently zombie pigman also break down
 

701
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,630
apparently zombie pigman also break down
wooden doors which I did not realize

702
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:02,640
wooden doors which I did not realize
 

703
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,410
wooden doors which I did not realize
that's something new I learned today

704
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:05,420
that's something new I learned today
 

705
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,010
that's something new I learned today
because they shared the zombie

706
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:09,020
because they shared the zombie
 

707
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,320
because they shared the zombie
characteristics I guess they don't

708
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,330
characteristics I guess they don't
 

709
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,180
characteristics I guess they don't
always do it though just occasionally

710
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,190
always do it though just occasionally
 

711
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,190
always do it though just occasionally
alright so now we can see them doing

712
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
alright so now we can see them doing
 

713
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,510
alright so now we can see them doing
their job zombie Pigman spawn super

714
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,520
their job zombie Pigman spawn super
 

715
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,160
their job zombie Pigman spawn super
quickly

716
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,170
quickly
 

717
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,270
quickly
you thought gasps here and there

718
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:28,280
you thought gasps here and there
 

719
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,890
you thought gasps here and there
although it's not as quick as I thought

720
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:30,900
although it's not as quick as I thought
 

721
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,280
although it's not as quick as I thought
why why is it taking a while yeah I

722
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,290
why why is it taking a while yeah I
 

723
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,730
why why is it taking a while yeah I
guess that's about right we are way up

724
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:37,740
guess that's about right we are way up
 

725
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,630
guess that's about right we are way up
in the nether here we're at like 250 so

726
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:41,640
in the nether here we're at like 250 so
 

727
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,180
in the nether here we're at like 250 so
that prevents any land below it like I'm

728
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,190
that prevents any land below it like I'm
 

729
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,000
that prevents any land below it like I'm
above the bedrock layer that prevents

730
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,010
above the bedrock layer that prevents
 

731
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,060
above the bedrock layer that prevents
any mob spawning down below in the

732
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,070
any mob spawning down below in the
 

733
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,790
any mob spawning down below in the
nether so they all will spawn within the

734
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:52,800
nether so they all will spawn within the
 

735
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,760
nether so they all will spawn within the
trap here yes very good they don't

736
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:58,770
trap here yes very good they don't
 

737
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,040
trap here yes very good they don't
actually go after the gas they only

738
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,050
actually go after the gas they only
 

739
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,010
actually go after the gas they only
attack them if the gas is in between

740
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,020
attack them if the gas is in between
 

741
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,350
attack them if the gas is in between
their target pigment is the way it works

742
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:08,360
their target pigment is the way it works
 

743
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,580
their target pigment is the way it works
they're doing a pretty good job keeping

744
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:10,590
they're doing a pretty good job keeping
 

745
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,680
they're doing a pretty good job keeping
things under control I may be a little

746
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:12,690
things under control I may be a little
 

747
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,380
things under control I may be a little
too close here still I never actually

748
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:15,390
too close here still I never actually
 

749
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,730
too close here still I never actually
measured that's probably all the golems

750
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:19,740
measured that's probably all the golems
 

751
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:25,460
measured that's probably all the golems
we need actually alright anyway so as

752
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:25,470
we need actually alright anyway so as
 

753
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:30,830
we need actually alright anyway so as
that goes on let's head on down

754
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:30,840

 

755
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,869

of course we have that hopper minecart

756
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:32,879
of course we have that hopper minecart
 

757
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:35,840
of course we have that hopper minecart
running below in its zig-zag pattern and

758
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:35,850
running below in its zig-zag pattern and
 

759
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,960
running below in its zig-zag pattern and
that's picking up all the all the drops

760
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:38,970
that's picking up all the all the drops
 

761
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,720
that's picking up all the all the drops
as it goes by and I changed it so

762
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:41,730
as it goes by and I changed it so
 

763
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,639
as it goes by and I changed it so
instead of doing a zig zag bat it just

764
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:43,649
instead of doing a zig zag bat it just
 

765
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:46,820
instead of doing a zig zag bat it just
does a straight line back and goes here

766
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:46,830
does a straight line back and goes here
 

767
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,480
does a straight line back and goes here
and when I built this I made sure I

768
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,490
and when I built this I made sure I
 

769
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,489
and when I built this I made sure I
could take advantage of the Southwest

770
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:52,499
could take advantage of the Southwest
 

771
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:54,409
could take advantage of the Southwest
rule here with the track so when this

772
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:54,419
rule here with the track so when this
 

773
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:58,989
rule here with the track so when this
minecart comes by it will go this way

774
00:21:58,989 --> 00:21:58,999
minecart comes by it will go this way
 

775
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:04,129
minecart comes by it will go this way
towards the unloader is that because I

776
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:04,139
towards the unloader is that because I
 

777
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:05,720
towards the unloader is that because I
killed a few I hope we don't get swords

778
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:05,730
killed a few I hope we don't get swords
 

779
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,759
killed a few I hope we don't get swords
from this although if we get sorts we

780
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:07,769
from this although if we get sorts we
 

781
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:09,109
from this although if we get sorts we
get gold ingots we're gonna be bad

782
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:09,119
get gold ingots we're gonna be bad
 

783
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,940
get gold ingots we're gonna be bad
either yeah so this is a basic unloader

784
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:13,950
either yeah so this is a basic unloader
 

785
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,369
either yeah so this is a basic unloader
we got a comparator up to a torch and

786
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:16,379
we got a comparator up to a torch and
 

787
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:18,889
we got a comparator up to a torch and
that powers this block and this redstone

788
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:18,899
that powers this block and this redstone
 

789
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:22,399
that powers this block and this redstone
dust which controls this this power rail

790
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:22,409
dust which controls this this power rail
 

791
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:24,830
dust which controls this this power rail
you have to do hopper and then chest

792
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
you have to do hopper and then chest
 

793
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,690
you have to do hopper and then chest
below it for that to really work though

794
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:26,700
below it for that to really work though
 

795
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,940
below it for that to really work though
if you do hopper hopper it doesn't

796
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:28,950
if you do hopper hopper it doesn't
 

797
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:33,399
if you do hopper hopper it doesn't
because this comparator doesn't turn on

798
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:33,409

 

799
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:39,129

now looking pretty good so we'll maybe

800
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:39,139
now looking pretty good so we'll maybe
 

801
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:43,519
now looking pretty good so we'll maybe
also i will i built this by the way i

802
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:43,529
also i will i built this by the way i
 

803
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:47,060
also i will i built this by the way i
started building this at y 224 it

804
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,070
started building this at y 224 it
 

805
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,980
started building this at y 224 it
doesn't matter too much what layer you

806
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:48,990
doesn't matter too much what layer you
 

807
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:54,440
doesn't matter too much what layer you
build it as long as you afk high enough

808
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:54,450
build it as long as you afk high enough
 

809
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,239
build it as long as you afk high enough
that stuff isn't spawning down in the

that stuff isn't spawning down in the
 

811
00:22:56,249 --> 00:23:01,840
that stuff isn't spawning down in the
nether below and I will upgrade the

812
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:01,850
nether below and I will upgrade the
 

813
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,009

my world just in case you were curious
because I never showed like getting here

824
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:20,039
because I never showed like getting here

because I never showed like getting here
so the these are the four beacons they

826
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:23,879
so the these are the four beacons they
 

827
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:25,549

00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:31,399
the nether so they're really red here
and down below this is the hole we made

832
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:31,409
and down below this is the hole we made
 

833
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:35,239
and down below this is the hole we made
in the ceiling a little while ago up at

834
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:35,249
in the ceiling a little while ago up at
 

835
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:36,700
in the ceiling a little while ago up at
the nether fortress

836

the nether fortress
 

837
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,359
the nether fortress
Oh usually I just enderpearl down and

838

this is the wither skeleton farm and you

840
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:44,360
this is the wither skeleton farm and you
 

841
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,980
this is the wither skeleton farm and you
can hear I'm running around somewhere

842
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:47,990

 

843
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,710

it's pretty funny like just like going

844
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
it's pretty funny like just like going
 

845
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,230
it's pretty funny like just like going
back and forth like collect supplies and

846
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:53,240
back and forth like collect supplies and
 

847
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,440
back and forth like collect supplies and
then going up there to to work on

848
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:56,450
then going up there to to work on
 

849
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,539
then going up there to to work on
building I had to make like five trips

850
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:58,549
building I had to make like five trips
 

851
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:00,730
building I had to make like five trips
back and forth between here I got four

852
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:00,740
back and forth between here I got four
 

853
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,759
back and forth between here I got four
with wither skeleton heads so we're up

854
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:03,769
with wither skeleton heads so we're up
 

855
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:06,789
with wither skeleton heads so we're up
to eight again the main reason for the

856
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:06,799
to eight again the main reason for the
 

857
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,440
to eight again the main reason for the
gold firm up here by the way is to make

858
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:11,450
gold firm up here by the way is to make
 

859
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,419
gold firm up here by the way is to make
beacons I want lots and lots of beacons

860
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:13,429
beacons I want lots and lots of beacons
 

861
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:16,090
beacons I want lots and lots of beacons
so I'm gonna use the gold blocks for

862
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,100
so I'm gonna use the gold blocks for
 

863
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,330
so I'm gonna use the gold blocks for
those and also for power rails if I ever

864
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:19,340
those and also for power rails if I ever
 

865
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,840
those and also for power rails if I ever
need power rails for things this will do

866
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:22,850
need power rails for things this will do
 

867
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,739
need power rails for things this will do
the trick nicely

868
00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:23,749
the trick nicely
 

869
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:29,619
the trick nicely
oh no look what look what I found here I

870
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:29,629
oh no look what look what I found here I
 

871
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:33,609
oh no look what look what I found here I
heard some zombie pigmen grumbling when

872
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:33,619
heard some zombie pigmen grumbling when
 

873
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:36,700
heard some zombie pigmen grumbling when
I was on the nether sealing here so I'll

874
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:36,710
I was on the nether sealing here so I'll
 

875
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,489
I was on the nether sealing here so I'll
have to probably slab out this cave it's

876
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:39,499
have to probably slab out this cave it's
 

877
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:41,950
have to probably slab out this cave it's
really really close to the roof and my

878
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:41,960
really really close to the roof and my
 

879
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,119
really really close to the roof and my
farm and I might get slightly better

880
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:46,129
farm and I might get slightly better
 

881
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:57,180
farm and I might get slightly better
rates whoa no no there was a hole there

882
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,190

 

883
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,799

okay here comes a minecart we're gonna

884
00:24:59,799 --> 00:24:59,809
okay here comes a minecart we're gonna
 

885
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:02,340
okay here comes a minecart we're gonna
do a test to your guys I have an idea

886
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:02,350
do a test to your guys I have an idea
 

887
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,289
do a test to your guys I have an idea
you see there's no gold ingots no gold

888
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:05,299
you see there's no gold ingots no gold
 

889
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:08,649
you see there's no gold ingots no gold
swords or anything that's a rare drop in

890
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:08,659
swords or anything that's a rare drop in
 

891
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:13,259
swords or anything that's a rare drop in
the minecart right now I also checked

892
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:13,269
the minecart right now I also checked
 

893
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:15,730
the minecart right now I also checked
the ground here there's none on the

894
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:15,740
the ground here there's none on the
 

895
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,239
the ground here there's none on the
ground anywhere so since we're getting

896
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:19,249
ground anywhere so since we're getting
 

897
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:22,989
ground anywhere so since we're getting
XP from these iron golems I'm pretty

898
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:22,999
XP from these iron golems I'm pretty
 

899
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:25,090
XP from these iron golems I'm pretty
sure it's because I own them and they

900
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,100
sure it's because I own them and they
 

901
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,850
sure it's because I own them and they
count as mine so if I have my looting

902
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:30,860
count as mine so if I have my looting
 

903
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,639
count as mine so if I have my looting
sword selected while I afk up here I'm

904
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:33,649
sword selected while I afk up here I'm
 

905
00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:36,159
sword selected while I afk up here I'm
guessing we're gonna get rare drops and

906
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:36,169
guessing we're gonna get rare drops and
 

907
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:40,600
guessing we're gonna get rare drops and
extra like lots extra gold nuggets and

908
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:40,610
extra like lots extra gold nuggets and
 

909
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,440
extra like lots extra gold nuggets and
stuff from from the mobs as well so I'm

910
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:44,450
stuff from from the mobs as well so I'm
 

911
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,299
stuff from from the mobs as well so I'm
gonna let them do their thing for a

912
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:46,309
gonna let them do their thing for a
 

913
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:48,920
gonna let them do their thing for a
little bit here

914
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:48,930
little bit here
 

915
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,670
little bit here
maybe next time there's no gas if that's

916
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:52,680
maybe next time there's no gas if that's
 

917
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,280
maybe next time there's no gas if that's
possible we will hop down there and

918
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,290
possible we will hop down there and
 

919
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,890
possible we will hop down there and
check if there's anything rare on the

920
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:57,900
check if there's anything rare on the
 

921
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:05,420
check if there's anything rare on the
ground or in the chest oh is this it is

922
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:05,430
ground or in the chest oh is this it is
 

923
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,200
ground or in the chest oh is this it is
this it

924
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,210
this it
 

925
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,780
this it
kill that gas so I can go check thank

926
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:08,790
kill that gas so I can go check thank
 

927
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:11,630
kill that gas so I can go check thank
you I've been up here forever and

928
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:11,640
you I've been up here forever and
 

929
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,720
you I've been up here forever and
there's been a guest the whole time so

930
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:13,730
there's been a guest the whole time so
 

931
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:18,140
there's been a guest the whole time so
lots of oh look I see it already

932
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,150
lots of oh look I see it already
 

933
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,630
lots of oh look I see it already
Goulding get on the ground you would not

934
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640
Goulding get on the ground you would not
 

935
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,310
Goulding get on the ground you would not
be able to get that if it was just the

936
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,320
be able to get that if it was just the
 

937
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,050
be able to get that if it was just the
standard kill so they're counting as my

938
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:24,060
standard kill so they're counting as my
 

939
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:29,150
standard kill so they're counting as my
kills and I guess it's kind of hard to

940
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:29,160
kills and I guess it's kind of hard to
 

941
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,860
kills and I guess it's kind of hard to
prove though if I'm getting the looting

942
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:30,870
prove though if I'm getting the looting
 

943
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,700
prove though if I'm getting the looting
effect

944
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:31,710
effect
 

945
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,910
effect
um is there more than one guest here

946
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:34,920
um is there more than one guest here
 

947
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,150
um is there more than one guest here
here that would prove it now it's just

948
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,160
here that would prove it now it's just
 

949
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:49,690
here that would prove it now it's just
one just one hmm let's see

950
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:49,700

 

951
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,910

little guy pretty sure I'm getting the

iron ore the gold ingots on the ground
 

957
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,820
iron ore the gold ingots on the ground
just by having the looting sword

958
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:58,830
just by having the looting sword
 

959
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,600
just by having the looting sword
selected while I'm up there which is

pretty cool okay you know what this
 

963
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,320
pretty cool okay you know what this
should actually be pretty easy to figure

964
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:09,330
should actually be pretty easy to figure
 

965
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,390
should actually be pretty easy to figure
out now that I think of it cuz zombie

966
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:11,400
out now that I think of it cuz zombie
 

967
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,120
out now that I think of it cuz zombie
Pigman will only drop at most one rotten

968
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,130
Pigman will only drop at most one rotten
 

969
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:21,280
Pigman will only drop at most one rotten
flesh and one nugget so if we see a

970
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,290
flesh and one nugget so if we see a
 

971
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,900
flesh and one nugget so if we see a
stack drop from one of these it looks

972
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:23,910
stack drop from one of these it looks
 

973
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,260
stack drop from one of these it looks
like more than one has fallen

974
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:26,270
like more than one has fallen
 

975
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,820
like more than one has fallen
that means the looting sword is having

976
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:28,830
that means the looting sword is having
 

977
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,740
that means the looting sword is having
an effect

978
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:30,750
an effect
 

979
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,669
an effect
it looks like it's only one each time

980
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:34,679
it looks like it's only one each time
 

981
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:40,889
it looks like it's only one each time
yeah so I doubt it is actually yeah okay

982
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:40,899
yeah so I doubt it is actually yeah okay
 

983
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:43,009
yeah so I doubt it is actually yeah okay
so looting sword not doing anything I

984
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:43,019
so looting sword not doing anything I
 

985
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:45,389
so looting sword not doing anything I
thought it was GRU for a moment there

986
00:27:45,389 --> 00:27:45,399
thought it was GRU for a moment there
 

987
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:46,740
thought it was GRU for a moment there
because we were getting so many rare

988
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:46,750
because we were getting so many rare
 

989

to know another reason I wanted the

994
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:55,539
to know another reason I wanted the
 

995
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:57,779
to know another reason I wanted the
zombies to spawn is because I'm pretty

996
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:57,789
zombies to spawn is because I'm pretty
 

997
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:59,399
zombies to spawn is because I'm pretty
sure we will be able to get a zombie

998
00:27:59,399 --> 00:27:59,409
sure we will be able to get a zombie
 

999
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:02,940
sure we will be able to get a zombie

very much fun so yeah that might come in
 

1013
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:25,850
very much fun so yeah that might come in
handy okay here comes the minecart guys

1014
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:25,860
handy okay here comes the minecart guys
 

1015
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,289
handy okay here comes the minecart guys
there's another problem with this I just

1016
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:28,299
there's another problem with this I just
 

1017
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:31,919
there's another problem with this I just
realized oh it was fine this time a lot

1018
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:31,929
realized oh it was fine this time a lot
 

1019
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:33,659
realized oh it was fine this time a lot
of the times though this Mike Kurt will

1020
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:33,669
of the times though this Mike Kurt will
 

1021
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:35,399
of the times though this Mike Kurt will
pick up a bunch of gold swords like

1022
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:35,409
pick up a bunch of gold swords like
 

1023
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:38,639
pick up a bunch of gold swords like
right away and it takes up all the slots

1024
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:38,649
right away and it takes up all the slots
 

1025
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:40,710
right away and it takes up all the slots
and then it doesn't pick up anything

1026
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:40,720
and then it doesn't pick up anything
 

1027
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,149
and then it doesn't pick up anything
else off the ground so yeah that's a

1028
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:45,159
else off the ground so yeah that's a
 

1029
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:47,639
else off the ground so yeah that's a
problem for sure the only way to really

1030
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:47,649
problem for sure the only way to really
 

1031
00:28:47,649 --> 00:28:49,470
problem for sure the only way to really
deal with that is to have like I'm

1032
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:49,480
deal with that is to have like I'm
 

1033
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,389
deal with that is to have like I'm
guessing you would need about ten of

1034
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:51,399
guessing you would need about ten of
 

1035
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:53,669
guessing you would need about ten of
these going at the same time then you

1036
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:53,679
these going at the same time then you
 

1037
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,310
these going at the same time then you
got a deal with like them crashing into

1038
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
got a deal with like them crashing into
 

1039
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,519
got a deal with like them crashing into
each other and so I've had another idea

1040
00:28:59,519 --> 00:28:59,529
each other and so I've had another idea
 

1041
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,490
each other and so I've had another idea
on a possible way of dealing with this

1042
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:02,500
on a possible way of dealing with this
 

1043
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,419
on a possible way of dealing with this
we are gonna take all the drops we want

1044
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:05,429
we are gonna take all the drops we want
 

1045
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:09,060
we are gonna take all the drops we want
primarily so we're gonna take nuggets

1046
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,070
primarily so we're gonna take nuggets
 

1047
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,529
primarily so we're gonna take nuggets
gasps tears I guess zombie flesh gold

1048
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:13,539
gasps tears I guess zombie flesh gold
 

1049
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:16,039
gasps tears I guess zombie flesh gold
ingots of course are really good and

1050
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:16,049
ingots of course are really good and
 

1051
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:19,860
ingots of course are really good and
probably don't need magma cream I think

1052
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:19,870
probably don't need magma cream I think
 

1053
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:24,049
probably don't need magma cream I think
the only other thing we get is gunpowder

1054
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:24,059

 

1055
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,710

yeah so

1056
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:26,720
yeah so
 

1057
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,080
yeah so
I have made like an injection type of

1058
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,090
I have made like an injection type of
 

1059
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,639
I have made like an injection type of
system here all these hoppers we got

1060
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:30,649
system here all these hoppers we got
 

1061
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:32,889
system here all these hoppers we got
five hoppers one for each slot in the

1062
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:32,899
five hoppers one for each slot in the
 

1063
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:35,469
five hoppers one for each slot in the
the hopper minecart and we're gonna

1064
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:35,479
the hopper minecart and we're gonna
 

1065
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:38,019
the hopper minecart and we're gonna
force it to pick up one of these as it

1066
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:38,029
force it to pick up one of these as it
 

1067
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:41,680
force it to pick up one of these as it
passes by so it'll pick up one nugget

1068
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:41,690
passes by so it'll pick up one nugget
 

1069
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:48,789
passes by so it'll pick up one nugget
one gold ingots zombie flesh one guest

1070
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:48,799
one gold ingots zombie flesh one guest
 

1071
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,820
one gold ingots zombie flesh one guest
here and one gun powder and then as it

1072
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:51,830
here and one gun powder and then as it
 

1073
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,519
here and one gun powder and then as it
makes its trip and pick up up to sixty

1074
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:54,529
makes its trip and pick up up to sixty
 

1075
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:56,950
makes its trip and pick up up to sixty
four of those on its way and hopefully

1076
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:56,960
four of those on its way and hopefully
 

1077
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,909
four of those on its way and hopefully
that will deal with the problem okay may

1078
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:03,919
that will deal with the problem okay may
 

1079
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,830
that will deal with the problem okay may
need to mine cards because I think I've

1080
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
need to mine cards because I think I've
 

1081
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,169
need to mine cards because I think I've
seen it come back with over a stack of

1082
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:08,179
seen it come back with over a stack of
 

1083
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:13,210
seen it come back with over a stack of
Nuggets before and I can't create I

1084
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:13,220
Nuggets before and I can't create I
 

1085
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,219
Nuggets before and I can't create I
can't create two slots for the Nuggets

1086
00:30:15,219 --> 00:30:15,229
can't create two slots for the Nuggets
 

1087
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:17,289
can't create two slots for the Nuggets
because if I put nuggets in this one and

1088
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:17,299
because if I put nuggets in this one and
 

1089
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:18,789
because if I put nuggets in this one and
nuggets in this one it's just gonna put

1090
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:18,799
nuggets in this one it's just gonna put
 

1091
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,139
nuggets in this one it's just gonna put
two in one slot in the minecarts anyway

1092
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:23,149
two in one slot in the minecarts anyway
 

1093
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:25,419
two in one slot in the minecarts anyway
just thought I would point that out as

let's check out the statistics here um

1132
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:28,570
let's check out the statistics here um
 

1133
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,210
let's check out the statistics here um
again I don't know when these were last

1134
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:31,220
again I don't know when these were last
 

1135
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,879
again I don't know when these were last
reset because before I believe the

1136
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:33,889
reset because before I believe the
 

1137
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:36,519
reset because before I believe the
statistics accumulated throughout

1138
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:36,529
statistics accumulated throughout
 

1139
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:38,589

different worlds and that one off

1140
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:38,599
different worlds and that one off
 

1141
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,770
different worlds and that one off
totally and then I think they got reset

1142
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:40,780
totally and then I think they got reset
 

1143
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,140
totally and then I think they got reset
and now they're bound to just a single

1144
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,150
and now they're bound to just a single
 

1145
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,540
and now they're bound to just a single
world so from whenever that reset was I

1146
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:45,550
world so from whenever that reset was I
 

1147
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:51,120
world so from whenever that reset was I
think this is accurate 14 days compared

1148
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,130

1149
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:59,070
think this is accurate 14 days compared
to day 4450 according to this just quite

1150
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,080
to day 4450 according to this just quite
 

1151
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,920
to day 4450 according to this just quite

1153
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,660
a bit that I don't know how much time

1154
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:03,670
that actually is though because each day
 

1155
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,280
that actually is though because each day
