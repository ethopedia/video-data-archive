lie and yeah they fall down three and a
 

57
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,789
lie and yeah they fall down three and a
half blocks they'll walk off on their

58
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:01,799
half blocks they'll walk off on their
 

59
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,730
half blocks they'll walk off on their
own at that that's the maximum distance

60
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:04,740
own at that that's the maximum distance
 

61
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,819
own at that that's the maximum distance
they will fall and they'll actually take

62
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:07,829
they will fall and they'll actually take
 

63
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,620
they will fall and they'll actually take
damage from that

64
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:11,630

 

65
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,790

what I was just working on is setting up

66
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:15,800
what I was just working on is setting up
 

67
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,550
what I was just working on is setting up
the trapdoor thing here - how does he

68
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:19,560
the trapdoor thing here - how does he
 

69
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:27,500
the trapdoor thing here - how does he
walk over that till the walls and I'll

70
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:27,510
walk over that till the walls and I'll
 

71
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,110
walk over that till the walls and I'll
have lava underneath or fire it's a real

72
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
have lava underneath or fire it's a real
 

73
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,240
have lava underneath or fire it's a real
pain trying to wire these four doors

74
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,250
pain trying to wire these four doors
 

75
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,200
pain trying to wire these four doors
though because I have four sets of

76
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,210
though because I have four sets of
 

77
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,920
though because I have four sets of
double doors right next to it but

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:41,930
double doors right next to it but
 

79
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,960
double doors right next to it but
somehow managed to do it by having

80
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:46,970
somehow managed to do it by having
 

81
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,900
somehow managed to do it by having
sneaking in this redstone torch here

82
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:49,910
sneaking in this redstone torch here
 

83
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,740
sneaking in this redstone torch here
opens and closes all four of them the

84
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:54,750
opens and closes all four of them the
 

85
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,860
opens and closes all four of them the
only downside is I have to have exposed

86
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:57,870
only downside is I have to have exposed
 

87
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,530
only downside is I have to have exposed
wires above here so I got to run a wire

88
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:03,540
wires above here so I got to run a wire
 

89
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,430
wires above here so I got to run a wire
to the back there and attach to that

90
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
to the back there and attach to that
 

91
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:15,440
to the back there and attach to that
block there so out here and I'll hook up

92
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:15,450
block there so out here and I'll hook up
 

93
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,060
block there so out here and I'll hook up
the kill switch to here I guess

94
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,070

 

95
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,140

shouldn't be too hard

96
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,150

 

97
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,410

you know a lot of people comment about

98
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:26,420
you know a lot of people comment about
 

99
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,649
you know a lot of people comment about
the way I say lava am I saying it wrong

100
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:29,659
the way I say lava am I saying it wrong
 

101
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:32,080
the way I say lava am I saying it wrong
or what because I sometimes hear people

102
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,090
or what because I sometimes hear people
 

103
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:38,080
or what because I sometimes hear people
say lava like la wva is that the right

104
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,090
say lava like la wva is that the right
 

105
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,170
say lava like la wva is that the right
way of saying it some people say larva

106
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:41,180
way of saying it some people say larva
 

107
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,210
way of saying it some people say larva
kind of British people and yeah I'm just

108
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:46,220
kind of British people and yeah I'm just
 

109
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,099
kind of British people and yeah I'm just
kind of curious about that I always

110
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:48,109
kind of curious about that I always
 

111
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:51,369
kind of curious about that I always
thought I said it proper but maybe I

112
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:51,379
thought I said it proper but maybe I
 

113
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:56,289
thought I said it proper but maybe I
don't actually after looking at this

114
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:56,299
don't actually after looking at this
 

115
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:00,119
don't actually after looking at this
again since my levers about over there

116
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:00,129
again since my levers about over there
 

117
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,339
again since my levers about over there
I'd rather have the wiring and closer to

118
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:03,349
I'd rather have the wiring and closer to
 

119
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:06,390
I'd rather have the wiring and closer to
this side instead of on the back side so

120
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
this side instead of on the back side so
 

121
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,300
this side instead of on the back side so
I think I can just place a redstone

122
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,310
I think I can just place a redstone
 

123
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,750
I think I can just place a redstone
torch here yeah and it doesn't interfere

124
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:16,760
torch here yeah and it doesn't interfere
 

125
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,010
torch here yeah and it doesn't interfere
with these doors I don't think

126
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,020

 

127
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:29,410

let's Merc that spots I'll have to run

128
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:29,420

 

129
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,530

mmm
 

131
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,660
mmm
although I will have to put wiring under

132
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:32,670
although I will have to put wiring under
 

133
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:38,620
although I will have to put wiring under
water that might be a little strange

134
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:38,630

 

135
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:48,820

no idea okay so the lever is a excuse me
over there two blocks in should be under

152
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:23,630
over there two blocks in should be under
 

153
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:34,870
over there two blocks in should be under
here then I think that's it so I need to

154
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
here then I think that's it so I need to
 

155
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,990
here then I think that's it so I need to
run

156
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,000
run
 

157
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,850
run
sure wish this wiring was in here just

158
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:39,860
sure wish this wiring was in here just
 

159
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:46,870
sure wish this wiring was in here just
gonna make this a lot harder run a

160
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
gonna make this a lot harder run a
 

161
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,290
gonna make this a lot harder run a
redstone there run back up turn it on

162
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:50,300
redstone there run back up turn it on
 

163
00:05:50,300 --> 00:06:00,520
redstone there run back up turn it on
make sure that's the right spot yeah

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:00,530
make sure that's the right spot yeah
 

165
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,110
make sure that's the right spot yeah
it's on good okay I probably have to get

166
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
it's on good okay I probably have to get
 

167
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,010
it's on good okay I probably have to get
rid of this move this over one

168
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:11,020
rid of this move this over one
 

169
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:21,719
rid of this move this over one
and then start going down yeah don't you

170
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:21,729
and then start going down yeah don't you
 

171
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:35,309
and then start going down yeah don't you
guys just love redstone wiring something

172
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:35,319
guys just love redstone wiring something
 

173
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:42,450
guys just love redstone wiring something
like that look at all these animals this

174
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:42,460
like that look at all these animals this
 

175
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,540
like that look at all these animals this
is so annoying why did I built this

176
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:45,550
is so annoying why did I built this
 

177
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:55,909
is so annoying why did I built this
thing I built an annoying machine okay

178
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
thing I built an annoying machine okay
 

179
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:11,000
thing I built an annoying machine okay
it's dumb wire comes down keep going

180
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,010

 

181
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,050

yeah we're just gonna have to run it one

182
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,060
yeah we're just gonna have to run it one
 

183
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,170
yeah we're just gonna have to run it one
block over I like to try to always keep

184
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:16,180
block over I like to try to always keep
 

185
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,170
block over I like to try to always keep
my wiring as compact as I can but you

186
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:19,180
my wiring as compact as I can but you
 

187
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,490
my wiring as compact as I can but you
know sometimes it's just easier to make

188
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:23,500
know sometimes it's just easier to make
 

189
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:30,090
know sometimes it's just easier to make
it a little bit bigger and I'll need a

190
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,100
it a little bit bigger and I'll need a
 

191
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:39,740
it a little bit bigger and I'll need a
repeater somewhere in here right there

192
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:39,750

 

193
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,280

and you still have to make this go out

194
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,290
and you still have to make this go out
 

195
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,690
and you still have to make this go out
the other way didn't work it was

196
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:45,700
the other way didn't work it was
 

197
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,490
the other way didn't work it was
interfering with the double doors after

198
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:47,500
interfering with the double doors after
 

199
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,450
interfering with the double doors after
all so I had to go back to going around

200
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:51,460
all so I had to go back to going around
 

201
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,620
all so I had to go back to going around
the back so there's a redstone torch on

202
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:55,630
the back so there's a redstone torch on
 

203
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,990
the back so there's a redstone torch on
the other side of this block and that

204
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,000
the other side of this block and that
 

205
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,610
the other side of this block and that
should do it so I just need a repeater

206
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:02,620
should do it so I just need a repeater
 

207
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,770
should do it so I just need a repeater
in here and then we'll try it out yeah

208
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:07,780
in here and then we'll try it out yeah
 

209
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,540
in here and then we'll try it out yeah
there's actually a lot of wiring under

210
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:09,550
there's actually a lot of wiring under
 

211
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:15,420
there's actually a lot of wiring under
here get a repeater you hurt them shut

212
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:15,430
here get a repeater you hurt them shut
 

213
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,520
here get a repeater you hurt them shut
they're a little bit so I think it's

214
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:20,530
they're a little bit so I think it's
 

215
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:30,590
they're a little bit so I think it's
already Oh guys just so annoying

216
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:30,600

 

217
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,110

okay oh yeah I'm gonna replace the wood

218
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,120
okay oh yeah I'm gonna replace the wood
 

219
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:43,400
okay oh yeah I'm gonna replace the wood
here yet hey they're closed they're open

220
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:43,410
here yet hey they're closed they're open
 

221
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:48,600
here yet hey they're closed they're open
doors are still open yeah that works

222
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:48,610
doors are still open yeah that works
 

223
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,930
doors are still open yeah that works
let's see if they interfere all right

224
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:51,940
let's see if they interfere all right
 

225
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,460
let's see if they interfere all right
now they're closed and they're open and

226
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:56,470
now they're closed and they're open and
 

227
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,110
now they're closed and they're open and
the double doors are still closed so

228
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,120
the double doors are still closed so
 

229
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,430
the double doors are still closed so
that's exactly what we want may as well

230
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:02,440
that's exactly what we want may as well
 

231
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,490
that's exactly what we want may as well
put a light there

232
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:05,500

 

233
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,640

little indicator lights there so now we

234
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:09,650
little indicator lights there so now we
 

235
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:15,060
little indicator lights there so now we
can choose to kill them here if we want

236
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,070
can choose to kill them here if we want
 

237
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,710
can choose to kill them here if we want
so that's pretty cool oh yeah I need to

238
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:20,720
so that's pretty cool oh yeah I need to
 

239
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,890
so that's pretty cool oh yeah I need to
put the lavend right

240
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:25,900

 

241
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,640

probably just have

242
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:29,650

 

243
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:35,870

locks up the here and I think I can I

244
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:35,880
locks up the here and I think I can I
 

245
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,100
locks up the here and I think I can I
think I might be able to fill this in

246
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,110
think I might be able to fill this in
 

247
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:44,610
think I might be able to fill this in
actually yeah I think I can't so I can

248
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:44,620
actually yeah I think I can't so I can
 

249
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,420
actually yeah I think I can't so I can
put blocks here here

250
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:48,430

 

251
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:55,769

all the way around and then blocks up

252
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:55,779
all the way around and then blocks up
 

253
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:58,269
all the way around and then blocks up
and I don't think that will interfere in

254
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:58,279
and I don't think that will interfere in
 

255
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,400
and I don't think that will interfere in
any way and when you just fill that in

256
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:00,410
any way and when you just fill that in
 

257
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,000
any way and when you just fill that in
flava I could use fire and not have to

258
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,010
flava I could use fire and not have to
 

259
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,940
flava I could use fire and not have to
worry about it spreading to the wood

260
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:06,950
worry about it spreading to the wood
 

261
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,810
worry about it spreading to the wood
here but I hate that sound fire makes

262
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:09,820
here but I hate that sound fire makes
 

263
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,210
here but I hate that sound fire makes
with a passion it's ok once in a while

264
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:13,220
with a passion it's ok once in a while
 

265
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,829
with a passion it's ok once in a while
but when it's going all the time it's so

266
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:14,839
but when it's going all the time it's so
 

267
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:24,130
but when it's going all the time it's so
annoying and hopefully I never have to

268
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:24,140
annoying and hopefully I never have to
 

269
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,680
annoying and hopefully I never have to
rewire any of this because that would

270
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:26,690
rewire any of this because that would
 

271
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,090
rewire any of this because that would
suck ok so good it's gonna change the

272
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:31,100
suck ok so good it's gonna change the
 

273
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,940
suck ok so good it's gonna change the
wood and it should be good to go

274
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:35,950

 

275
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,780

such a pretty view this is like my Lunar

276
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:40,790
such a pretty view this is like my Lunar
 

277
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,699
such a pretty view this is like my Lunar
biome what I'm that's what I'm gonna

278
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:45,709
biome what I'm that's what I'm gonna
 

279
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,519
biome what I'm that's what I'm gonna
refer to that as seems I didn't have any

280
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:48,529
refer to that as seems I didn't have any
 

281
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:51,940
refer to that as seems I didn't have any
sandstone left so you know what that

282
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:51,950
sandstone left so you know what that
 

283
00:10:51,950 --> 00:11:29,110
sandstone left so you know what that
means gotta get some more James really

284
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
means gotta get some more James really
 

285
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,980
means gotta get some more James really
lightning from all these items and that

286
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:35,990
lightning from all these items and that
 

287
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,120
lightning from all these items and that
should keep me sit for a while I'd say

288
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,130
should keep me sit for a while I'd say
 

289
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,740
should keep me sit for a while I'd say
again I don't know where all my

290
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:41,750
again I don't know where all my
 

291
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,579
again I don't know where all my
sandstone is going I think never use

292
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:45,589
sandstone is going I think never use
 

293
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:53,790
sandstone is going I think never use
this stuff

294
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:53,800

 

295
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:00,329

so you got plenty of sandstone again and

296
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:00,339
so you got plenty of sandstone again and
 

297
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:02,920
so you got plenty of sandstone again and
my sand supply is really good at the

298
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:02,930
my sand supply is really good at the
 

299
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,920
my sand supply is really good at the
moment although my gunpowder supply is

300
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:05,930
moment although my gunpowder supply is
 

301
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,449
moment although my gunpowder supply is
also really good at the moment so I'll

302
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:07,459
also really good at the moment so I'll
 

303
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:12,630
also really good at the moment so I'll
probably make a bunch of TNT soon again

304
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:12,640

 

305
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:19,840

and let's finish this thing up brown

306
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:19,850
and let's finish this thing up brown
 

307
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:32,110
and let's finish this thing up brown
sheep brown sheep yay get rid of this so

308
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,120
sheep brown sheep yay get rid of this so
 

309
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,910
sheep brown sheep yay get rid of this so
we gotta replace this wood with

310
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
we gotta replace this wood with
 

311
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:44,290
we gotta replace this wood with
sandstone and we even have trapdoors to

312
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:44,300
sandstone and we even have trapdoors to
 

313
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,970
sandstone and we even have trapdoors to
stand on as we do it which is pretty

314
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:45,980
stand on as we do it which is pretty
 

315
00:12:45,980 --> 00:13:06,990
stand on as we do it which is pretty
cool oh I forgot good good sandstone

316
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,000

 

317
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,670

I love this block looks so good and our

318
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:14,680
I love this block looks so good and our
 

319
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,420
I love this block looks so good and our
trapdoors see how did I do that before

320
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:18,430
trapdoors see how did I do that before
 

321
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:25,740
trapdoors see how did I do that before
that that that's and that's their wiring

322
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:25,750
that that that's and that's their wiring
 

323
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:34,350
that that that's and that's their wiring
back good okay

324
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:34,360

of wolves entering the barn right now so

360
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,170
of wolves entering the barn right now so
 

361
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,370
of wolves entering the barn right now so
we're gonna try it out one thing I think

362
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:11,380
we're gonna try it out one thing I think
 

363
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,830
we're gonna try it out one thing I think
I may need to add on to this is some

364
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:13,840
I may need to add on to this is some
 

365
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,360
I may need to add on to this is some
type of animal lock on the front door

366
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,370
type of animal lock on the front door
 

367
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,940
type of animal lock on the front door
because they tend to get out when I'm

368
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:19,950
because they tend to get out when I'm
 

369
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:26,850
because they tend to get out when I'm
enter or leave the barn so may have to

370
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:26,860
enter or leave the barn so may have to
 

371
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,590
enter or leave the barn so may have to
figure something out with that shouldn't

372
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:28,600
figure something out with that shouldn't
 

373
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,190
figure something out with that shouldn't
be too hard

374
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:34,200

 

375
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,340

wolves

376
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:37,350

 

377
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,860

I forgot they're gonna be trying to get

378
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:40,870
I forgot they're gonna be trying to get
 

379
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,390
I forgot they're gonna be trying to get
the sheep so they might not want to go

380
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:42,400
the sheep so they might not want to go
 

381
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:56,480
the sheep so they might not want to go
to the center one one one all right um

382
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:56,490
to the center one one one all right um
 

383
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,820
to the center one one one all right um

second any cow lovers or sheep lovers no
okay good I wonder if they will go on

390
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
okay good I wonder if they will go on
 

391
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,070
okay good I wonder if they will go on
their own if the Sheep

392
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,080
their own if the Sheep
 

393
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,570
their own if the Sheep
well the Sheep would have to move around

394
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:30,580
well the Sheep would have to move around
 

395
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:52,950
well the Sheep would have to move around
I don't know what was that no that

396
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:52,960
I don't know what was that no that
 

397
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:59,220
I don't know what was that no that
steams too much fun

398
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,230

 

399
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,930

hmm yeah they sure like to go after the

400
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:01,940
hmm yeah they sure like to go after the
 

401
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:12,909
hmm yeah they sure like to go after the
sheep if it's open they will drop down

402
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:12,919
sheep if it's open they will drop down
 

403
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:16,990
sheep if it's open they will drop down
into it I'm pretty sure it's as if

404
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,000
into it I'm pretty sure it's as if
 

405
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,699
into it I'm pretty sure it's as if
they're in there already and you open it

406
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:18,709
they're in there already and you open it
 

407
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:20,409
they're in there already and you open it
and you might might take a little longer

408
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:20,419
and you might might take a little longer
 

409
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:30,669
and you might might take a little longer
for them to you know so the last thing I

410
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:30,679
for them to you know so the last thing I
 

411
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,830
for them to you know so the last thing I
need to do is get rid of I think I'm

412
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:32,840
need to do is get rid of I think I'm
 

413
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,510
need to do is get rid of I think I'm
gonna get rid of this marine since it's

414
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:34,520
gonna get rid of this marine since it's
 

415
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,180
gonna get rid of this marine since it's
not needed anymore

416
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,190
not needed anymore
 

417
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,500
not needed anymore
that goes all the way around and I need

418
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:38,510
that goes all the way around and I need
 

419
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:45,600
that goes all the way around and I need
to put some kind of sealing on here

420
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:45,610

 

421
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,110

and then of course we need the squid

422
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,120
and then of course we need the squid
 

423
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,870
and then of course we need the squid
aquarium here I have a general idea how

424
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:51,880
aquarium here I have a general idea how
 

425
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,420
aquarium here I have a general idea how
I'm gonna do it but not exactly yet and

426
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:56,430
I'm gonna do it but not exactly yet and
 

427
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,750
I'm gonna do it but not exactly yet and
there's huge ocean out in front of yours

428
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:00,760
there's huge ocean out in front of yours
 

429
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,970
there's huge ocean out in front of yours
so I'm thinking something with boats

430
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:04,980
so I'm thinking something with boats
 

431
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,980
so I'm thinking something with boats
might be on the barn as well some kind

432
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:07,990
might be on the barn as well some kind
 

433
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,440
might be on the barn as well some kind
of boat dispenser maybe so I can go into

434
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:10,450
of boat dispenser maybe so I can go into
 

435
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,160
of boat dispenser maybe so I can go into
the ocean or if I start like an

436
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,170
the ocean or if I start like an
 

437
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,260
the ocean or if I start like an
underwater project that might have a

438
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,270
underwater project that might have a
 

439
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:22,380
underwater project that might have a
tube that goes underwater here not fully

440
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:22,390
tube that goes underwater here not fully
 

441
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:28,130
tube that goes underwater here not fully
sure what I'm gonna do yet anyway I

442
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,140

 

443
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,440

think I got all the wiring done now too

444
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:31,450
think I got all the wiring done now too
 

445
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,240
think I got all the wiring done now too
so I can probably go ahead and put a

446
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,250
so I can probably go ahead and put a
 

447
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,990
so I can probably go ahead and put a
hurting on the middle there so you can't

448
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,000
hurting on the middle there so you can't
 

449
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,650
hurting on the middle there so you can't
see all that wiring and I'll probably

450
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:40,660
see all that wiring and I'll probably
 

451
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:47,900
see all that wiring and I'll probably
also maybe trim it all around like this

452
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:47,910
also maybe trim it all around like this
 

453
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,550
also maybe trim it all around like this
just to give it a little bit more shape

454
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:50,560
just to give it a little bit more shape
 

455
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,810
just to give it a little bit more shape
and then possibly put those legs on it

456
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:54,820
and then possibly put those legs on it
 

457
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,370
and then possibly put those legs on it
or something and that looks a little

458
00:18:59,370 --> 00:18:59,380
or something and that looks a little
 

459
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:06,510
or something and that looks a little
strange looks even more strange I'll

460
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:06,520
strange looks even more strange I'll
 

461
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,590
strange looks even more strange I'll
figure something out

462
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600

 

463
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,030

you guys may have seen the eats road

464
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,040
you guys may have seen the eats road
 

465
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,680
you guys may have seen the eats road
already the latest addition I cleaned up

466
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:16,690
already the latest addition I cleaned up
 

467
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,640
already the latest addition I cleaned up
this spot now so it was pretty tall in

468
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:20,650
this spot now so it was pretty tall in
 

469
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,280
this spot now so it was pretty tall in
here so I decided to just grow trees and

470
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,290
here so I decided to just grow trees and
 

471
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:28,080
here so I decided to just grow trees and
have them kind of go over was not easy

472
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,090
have them kind of go over was not easy
 

473
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,610
have them kind of go over was not easy
to do that's for sure took a long time

474
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:31,620
to do that's for sure took a long time
 

475
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,260
to do that's for sure took a long time
but it's kind of unique I got a ladder

476
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,270
but it's kind of unique I got a ladder
 

477
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,940
but it's kind of unique I got a ladder
on every one of the trees use tons and

478
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:38,950
on every one of the trees use tons and
 

479
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,890
on every one of the trees use tons and
tons and tons of bonemeal trying to grow

480
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:40,900
tons and tons of bonemeal trying to grow
 

481
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,320
tons and tons of bonemeal trying to grow
them in such a little area and so close

482
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,330
them in such a little area and so close
 

483
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:48,900
them in such a little area and so close
together and one other thing I no longer

484
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:48,910
together and one other thing I no longer
 

485
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:54,750
together and one other thing I no longer
have glass over top my thing there
