something here if we get rid of all the

66
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:40,650
something here if we get rid of all the
 

67
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,819

69
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,679
torches it's going to be really dark
right I'm assuming yeah obviously but we

70
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:48,689
right I'm assuming yeah obviously but we
 

71
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,569
right I'm assuming yeah obviously but we
should go get a night vision potion and

72
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:50,579
should go get a night vision potion and
 

73
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,740

I just want to see what it's like if we

74
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:51,750
I just want to see what it's like if we
 

75
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,920
I just want to see what it's like if we
if we have that going because I got to

76
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:54,930
if we have that going because I got to
 

77
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,149
if we have that going because I got to
figure out how we're doing the lighting

78
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
figure out how we're doing the lighting
 

79
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,420
figure out how we're doing the lighting
and if we do lighting the issue is

80
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,430
and if we do lighting the issue is
 

81
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,920
and if we do lighting the issue is
creepers are going to blow it up all the

82
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:00,930
creepers are going to blow it up all the
 

83
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,639
creepers are going to blow it up all the
time right so maybe we should just plant

84
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:04,649
time right so maybe we should just plant
 

85
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,410
time right so maybe we should just plant
it so that we have to use a night vision

86

this looks like the best spot that I've

180
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:31,750
this looks like the best spot that I've
 

181
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,620

enclosed area and we're going to start
 

191
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,189
enclosed area and we're going to start
it right here I think okay so I I'm

it up off-camera but I put some thought

198
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:56,500
it up off-camera but I put some thought
 

199
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,159
it up off-camera but I put some thought
into it we're gonna give the Rube

200
00:04:59,159 --> 00:04:59,169
into it we're gonna give the Rube
 

201
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:04,980
into it we're gonna give the Rube
Goldberg machine a seam and it's going

202
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:04,990
Goldberg machine a seam and it's going
 

203
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,279
Goldberg machine a seam and it's going
to be villagers bad day okay so we're

204
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:08,289
to be villagers bad day okay so we're
 

205
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:09,240
to be villagers bad day okay so we're
going to start out with a little

206
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,250
going to start out with a little
 

207
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,670
going to start out with a little
villager Shack or house up on top of the

208
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
villager Shack or house up on top of the
 

209
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,020
villager Shack or house up on top of the
hill here and when he goes outside we'll

210
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,030
hill here and when he goes outside we'll
 

211
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,310
hill here and when he goes outside we'll
have the door blocked off while we're

212
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:17,320
have the door blocked off while we're
 

213
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,529
have the door blocked off while we're
working on this but then when we're

214
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:19,539
working on this but then when we're
 

215
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:20,790
working on this but then when we're
ready to start the machine will just

216
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
ready to start the machine will just
 

217
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,370
ready to start the machine will just
remove like a block in front the door

218
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:23,380
remove like a block in front the door
 

219
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,320
remove like a block in front the door
and he'll be able to get out when he

220
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,330
and he'll be able to get out when he
 

221
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,110
and he'll be able to get out when he
goes outside though he's going to find

222
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
goes outside though he's going to find
 

223
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,779
goes outside though he's going to find
the land has washed away outside his

224
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:30,789
the land has washed away outside his
 

225
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,839
the land has washed away outside his
door here so we're gonna dig down I'll

226
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:33,849
door here so we're gonna dig down I'll
 

227
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,330
door here so we're gonna dig down I'll
build the house off-camera because if we

228
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:36,340
build the house off-camera because if we
 

229
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,070
build the house off-camera because if we
focus on that too much we're not getting

230
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
focus on that too much we're not getting
 

231
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,830
focus on that too much we're not getting
anything done right all right and we're

232
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:40,840
anything done right all right and we're
 

233
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,420
anything done right all right and we're
gonna set up some water streams down

234
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:42,430
gonna set up some water streams down
 

235
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,089
gonna set up some water streams down
here hopefully and it'll wash the

236
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:45,099
here hopefully and it'll wash the
 

237
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:48,149
here hopefully and it'll wash the
villager down this cliff I'm hoping we

238
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:48,159
villager down this cliff I'm hoping we
 

239
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,600
villager down this cliff I'm hoping we
want stuff with lots of motion and

240
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:50,610
want stuff with lots of motion and
 

241
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,550
want stuff with lots of motion and
that's fun to watch so I think watching

242
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:53,560
that's fun to watch so I think watching
 

243
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,070
that's fun to watch so I think watching
a villager go down a cliff would look

244
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
a villager go down a cliff would look
 

245
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,770
a villager go down a cliff would look
pretty funny let's just see what happens

246
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:58,780
pretty funny let's just see what happens
 

247
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,330
pretty funny let's just see what happens
if we put ice here in here we're going

248
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:03,340
if we put ice here in here we're going
 

249
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,520
if we put ice here in here we're going
to make a big mess getting it to flow

250
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:05,530
to make a big mess getting it to flow
 

251
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,770
to make a big mess getting it to flow
nicely down here it's going to be tough

252
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:07,780
nicely down here it's going to be tough
 

253
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,390
nicely down here it's going to be tough
and we got to make sure the villager can

254
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:09,400
and we got to make sure the villager can
 

255
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,399
and we got to make sure the villager can
escape the water too as he goes down I'm

256
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:11,409
escape the water too as he goes down I'm
 

257
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:13,409
escape the water too as he goes down I'm
kind of hoping you'll just like kind of

Bend
up and around yeah something like that's

262
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,010
up and around yeah something like that's
 

263
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,690
up and around yeah something like that's
good I would say we're going to stop the

264
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:23,700
good I would say we're going to stop the
 

265
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:29,570
good I would say we're going to stop the
water around here somewhere though oh if

266
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:29,580
water around here somewhere though oh if
 

267
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,670
water around here somewhere though oh if
we can alright so that's pretty cool

268
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:34,680
we can alright so that's pretty cool
 

269
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
we can alright so that's pretty cool
now to actually get the villager into

270
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:36,690
now to actually get the villager into
 

271
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,090
now to actually get the villager into
the water we're going to have to do

272
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,100
the water we're going to have to do
 

273
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,700
the water we're going to have to do
something though outside his door we're

274
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:43,710
something though outside his door we're
 

275
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,200
something though outside his door we're
gonna have to put some trap doors so

276
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,210
gonna have to put some trap doors so
 

277
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:50,480
gonna have to put some trap doors so
he'll walk off the ledge here oh this is

278
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:50,490
he'll walk off the ledge here oh this is
 

279
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,910
he'll walk off the ledge here oh this is
getting tricky already I don't have a

280
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:52,920
getting tricky already I don't have a
 

281
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,470
getting tricky already I don't have a
chess set up or anything so my

282
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:54,480
chess set up or anything so my

00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,030
inventories a mess I want to build a
 

285
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,490
inventories a mess I want to build a
house I can actually store stuff there

286
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:58,500
house I can actually store stuff there
 

287
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,160
house I can actually store stuff there
and you can see I got TNT and TNT

288
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,170
and you can see I got TNT and TNT
 

289
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,900
and you can see I got TNT and TNT
minecarts that's right we're going to

290
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:02,910
minecarts that's right we're going to
 

291
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,930
minecarts that's right we're going to
have some fun with that I can't think of

292
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:05,940
have some fun with that I can't think of
 

293
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,990
have some fun with that I can't think of
anything more fun to watch then like TNT

294
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,000
anything more fun to watch then like TNT
 

295
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,510
anything more fun to watch then like TNT
minecarts moving around and blown up so

296
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
minecarts moving around and blown up so
 

297
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,450
minecarts moving around and blown up so
hopefully the second step of this is we

298
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:14,460
hopefully the second step of this is we
 

299
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,060
hopefully the second step of this is we
can get into that I'm trying to do

300
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,070
can get into that I'm trying to do
 

301
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,530
can get into that I'm trying to do
something here what was it trapdoors

302
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:18,540
something here what was it trapdoors
 

303
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,860
something here what was it trapdoors
let's get some trapdoors so we'll have

304
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:21,870
let's get some trapdoors so we'll have
 

305
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,140
let's get some trapdoors so we'll have
to make it so he paths finds his way off

306
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,150
to make it so he paths finds his way off
 

307
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,230
to make it so he paths finds his way off
a cliff and he'll walk into the water so

308
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,240
a cliff and he'll walk into the water so
 

309
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:34,030
a cliff and he'll walk into the water so
maybe if we just do something like this

310
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,040
maybe if we just do something like this
 

311
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,230
maybe if we just do something like this
and over here he'll try to walk over to

312
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:39,240
and over here he'll try to walk over to
 

313
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,760
and over here he'll try to walk over to
these trapdoors but he won't be able to

314
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:40,770
these trapdoors but he won't be able to
 

315
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,500
these trapdoors but he won't be able to
inhale just fall down although here he

316

in
once we do that I guess I can still

352
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:29,950
once we do that I guess I can still
 

353
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,630
once we do that I guess I can still
access stuff from outside yeah because

354
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:33,640
access stuff from outside yeah because
 

355
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,280

the door and then we'll head down to
 

369
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,990
the door and then we'll head down to
over here where this bed is we got to

over here where this bed is we got to
 

371
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,880
over here where this bed is we got to
think about where we're going to be

watching this as it runs - so I thought

374
00:08:59,250 --> 00:08:59,260
watching this as it runs - so I thought
 

375
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,200
watching this as it runs - so I thought
this would be a nice vantage point to

376
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,210
this would be a nice vantage point to
 

377
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,290
this would be a nice vantage point to
start it off that villager will come out

378
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:04,300
start it off that villager will come out
 

379
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,550
start it off that villager will come out
the door and he'll fall in the water and

380
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:05,560
the door and he'll fall in the water and
 

381
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,890
the door and he'll fall in the water and
we can watch them go all the way down

382
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:06,900
we can watch them go all the way down
 

383
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,230
we can watch them go all the way down
but start the machine all we got to do

384
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
but start the machine all we got to do
 

385
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,060
but start the machine all we got to do
is sleep in the bed and then in the

386
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,070
is sleep in the bed and then in the
 

387
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,840
is sleep in the bed and then in the
daytime the start of the day villager is

388
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:15,850
daytime the start of the day villager is
 

389
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,520
daytime the start of the day villager is
going to start his day out very badly

390
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:17,530
going to start his day out very badly
 

391
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,370
going to start his day out very badly
he's going to come up the door and it's

392
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:20,380
he's going to come up the door and it's
 

393
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,050
he's going to come up the door and it's
going to fall fall in the water and make

394
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,060
going to fall fall in the water and make
 

395
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,530
going to fall fall in the water and make
his way down to here alright so we

396
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:25,540
his way down to here alright so we
 

397
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,270
his way down to here alright so we
should test this out let's double check

398
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,280
should test this out let's double check
 

399
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,930
should test this out let's double check
I got the water streams all right try to

400
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:30,940
I got the water streams all right try to
 

401
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,810
I got the water streams all right try to
try to get it just right so I built up

402
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:33,820
try to get it just right so I built up
 

403
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,540

the banks along this river - as you

404
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:36,550
the banks along this river - as you
 

405
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,880
the banks along this river - as you
might notice so hopefully there's no

406
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:38,890
might notice so hopefully there's no
 

407
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,250
might notice so hopefully there's no
place for the villager to get out as I

408
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:41,260
place for the villager to get out as I
 

409
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,240
place for the villager to get out as I
go down here I'm just going to hold

410
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,250
go down here I'm just going to hold
 

411
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,100
go down here I'm just going to hold
spacebar because that kind of mimics how

412
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,110
spacebar because that kind of mimics how
 

413
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,890
spacebar because that kind of mimics how
mobs behave in water they do move a

414
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:46,900
mobs behave in water they do move a
 

415
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,390
mobs behave in water they do move a
little bit too but not very much don't

416
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:51,400
little bit too but not very much don't
 

417
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,890
little bit too but not very much don't
think they'll be able to get out of the

418
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:52,900
think they'll be able to get out of the
 

419
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,220
think they'll be able to get out of the
water here though it's actually quite a

420
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:56,230
water here though it's actually quite a
 

421
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,140
water here though it's actually quite a
bit slower than I had hoped

422
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,150
bit slower than I had hoped
 

423
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,330
bit slower than I had hoped
darn it alright maybe it'll be like a

424
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:03,340
darn it alright maybe it'll be like a
 

425
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,420
darn it alright maybe it'll be like a
slow epic start to the whole thing I'll

426
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:06,430
slow epic start to the whole thing I'll
 

427
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,960
slow epic start to the whole thing I'll
just slowly watch them go down here and

428
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:08,970
just slowly watch them go down here and
 

429
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,130
just slowly watch them go down here and
then they'll get to this point and

430
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,140
then they'll get to this point and
 

431
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,220
then they'll get to this point and
they'll fall down alright

432
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,230
they'll fall down alright
 

433
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,640
they'll fall down alright
very cool so at this point that's kind

434
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:17,650
very cool so at this point that's kind
 

435
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,200
very cool so at this point that's kind
of like the first and second step I

436
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,210
of like the first and second step I
 

437
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,970
of like the first and second step I
guess first step is I'm falling into the

438
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:20,980
guess first step is I'm falling into the
 

439
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,920
guess first step is I'm falling into the
water second step is I'm going down the

440
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:22,930
water second step is I'm going down the
 

441
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,740
water second step is I'm going down the
water stream third step let's start that

442
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:25,750
water stream third step let's start that
 

443
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,650
water stream third step let's start that
and I did not bring what I needed

444
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:28,660
and I did not bring what I needed
 

445

try to get the villager into a minecart
at this part so what I'm going to do is

450
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,080
at this part so what I'm going to do is
 

451
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,380
at this part so what I'm going to do is
grab a dispenser might need redstone

452
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:41,390
grab a dispenser might need redstone
 

453
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,870
grab a dispenser might need redstone
oonh yeah so as he falls down

454
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
oonh yeah so as he falls down
 

455
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,670
oonh yeah so as he falls down
OOP I guess we can take this down

456
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:48,680
OOP I guess we can take this down
 

457
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,740
OOP I guess we can take this down
ourselves as he falls down here I'm

458
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:50,750
ourselves as he falls down here I'm
 

459
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,410
ourselves as he falls down here I'm
going to make them hit some tripwire so

460
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:53,420
going to make them hit some tripwire so
 

461
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,180
going to make them hit some tripwire so
maybe we should raise this one block so

462
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,190
maybe we should raise this one block so
 

463
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,710
maybe we should raise this one block so
it doesn't take damage to I don't know

464
00:10:59,710 --> 00:10:59,720
it doesn't take damage to I don't know
 

465
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,210
it doesn't take damage to I don't know
what we're going to build the track out

466
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,220
what we're going to build the track out
 

467
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,790
what we're going to build the track out
of I'll just put that there so it'll be

468
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:03,800
of I'll just put that there so it'll be
 

469
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,070
of I'll just put that there so it'll be
a rail here OOP goes that way we'll have

470
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,080
a rail here OOP goes that way we'll have
 

471
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,400
a rail here OOP goes that way we'll have
a dispenser to release a carts and I

472
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,410
a dispenser to release a carts and I
 

473
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,990
a dispenser to release a carts and I
think when this release is a minecart

474
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
think when this release is a minecart
 

475
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,120
think when this release is a minecart
it'll pick up the villager so we just

476
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,130
it'll pick up the villager so we just
 

477
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,040
it'll pick up the villager so we just
need to activate it so we'll have a

478
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,050
need to activate it so we'll have a
 

479
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:25,030
need to activate it so we'll have a
tripwire here and here okay and we'll

480
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
tripwire here and here okay and we'll
 

481
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,190
tripwire here and here okay and we'll
connect it to the dispenser and that

482
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200
connect it to the dispenser and that
 

483
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,120
connect it to the dispenser and that
should be good I think we'll have to

484
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,130
should be good I think we'll have to
 

485
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,720
should be good I think we'll have to
make sure he can't actually get out of

486
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:34,730
make sure he can't actually get out of
 

487
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,430
make sure he can't actually get out of
here though so we'll need to build it up

488
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:36,440
here though so we'll need to build it up
 

489
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:43,570
here though so we'll need to build it up
- all right and up here - sure oops

490
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:43,580
- all right and up here - sure oops
 

491
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,600
- all right and up here - sure oops
not there if I do that he can't get down

492
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:46,610
not there if I do that he can't get down
 

493
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:53,400
not there if I do that he can't get down
we need one over here maybe like that

494
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:53,410
we need one over here maybe like that
 

495
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,930
we need one over here maybe like that
sure all right

496
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:55,940
sure all right
 

497
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,790
sure all right
and I had an idea let's go back up here

498
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:57,800
and I had an idea let's go back up here
 

499
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,250
and I had an idea let's go back up here
we might redo this first step like where

500
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:00,260
we might redo this first step like where
 

501
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,480
we might redo this first step like where
the part where he falls in the water

502
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:01,490
the part where he falls in the water
 

503
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,670
the part where he falls in the water
it's a little bit lame having him just

504
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
it's a little bit lame having him just
 

505
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,550
it's a little bit lame having him just
walk off the ledge I was sneaking let's

506
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
walk off the ledge I was sneaking let's
 

507
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,400
walk off the ledge I was sneaking let's
try one thing here and I might regret

508
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,410
try one thing here and I might regret
 

509
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,700
try one thing here and I might regret
this but we're gonna try activate it

510
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,710
this but we're gonna try activate it
 

511
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,330
this but we're gonna try activate it
with TNT

512
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:13,340
with TNT
 

513
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,230
with TNT
I have no clay how have I used all the

514
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,240
I have no clay how have I used all the
 

515
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,420
I have no clay how have I used all the
clay up you'll just grab a couple pieces

516
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,430
clay up you'll just grab a couple pieces
 

517
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:26,290
clay up you'll just grab a couple pieces
okay I'll fix that later I think what we

518
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:26,300
okay I'll fix that later I think what we
 

519
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,450
okay I'll fix that later I think what we
could do is just have like a three by

520
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:28,460
could do is just have like a three by
 

521
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,380
could do is just have like a three by
three by three thing of clay and we'll

522
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:32,390
three by three thing of clay and we'll
 

523
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,610
three by three thing of clay and we'll
put a piece of TNT in the middle and we

524
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:36,620
put a piece of TNT in the middle and we
 

525
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,230
put a piece of TNT in the middle and we
might even make it so the water gets

526
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
might even make it so the water gets
 

527
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
might even make it so the water gets
released then - instead of it always

528
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:39,770
released then - instead of it always
 

529
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:45,070
released then - instead of it always
flowing here like maybe part of the

530
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,080
flowing here like maybe part of the
 

531
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,780
flowing here like maybe part of the
cliff blows up and then he falls down I

532
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:46,790
cliff blows up and then he falls down I
 

533
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,690
cliff blows up and then he falls down I
really wish I had more clay we're right

534
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:49,700
really wish I had more clay we're right
 

535
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,679
really wish I had more clay we're right
by the clay mining outpost by the way

536
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:54,689

 

537
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:57,629

should be easy to get some but I didn't

538
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:57,639
should be easy to get some but I didn't
 

539
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:04,069
should be easy to get some but I didn't
plan ahead grab a little bit more okay

540
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
plan ahead grab a little bit more okay
 

541
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,170
plan ahead grab a little bit more okay
put the TNT in the middle here let's get

542
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:07,180
put the TNT in the middle here let's get
 

543
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,059
put the TNT in the middle here let's get
rid of these trapdoors so maybe instead

544
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:09,069
rid of these trapdoors so maybe instead
 

545
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:10,499
rid of these trapdoors so maybe instead
of them just like watching out the ledge

546
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:10,509
of them just like watching out the ledge
 

547
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:11,850
of them just like watching out the ledge
we'll make them step on a pressure plate

548
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:11,860
we'll make them step on a pressure plate
 

549
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,280
we'll make them step on a pressure plate
with a piece of TNT in the middle of

550
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,290
with a piece of TNT in the middle of
 

551
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,929
with a piece of TNT in the middle of
this I don't think it will hurt him and

552
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:18,939
this I don't think it will hurt him and
 

553
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,939
this I don't think it will hurt him and
it would have a much cooler effect that

554
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:20,949
it would have a much cooler effect that
 

555
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:23,220
it would have a much cooler effect that
way something like this we'll have to

556
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,230
way something like this we'll have to
 

557
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,079
way something like this we'll have to
make it so other mobs can't activate it

558
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:25,089
make it so other mobs can't activate it
 

559
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:28,319
make it so other mobs can't activate it
though we'll just try it for right now

560
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:28,329
though we'll just try it for right now
 

561
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:32,009
though we'll just try it for right now
I'm going to put some of my stuff away

562
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:32,019
I'm going to put some of my stuff away
 

563
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,989
I'm going to put some of my stuff away
here just in case I'm wrong about this

564
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:33,999
here just in case I'm wrong about this
 

565
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:36,139
here just in case I'm wrong about this
but I don't think it's gonna kill me you

566
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:36,149
but I don't think it's gonna kill me you
 

567
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,299
but I don't think it's gonna kill me you
can take off my boots and my armor so

568
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:39,309
can take off my boots and my armor so
 

569
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:40,829
can take off my boots and my armor so
we're the villager coming out in the

570
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:40,839
we're the villager coming out in the
 

571
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:47,790
we're the villager coming out in the
morning we step over here and yeah we're

572
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:47,800
morning we step over here and yeah we're
 

573
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,210
morning we step over here and yeah we're
fine

574
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:48,220
fine
 

575
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,160
fine
so if we could make it so the water

576
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,170
so if we could make it so the water
 

577
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,170
so if we could make it so the water
starts flowing then that would be really

578
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:52,180
starts flowing then that would be really
 

579
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,499
starts flowing then that would be really
cool oh man I think this might work guys

580
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:55,509
cool oh man I think this might work guys
 

581
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:58,379
cool oh man I think this might work guys
let's try it out I got water in the the

582
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:58,389
let's try it out I got water in the the
 

583
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:00,900
let's try it out I got water in the the
corners so one here one here and then

584
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:00,910
corners so one here one here and then
 

585
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,290
corners so one here one here and then
two in the middle there going to be

586
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:04,300
two in the middle there going to be
 

587
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,069
two in the middle there going to be
behind clay like this and oops not there

588
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
behind clay like this and oops not there
 

589
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,110
behind clay like this and oops not there
let's just build it up like it would be

590
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,120
let's just build it up like it would be
 

591
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,119
let's just build it up like it would be
I'm just using red clay because I got

592
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:12,129
I'm just using red clay because I got
 

593
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:15,569
I'm just using red clay because I got
lots of it around here we'll use it

594
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:15,579
lots of it around here we'll use it
 

595
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:17,400
lots of it around here we'll use it
something that actually matches in the

596
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:17,410
something that actually matches in the
 

597
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,720
something that actually matches in the
official version but this is just a test

598
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:20,730
official version but this is just a test
 

599
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,259
official version but this is just a test
alright and do that in that let's put a

600
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:25,269
alright and do that in that let's put a
 

601
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:29,069
alright and do that in that let's put a
tnt there there and there

602
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:29,079
tnt there there and there
 

603
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:34,319
tnt there there and there
oh that's not right how did I do that is

604
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:34,329
oh that's not right how did I do that is
 

605
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:35,579
oh that's not right how did I do that is
one of them

606
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:35,589
one of them
 

607
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:39,360
one of them
oh man that water's in the wrong spot

608
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,370
oh man that water's in the wrong spot
 

609
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,309
oh man that water's in the wrong spot
umm wonder if that'll be okay let's just

610
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:44,319
umm wonder if that'll be okay let's just
 

611
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:46,049
umm wonder if that'll be okay let's just
try it let's see what happens I thought

612
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:46,059
try it let's see what happens I thought
 

613
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:49,519
try it let's see what happens I thought
it was over one more cover this up and

614
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:49,529
it was over one more cover this up and
 

615
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,720
it was over one more cover this up and
we'll have the pressure plates over top

616
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:51,730
we'll have the pressure plates over top
 

617
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,509
we'll have the pressure plates over top
each of these there and there I guess

618
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:54,519
each of these there and there I guess
 

619
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,519
each of these there and there I guess
and we'll probably put a fence around

620
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:56,529
and we'll probably put a fence around
 

621
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,439
and we'll probably put a fence around
here just so no other mobs can get in

622
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:58,449
here just so no other mobs can get in
 

623
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:00,449
here just so no other mobs can get in
and activate these at nighttime or

624
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:00,459
and activate these at nighttime or
 

625
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:03,900
and activate these at nighttime or
something stupid alright so it'll be

626
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:03,910
something stupid alright so it'll be
 

627
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,669
something stupid alright so it'll be

with this is just running back and forth

906
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
with this is just running back and forth
 

907
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,710
with this is just running back and forth
getting stuff now we're going to start

908
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
getting stuff now we're going to start
 

909
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,600
getting stuff now we're going to start
the next section of this so we're going

910
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:42,610
the next section of this so we're going
 

911
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,160
the next section of this so we're going
to build it like in stages and then

912
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,170
to build it like in stages and then
 

913
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,770
to build it like in stages and then
hopefully for next episode we'll have

914
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:46,780
hopefully for next episode we'll have
 

915
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,450
hopefully for next episode we'll have
like a grand finale where we see the

916
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:48,460
like a grand finale where we see the
 

917
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,030
like a grand finale where we see the
whole thing run through and it works

918
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,040
whole thing run through and it works
 

919
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,380
whole thing run through and it works
flawlessly hopefully I have an idea for

920
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:55,390
flawlessly hopefully I have an idea for
 

921
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,390
flawlessly hopefully I have an idea for
this next part in it this might be a

922
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:57,400
this next part in it this might be a
 

923
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,950
this next part in it this might be a
pretty big part of the whole Rube

924
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:58,960
pretty big part of the whole Rube
 

925
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,780
pretty big part of the whole Rube
Goldberg machine like this mechanic

926
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:00,790
Goldberg machine like this mechanic
 

927

we're going to put a TNT minecarts in

928
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:03,940
we're going to put a TNT minecarts in
 

929
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,320
we're going to put a TNT minecarts in
here we're going to take advantage of

930
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:07,330
here we're going to take advantage of
 

931
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,690
here we're going to take advantage of
the fact that I believe TNT my cards

932
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:09,700
the fact that I believe TNT my cards
 

933
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,300

don't blow up the tractor on but I think

934
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,310
don't blow up the tractor on but I think
 

935
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,460
don't blow up the tractor on but I think
they'll blow up blocks like upwards and

936
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:14,470
they'll blow up blocks like upwards and
 

937
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,730
they'll blow up blocks like upwards and
like sort of sideways if I remember

938
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:17,740
like sort of sideways if I remember
 

939
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,860
like sort of sideways if I remember
correctly so what we'll do is have this

940
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:22,870
correctly so what we'll do is have this
 

941
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,850
correctly so what we'll do is have this
go maybe go over and activate a rail I

942
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:25,860
go maybe go over and activate a rail I
 

943
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,470
go maybe go over and activate a rail I
know like all the recipes in this game

944
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
know like all the recipes in this game
 

945
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,590
know like all the recipes in this game
by hearts like no question except for

946
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
by hearts like no question except for
 

947
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,540
by hearts like no question except for
activated rails I always forget the

948
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:33,550
activated rails I always forget the
 

949
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,070
activated rails I always forget the
recipe for them and I have to look it up

950
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,080
recipe for them and I have to look it up
 

951
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,460
recipe for them and I have to look it up
so annoying because how often do use

952
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:38,470
so annoying because how often do use
 

953
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,770
so annoying because how often do use
activator rails honestly okay so

954
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:42,780
activator rails honestly okay so
 

955
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,610
activator rails honestly okay so
villager is going to keep going along

956
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:44,620
villager is going to keep going along
 

957
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,960
villager is going to keep going along
this track I'm going to make it look

958
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:45,970
this track I'm going to make it look
 

959
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,690
this track I'm going to make it look
like he rat runs into some boulders here

960
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:48,700
like he rat runs into some boulders here
 

961
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,610
like he rat runs into some boulders here
so like with this clay

962
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:51,620
so like with this clay
 

963
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,590
so like with this clay
and he hits a dead end basically so yeah

964
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:56,600
and he hits a dead end basically so yeah
 

965
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,320
and he hits a dead end basically so yeah
but then underneath he's going to have

966
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,330
but then underneath he's going to have
 

967
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,019
but then underneath he's going to have
this TNT minecart go over an activator

968
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:02,029
this TNT minecart go over an activator
 

969
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:07,299
this TNT minecart go over an activator
track over here and then we got to make

970
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:07,309
track over here and then we got to make
 

971
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:09,370
track over here and then we got to make
it go to right underneath where he is

972
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:09,380
it go to right underneath where he is
 

973
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,279
it go to right underneath where he is
since we have a clay block between him

974
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:12,289
since we have a clay block between him
 

975
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:13,750
since we have a clay block between him
and the TNT I don't think it's going to

976
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:13,760
and the TNT I don't think it's going to
 

977
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,779
and the TNT I don't think it's going to
kill him oh this is going to be tough oh

978
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:18,789
kill him oh this is going to be tough oh
 

979
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:21,669
kill him oh this is going to be tough oh
that worked okay let's get rid of this

980
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
that worked okay let's get rid of this
 

981
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,549
that worked okay let's get rid of this
and this and we still have a downward

982
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:24,559
and this and we still have a downward
 

983
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,260
and this and we still have a downward
slope there that's good so he's going to

984
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:26,270
slope there that's good so he's going to
 

985
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,899
slope there that's good so he's going to
fall from up here down to this track

986
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:28,909
fall from up here down to this track
 

987
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:31,899
fall from up here down to this track
here I'm pretty sure that's what we're

988
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:31,909
here I'm pretty sure that's what we're
 

989
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:34,810
here I'm pretty sure that's what we're
testing anyway that TNT minecart should

990
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:34,820
testing anyway that TNT minecart should
 

991
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:40,169
testing anyway that TNT minecart should
end up over here somewhere and yeah

992
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:40,179
end up over here somewhere and yeah
 

993
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:43,419
end up over here somewhere and yeah
think so let's do it do a test I'm not

994
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:43,429
think so let's do it do a test I'm not
 

995
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:44,620
think so let's do it do a test I'm not
going to make a backup for this because

996
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:44,630
going to make a backup for this because
 

997
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,639
going to make a backup for this because
I don't think it's going to cause much

998
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:45,649
I don't think it's going to cause much
 

999
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:49,870
I don't think it's going to cause much
of an explosion but we'll put our

1000
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:49,880
of an explosion but we'll put our
 

1001
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,039
of an explosion but we'll put our
minecart in here should I ride it maybe

1002
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:54,049
minecart in here should I ride it maybe
 

1003
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:59,980
minecart in here should I ride it maybe
I should ride it just to try it oh whoa

1004
00:24:59,980 --> 00:24:59,990
I should ride it just to try it oh whoa
 

1005
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:09,240
I should ride it just to try it oh whoa
because the TNT no I always make backups

1006
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,250
because the TNT no I always make backups

1007
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:27,540
because the TNT no I always make backups
need more power rails start it

1009
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,580
ridiculous okay I give up you win you

1010
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:30,590
ridiculous okay I give up you win you
 

1011
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,390
ridiculous okay I give up you win you
win I'm out of here I made a backup this

1012
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:34,400
win I'm out of here I made a backup this
 

1013
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,940
win I'm out of here I made a backup this
time I'm not building a rebuilding any

1014
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:36,950
time I'm not building a rebuilding any
 

1015
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,180
time I'm not building a rebuilding any
more than I need to from this point on

1016
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,190
more than I need to from this point on
 

1017
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,490
more than I need to from this point on
okay so I made it look like I tried to

1018
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:42,500
okay so I made it look like I tried to
 

1019
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,650
okay so I made it look like I tried to
make it look like a pile of gravel fell

1020
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:44,660
make it look like a pile of gravel fell
 

1021
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,680
make it look like a pile of gravel fell
on the track and broke it so at this

1022
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:47,690
on the track and broke it so at this
 

1023
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,810
on the track and broke it so at this
point it breaks there's a big gravel

1024
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:49,820
point it breaks there's a big gravel
 

1025
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,530
point it breaks there's a big gravel
pile in the way of the villager and TT

1026
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:53,540
pile in the way of the villager and TT
 

1027
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,420
pile in the way of the villager and TT
minecart goes up to the pile blows it up

1028
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:55,430
minecart goes up to the pile blows it up
 

1029
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,330
minecart goes up to the pile blows it up
any gravel that lands on the track over

1030
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:58,340
any gravel that lands on the track over
 

1031
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,420
any gravel that lands on the track over
there should break automatically and I

1032
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:01,430
there should break automatically and I
 

1033
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,700
there should break automatically and I
don't think there'll be any trouble I

1034
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:03,710
don't think there'll be any trouble I
 

1035
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,730
don't think there'll be any trouble I
did change out this block here it used

1036
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:06,740
did change out this block here it used
 

1037
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,980
did change out this block here it used
to be clay I've changed it changed it to

1038
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:08,990
to be clay I've changed it changed it to
 

1039
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,550
to be clay I've changed it changed it to
gravel so it for sure will fall and last

1040
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:12,560
gravel so it for sure will fall and last
 

1041
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,730
gravel so it for sure will fall and last
time I tested it it did not blow up for

1042
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:15,740
time I tested it it did not blow up for
 

1043
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,770
time I tested it it did not blow up for
some reason so I'm not exactly sure how

1044
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:17,780
some reason so I'm not exactly sure how
 

1045
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,860
some reason so I'm not exactly sure how
t minecarts work compared to normal tnt

1046
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:20,870
t minecarts work compared to normal tnt
 

1047
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,040
t minecarts work compared to normal tnt
it's not quite the same though for sure

1048
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,050
it's not quite the same though for sure
 

1049
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,020
it's not quite the same though for sure
okay let's get our card in here we're

1050
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,030
okay let's get our card in here we're
 

1051
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,260
okay let's get our card in here we're
gonna have to actually ride this

1052
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,270
gonna have to actually ride this
 

1053
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:34,860
gonna have to actually ride this
otherwise the oh it's going pretty slow 

1055
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:38,650
to really enter that very well yeah I

1056
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:38,660
to really enter that very well yeah I
 

1057
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,500
to really enter that very well yeah I
didn't take any damage one piece of

1058
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:41,510
didn't take any damage one piece of
 

1059
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,970
didn't take any damage one piece of
gravel suffocated me for a bit there but

1060
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:42,980
gravel suffocated me for a bit there but
 

1061
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,480
gravel suffocated me for a bit there but
I didn't take any damage so I think our

1062
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:46,490
I didn't take any damage so I think our
 

1063
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,029
I didn't take any damage so I think our
villager is gonna be okay that was

1064
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:49,039
villager is gonna be okay that was
 

1065
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,789
villager is gonna be okay that was
actually really cool isn't it

1066
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:50,799
actually really cool isn't it
 

1067
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,820
actually really cool isn't it
all right I'm happy with that but

1068
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:54,830
all right I'm happy with that but
 

1069
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,890
all right I'm happy with that but
anyways guys I think we're gonna have to

1070
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:56,900
anyways guys I think we're gonna have to
 

1071
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,360
anyways guys I think we're gonna have to
call it here for today and wrap things

1072
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,370
call it here for today and wrap things
 

1073
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,549
call it here for today and wrap things
up we're gonna work on this again next

1074
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
up we're gonna work on this again next
 

1075
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,340
up we're gonna work on this again next
time though and hopefully get like at

1076
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:03,350
time though and hopefully get like at
 

1077
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,070
time though and hopefully get like at
least five more track pieces built on to

1078
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,080
least five more track pieces built on to
 

1079
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,649
least five more track pieces built on to
it because otherwise there's not going

1080
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:08,659
it because otherwise there's not going
 

1081
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:10,630
it because otherwise there's not going
to be much to it at the grand finale

1082
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:10,640
to be much to it at the grand finale
 

1083
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,919
to be much to it at the grand finale
next episode um kind of needed to start

1084
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:14,929
next episode um kind of needed to start
 

1085
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:16,360
next episode um kind of needed to start
this two episodes ago or three episodes

1086
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:16,370
this two episodes ago or three episodes
 

1087
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,450
this two episodes ago or three episodes
ago to be honest but don't think you

1088
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:19,460
ago to be honest but don't think you
 

1089
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,860
ago to be honest but don't think you
would want to watch me work on it five

1090
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:20,870
would want to watch me work on it five
 

1091
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,260
would want to watch me work on it five
episodes straight either right so the

1092
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,270
episodes straight either right so the
 

1093
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,960
episodes straight either right so the
plan we're gonna we're going to activate

1094
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:25,970
plan we're gonna we're going to activate
 

1095
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,860
plan we're gonna we're going to activate
this just to make sure it works - the

1096
