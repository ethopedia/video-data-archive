00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:17,430
I played around with it a little bit
 

163
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,640
I played around with it a little bit
today the idea again and it turns out

164
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:19,650
today the idea again and it turns out
 

165
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,400
today the idea again and it turns out
you don't need a really huge crazy

166
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,410
you don't need a really huge crazy
 

167
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,200
you don't need a really huge crazy
contraption to do it either you can

168
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,210
contraption to do it either you can
 

169
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,110
contraption to do it either you can
actually do it really simply and I just

170
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
actually do it really simply and I just
 

171
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,170
actually do it really simply and I just
want to today's going to be a research

172
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:30,180
want to today's going to be a research
 

173
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,670
want to today's going to be a research
episode okay we're going to play around

174
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
episode okay we're going to play around
 

175
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,279
episode okay we're going to play around
with the idea and I want to show kind of

176
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:34,289
with the idea and I want to show kind of
 

177
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:36,129
with the idea and I want to show kind of
explain to you how it works and also

178
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:36,139
explain to you how it works and also
 

179
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:38,629
explain to you how it works and also
show you how to build it and we will

180
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
show you how to build it and we will
 

181
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,480
show you how to build it and we will
play play around with ways that we can

182
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,490
play play around with ways that we can
 

183
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,330
play play around with ways that we can
actually refine it and use it as a

184
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:44,340
actually refine it and use it as a
 

185
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,670
actually refine it and use it as a
teleporter like an actual teleporter in

186
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:46,680
teleporter like an actual teleporter in
 

187
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,490
teleporter like an actual teleporter in
our world so the idea is you need a a

188
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:51,500
our world so the idea is you need a a
 

189
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,170
our world so the idea is you need a a
piston that moves up and down and it

190
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:54,180
piston that moves up and down and it
 

191
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,120
piston that moves up and down and it
bounces the enderpearl on top here like

192
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,130
bounces the enderpearl on top here like
 

193
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,240
bounces the enderpearl on top here like
when you throw it this piston needs to

194
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,250
when you throw it this piston needs to
 

195
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,550
when you throw it this piston needs to
move up and and bounce it back up before

196
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:01,560
move up and and bounce it back up before
 

197
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,590
move up and and bounce it back up before
it hits the ground if it hits the slime

198
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
it hits the ground if it hits the slime
 

199
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,360
it hits the ground if it hits the slime
block it does actually absorb it so it

200
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,370
block it does actually absorb it so it
 

201
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,689
block it does actually absorb it so it
has to be moving when it hits it all

202
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:08,699
has to be moving when it hits it all
 

203
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:09,890
has to be moving when it hits it all
right guys so we're going to be doing

204
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:09,900
right guys so we're going to be doing
 

205
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,689
right guys so we're going to be doing
some experiments together here some

206
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:11,699
some experiments together here some
 

207
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,610
some experiments together here some
research I did not spend a lot of time

208
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:13,620
research I did not spend a lot of time
 

209
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,070
research I did not spend a lot of time
on this yet I did figure out a method

210
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
on this yet I did figure out a method
 

211
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,400
on this yet I did figure out a method
that works oh this isn't it I just want

212
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,410
that works oh this isn't it I just want
 

213
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,560
that works oh this isn't it I just want
to see if this works or not if it does

214
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:21,570
to see if this works or not if it does
 

215
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,700
to see if this works or not if it does
it's going to be a little bit more

216
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:22,710
it's going to be a little bit more
 

217
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,000
it's going to be a little bit more
compact than what I did before so it's

218
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,010
compact than what I did before so it's
 

219
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,680
compact than what I did before so it's
just a sticky piston with a slime block

220
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:27,690
just a sticky piston with a slime block
 

221
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,260
just a sticky piston with a slime block
and I got a comparator clock I'm going

222
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:30,270
and I got a comparator clock I'm going
 

223
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,909
and I got a comparator clock I'm going
to move it up and down really quickly

224
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
to move it up and down really quickly
 

225
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,920
to move it up and down really quickly
like that and then what we're going to

226
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:33,930
like that and then what we're going to
 

227
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,270
like that and then what we're going to
want to do put a water source here the

228
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:38,280
want to do put a water source here the
 

229
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,610
want to do put a water source here the
water slows down the enderpearls they

230
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:40,620
water slows down the enderpearls they
 

231
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,580
water slows down the enderpearls they
have higher friction in water than in

232
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:43,590
have higher friction in water than in
 

233
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,850
have higher friction in water than in
air and we want them moving as slow as

234
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:46,860
air and we want them moving as slow as
 

235
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,320
air and we want them moving as slow as
possible so it's more likely to bounce

236
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,330
possible so it's more likely to bounce
 

237
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,050
possible so it's more likely to bounce
off the sticky piston or the slime block

238
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,060
off the sticky piston or the slime block
 

239
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,320
off the sticky piston or the slime block
there then what we're going to do is

240
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,330
there then what we're going to do is
 

241
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,430
there then what we're going to do is
just to make a column with water up here

242
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
just to make a column with water up here
 

243
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,960
just to make a column with water up here
when I did this before like I tried this

244
00:05:59,960 --> 00:05:59,970
when I did this before like I tried this
 

245
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,700
when I did this before like I tried this
one slime blocks first came out and I

246
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:01,710
one slime blocks first came out and I
 

247
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,830
one slime blocks first came out and I
was only able to make it bounce twice in

248
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
was only able to make it bounce twice in
 

249
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,300
was only able to make it bounce twice in
a row I think I might have got it

250
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,310
a row I think I might have got it
 

251
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,339
a row I think I might have got it
bounced three times in a row a couple

252
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:07,349
bounced three times in a row a couple
 

253
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:09,350
bounced three times in a row a couple
times I just never could get it

254
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
times I just never could get it
 

255
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,779
times I just never could get it
consistently working because I was

256
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:11,789
consistently working because I was
 

257
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,629
consistently working because I was
trying to precisely time everything and

258
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
trying to precisely time everything and
 

259
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,399
trying to precisely time everything and
it turns out if you just spam the piston

260
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:16,409
it turns out if you just spam the piston
 

261
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,440
it turns out if you just spam the piston
like this it actually works

262
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,450
like this it actually works
 

263
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,610
like this it actually works
very simple all right so if we throw

264
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:23,620
very simple all right so if we throw
 

265
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,500
very simple all right so if we throw
this up there's a chance I think it

266
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:25,510
this up there's a chance I think it
 

267
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,220
this up there's a chance I think it
might work okay that didn't work let's

268
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,230
might work okay that didn't work let's
 

269
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,570
might work okay that didn't work let's
do a couple times here

270
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:30,580
do a couple times here
 

271
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,840
do a couple times here
I don't know how consistent this is nope

272
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:35,850
I don't know how consistent this is nope
 

273
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,210
I don't know how consistent this is nope
whoa that's cool we can actually bounce

274
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:39,220
whoa that's cool we can actually bounce
 

275
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,620
whoa that's cool we can actually bounce
in the water up off the slime block yeah

276
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:43,630
in the water up off the slime block yeah
 

277
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,910
in the water up off the slime block yeah
it's not looking very good for this

278
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:46,920

 

279
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,440

let's try a couple more times just in

280
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,450
let's try a couple more times just in
 

281
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,850
let's try a couple more times just in
case we're getting unlucky or something

282
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:50,860
case we're getting unlucky or something
 

283
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,780
case we're getting unlucky or something
oh that one seems to take longer before

284
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:54,790
oh that one seems to take longer before
 

285
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,910
oh that one seems to take longer before
it stops now okay this isn't very good

286
00:06:59,910 --> 00:06:59,920
it stops now okay this isn't very good
 

287
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,130
it stops now okay this isn't very good
this method my other one I try to

288
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:02,140
this method my other one I try to
 

289
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,840
this method my other one I try to
earlier work better than this so I'm

290
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:03,850
earlier work better than this so I'm
 

291
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,170
earlier work better than this so I'm
going to redo this okay so this is the

292
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:07,180
going to redo this okay so this is the
 

293
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,030
going to redo this okay so this is the
method that I got working earlier today

294
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,040
method that I got working earlier today
 

295
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,430
method that I got working earlier today
in a creative world it's pretty much the

296
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
in a creative world it's pretty much the
 

297
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,810
in a creative world it's pretty much the
same thing except I'm using regular

298
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:12,820
same thing except I'm using regular
 

299
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,790
same thing except I'm using regular
Pistons one's going up one's going down

300
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
Pistons one's going up one's going down
 

301
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Pistons one's going up one's going down
here and we have two slime blocks this

302
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:19,810
here and we have two slime blocks this
 

303
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,030
here and we have two slime blocks this
is the one we're going to bounce it off

304
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,040
is the one we're going to bounce it off
 

305
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,300
is the one we're going to bounce it off
of this one over here in the middle

306
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,310
of this one over here in the middle
 

307
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,580
of this one over here in the middle
hopefully again I haven't played around

308
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:26,590
hopefully again I haven't played around
 

309
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,980
hopefully again I haven't played around
with this much so hopefully it actually

310
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:28,990
with this much so hopefully it actually
 

311
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,800
with this much so hopefully it actually
works okay we get it going like that and

312
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:33,810
works okay we get it going like that and
 

313
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,970
works okay we get it going like that and
same thing as before we're just going to

314
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:35,980
same thing as before we're just going to
 

315
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,370
same thing as before we're just going to
try throw an ender pearl up here and

316
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:40,380
try throw an ender pearl up here and
 

317
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,810
try throw an ender pearl up here and
look at that look how easy that is

318
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:44,820
look at that look how easy that is
 

319
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,900
look at that look how easy that is
unbelievable so cool so it's going to

320
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:48,910
unbelievable so cool so it's going to
 

321
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,110
unbelievable so cool so it's going to
keep bouncing on that slime block as far

322
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,120
keep bouncing on that slime block as far
 

323
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,960
keep bouncing on that slime block as far
as I could tell indefinitely like it's

324
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:54,970
as I could tell indefinitely like it's
 

325
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,730
as I could tell indefinitely like it's
always pushing at the same amount and

326
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:56,740
always pushing at the same amount and
 

327
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,460
always pushing at the same amount and
activating at the exact same time it's

328
00:07:59,460 --> 00:07:59,470
activating at the exact same time it's
 

329
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,470
activating at the exact same time it's
kind of caught in a loop there so it's

330
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:01,480
kind of caught in a loop there so it's
 

331
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,730
kind of caught in a loop there so it's
going to keep going until you actually

332
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:02,740
going to keep going until you actually
 

333
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,730
going to keep going until you actually
shut off the machine and then it can hit

334
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:05,740
shut off the machine and then it can hit
 

335
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,630
shut off the machine and then it can hit
the ground and then you will teleport

336
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:08,640
the ground and then you will teleport
 

337
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,870
the ground and then you will teleport
that was weird as far as I could tell

338
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:12,880
that was weird as far as I could tell
 

339
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,250
that was weird as far as I could tell
earlier though oh we're fine we're good

340
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:16,260
earlier though oh we're fine we're good
 

341
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,360
earlier though oh we're fine we're good
earlier it didn't seem like I could get

342
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,370
earlier it didn't seem like I could get
 

343
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,420
earlier it didn't seem like I could get
it working 100% though so we might try

344
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:21,430
it working 100% though so we might try
 

345
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,470
it working 100% though so we might try
to refine this a bit more today

346
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:25,480

 

347
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:31,180

but it's pretty good like oh shut it off

348
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,190
but it's pretty good like oh shut it off
 

349
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,459
but it's pretty good like oh shut it off
again like it seemed to work at least

350
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:33,469
again like it seemed to work at least
 

351
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:35,550
again like it seemed to work at least
50% of the times I throw an ender pearl

352
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:35,560
50% of the times I throw an ender pearl
 

353
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,800
50% of the times I throw an ender pearl
let's try it again

354
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:37,810
let's try it again
 

355
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,300
let's try it again
so you're wondering probably well how am

356
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:40,310
so you're wondering probably well how am
 

357
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,800
so you're wondering probably well how am
I going to use this is a teleporter I'll

358
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:41,810
I going to use this is a teleporter I'll
 

359
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,360
I going to use this is a teleporter I'll
show you that in just a second here

360
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,370

 

361
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,040

actually it's pretty consistent isn't it

362
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,050
actually it's pretty consistent isn't it
 

363
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,500
actually it's pretty consistent isn't it
that's three in a row it works so it's

364
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:50,510
that's three in a row it works so it's
 

365
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,780
that's three in a row it works so it's
not bad not bad at all

366
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:52,790
not bad not bad at all
 

367
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,820
not bad not bad at all
so we can leave the chunk and come back

368
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:54,830
so we can leave the chunk and come back
 

369
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,220
so we can leave the chunk and come back
in it or leave like the load of chunks

370
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,230
in it or leave like the load of chunks
 

371
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,050
in it or leave like the load of chunks
in combat and it's still fine as far as

372
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,060
in combat and it's still fine as far as
 

373
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,800
in combat and it's still fine as far as
I could tell so we got to look into ways

374
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:02,810
I could tell so we got to look into ways
 

375
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,070
I could tell so we got to look into ways
of remotely flipping the switch

376
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
of remotely flipping the switch
 

377
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,350
of remotely flipping the switch
basically activating it if you're

378
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:08,360
basically activating it if you're
 

379
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,480
basically activating it if you're
playing on a server you could have your

380
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,490
playing on a server you could have your
 

381
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,130
playing on a server you could have your
ender pearl bouncing up and down and

382
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:12,140
ender pearl bouncing up and down and
 

383
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,210
ender pearl bouncing up and down and
then if a player wanted to like call you

384
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:16,220
then if a player wanted to like call you
 

385
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,070
then if a player wanted to like call you
their base for example if you have your

386
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
their base for example if you have your
 

387
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,720
their base for example if you have your
ender pearl at their base bouncing up

388
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:19,730
ender pearl at their base bouncing up
 

389
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,640
ender pearl at their base bouncing up
and down they could just push a button

390
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:21,650
and down they could just push a button
 

391
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,450
and down they could just push a button
and you'd be there instantly they could

392
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:25,460
and you'd be there instantly they could
 

393
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,520
and you'd be there instantly they could
instantly teleport you to their base

394
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:27,530
instantly teleport you to their base
 

395
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,710
instantly teleport you to their base
whenever they want to do for example it

396
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:29,720
whenever they want to do for example it
 

397
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,000
whenever they want to do for example it
is pretty cool

398
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,010
is pretty cool
 

399
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,829
is pretty cool
but in single-player it's a little bit

400
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:32,839
but in single-player it's a little bit
 

401
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,000
but in single-player it's a little bit
more tricky because you don't have that

402
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,010
more tricky because you don't have that
 

403
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,400
more tricky because you don't have that
other player loading the chunks and and

404
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:36,410
other player loading the chunks and and
 

405
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,170
other player loading the chunks and and
activating it for you you got to come up

406
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:38,180
activating it for you you got to come up
 

407
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,360
activating it for you you got to come up
with your own methods the first one I

408
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,370
with your own methods the first one I
 

409
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,900
with your own methods the first one I
want to try is just a hopper clock and

410
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:42,910
want to try is just a hopper clock and
 

411
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,550
want to try is just a hopper clock and
I'm going to build it between chunk

412
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:45,560
I'm going to build it between chunk
 

413
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,380
I'm going to build it between chunk
boundaries so hopefully it keeps the

414
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:47,390
boundaries so hopefully it keeps the
 

415
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,000
boundaries so hopefully it keeps the
chunk loaded so it says chunk 15 chunk 0

416
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,010
chunk loaded so it says chunk 15 chunk 0
 

417
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,440
chunk loaded so it says chunk 15 chunk 0
I think this is a chunk boundary between

418
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,450
I think this is a chunk boundary between
 

419
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,170
I think this is a chunk boundary between
this and this that's where I'm going to

420
00:09:59,170 --> 00:09:59,180
this and this that's where I'm going to
 

421
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,700
this and this that's where I'm going to
put the hoppers the items will flow

422
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:00,710
put the hoppers the items will flow
 

423
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,140
put the hoppers the items will flow
through and hopefully keep the chunks

424
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,150
through and hopefully keep the chunks
 

425
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:07,060
through and hopefully keep the chunks
loaded and let me set this up alright

426
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,070
loaded and let me set this up alright
 

427
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,920
loaded and let me set this up alright
guys so here is our experiment this is

428
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:08,930
guys so here is our experiment this is
 

429
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,240
guys so here is our experiment this is
what we're going to try to do we have

430
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,250
what we're going to try to do we have
 

431
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,130
what we're going to try to do we have
two stacks of items in here so that will

432
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:12,140
two stacks of items in here so that will
 

433
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,010
two stacks of items in here so that will
give us a little bit of time we have the

434
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,020
give us a little bit of time we have the
 

435
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,900
give us a little bit of time we have the
hoppers between chunk boundaries so

436
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:16,910
hoppers between chunk boundaries so
 

437
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,760
hoppers between chunk boundaries so
hopefully this chunk over here stays

438
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:18,770
hopefully this chunk over here stays
 

439
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,400
hopefully this chunk over here stays
loaded and this machine keeps working

440
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,410
loaded and this machine keeps working
 

441
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,520
loaded and this machine keeps working
and after a certain amount of time we

442
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:27,530
and after a certain amount of time we
 

443
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,699
and after a certain amount of time we
should be able to teleport

444
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:30,709
should be able to teleport
 

445
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,530
should be able to teleport
although the as I'm thinking about this

446
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:32,540
although the as I'm thinking about this
 

447
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,009
although the as I'm thinking about this
I almost doubting it now but we're going

448
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:36,019
I almost doubting it now but we're going
 

449
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:37,509
I almost doubting it now but we're going
to run far away from here so that

450
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
to run far away from here so that
 

451
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,160
to run far away from here so that
hopefully we're far enough away the

452
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,170
hopefully we're far enough away the
 

453
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,559
hopefully we're far enough away the
chunks unload and we'll just see if we

454
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:41,569
chunks unload and we'll just see if we
 

455
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:44,530
chunks unload and we'll just see if we
randomly teleport back there after a

456
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:44,540
randomly teleport back there after a
 

457
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,540
randomly teleport back there after a
certain amount of time the reason I

458
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:46,550
certain amount of time the reason I
 

459
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,660
certain amount of time the reason I
think it might not work is because when

460
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:49,670
think it might not work is because when
 

461
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,840
think it might not work is because when
you load chunks in this way with with

462
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:52,850
you load chunks in this way with with
 

463
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,720
you load chunks in this way with with
redstone and stuff it doesn't actually

464
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:54,730
redstone and stuff it doesn't actually
 

465
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,689
redstone and stuff it doesn't actually
load entities so I don't think that

466
00:10:58,689 --> 00:10:58,699
load entities so I don't think that
 

467
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:02,019
load entities so I don't think that
enderpearl will be moving when the chunk

468
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:02,029
enderpearl will be moving when the chunk
 

469
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:06,150
enderpearl will be moving when the chunk
is being loaded with the hoppers there

470
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
is being loaded with the hoppers there
 

471
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,759
is being loaded with the hoppers there
maybe if we push the Pistons into the

472
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:09,769
maybe if we push the Pistons into the
 

473
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,499
maybe if we push the Pistons into the
ender pearl it'll activate it but on its

474
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:11,509
ender pearl it'll activate it but on its
 

475
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:14,590
ender pearl it'll activate it but on its
own I kind of doubt it but we'll see

476
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:14,600
own I kind of doubt it but we'll see
 

477
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,970
own I kind of doubt it but we'll see
I'll give it a little bit of time here

478
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:15,980
I'll give it a little bit of time here
 

479
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,230
I'll give it a little bit of time here
ah

480
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:19,240

 

481
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:27,669

yes yay that is so cool so the idea is

482
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:27,679
yes yay that is so cool so the idea is
 

483
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,090
yes yay that is so cool so the idea is
like I could be at my amplified base for

484
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:31,100
like I could be at my amplified base for
 

485
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,009
like I could be at my amplified base for
example that's thousands of blocks away

486
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:33,019
example that's thousands of blocks away
 

487
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:36,069
example that's thousands of blocks away
I might need to run an errand to my

488
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
I might need to run an errand to my
 

489
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,689
I might need to run an errand to my
mancave here to pick something up and

490
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:37,699
mancave here to pick something up and
 

491
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,790
mancave here to pick something up and
then I want to go back what I could do

492
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:39,800
then I want to go back what I could do
 

493
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,829
then I want to go back what I could do
is just activate a machine like this on

494
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
is just activate a machine like this on
 

495
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,949
is just activate a machine like this on
a timer and run over to the man cave and

496
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:44,959
a timer and run over to the man cave and
 

497
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,179
a timer and run over to the man cave and
then after a certain amount of time I

498
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:46,189
then after a certain amount of time I
 

499
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:47,829
then after a certain amount of time I
would just get teleported back I want to

500
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
would just get teleported back I want to
 

501
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,019
would just get teleported back I want to
have to walk back so that would be

502
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:50,029
have to walk back so that would be
 

503
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:52,480
have to walk back so that would be
pretty cool this is like a simple way of

504
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:52,490
pretty cool this is like a simple way of
 

505
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,900
pretty cool this is like a simple way of
doing it but it's not very controllable

506
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:55,910
doing it but it's not very controllable
 

507
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,280
doing it but it's not very controllable
so we're going to look into one other

508
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,290
so we're going to look into one other
 

509
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,059
so we're going to look into one other
method here oh I might have got excited

510
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:01,069
method here oh I might have got excited
 

511
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:03,100
method here oh I might have got excited
a little too soon didn't work this time

512
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,110
a little too soon didn't work this time
 

513
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,799
a little too soon didn't work this time
I I'm all the way over at the stronghold

514
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:05,809
I I'm all the way over at the stronghold
 

515
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,869
I I'm all the way over at the stronghold
base I'm going to make my way back and

516
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:07,879
base I'm going to make my way back and
 

517
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,369
base I'm going to make my way back and
just see if we teleport eventually here

518
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:11,379
just see if we teleport eventually here
 

519
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:15,269
just see if we teleport eventually here
okay so check this out we're at Zed 650

520
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
okay so check this out we're at Zed 650
 

521
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,530
okay so check this out we're at Zed 650
we can probably go even a little bit

522
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:17,540
we can probably go even a little bit
 

523
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,009
we can probably go even a little bit
further here probably up to 700 it's

524
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:21,019
further here probably up to 700 it's
 

525
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:21,929
further here probably up to 700 it's
been doing a little bit more

526
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:21,939
been doing a little bit more
 

527
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:25,569
been doing a little bit more
experimenting should teleport any second

528
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:25,579
experimenting should teleport any second
 

529
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,139
experimenting should teleport any second
I believe maybe not maybe I got too far

530
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:29,149
I believe maybe not maybe I got too far
 

531
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:34,419
I believe maybe not maybe I got too far
away there we go and now we're at 206 on

532
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:34,429
away there we go and now we're at 206 on
 

533
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:36,429
away there we go and now we're at 206 on
the Zed so we teleported like five

534
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:36,439
the Zed so we teleported like five
 

535
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:39,009
the Zed so we teleported like five
hundred blocks there the reason we were

536
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:39,019
hundred blocks there the reason we were
 

537
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,929
hundred blocks there the reason we were
able to do that is because I turned my

538
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:40,939
able to do that is because I turned my
 

539
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:44,470
able to do that is because I turned my
chunks render distance up to 32

540
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
chunks render distance up to 32
 

541
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,600
chunks render distance up to 32
and 32 times 16 is 512 at 16 chunks

542
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:49,610
and 32 times 16 is 512 at 16 chunks
 

543
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,680
and 32 times 16 is 512 at 16 chunks
render we can only teleport 256 blocks

544
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:52,690
render we can only teleport 256 blocks
 

545
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,550
render we can only teleport 256 blocks
from the teleporter here so it turns out

546
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:57,560
from the teleporter here so it turns out
 

547
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,819
from the teleporter here so it turns out
there might be some limitations to this

548
00:12:59,819 --> 00:12:59,829
there might be some limitations to this
 

549
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:02,470
there might be some limitations to this
when it doesn't work when I go far away

550
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
when it doesn't work when I go far away
 

551
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,920
when it doesn't work when I go far away
outside of the render distance and it

552
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:05,930
outside of the render distance and it
 

553
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,740
outside of the render distance and it
doesn't teleport me and I come back the

554
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:08,750
doesn't teleport me and I come back the
 

555
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,990
doesn't teleport me and I come back the
ender pearl isn't there anymore like

556
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,000
ender pearl isn't there anymore like
 

557
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,670
ender pearl isn't there anymore like
it's not bouncing around in here still

558
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:12,680
it's not bouncing around in here still
 

559
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,790
it's not bouncing around in here still
it's not doesn't teleport me to the spot

560
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:15,800
it's not doesn't teleport me to the spot
 

561
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,620
it's not doesn't teleport me to the spot
once the chunks load again it's just

562
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:17,630
once the chunks load again it's just
 

563
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,490
once the chunks load again it's just
gone so it's like it's getting destroyed

564
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:21,500
gone so it's like it's getting destroyed
 

565
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,810
gone so it's like it's getting destroyed
or hitting something but it's not

566
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:22,820
or hitting something but it's not
 

567
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,970
or hitting something but it's not
actually teleporting me when that

568
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:24,980
actually teleporting me when that
 

569
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,360
actually teleporting me when that
happens

570
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:27,370

 

571
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,370

all right everybody so this is now quite

572
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:30,380
all right everybody so this is now quite
 

573
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,900
all right everybody so this is now quite
a bit later here I've been playing

574
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:31,910
a bit later here I've been playing
 

575
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,300
a bit later here I've been playing
around with this idea kind of figure out

576
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,310
around with this idea kind of figure out
 

577
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,449
around with this idea kind of figure out
the mechanics what's going on and I got

578
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:37,459
the mechanics what's going on and I got
 

579
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:40,389
the mechanics what's going on and I got
a good grasp of it now so the big issue

580
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:40,399
a good grasp of it now so the big issue
 

581
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,790
a good grasp of it now so the big issue
was because I was playing on the 1.8

582
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
was because I was playing on the 1.8
 

583
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,280
was because I was playing on the 1.8
free one release of the game I've now

584
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,290
free one release of the game I've now
 

585
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,639
free one release of the game I've now
updated to one point eight point four I

586
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:47,649
updated to one point eight point four I
 

587
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:50,860
updated to one point eight point four I
might and I might teleport here I'm not

588
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:50,870
might and I might teleport here I'm not
 

589
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:58,269
might and I might teleport here I'm not
sure maybe maybe not no oh there we go I

590
00:13:58,269 --> 00:13:58,279
sure maybe maybe not no oh there we go I
 

591
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,400
sure maybe maybe not no oh there we go I
had an ender pearl left in midair there

592
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:00,410
had an ender pearl left in midair there
 

593
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,850
had an ender pearl left in midair there
as one reef is going to take me back yes

594
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:03,860
as one reef is going to take me back yes
 

595
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,250
as one reef is going to take me back yes
I was in the one point eight four or at

596
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:06,260
I was in the one point eight four or at
 

597
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,879
I was in the one point eight four or at
one point eight pre-release and in that

598
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:09,889
one point eight pre-release and in that
 

599
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:12,490
one point eight pre-release and in that
version the reason the ender pearls were

600
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:12,500
version the reason the ender pearls were
 

601
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,920
version the reason the ender pearls were
just disappearing on me is because like

602
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:14,930
just disappearing on me is because like
 

603
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,449
just disappearing on me is because like
if you throw an ender pearl leave the

604
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:16,459
if you throw an ender pearl leave the
 

605
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,790
if you throw an ender pearl leave the
game and come back it doesn't actually

606
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
game and come back it doesn't actually
 

607
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,550
game and come back it doesn't actually
save the the pearl it's it's just gone

608
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:21,560
save the the pearl it's it's just gone
 

609
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,160
save the the pearl it's it's just gone
when you come back in the 1.8 for

610
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,170
when you come back in the 1.8 for
 

611
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,079
when you come back in the 1.8 for
release though it does save it properly

612
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:26,089
release though it does save it properly
 

613
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:29,800
release though it does save it properly
and because of that the end reporter is

614
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:29,810
and because of that the end reporter is
 

615
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,389
and because of that the end reporter is
going to happen guys it actually works

616
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:31,399
going to happen guys it actually works
 

617
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,699
going to happen guys it actually works
in 1.84 which I'm pretty happy about

618
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:35,709
in 1.84 which I'm pretty happy about
 

619
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,579
in 1.84 which I'm pretty happy about
still the same thing though as before

620
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:38,589
still the same thing though as before
 

621
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:41,710
still the same thing though as before
those chunks over there they're not

622
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:41,720
those chunks over there they're not
 

623
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,170
those chunks over there they're not
going to load the entities even though

624
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:44,180
going to load the entities even though
 

625
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,910
going to load the entities even though
the redstone is probably still running

626
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
the redstone is probably still running
 

627
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,590
the redstone is probably still running
right now so it's not until I get back

628
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:50,600
right now so it's not until I get back
 

629
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,620
right now so it's not until I get back
within render range which is about 500

630
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:55,630
within render range which is about 500
 

631
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,180
within render range which is about 500
or somewhere around the jungle tree

632
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,190
or somewhere around the jungle tree
 

633
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,210
or somewhere around the jungle tree
leave is when we get within 256 blocks

634
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:01,220
leave is when we get within 256 blocks
 

635
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:07,120
leave is when we get within 256 blocks
of the timer thing all right let's just

636
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,130
of the timer thing all right let's just
 

637
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,430
of the timer thing all right let's just
ender pearl there yes should be time up

638
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
ender pearl there yes should be time up
 

639
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,250
ender pearl there yes should be time up
by now I would think so we should just

640
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:12,260
by now I would think so we should just
 

641
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,010
by now I would think so we should just
randomly teleport as soon as those

642
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,020
randomly teleport as soon as those
 

643
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,580
randomly teleport as soon as those
chunks load within my render range I

644
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:17,590
chunks load within my render range I
 

645
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,420
chunks load within my render range I
think there we go and now we're back

646
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:22,430
think there we go and now we're back
 

647
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,960
think there we go and now we're back
yours so by now I'm guessing some of you

648
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:25,970
yours so by now I'm guessing some of you
 

649
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,730
yours so by now I'm guessing some of you
your eyes are glazing over and you're

650
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:27,740
your eyes are glazing over and you're
 

651
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,100
your eyes are glazing over and you're
like etho get to the point man why

652
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,110
like etho get to the point man why
 

653
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,290
like etho get to the point man why
should I care about this how can I use

654
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:32,300
should I care about this how can I use
 

655
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,230
should I care about this how can I use
it well I'm going to show you something

656
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:35,240
it well I'm going to show you something
 

657
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,580
it well I'm going to show you something
I've set up here I've been working on

658
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:36,590
I've set up here I've been working on
 

659
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,460
I've set up here I've been working on
this for a little while and I got three

660
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:39,470
this for a little while and I got three
 

661
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,950
this for a little while and I got three
ender borders set up in my world right

662
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:41,960
ender borders set up in my world right
 

663
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,890
ender borders set up in my world right
now we can add more but I got one in the

664
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:44,900
now we can add more but I got one in the
 

665
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,100
now we can add more but I got one in the
man cave over here so I've just got

666
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,110
man cave over here so I've just got
 

667
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,810
man cave over here so I've just got
suspended ender pearls at all three of

668
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:49,820
suspended ender pearls at all three of
 

669
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
suspended ender pearls at all three of
them and they're hooked together with

670
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:51,830
them and they're hooked together with
 

671
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,680
them and they're hooked together with
redstone this is the other way we can

672
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:53,690
redstone this is the other way we can
 

673
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,830
redstone this is the other way we can
control it instead of using a timer tap

674
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:56,840
control it instead of using a timer tap
 

675
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,410
control it instead of using a timer tap
a button and this is probably the best

676
00:15:59,410 --> 00:15:59,420
a button and this is probably the best
 

677
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,720
a button and this is probably the best
way of doing it honestly so when I hit

678
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:01,730
way of doing it honestly so when I hit
 

679
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,430
way of doing it honestly so when I hit
this button it's going to activate the

680
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
this button it's going to activate the
 

681
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,980
this button it's going to activate the
other end reporter that I have by the

682
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:05,990
other end reporter that I have by the
 

683
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,900
other end reporter that I have by the
lake here all right this is the Midway

684
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:10,910
lake here all right this is the Midway
 

685
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,050
lake here all right this is the Midway
one over here so I also have another one

686
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:14,060
one over here so I also have another one
 

687
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,870
one over here so I also have another one
over the Nexus this button takes me to

688
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
over the Nexus this button takes me to
 

689
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,490
over the Nexus this button takes me to
the man cave this one takes me to the

690
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:18,500
the man cave this one takes me to the
 

691
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,970
the man cave this one takes me to the
Nexus before I do before i teleport

692
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:21,980
Nexus before I do before i teleport
 

693
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,610
Nexus before I do before i teleport
again I would want to reset the ender

694
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:24,620
again I would want to reset the ender
 

695
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,820
again I would want to reset the ender
pearl here and like if this is my

696
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:27,830
pearl here and like if this is my
 

697
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,890
pearl here and like if this is my
destination fine I can go do stuff but

698
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:29,900
destination fine I can go do stuff but
 

699
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,470
destination fine I can go do stuff but
if I want to do the Nexus now hit that

700
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
if I want to do the Nexus now hit that
 

701
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:32,830
if I want to do the Nexus now hit that
one

702
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:32,840
one
 

703
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,810
one
and bam we're at the Nexus which is

704
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:37,820
and bam we're at the Nexus which is
 

705
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,880
and bam we're at the Nexus which is
pretty cool isn't it like we've

706
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:39,890
pretty cool isn't it like we've
 

707
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,010
pretty cool isn't it like we've
transported hundreds and hundreds of

708
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,020
transported hundreds and hundreds of
 

709
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,210
transported hundreds and hundreds of
blocks in seconds doing this and we can

710
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:46,220
blocks in seconds doing this and we can
 

711
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,960
blocks in seconds doing this and we can
set up a network of these all over the

712
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:49,970
set up a network of these all over the
 

713
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,400
set up a network of these all over the
place they're really easy to set up

714
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:51,410
place they're really easy to set up
 

715
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,560
place they're really easy to set up
they're pretty easy to wire the only

716
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:53,570
they're pretty easy to wire the only
 

717
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,240
they're pretty easy to wire the only
real pain of this is we've got to run a

718
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,250
real pain of this is we've got to run a
 

719
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,410
real pain of this is we've got to run a
redstone wire or two of them actually

720
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:58,420
redstone wire or two of them actually
 

721
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,579
redstone wire or two of them actually
between all the end reporters and these

722
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:00,589
between all the end reporters and these
 

723
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:04,540
between all the end reporters and these
stretch like hundreds of blocks yeah so

724
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:04,550
stretch like hundreds of blocks yeah so
 

725
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,460
stretch like hundreds of blocks yeah so
basically the way this works let's say

726
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:06,470
basically the way this works let's say
 

727
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,530
basically the way this works let's say
this is the end reporter by the lake

728
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:08,540
this is the end reporter by the lake
 

729
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,470
this is the end reporter by the lake
this is the one at the man cave that

730
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:11,480
this is the one at the man cave that
 

731
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,100
this is the one at the man cave that
button over

732
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,110
button over
 

733
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,520
button over
they're from the man cave has to connect

734
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:15,530
they're from the man cave has to connect
 

735
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,819
they're from the man cave has to connect
to the clock at the lake and then the

736
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:18,829
to the clock at the lake and then the
 

737
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,100
to the clock at the lake and then the
lake one has a button that connects to

738
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,110
lake one has a button that connects to
 

739
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,620
lake one has a button that connects to
the clock at the man cave here so we

740
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:23,630
the clock at the man cave here so we
 

741
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,020
the clock at the man cave here so we
have two wires running between them and

742
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,030
have two wires running between them and
 

743
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,690
have two wires running between them and
basically from the lake Oh

744
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:31,700
basically from the lake Oh
 

745
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,240
basically from the lake Oh
it activates this wire down here and

746
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,250
it activates this wire down here and
 

747
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,600
it activates this wire down here and
once once it triggers this clock once it

748
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:37,610
once once it triggers this clock once it
 

749
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,760
once once it triggers this clock once it
shuts it off for a split second that

750
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:39,770
shuts it off for a split second that
 

751
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,370
shuts it off for a split second that
allows the ender pearl to land and we

752
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:42,380
allows the ender pearl to land and we
 

753
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,400
allows the ender pearl to land and we
get teleported because it's within

754
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:45,410
get teleported because it's within
 

755
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,470
get teleported because it's within
render range it's only about 200 blocks

756
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:47,480
render range it's only about 200 blocks
 

757
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,950
render range it's only about 200 blocks
away from here so yeah let's just go

758
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
away from here so yeah let's just go
 

759
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,510
away from here so yeah let's just go
over really quickly I tried to simplify

760
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:52,520
over really quickly I tried to simplify
 

761
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,400
over really quickly I tried to simplify
this the best that I could because it's

762
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,410
this the best that I could because it's
 

763
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,390
this the best that I could because it's
kind of complicated right these are the

764
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
kind of complicated right these are the
 

765
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,250
kind of complicated right these are the
conditions you need if you want to do

766
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:00,260
conditions you need if you want to do
 

767
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,530
conditions you need if you want to do
this you should be using Minecraft 1.8

768
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:02,540
this you should be using Minecraft 1.8
 

769
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,440
this you should be using Minecraft 1.8
for or later the ender Porter needs a

770
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:05,450
for or later the ender Porter needs a
 

771
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,480
for or later the ender Porter needs a
trigger device so either a button like

772
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:07,490
trigger device so either a button like
 

773
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,610
trigger device so either a button like
that or it needs a clock like we played

774
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:09,620
that or it needs a clock like we played
 

775
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,310
that or it needs a clock like we played
around with before it actually activate

776
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,320
around with before it actually activate
 

777
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,409
around with before it actually activate
it to disable it so the ender protein

778
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:14,419
it to disable it so the ender protein
 

779
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:17,620
it to disable it so the ender protein
land and the ender pearl must be in a

780
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:17,630
land and the ender pearl must be in a
 

781
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,740
land and the ender pearl must be in a
loaded chunk and there's three ways I

782
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:20,750
loaded chunk and there's three ways I
 

783
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,570
loaded chunk and there's three ways I
know of doing that you can either load

784
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:22,580
know of doing that you can either load
 

785
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,990
know of doing that you can either load
the chunk by yourself which is limited

786
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
the chunk by yourself which is limited
 

787
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,669
the chunk by yourself which is limited
by the render distance you have so

788
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
by the render distance you have so
 

789
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,620
by the render distance you have so
however many chunks times 16 where is it

790
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:35,630
however many chunks times 16 where is it

today um so yeah you see other compass

854
00:19:59,590 --> 00:19:59,600
today um so yeah you see other compass

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:14,960
so we just crossed into a new chunk so
 

867
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,220
so we just crossed into a new chunk so
we go one one chunk two chunks three

this log here is as far as entities will
 

875
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,240
this log here is as far as entities will
be loaded so if we set up one here it

876
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,250
be loaded so if we set up one here it
 

877
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,790
be loaded so if we set up one here it

930
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:49,889
several of them going I don't know if
 

931
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:52,850
several of them going I don't know if
I'd really recommend that though and the

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:52,860
I'd really recommend that though and the
 

933
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,370
I'd really recommend that though and the
other thing it turns out this backing

934
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:55,380
other thing it turns out this backing
 

935
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,440
other thing it turns out this backing
over here that I got is actually pretty

936
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:57,450
over here that I got is actually pretty
 

937
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,710
over here that I got is actually pretty
important to stabilizing them somehow

938
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
important to stabilizing them somehow
 

939
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,879
important to stabilizing them somehow
it's affecting their their thing or at

940
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:04,889
it's affecting their their thing or at
 

941
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:06,560
it's affecting their their thing or at
least on the setup yeah you see now

942
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:06,570
least on the setup yeah you see now
 

943
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,919
least on the setup yeah you see now
they're they're actually not staying

so you need to have that backing

948
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:16,460
so you need to have that backing
 

949
