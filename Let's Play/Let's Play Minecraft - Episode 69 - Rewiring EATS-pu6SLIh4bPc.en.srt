00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,689
doesn't get in the way and this door
seems to have been controlled by a

166
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:57,699
seems to have been controlled by a
 

167
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:02,969
seems to have been controlled by a
pressure plate down here it's an

168
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:02,979
pressure plate down here it's an
 

169
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:08,129
pressure plate down here it's an
inverted door so it would be closed if

170
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:08,139
inverted door so it would be closed if
 

171
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:09,810
inverted door so it would be closed if
something was on the pressure plate and

172
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:09,820
something was on the pressure plate and
 

173
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,960
something was on the pressure plate and
then he would be freed when this item

174
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:12,970
then he would be freed when this item
 

175
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:18,240
then he would be freed when this item
responds in five minutes which is very

176
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,250
responds in five minutes which is very
 

177
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:26,279
responds in five minutes which is very
strange so I think however this worked

178
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:26,289
strange so I think however this worked
 

179
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:29,159
strange so I think however this worked
I believe this hole here was for

180
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:29,169
I believe this hole here was for
 

181
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:36,450
I believe this hole here was for
throwing an item down and then spaz fell

182
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:36,460
throwing an item down and then spaz fell
 

183
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,540
throwing an item down and then spaz fell
down here

184
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:40,550

 

185
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,919

and then he was timed properly for this

186
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:45,929
and then he was timed properly for this
 

187
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:49,189
and then he was timed properly for this
door to open at the right time when that

188
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
door to open at the right time when that
 

189
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,089
door to open at the right time when that
despawn and then there were seems to be

190
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:53,099
despawn and then there were seems to be
 

191
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,189
despawn and then there were seems to be
solid water source blocks all the way up

192
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
solid water source blocks all the way up
 

193
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:02,469
solid water source blocks all the way up
so very clever little device by spazz

194
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
so very clever little device by spazz
 

195
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,999
so very clever little device by spazz
don't know how he came up with that one

196
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:05,009
don't know how he came up with that one
 

197
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:12,259
don't know how he came up with that one
I don't really know what happened at the

198
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:12,269
I don't really know what happened at the
 

199
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:13,790
I don't really know what happened at the
end of the last episode I was knocked

200
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:13,800
end of the last episode I was knocked
 

201
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,279
end of the last episode I was knocked
unconscious and I woke up here so I

202
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:16,289
unconscious and I woke up here so I
 

203
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:22,280
unconscious and I woke up here so I
don't know who won

204
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,290

 

205
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,770

so this spot here used to be blank but

206
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:24,780
so this spot here used to be blank but
 

207
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,430
so this spot here used to be blank but
now I've added trapdoors here so I knew

208
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,440
now I've added trapdoors here so I knew
 

209
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,910
now I've added trapdoors here so I knew
I left it blank for a reason and

210
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:30,920
I left it blank for a reason and
 

211
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,460
I left it blank for a reason and
something else I noticed apparently this

212
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:34,470
something else I noticed apparently this
 

213
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:41,300
something else I noticed apparently this
thing is broken again and I just fixed

214
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:41,310
thing is broken again and I just fixed
 

215
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,870
thing is broken again and I just fixed
it like a few days ago so now I need to

216
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
it like a few days ago so now I need to
 

217
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,050
it like a few days ago so now I need to
fix that again while we do it some other

218
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,060
fix that again while we do it some other
 

219
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,900
fix that again while we do it some other
time

220
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:49,910
time
 

221
00:08:49,910 --> 00:09:00,790
time
I want to do some work on eats today

222
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800

 

223
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,790

this place still looks rough over here

224
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800

 

225
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,260

the one thing I want to try to do today

226
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,270
the one thing I want to try to do today
 

227
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,460
the one thing I want to try to do today
is get my boat elevator working here

228
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:13,470
is get my boat elevator working here
 

229
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:23,990
is get my boat elevator working here
again so I suppose I brought some stuff

230
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
again so I suppose I brought some stuff
 

231
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,760
again so I suppose I brought some stuff
with me already get started there's a

232
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:28,770
with me already get started there's a
 

233
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,040
with me already get started there's a
few ways you could do this so I'm gonna

234
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,050
few ways you could do this so I'm gonna
 

235
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:36,500
few ways you could do this so I'm gonna
experiment with these one way I think is

236
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:36,510
experiment with these one way I think is
 

237
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:42,710
experiment with these one way I think is
just to put signs here and need some

238
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
just to put signs here and need some
 

239
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:51,630
just to put signs here and need some
more signs I go through so many signs

240
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:51,640

 

241
00:09:51,640 --> 00:10:06,360

okay and I'm going to put one over here

242
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,370

 

243
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:12,550

and that will flow good and then this

244
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
and that will flow good and then this
 

245
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,350
and that will flow good and then this
will come down here so I'm going to set

246
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:14,360
will come down here so I'm going to set
 

247
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,019
will come down here so I'm going to set
up a little ez loader here to do some

248
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:17,029
up a little ez loader here to do some
 

249
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:23,740
up a little ez loader here to do some
testing I guess I'll just put this out

250
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:23,750
testing I guess I'll just put this out
 

251
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:29,519
testing I guess I'll just put this out
here got some pressure plates with me

252
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:29,529
here got some pressure plates with me
 

253
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:42,010
here got some pressure plates with me
and do that that I think you get the

254
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:42,020
and do that that I think you get the
 

255
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,699
and do that that I think you get the
boat underneath the ladders you need to

256
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:45,709
boat underneath the ladders you need to
 

257
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,139
boat underneath the ladders you need to
put the ladder at the end of the ez

258
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:47,149
put the ladder at the end of the ez
 

259
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,910
put the ladder at the end of the ez
loader so stupid water currents so right

260
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
loader so stupid water currents so right
 

261
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,450
loader so stupid water currents so right
over here

262
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:57,460

 

263
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:12,370

J let's make us a boat and see what

264
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:12,380
J let's make us a boat and see what
 

265
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,380
J let's make us a boat and see what
happens here place in the center oh well

266
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,390
happens here place in the center oh well
 

267
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:24,910
happens here place in the center oh well
I didn't work J so the boat won't rise

268
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:24,920
I didn't work J so the boat won't rise
 

269
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:35,380
I didn't work J so the boat won't rise
like this I think I can put wood over

270
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:35,390
like this I think I can put wood over
 

271
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:41,500
like this I think I can put wood over
there and here and then I think if I get

272
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:41,510
there and here and then I think if I get
 

273
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:49,230
there and here and then I think if I get
rid of this nope

274
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:49,240

 

275
00:11:49,240 --> 00:12:08,590

hmm why isn't it rising going to put a

276
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:08,600
hmm why isn't it rising going to put a
 

277
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,370
hmm why isn't it rising going to put a
pressure plate over here oh is the

278
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:15,380
pressure plate over here oh is the
 

279
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,870
pressure plate over here oh is the
pressure plate doing it okay very

280
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:19,880
pressure plate doing it okay very
 

281
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,430
pressure plate doing it okay very
interesting so two boats I guess

282
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:24,440
interesting so two boats I guess
 

283
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:31,260
interesting so two boats I guess
pressure plates count two solid blocks

284
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:31,270

 

285
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,080

okay so I can probably put that back and

286
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,090
okay so I can probably put that back and
 

287
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,760
okay so I can probably put that back and
let's try this again I hope science

288
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:39,770
let's try this again I hope science
 

289
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,290
let's try this again I hope science
don't count as solid blocks otherwise

290
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:41,300
don't count as solid blocks otherwise
 

291
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:49,630
don't count as solid blocks otherwise
this isn't gonna work okay that time it

292
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:49,640
this isn't gonna work okay that time it
 

293
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,060
this isn't gonna work okay that time it
went under the ladder and it stops there

294
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,070
went under the ladder and it stops there
 

295
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,640
went under the ladder and it stops there
so it's one block the ladders one block

296
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:57,650
so it's one block the ladders one block
 

297
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:06,780
so it's one block the ladders one block
away from the easy loader here

298
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:06,790

 

299
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,670

let's see why isn't that working ouch I

300
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:10,680
let's see why isn't that working ouch I
 

301
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,890
let's see why isn't that working ouch I
probably have to get rid of this block

302
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:13,900
probably have to get rid of this block
 

303
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:30,510
probably have to get rid of this block
here and this one here it seems like

304
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:30,520
here and this one here it seems like
 

305
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,170
here and this one here it seems like
signs do affect the boats as well let's

306
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:34,180
signs do affect the boats as well let's
 

307
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,640
signs do affect the boats as well let's
do a little test with that we're gonna

308
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:35,650
do a little test with that we're gonna
 

309
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,300
do a little test with that we're gonna
put one just over here and if the book

310
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,310
put one just over here and if the book
 

311
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,920
put one just over here and if the book
if the boat stops there it means it

312
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:40,930
if the boat stops there it means it
 

313
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:55,470
if the boat stops there it means it
affects them yep okay um so I'm gonna

314
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:55,480
affects them yep okay um so I'm gonna
 

315
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,590
affects them yep okay um so I'm gonna
have to do a different method then I'll

316
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:58,600
have to do a different method then I'll
 

317
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,220
have to do a different method then I'll
see you in a little bit okay so to get

318
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,230
see you in a little bit okay so to get
 

319
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,620
see you in a little bit okay so to get
the boat to rise I'd seems I need to use

320
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:07,630
the boat to rise I'd seems I need to use
 

321
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:13,610
the boat to rise I'd seems I need to use
solid water source blocks for this so I

322
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:13,620
solid water source blocks for this so I
 

323
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,140
solid water source blocks for this so I
can put a glass casing around the water

324
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:16,150
can put a glass casing around the water
 

325
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,690
can put a glass casing around the water
or I think what I'm just gonna do is

326
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:18,700
or I think what I'm just gonna do is
 

327
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:24,230
or I think what I'm just gonna do is
these ladders to hold the water in place

328
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240

 

329
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,000

oops

330
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,010
oops
 

331
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,930
oops
suddenly place one of those glitch

332
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:27,940
suddenly place one of those glitch
 

333
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,960
suddenly place one of those glitch
ladders and then I'm gonna do that for

334
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:33,970
ladders and then I'm gonna do that for
 

335
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:42,060
ladders and then I'm gonna do that for
this side here just like that and I

336
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,070
this side here just like that and I
 

337
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,200
this side here just like that and I
should be able to fill this up no

338
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,210
should be able to fill this up no
 

339
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,660
should be able to fill this up no
problem

340
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:44,670
problem
 

341
00:14:44,670 --> 00:15:00,519
problem
well don't know what happened there

342
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:00,529

 

343
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:05,590

just like this

344
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600

 

345
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,910

although placing the water is going to

346
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
although placing the water is going to
 

347
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,470
although placing the water is going to
be a bit of a challenge for this corner

348
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
be a bit of a challenge for this corner
 

349
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:22,550
be a bit of a challenge for this corner
here Oh missed oh no is that stupid

350
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
here Oh missed oh no is that stupid
 

351
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,480
here Oh missed oh no is that stupid
glitch where it destroys a ladder again

352
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:28,490

 

353
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,829

okay well this is getting annoying quick

354
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:32,839
okay well this is getting annoying quick
 

355
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,300
okay well this is getting annoying quick
so what I'm gonna do is just place

356
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,310
so what I'm gonna do is just place
 

357
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,319
so what I'm gonna do is just place
blocks all the way up so that's

358
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:42,329
blocks all the way up so that's
 

359
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:45,139
blocks all the way up so that's
something to place the water against and

360
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:45,149
something to place the water against and
 

361
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:58,699
something to place the water against and
then I'll destroy it

362
00:15:58,699 --> 00:15:58,709

 

363
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:06,059

yes like this okay I filled it up to the

364
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:06,069
yes like this okay I filled it up to the
 

365
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:09,030
yes like this okay I filled it up to the
top I just had these two last ones to

366
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
top I just had these two last ones to
 

367
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,689
top I just had these two last ones to
place and I have that problem with it

368
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:12,699
place and I have that problem with it
 

369
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:15,230
place and I have that problem with it
not going to these two blocks here so I

370
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,240
not going to these two blocks here so I
 

371
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,410
not going to these two blocks here so I
can trick it doing this force the blocks

372
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:19,420
can trick it doing this force the blocks
 

373
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:26,600
can trick it doing this force the blocks
the updates there just like that

374
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:26,610

 

375
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,050

this is what it looks like

376
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,060
this is what it looks like
 

377
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,370
this is what it looks like
water's being held in place by the

378
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:32,380
water's being held in place by the
 

379
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,100
water's being held in place by the
ladders I could use glass instead or

380
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,110
ladders I could use glass instead or
 

381
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,800
ladders I could use glass instead or
some other block but kind of like how

382
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:37,810
some other block but kind of like how
 

383
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:44,250
some other block but kind of like how
that looks okay let's try it out to see

384
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:44,260
that looks okay let's try it out to see
 

385
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:51,450
that looks okay let's try it out to see
if it works pretty sure it will unless I

386
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:51,460
if it works pretty sure it will unless I
 

387
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:57,530
if it works pretty sure it will unless I
overlooked something

388
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:57,540

 

389
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:03,380

oops that happens if you try to enter a

390
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:03,390
oops that happens if you try to enter a
 

391
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,710
oops that happens if you try to enter a
boat when it's moving quickly the odd

392
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:07,720
boat when it's moving quickly the odd
 

393
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:15,059
boat when it's moving quickly the odd
time that will happen gonna wind up

394
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:15,069
time that will happen gonna wind up
 

395
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,720
time that will happen gonna wind up
going up going up good

396
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:18,730
going up going up good
 

397
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,640
going up going up good
that's fixed

398
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:22,650

 

399
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,069

I didn't do the fancy quick rise

400
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
I didn't do the fancy quick rise
 

401
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,420
I didn't do the fancy quick rise
elevator just because this is such a

402
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:29,430
elevator just because this is such a
 

403
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,780
elevator just because this is such a
little rise but I'll experiment with

404
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:33,790
little rise but I'll experiment with
 

405
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:42,090
little rise but I'll experiment with
that later - all right guys so it's

406
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:42,100
that later - all right guys so it's
 

407
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,620
that later - all right guys so it's
doing a little bit of an experiment here

408
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:43,630
doing a little bit of an experiment here
 

409
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,150
doing a little bit of an experiment here
I built something I've never built

410
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:45,160
I built something I've never built
 

411
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,660
I built something I've never built
before this is called pulse limiter

412
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:48,670
before this is called pulse limiter
 

413
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,170
before this is called pulse limiter
it's a redstone circuit I saw on the

414
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:52,180
it's a redstone circuit I saw on the
 

415
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,500
it's a redstone circuit I saw on the
Minecraft Wiki page and what this does

416
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:55,510
Minecraft Wiki page and what this does
 

417
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,740
Minecraft Wiki page and what this does
it lets out a short pulse to the door

418
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:58,750
it lets out a short pulse to the door
 

419
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,990
it lets out a short pulse to the door
here or whatever you hook it up to and I

420
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000
here or whatever you hook it up to and I
 

421
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,780
here or whatever you hook it up to and I
plan on using this for my each Road

422
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:06,790
plan on using this for my each Road
 

423
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,420
plan on using this for my each Road
doors for the dispenser so it only lets

424
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:09,430
doors for the dispenser so it only lets
 

425
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,390
doors for the dispenser so it only lets
out one boat instead of two like your

426
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
out one boat instead of two like your
 

427
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,130
out one boat instead of two like your
husband so I'm gonna show you a little

428
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,140
husband so I'm gonna show you a little
 

429
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,270
husband so I'm gonna show you a little
test I did here when I hop on the

430
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
test I did here when I hop on the
 

431
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,290
test I did here when I hop on the
pressure plate the items fall down and

432
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:25,300
pressure plate the items fall down and
 

433
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,860
pressure plate the items fall down and
then when I hop off they just stay there

434
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:28,870
then when I hop off they just stay there
 

435
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:32,880
then when I hop off they just stay there
so that's the exact trade I was looking

436
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:32,890
so that's the exact trade I was looking
 

437
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,190
so that's the exact trade I was looking
for so I think this should work I'm

438
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
for so I think this should work I'm
 

439
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,350
for so I think this should work I'm
gonna try add this to my eats Road now

440
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
gonna try add this to my eats Road now
 

441
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,110
gonna try add this to my eats Road now
and hopefully hopefully it does what I

442
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,120
and hopefully hopefully it does what I
 

443
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,200
and hopefully hopefully it does what I
wanted to

444
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,210

 

445
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,730

all right so I got a little bit

446
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:44,740
all right so I got a little bit
 

447
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,430
all right so I got a little bit
distracted here I was gonna hook up

448
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
distracted here I was gonna hook up
 

449
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,000
distracted here I was gonna hook up
pulse limiter to the door but then I

450
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,010
pulse limiter to the door but then I
 

451
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,720
pulse limiter to the door but then I
started wondering if I could use

452
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:51,730
started wondering if I could use
 

453
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,510
started wondering if I could use
trapdoors instead as just kind of

454
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:54,520
trapdoors instead as just kind of
 

455
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,030
trapdoors instead as just kind of
curious to see if they would work like

456
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,040
curious to see if they would work like
 

457
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,690
curious to see if they would work like
this and the way I have it set up here

458
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:00,700
this and the way I have it set up here
 

459
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,540
this and the way I have it set up here
does not work and I'll show you why

460
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:05,550
does not work and I'll show you why
 

461
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,350
does not work and I'll show you why
we're loading a boat this door here will

462
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:10,360
we're loading a boat this door here will
 

463
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,610
we're loading a boat this door here will
hold the boat like I wanted to and then

464
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:14,620
hold the boat like I wanted to and then
 

465
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,830
hold the boat like I wanted to and then
when its flipped down the boat goes but

466
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
when its flipped down the boat goes but
 

467
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,530
when its flipped down the boat goes but
for an actual dispenser this does not

468
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:22,540
for an actual dispenser this does not
 

469
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:32,100
for an actual dispenser this does not
work because in order for you to use

470
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,110
work because in order for you to use
 

471
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,320
work because in order for you to use
this the pressure plate needs to be a

472
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,330
this the pressure plate needs to be a
 

473
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:39,180
this the pressure plate needs to be a
jacent with the trap door and so the

474
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,190
jacent with the trap door and so the
 

475
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,880
jacent with the trap door and so the
pressure plate overrides any redstone

476
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:41,890
pressure plate overrides any redstone
 

477
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,460
pressure plate overrides any redstone
wiring you might hook up to it so when

478
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:44,470
wiring you might hook up to it so when
 

479
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,000
wiring you might hook up to it so when
I'm honest the door is up and when I'm

480
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,010
I'm honest the door is up and when I'm
 

481
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,750
I'm honest the door is up and when I'm
off it it's down so it's the reverse of

482
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
off it it's down so it's the reverse of
 

483
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,500
off it it's down so it's the reverse of
what I want it to do and also I would

484
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:55,510
what I want it to do and also I would
 

485
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,830
what I want it to do and also I would
still have problems with boats do boats

486
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:58,840
still have problems with boats do boats
 

487
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,740
still have problems with boats do boats
going through I think this one here does

488
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:01,750
going through I think this one here does
 

489
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,120
going through I think this one here does
absolutely nothing the boats will pass

490
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,130
absolutely nothing the boats will pass
 

491
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:11,760
absolutely nothing the boats will pass
by it if it's up and if it's down so and

492
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:11,770
by it if it's up and if it's down so and
 

493
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,110
by it if it's up and if it's down so and
I can't put a pressure plate

494
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
I can't put a pressure plate
 

495
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,970
I can't put a pressure plate
it's diagonally from it like I want to

496
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:14,980
it's diagonally from it like I want to
 

497
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,840
it's diagonally from it like I want to
because your player is on the right side

498
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:18,850
because your player is on the right side
 

499
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,520
because your player is on the right side
so case you didn't know this for the e

500
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,530
so case you didn't know this for the e
 

501
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:27,480
so case you didn't know this for the e
throw to all these pressure plates when

502
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:27,490
throw to all these pressure plates when
 

503
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,010
throw to all these pressure plates when
you go over them you only go over the

504
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:29,020
you go over them you only go over the
 

505
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,110
you go over them you only go over the
one on the right and the one on the Left

506
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,120
one on the right and the one on the Left
 

507
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,200
one on the right and the one on the Left
doesn't get activated

508
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,210

 

509
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,790

so yeah I'm gonna try one more thing

510
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:38,800
so yeah I'm gonna try one more thing
 

511
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,180
so yeah I'm gonna try one more thing
here

512
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,190
here
 

513
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,220
here
I wanted to experiment with this a

514
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,230
I wanted to experiment with this a
 

515
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,870
I wanted to experiment with this a
little bit more the other trap door idea

516
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:45,880
little bit more the other trap door idea
 

517
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,270
little bit more the other trap door idea
I wanted to test wasn't as simple as I

518
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:48,280
I wanted to test wasn't as simple as I
 

519
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,590
I wanted to test wasn't as simple as I
thought it was gonna be so I just

520
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
thought it was gonna be so I just
 

521
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,350
thought it was gonna be so I just
skipped doing that and I went back to

522
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
skipped doing that and I went back to
 

523
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,200
skipped doing that and I went back to
using a door I went ahead and wired

524
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,210
using a door I went ahead and wired
 

525
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,250
using a door I went ahead and wired
everything already

526
00:20:59,250 --> 00:20:59,260
everything already
 

527
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:03,330
everything already
since you know redstone wiring doesn't

528
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:03,340
since you know redstone wiring doesn't
 

529
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,860
since you know redstone wiring doesn't
interest a whole lot of people but this

530
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:07,870
interest a whole lot of people but this
 

531
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,610
interest a whole lot of people but this
is how this works and you hop in the

532
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:11,620
is how this works and you hop in the
 

533
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,190
is how this works and you hop in the
boat the door does this just lets out

534
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,200
boat the door does this just lets out
 

535
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,000
boat the door does this just lets out
one boat now but remember I also need to

536
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,010
one boat now but remember I also need to
 

537
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,850
one boat now but remember I also need to
hook this pressure plate up to this door

538
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:20,860
hook this pressure plate up to this door
 

539
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,140
hook this pressure plate up to this door
as well do the same thing so this one

540
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,150
as well do the same thing so this one
 

541
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,650
as well do the same thing so this one
does a quick policy as well and then

542
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:28,660
does a quick policy as well and then
 

543
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:33,560
does a quick policy as well and then
this one here just is the holding system

544
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:33,570
this one here just is the holding system
 

545
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:39,120
this one here just is the holding system
so let's take a look at the wiring now

546
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,130
so let's take a look at the wiring now
 

547
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:45,039
so let's take a look at the wiring now
that I got the hard part done

548
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:45,049

 

549
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:49,989

so this is the further pressure plate

550
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:49,999
so this is the further pressure plate
 

551
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:55,180
so this is the further pressure plate
comes to here lights up this torch and

552
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,190
comes to here lights up this torch and
 

553
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,879
comes to here lights up this torch and
other closer pressure plate is above

554
00:21:58,879 --> 00:21:58,889
other closer pressure plate is above
 

555
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:02,989
other closer pressure plate is above
here and it goes to the same torch so

556
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:02,999
here and it goes to the same torch so
 

557
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:07,099
here and it goes to the same torch so
they share the same pulse limiter over

558
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:07,109
they share the same pulse limiter over
 

559
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:11,659
they share the same pulse limiter over
here

560
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:11,669

 

561
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:14,869

it's pout is unpowered this wire here

562
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:14,879
it's pout is unpowered this wire here
 

563
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:19,190
it's pout is unpowered this wire here
which lights up this torch goes to pulse

564
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
which lights up this torch goes to pulse
 

565
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,899
which lights up this torch goes to pulse
limiter here goes down lights up this

566
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:23,909
limiter here goes down lights up this
 

567
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,589
limiter here goes down lights up this
torch and the door is right above this

568
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:27,599
torch and the door is right above this
 

569
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:35,239
torch and the door is right above this
block here pause the video if you need

570
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:35,249
block here pause the video if you need
 

571
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:41,029

to get a better look okay so let's go

572
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
to get a better look okay so let's go
 

573
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,029
to get a better look okay so let's go
for the first each row test that I've

574
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:47,039
for the first each row test that I've
 

575
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,609
for the first each row test that I've
done in a while full lengths of the road

576
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:49,619
done in a while full lengths of the road
 

577
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,310
done in a while full lengths of the road
is set up right now I just have a loop

578
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
is set up right now I just have a loop
 

579
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
is set up right now I just have a loop
at the very end so we'll come back to

580
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,330
at the very end so we'll come back to
 

581
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,639
at the very end so we'll come back to
here so let's try this out three boats

582
00:22:58,639 --> 00:22:58,649
here so let's try this out three boats
 

583
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:03,229
here so let's try this out three boats
oh dang it I bump the boat let's see if

584
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:03,239
oh dang it I bump the boat let's see if
 

585
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:06,460
oh dang it I bump the boat let's see if
it works

586
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:06,470

 

587
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:16,630

that's fine it's fine

588
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640

 

589
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,550

always use three boats when you're

590
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:19,560
always use three boats when you're
 

591
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:25,310
always use three boats when you're
testing to make sure only one boat what

592
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:25,320
testing to make sure only one boat what
 

593
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:45,280
testing to make sure only one boat what
was let out there exactly what we want

594
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,290

 

595
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,100

and then I cut out the rest of the song

596
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,110
and then I cut out the rest of the song
 

597
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,580
and then I cut out the rest of the song
and here is my loop which I hope works

598
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:51,590
and here is my loop which I hope works
 

599
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,190
and here is my loop which I hope works
yep and now we're heading back i might

600
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
yep and now we're heading back i might
 

601
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
yep and now we're heading back i might
hook up a song to this side too I don't

602
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,210
hook up a song to this side too I don't
 

603
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:05,240
hook up a song to this side too I don't
know see how I feel it's a fast those

604
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:05,250
know see how I feel it's a fast those
 

605
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:11,450
know see how I feel it's a fast those
coordinates change approaching our newly

606
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:11,460
coordinates change approaching our newly
 

607
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,520
coordinates change approaching our newly
constructed water elevator here

608
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:16,530

 

609
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:21,600

works just fine holding area hopefully

610
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:21,610
works just fine holding area hopefully
 

611
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,290
works just fine holding area hopefully
works yep

612
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:24,300
works yep
 

613
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,200
works yep
let's out another boats to replace the

614
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,210
let's out another boats to replace the
 

615
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,640
let's out another boats to replace the
one we just stuck from the other side

616
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:29,650
one we just stuck from the other side
 

617
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:34,080
one we just stuck from the other side
assuming we had another dispenser set up

618
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,090
assuming we had another dispenser set up
 

619
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:38,280
assuming we had another dispenser set up
at the other end which we don't so that

620
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,290
at the other end which we don't so that
 

621
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,270
at the other end which we don't so that
other boats that's going to leave that

622
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:39,280
other boats that's going to leave that
 

623
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:46,290
other boats that's going to leave that
here too yeah let's go to the other end

624
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:46,300
here too yeah let's go to the other end
 

625
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,630
here too yeah let's go to the other end
one more time I'll show you what my plan

626
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:48,640
one more time I'll show you what my plan
 

627
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:58,950
one more time I'll show you what my plan
is I have plan on making what if you

628
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:58,960
is I have plan on making what if you
 

629
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:13,980
is I have plan on making what if you
eats roads actually at this end here and

630
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:13,990
eats roads actually at this end here and
 

631
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,100
eats roads actually at this end here and
hop out oops

632
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,110
hop out oops
 

633
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:22,650
hop out oops
broke it oh I marked out where my other

634
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:22,660
broke it oh I marked out where my other
 

635
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,470
broke it oh I marked out where my other
dispenser thing is going to go right

636
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:25,480
dispenser thing is going to go right
 

637
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,050
dispenser thing is going to go right
over here and what I plan on doing is

638
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:28,060
over here and what I plan on doing is
 

639
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,910
over here and what I plan on doing is
kind of having a little dome area here

640
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:31,920
kind of having a little dome area here
 

641
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,710
kind of having a little dome area here
they'll be a road I think to the right

642
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:34,720
they'll be a road I think to the right
 

643
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,040
they'll be a road I think to the right
one to the left it's maybe and one going

644
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,050
one to the left it's maybe and one going
 

645
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,980
one to the left it's maybe and one going
that way as well and in the center there

646
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:40,990
that way as well and in the center there
 

647
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,680
that way as well and in the center there
will be a boat elevator to go to the

648
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:43,690
will be a boat elevator to go to the
 

649
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:52,040
