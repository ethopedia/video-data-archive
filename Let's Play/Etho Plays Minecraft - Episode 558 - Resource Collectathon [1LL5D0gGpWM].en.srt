00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
well you can see we got rid of the chain
 

33
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,110
well you can see we got rid of the chain
that was in the middle there

00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
that was in the middle there
 

35
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,869

your guys's suggestion
put a slab there and we haven't had any

44
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
put a slab there and we haven't had any
 

45
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,350
put a slab there and we haven't had any
issues since so that's great

46
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
issues since so that's great
 

47
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,189
issues since so that's great
uh since last episode we have also

48
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
uh since last episode we have also
 

49
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,549
uh since last episode we have also
installed an item disorder

50
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
installed an item disorder
 

51
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,229
installed an item disorder
so we got the zombie flash we got the

52
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
so we got the zombie flash we got the
 

53
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,670
so we got the zombie flash we got the
gold ingots and

54
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
gold ingots and
 

55
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,510
gold ingots and
all the chicken nuggies i mean the gold

56
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
all the chicken nuggies i mean the gold
 

57
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,510
all the chicken nuggies i mean the gold
nuggets now in order to get this item

58
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
nuggets now in order to get this item
 

59
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,710
nuggets now in order to get this item
sorter to work

60
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
sorter to work
 

61
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,310
sorter to work
we couldn't just do the standard thing

62
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
we couldn't just do the standard thing
 

63
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,230
we couldn't just do the standard thing
we had to get a little bit fancy with it

64
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
we had to get a little bit fancy with it
 

65
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,550
we had to get a little bit fancy with it
not

66
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560
not
 

67
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,550
not
not super fancy but just just a little

68
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
not super fancy but just just a little
 

69
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,630
not super fancy but just just a little
bit extra um

70
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,640
bit extra um
 

71
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,910
bit extra um
for one thing we don't have water

72
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
for one thing we don't have water
 

73
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,510
for one thing we don't have water
streams in the nether right so we can't

74
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
streams in the nether right so we can't
 

75
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:15,990
streams in the nether right so we can't
just move

76
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
just move
 

77
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,030
just move
items around with water streams

78
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
items around with water streams
 

79
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,109
items around with water streams
we actually use slime block launchers to

80
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
we actually use slime block launchers to
 

81
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,469
we actually use slime block launchers to
launch the items up and then we have

82
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
launch the items up and then we have
 

83
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,149
launch the items up and then we have
another one that launches it sideways

84
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
another one that launches it sideways
 

85
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,270
another one that launches it sideways
into the ender chest

86
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
into the ender chest
 

87
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,469
into the ender chest
that aligns it ender chest is slightly

88
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
that aligns it ender chest is slightly
 

89
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,830
that aligns it ender chest is slightly
smaller than a block

90
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
smaller than a block
 

91
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,910
smaller than a block
which is important and then they fall

92
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
which is important and then they fall
 

93
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,190
which is important and then they fall
straight down there

94
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
straight down there
 

95
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,160
straight down there
where did they go well

96
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,170
where did they go well
 

97
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,510
where did they go well

let's go check it out so

100
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
let's go check it out so
 

101
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,310
let's go check it out so
it lands on some ice well it lands right

102
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
it lands on some ice well it lands right
 

103
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,109
it lands on some ice well it lands right
over there actually

104
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
over there actually
 

105
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,270
over there actually
on the terracotta then it gets pushed on

106
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
on the terracotta then it gets pushed on
 

107
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,870
on the terracotta then it gets pushed on
the ice and because it's aligned in

108
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
the ice and because it's aligned in
 

109
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,469
the ice and because it's aligned in
between

110
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
between
 

111
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,550
between
the ice blocks and the hopper it still

112
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
the ice blocks and the hopper it still
 

113
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,550
the ice blocks and the hopper it still
gets the slippery effect from the ice

114
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
gets the slippery effect from the ice
 

115
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,190
gets the slippery effect from the ice
but it can also still go into the hopper

116
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
but it can also still go into the hopper
 

117
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,870
but it can also still go into the hopper
and then i put redstone above it just so

118
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
and then i put redstone above it just so
 

119
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,510
and then i put redstone above it just so
mobs don't spawn on top of the ice there

120
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
mobs don't spawn on top of the ice there
 

121
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,350
mobs don't spawn on top of the ice there
and it runs over top all our item

122
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
and it runs over top all our item
 

123
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,709
and it runs over top all our item
filters this is important because

124
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
filters this is important because
 

125
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,309
filters this is important because
like a lot of times when i talk about

126
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
like a lot of times when i talk about
 

127
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,469
like a lot of times when i talk about
systems i'll say one times hopper speed

128
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
systems i'll say one times hopper speed
 

129
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,630
systems i'll say one times hopper speed
two times four times hopper speed

130
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
two times four times hopper speed
 

131
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,470
two times four times hopper speed
there's a certain limit to how fast

132
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
there's a certain limit to how fast
 

133
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,309
there's a certain limit to how fast
hoppers can work in this game

134
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
hoppers can work in this game
 

135
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,550
hoppers can work in this game
and when you get to a farm like this

136
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
and when you get to a farm like this
 

137
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,750
and when you get to a farm like this
where we need like 14 times hopper speed

138
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
where we need like 14 times hopper speed
 

139
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,510
where we need like 14 times hopper speed
the standard method just doesn't work we

140
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
the standard method just doesn't work we
 

141
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,030
the standard method just doesn't work we
can't move items around

142
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
can't move items around
 

143
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,949
can't move items around
using hoppers we have to just launch

144
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
using hoppers we have to just launch
 

145
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,270
using hoppers we have to just launch
them around with slime blocks basically

146
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
them around with slime blocks basically
 

147
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,710
them around with slime blocks basically
and then we run them over top the

148
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
and then we run them over top the
 

149
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,630
and then we run them over top the
filters and each one

150
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
filters and each one
 

151
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,190
filters and each one
can accept a certain amount of items so

152
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
can accept a certain amount of items so
 

153
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,589
can accept a certain amount of items so
if we have five item filters for

154
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
if we have five item filters for
 

155
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,150
if we have five item filters for
gold nuggets we can increase the speed

156
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
gold nuggets we can increase the speed
 

157
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,790
gold nuggets we can increase the speed
that way

158
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
that way
 

159
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,550
that way
so with our big globs of items here we

160
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
so with our big globs of items here we
 

161
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,470
so with our big globs of items here we
filter out the zombie flesh the gold

162
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
filter out the zombie flesh the gold
 

163
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,390
filter out the zombie flesh the gold
nuggets the gold ingots the one thing

164
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
nuggets the gold ingots the one thing
 

165
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,229
nuggets the gold ingots the one thing
that doesn't get filtered that makes it

166
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
that doesn't get filtered that makes it
 

167
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,750
that doesn't get filtered that makes it
all the way to the end here is the

168
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
all the way to the end here is the
 

169
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,390
all the way to the end here is the
golden swords those pass over a bunch of

170
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
golden swords those pass over a bunch of
 

171
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,509
golden swords those pass over a bunch of
hoppers

172
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
hoppers
 

173
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,589
hoppers
uh and funnel down into blast furnaces

174
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:55,599
uh and funnel down into blast furnaces
 

175
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,030
uh and funnel down into blast furnaces
that's melted down for

176
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
that's melted down for
 

177
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,110
that's melted down for
a few extra golden nuggets i think it's

178
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
a few extra golden nuggets i think it's
 

179
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,149
a few extra golden nuggets i think it's
worth doing that you probably get at

180
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
worth doing that you probably get at
 

181
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,910
worth doing that you probably get at
least five to ten percent extra gold

182
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
least five to ten percent extra gold
 

183
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,430
least five to ten percent extra gold
from your gold farm

184
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
from your gold farm
 

185
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,790
from your gold farm
a lot of people like to just toss them

186
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
a lot of people like to just toss them
 

187
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,390
a lot of people like to just toss them
in lava but i think i think it's worth

188
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
in lava but i think i think it's worth
 

189
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,350
in lava but i think i think it's worth
the

190
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
the
 

191
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,790
the
you know smelting them down you can get

192
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
you know smelting them down you can get
 

193
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,630
you know smelting them down you can get
a little bit extra and then they go into

194
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
a little bit extra and then they go into
 

195
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,070
a little bit extra and then they go into
the chest on the right side here

196
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
the chest on the right side here
 

197
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,990
the chest on the right side here
so yeah overall i think we're about done

198
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
so yeah overall i think we're about done
 

199

with this farm and i'm very happy with
 

201
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,430
with this farm and i'm very happy with
how it turned out

202
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
how it turned out
 

203
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,030
how it turned out
when i designed it i wanted to make sure

204
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
when i designed it i wanted to make sure
 

205
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,509

i'd be happy with it long term though

206
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
i'd be happy with it long term though
 

207
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,149
i'd be happy with it long term though
i made the decision to design it where i

208
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
i made the decision to design it where i
 

209
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,869
i made the decision to design it where i
could use looting 3 for my sword

210
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
could use looting 3 for my sword
 

211
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,470
could use looting 3 for my sword
we get extra items that way but the

we get extra items that way but the
downside is i can't just afk

downside is i can't just afk
 

215
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,070
downside is i can't just afk
but like i said i wanted to make sure

216
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
but like i said i wanted to make sure
 

217
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,750
but like i said i wanted to make sure
i'd be happy long term if we just

218
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
i'd be happy long term if we just
 

219
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,910
i'd be happy long term if we just

black stone aha that's one of the main

340
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
black stone aha that's one of the main
 

341
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,029

346
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
stacks
 

347
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,230
stacks
i think we had half a stack of obsidian

348
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
i think we had half a stack of obsidian
 

349
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,990
i think we had half a stack of obsidian
here so i think we got about five stacks

350
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
here so i think we got about five stacks
 

351
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,950
here so i think we got about five stacks
of that

352
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
of that
 

353
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,430
of that
the big reason why we want resources so

354
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
the big reason why we want resources so
 

355
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,029
the big reason why we want resources so
much what we're doing here is we're

356
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
much what we're doing here is we're
 

357
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,230

trying to fill up our
 

359
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,150
trying to fill up our
ender chest storage system we set up

360
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
ender chest storage system we set up
 

361
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,430
ender chest storage system we set up
last episode

362
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
last episode
 

363
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,150
last episode
which means we need to collect like 12

364
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
which means we need to collect like 12
 

365
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,029
which means we need to collect like 12
stacks

366
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
stacks
 

367
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,830
stacks
of every single item in the game pretty

368
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
of every single item in the game pretty
 

369
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,670
of every single item in the game pretty
much and fill up all these chests

370
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
much and fill up all these chests
 

371
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,270
much and fill up all these chests
there's more on the other side as well

372
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
there's more on the other side as well
 

373
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,189
there's more on the other side as well
double this um

374
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
double this um
 

375
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,909
double this um
and we needed blackstone for this and uh

376
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
and we needed blackstone for this and uh
 

377
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,749
and we needed blackstone for this and uh
i think uh today what we're gonna do

378
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
i think uh today what we're gonna do
 

379
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,629
i think uh today what we're gonna do
actually

380
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
actually
 

381
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,070
actually
i'll do most of this off camera still

382
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
i'll do most of this off camera still
 

383
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,430
i'll do most of this off camera still
but i thought it might be cool let's

384
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
but i thought it might be cool let's
 

385
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,430
but i thought it might be cool let's
actually dedicate an episode

386
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
actually dedicate an episode
 

387
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,790
actually dedicate an episode
to resource gathering you know it's

388
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
to resource gathering you know it's
 

389
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,469
to resource gathering you know it's
something i kind of skip over a lot

390
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
something i kind of skip over a lot
 

391
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,990
something i kind of skip over a lot
these days

392
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
these days
 

393
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,749
these days
it's a big part of the game though and i

394
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
it's a big part of the game though and i
 

395
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,830
it's a big part of the game though and i
think there's a there's some interesting

396
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
think there's a there's some interesting
 

397
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,749
think there's a there's some interesting
stuff to be said about it so

398
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
stuff to be said about it so
 

399
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,550
stuff to be said about it so
that's our goal for this episode uh

400
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
that's our goal for this episode uh
 

401
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,550
that's our goal for this episode uh
blackstone

402
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
blackstone
 

403
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,230
blackstone
we had the regular stuff we did not have

404
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
we had the regular stuff we did not have
 

405
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,150
we had the regular stuff we did not have
the chiseled so let's get that in there

406
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
the chiseled so let's get that in there
 

407
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,070
the chiseled so let's get that in there
yeah so for this episode i wanna show

408
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
yeah so for this episode i wanna show
 

409
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,270
yeah so for this episode i wanna show
you guys how i'm gonna go about

410
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
you guys how i'm gonna go about
 

411
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,110
you guys how i'm gonna go about
collecting some of these resources but

412
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
collecting some of these resources but
 

413
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,270
collecting some of these resources but
also maybe some tips and tricks for you

414
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
also maybe some tips and tricks for you
 

415
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,950
also maybe some tips and tricks for you
how you might get stuff a little bit

416
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
how you might get stuff a little bit
 

417
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,390
how you might get stuff a little bit
faster in this game

418
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
faster in this game
 

419
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,309
faster in this game
and also some oddities with resource

420
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
and also some oddities with resource
 

421
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,070
and also some oddities with resource
gathering or nuances

422
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
gathering or nuances
 

423
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,749
gathering or nuances
uh i think a good example of that would

424
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
uh i think a good example of that would
 

425
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,830
uh i think a good example of that would
be black stone like you can use this as

426
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
be black stone like you can use this as
 

427
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,830
be black stone like you can use this as
a cobble substitute

428
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
a cobble substitute
 

429
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,230
a cobble substitute
to a certain extent and the cool thing

430
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
to a certain extent and the cool thing
 

431
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,909
to a certain extent and the cool thing
about blackstone is you can actually get

432
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
about blackstone is you can actually get
 

433
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,430
about blackstone is you can actually get
it totally automatically you don't need

434
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
it totally automatically you don't need
 

435
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,710
it totally automatically you don't need
tnt dupers

436
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
tnt dupers
 

437
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,870
tnt dupers
or any of those shenanigans you just get

438
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
or any of those shenanigans you just get
 

439
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,950
or any of those shenanigans you just get
it from the piglet bartering

440
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
it from the piglet bartering
 

441
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,830
it from the piglet bartering
um but you can't use it as a total

442
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
um but you can't use it as a total
 

443
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,430
um but you can't use it as a total
cobblestone substitute like you can't

444
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
cobblestone substitute like you can't
 

445
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,990
cobblestone substitute like you can't
use it to make

446
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
use it to make
 

447
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,990
use it to make
droppers for example the only two things

448
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
droppers for example the only two things
 

449
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,790
droppers for example the only two things
you can craft beyond the cobble tools

450
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
you can craft beyond the cobble tools
 

451
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,909
you can craft beyond the cobble tools
is brewing stands and furnaces

452
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
is brewing stands and furnaces
 

453
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,749
is brewing stands and furnaces
furnaces you need of course for making

454
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
furnaces you need of course for making
 

455
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,830
furnaces you need of course for making
blast furnaces and smokers as well

456
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
blast furnaces and smokers as well
 

457
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,670
blast furnaces and smokers as well
so even though i do have lots of

458
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
so even though i do have lots of
 

459
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,510
so even though i do have lots of
cobblestone saved up in my world here i

460
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
cobblestone saved up in my world here i
 

461
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,029
cobblestone saved up in my world here i
am going to use the blackstone for

462
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
am going to use the blackstone for
 

463
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,629
am going to use the blackstone for
making furnaces and stuff

464
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
making furnaces and stuff
 

465
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,629
making furnaces and stuff
just because when you get to like making

466
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
just because when you get to like making
 

467
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,309
just because when you get to like making
50 stacks of furnaces

468
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
50 stacks of furnaces
 

469
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,070
50 stacks of furnaces
that's gonna tap into your resource

470
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
that's gonna tap into your resource
 

471
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,510
that's gonna tap into your resource
supply even if you do have a lot of

472
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
supply even if you do have a lot of
 

473
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,710
supply even if you do have a lot of
cobblestone so

474
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
cobblestone so
 

475
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,469
cobblestone so
i wanted to pick the automatic method

476
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
i wanted to pick the automatic method
 

477
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,870
i wanted to pick the automatic method
here something that used to always

478
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
here something that used to always
 

479
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,629
here something that used to always
happen to me when i would go mining or

480
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
happen to me when i would go mining or
 

481
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,230
happen to me when i would go mining or
when i was digging out a hole

when i was digging out a hole
 

483
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,830
when i was digging out a hole
is i would find i didn't bring enough

484
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
is i would find i didn't bring enough
 

485
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,670
is i would find i didn't bring enough
shulker boxes to bring all the stuff

486
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
shulker boxes to bring all the stuff
 

487
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,350
shulker boxes to bring all the stuff
back with me so if we go check one of my

488
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
back with me so if we go check one of my
 

489
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,070
back with me so if we go check one of my
old

490
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
old
 

491
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,070
old
speed mines down here i'm sure there's

492
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
speed mines down here i'm sure there's
 

493
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,909
speed mines down here i'm sure there's
tons of resources

494
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
tons of resources
 

495
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,830
tons of resources
which we can collect if we need to which

496
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
which we can collect if we need to which
 

497
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,350
which we can collect if we need to which
we do um

498
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
we do um
 

499
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,670
we do um
especially like diorite and stuff i

500
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
especially like diorite and stuff i
 

501
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,189
especially like diorite and stuff i
don't have a lot of that in my world

502
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
don't have a lot of that in my world
 

503
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,749
don't have a lot of that in my world
so dirt's always good to get but even

504
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
so dirt's always good to get but even
 

505
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,430
so dirt's always good to get but even
things like cobblestone and stone i

506
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
things like cobblestone and stone i
 

507
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,029
things like cobblestone and stone i
would always leave behind

508
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
would always leave behind
 

509
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,469
would always leave behind
uh because i just didn't have enough

510
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
uh because i just didn't have enough
 

511
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,230
uh because i just didn't have enough
space to bring it back with me so

512
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
space to bring it back with me so
 

513
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,150
space to bring it back with me so
one trick i kind of caught on to

514
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
one trick i kind of caught on to
 

515
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,909
one trick i kind of caught on to
eventually

516
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
eventually
 

517
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,950
eventually
because i always carry a bunch of

518
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
because i always carry a bunch of
 

519
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,909
because i always carry a bunch of
redstone in my redstone box here i can

520
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
redstone in my redstone box here i can
 

521
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,029
redstone in my redstone box here i can
take that

522
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
take that
 

523
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,749
take that
right i'm going somewhere here or like

524
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
right i'm going somewhere here or like
 

525
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,110
right i'm going somewhere here or like
when you're mining you usually get a lot

526
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
when you're mining you usually get a lot
 

527
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,629
when you're mining you usually get a lot
of redstone

528
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
of redstone
 

529
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,710
of redstone
i can then craft things like droppers

530
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
i can then craft things like droppers
 

531
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,629
i can then craft things like droppers
and it compresses those seven stacks of

532
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
and it compresses those seven stacks of
 

533
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,230
and it compresses those seven stacks of
cobblestone down into one

534
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
cobblestone down into one
 

535
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,990
cobblestone down into one
and then it's much easier to bring those

536
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
and then it's much easier to bring those
 

537
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,430
and then it's much easier to bring those
resources back home

538
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
resources back home
 

539
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,189
resources back home
the thing i really like about piglet

540
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
the thing i really like about piglet
 

541
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,190
the thing i really like about piglet
bartering is it gives you resources that

542
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
bartering is it gives you resources that
 

543
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,630
bartering is it gives you resources that
you can use in a variety of different

544
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
you can use in a variety of different
 

545
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,350
you can use in a variety of different
ways so in my case with nether quartz

546
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
ways so in my case with nether quartz
 

547
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,469
ways so in my case with nether quartz
i could craft that into quartz blocks

548
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
i could craft that into quartz blocks
 

549
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,149
i could craft that into quartz blocks
but i think it's much better just to buy

550
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
but i think it's much better just to buy
 

551
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,389
but i think it's much better just to buy
that from villagers most of my world was

552
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
that from villagers most of my world was
 

553
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,470
that from villagers most of my world was
generated before diorite granite and

554
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
generated before diorite granite and
 

555
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,150
generated before diorite granite and
andesite became a thing so i'm very

556
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
andesite became a thing so i'm very
 

557
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,750
andesite became a thing so i'm very
limited on that actually i have very

558
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
limited on that actually i have very
 

559
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,110
limited on that actually i have very
little of that stuff

560
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
little of that stuff
 

561
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,949
little of that stuff
so i'll probably be using another quartz

562
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
so i'll probably be using another quartz
 

563
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,870
so i'll probably be using another quartz
we get from the big one bartering to

564
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
we get from the big one bartering to
 

565
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,230
we get from the big one bartering to
craft it actually

566
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
craft it actually
 

567
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,550
craft it actually
that might seem wasteful to you guys but

568
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
that might seem wasteful to you guys but
 

569
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,230
that might seem wasteful to you guys but
in in my world here

570
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
in in my world here
 

571
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,150
in in my world here
trust me this stuff is pretty rare and

572
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
trust me this stuff is pretty rare and
 

573
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,430
trust me this stuff is pretty rare and
then you can craft

574
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
then you can craft
 

575
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,150
then you can craft
that into andesite or into granite and

576
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
that into andesite or into granite and
 

577
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,550
that into andesite or into granite and
that

578
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
that
 

579
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,829
that
now i have a way of actually

580
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
now i have a way of actually
 

581
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,990
now i have a way of actually
automatically farming this stuff

582
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
automatically farming this stuff
 

583
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,590
automatically farming this stuff
another thing we get a lot of though is

584
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
another thing we get a lot of though is
 

585
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,910
another thing we get a lot of though is
gravel and something i think is pretty

586
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
gravel and something i think is pretty
 

587
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,550
gravel and something i think is pretty
interesting

588
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
interesting
 

589
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,710
interesting
a lot of people struggle to get enough

590
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
a lot of people struggle to get enough
 

591
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,110
a lot of people struggle to get enough
dirt i find

592
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
dirt i find
 

593
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,430
dirt i find
you can craft dirt now automatically

594
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
you can craft dirt now automatically
 

595
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,310
you can craft dirt now automatically
with gravel

596
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
with gravel
 

597
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,230
with gravel
you get from piglet bartering the catch

598
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
you get from piglet bartering the catch
 

599
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,550
you get from piglet bartering the catch
of course is you don't get dirt you get

600
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
of course is you don't get dirt you get
 

601
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,070
of course is you don't get dirt you get
the coarse dirt

602
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
the coarse dirt
 

603
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,150
the coarse dirt
which is probably why people don't do it

604
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
which is probably why people don't do it
 

605
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,710
which is probably why people don't do it
but you can process it similar to

606
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:32,720
but you can process it similar to
 

607
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,949
but you can process it similar to
like a concrete factory where you push

608
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
like a concrete factory where you push
 

609
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,070
like a concrete factory where you push
it into a tnt

610
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
it into a tnt
 

611
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,710
it into a tnt
exploder thinger just get the coarse

612
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
exploder thinger just get the coarse
 

613
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,150
exploder thinger just get the coarse
dirt in your offhand get the hole in the

614
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
dirt in your offhand get the hole in the
 

615
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,230
dirt in your offhand get the hole in the
other one

616
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
other one
 

617
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,550
other one
and make a line like this if you just

618
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
and make a line like this if you just
 

619
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,230
and make a line like this if you just
hold right click it'll till it and turn

620
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
hold right click it'll till it and turn
 

621
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,350
hold right click it'll till it and turn
it to regular dirt

622
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
it to regular dirt
 

623
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,269
it to regular dirt
and then if you want to get really fancy

624
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
and then if you want to get really fancy
 

625
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,110
and then if you want to get really fancy
with the idea another thing you could do

626
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
with the idea another thing you could do
 

627
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,990
with the idea another thing you could do
is combine

628
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
is combine
 

629
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,509
is combine
the dirt farm with an enderman farm

630
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
the dirt farm with an enderman farm
 

631
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,670
the dirt farm with an enderman farm
and make it so you push the dirt in an

632
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
and make it so you push the dirt in an
 

633
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,430
and make it so you push the dirt in an
area where the endermen walk by maybe

634
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
area where the endermen walk by maybe
 

635
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,670
area where the endermen walk by maybe
even set up grass and mycelium here

636
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
even set up grass and mycelium here
 

637
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,509
even set up grass and mycelium here
so that you can farm those automatically

638
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
so that you can farm those automatically
 

639
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,710
so that you can farm those automatically
as well

640
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
as well
 

641
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,150
as well
when they pick up the dirt and die

642
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
when they pick up the dirt and die
 

643
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,310
when they pick up the dirt and die
down down at your enderman farm they

644
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
down down at your enderman farm they
 

645
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,069
down down at your enderman farm they
should drop it then

646
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
should drop it then
 

647
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,710
should drop it then
yeah and then you can get dirt

648
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
yeah and then you can get dirt
 

649
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,750
yeah and then you can get dirt

you don't have an automatic tree farm

680
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
you don't have an automatic tree farm
 

681
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,670
you don't have an automatic tree farm
i would highly recommend people use tnt

682
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
i would highly recommend people use tnt
 

683
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,750
i would highly recommend people use tnt
for farming trees it just saves so much

684
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
for farming trees it just saves so much
 

685
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,230
for farming trees it just saves so much

689
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,870

okay so after a quick haircut this is

okay so after a quick haircut this is
 

691
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,470
okay so after a quick haircut this is
what we're left with and then i take the

692
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
what we're left with and then i take the
 

693
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,670
what we're left with and then i take the
tnt

694
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
tnt
 

695
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,470
tnt
and go down the middle and uh just light

696
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
and go down the middle and uh just light
 

697
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,790
and go down the middle and uh just light
it

698
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
it
 

699
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,670
it
so tnt will blast through up to two

700
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
so tnt will blast through up to two
 

701
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,590
so tnt will blast through up to two
blocks of wood

702
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
blocks of wood
 

703
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,110
blocks of wood
and it'll take care of any leftover

704
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
and it'll take care of any leftover
 

705
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,790
and it'll take care of any leftover
leaves and stuff

706

leaves and stuff
 

707
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,269
leaves and stuff
and it's just this saves a lot of time

708
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
and it's just this saves a lot of time
 

709
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,590
and it's just this saves a lot of time
you gotta be a little careful though but

710
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
you gotta be a little careful though but
 

711
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,710
you gotta be a little careful though but
look at that you know how many

712
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
look at that you know how many
 

713
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,150

doors

728
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
doors
 

729
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,949
doors
for each type of log so it's going to

730
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
for each type of log so it's going to
 

731
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:46,389
for each type of log so it's going to
take a lot of wood

732

733
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,910

i've never actually farmed jungle logs

748
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
i've never actually farmed jungle logs
 

749
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,910
i've never actually farmed jungle logs
at this tree farm

750
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
at this tree farm
 

751
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,509
at this tree farm
and i found something out that

752
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
and i found something out that
 

753
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,150
and i found something out that
apparently you can't do the jungle trees

754
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
apparently you can't do the jungle trees
 

755
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,110
apparently you can't do the jungle trees
here because

756
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
here because
 

757
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,430
here because
vines seem to be a block that trees

758
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
vines seem to be a block that trees
 

759
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,870
vines seem to be a block that trees
can't grow through like there's certain

760
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
can't grow through like there's certain
 

761
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,350
can't grow through like there's certain
blocks they can like logs leaves

762
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
blocks they can like logs leaves
 

763
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,389
blocks they can like logs leaves
uh dirt but like as much bone meal as i

764
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
uh dirt but like as much bone meal as i
 

765
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,590
uh dirt but like as much bone meal as i
put on this thing i don't think it'll

766
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
put on this thing i don't think it'll
 

767
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,870
put on this thing i don't think it'll
ever grow because these

768
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
ever grow because these
 

769
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,350
ever grow because these
vines are in the way vines are something

770
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
vines are in the way vines are something
 

771
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:23,990
vines are in the way vines are something
worth mentioning

772
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
worth mentioning
 

773
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,829
worth mentioning
as well it's one of those weird things

774
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
as well it's one of those weird things
 

775
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,910
as well it's one of those weird things
in the game did you know the proper tool

776
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
in the game did you know the proper tool
 

777
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,550
in the game did you know the proper tool
for harvesting vines is actually the axe

778
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
for harvesting vines is actually the axe
 

779
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,470
for harvesting vines is actually the axe
so you can instant break them with the

780
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
so you can instant break them with the
 

781
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,910
so you can instant break them with the
axe

782
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
axe
 

783
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,110
axe
but you don't get the silk touch and

784
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
but you don't get the silk touch and
 

785
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,110
but you don't get the silk touch and
even with efficiency 5

786
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
even with efficiency 5
 

787
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,870
even with efficiency 5
shears here you do get the silk touch

788
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
shears here you do get the silk touch
 

789
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,550
shears here you do get the silk touch
but it's super slow there's no way to

790
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560
but it's super slow there's no way to
 

791
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,470
but it's super slow there's no way to
speed up the the mining

792
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
speed up the the mining
 

793
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,069
speed up the the mining
of the the vines which is really

794
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
of the the vines which is really
 

795
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,230
of the the vines which is really
annoying so you they're such a pain to

796
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
annoying so you they're such a pain to
 

797
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,430
annoying so you they're such a pain to
collect

798
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
collect
 

799
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,670
collect
um i can't think of any other block in

800
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
um i can't think of any other block in
 

801
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,230
um i can't think of any other block in
the game where the proper tool

802
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
the game where the proper tool
 

803
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,230
the game where the proper tool
won't still touch it okay let's just

804
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
won't still touch it okay let's just
 

805
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,069
won't still touch it okay let's just
double check here i got the tree d-vine

806
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
double check here i got the tree d-vine
 

807
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,069
double check here i got the tree d-vine
so now i'm assuming this will be able to

808
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
so now i'm assuming this will be able to
 

809
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,910
so now i'm assuming this will be able to
grow

810
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
grow
 

811
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:12,310

um usually i do like a couple hours of
 

825
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,949
um usually i do like a couple hours of
resource gathering after every episode

826
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
resource gathering after every episode
 

827
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,190
resource gathering after every episode
and it just hasn't been enough we've

828
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,200
and it just hasn't been enough we've
 

829

been doing bigger projects lately
 

831
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,150
been doing bigger projects lately
and um some stuff has caught up

832
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
and um some stuff has caught up
 

833

of wood
 

839
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,910
of wood
we're out of all these things all at

840

once so
today is all about the resource

844
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
today is all about the resource
 

845
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,150
today is all about the resource
gathering and i think i've been at it

846
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
gathering and i think i've been at it
 

847

collecting other things like the vines
 

863
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,990
collecting other things like the vines
off the jungle trees we got the leaves

864
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
off the jungle trees we got the leaves
 

865
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,710
off the jungle trees we got the leaves
uh we got a bunch of nether plants and

866
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
uh we got a bunch of nether plants and
 

867
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,350
uh we got a bunch of nether plants and
uh

868
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
uh
 

869
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,829
uh
saplings we collected the saplings we're

870
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
saplings we collected the saplings we're
 

871
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,910
saplings we collected the saplings we're
missing some birch saplings jungle

872
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
missing some birch saplings jungle
 

873
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,430
missing some birch saplings jungle
saplings and we need

874
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
saplings and we need
 

875
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,550
saplings and we need
some more dark oak as well um

876
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:18,560
some more dark oak as well um
 

877
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,189
some more dark oak as well um
did some redstone stuff as well we're

878
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
did some redstone stuff as well we're
 

879
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,310
did some redstone stuff as well we're
not done yet though we're gonna keep

880
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
not done yet though we're gonna keep
 

881
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,030
not done yet though we're gonna keep
going here

882
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
going here
 

883
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,590
going here
so there's actually one resource in this

884
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
so there's actually one resource in this
 

885
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,670
so there's actually one resource in this
world that i've never collected before

886
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680
world that i've never collected before
 

887
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,150
world that i've never collected before
at least not the proper way you guys

888
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
at least not the proper way you guys
 

889
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,269
at least not the proper way you guys
remember this thing

890
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
remember this thing
 

891
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,030
remember this thing
that we had a way of converting yellow

892
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
that we had a way of converting yellow
 

893
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,310
that we had a way of converting yellow
sand into

894
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
sand into
 

895
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,350
sand into
red sand using a glitch in the game and

896
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
red sand using a glitch in the game and
 

897
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,350
red sand using a glitch in the game and
i took advantage of that for a while

898
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
i took advantage of that for a while
 

899
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,110
i took advantage of that for a while
doesn't work anymore though i'm kind of

900
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120
doesn't work anymore though i'm kind of
 

901
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,550
doesn't work anymore though i'm kind of
wondering

902
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
wondering
 

903
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,990
wondering
what we actually have here so there's

904
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
what we actually have here so there's
 

905
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,750
what we actually have here so there's
some red sandstone

906
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:45,760
some red sandstone
 

907
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,670
some red sandstone
oh there is regular sand here too we'll

908
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:47,680
oh there is regular sand here too we'll
 

909
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,949
oh there is regular sand here too we'll
snag that

910
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
snag that
 

911
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,550
snag that
uh okay one two and a half

912
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
uh okay one two and a half
 

913
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,949
uh okay one two and a half
oh it's so close but it's not quite

914
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
oh it's so close but it's not quite
 

915
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,550
oh it's so close but it's not quite
enough to fill up the ender chest thing

916
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:56,560
enough to fill up the ender chest thing
 

917
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,550
enough to fill up the ender chest thing
so we might go mine some

918
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
so we might go mine some
 

919
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,750
so we might go mine some
just to see what that's like let's see

920
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:01,760
just to see what that's like let's see
 

921
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,350
just to see what that's like let's see
yeah because we only have like one chalk

922
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
yeah because we only have like one chalk
 

923
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,269
yeah because we only have like one chalk
or full and we need like a shocker and a

924
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
or full and we need like a shocker and a
 

925
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,269
or full and we need like a shocker and a
half okay so the thing about that is

926
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279
half okay so the thing about that is
 

927
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,590
half okay so the thing about that is
we switched our world to amplified a

928
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
we switched our world to amplified a
 

929
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,710
we switched our world to amplified a
long time ago

930
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
long time ago
 

931
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,470
long time ago
i don't regret that decision i think it

932
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
i don't regret that decision i think it
 

933
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,230
i don't regret that decision i think it
was a good idea

934
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
was a good idea
 

935
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,629
was a good idea
um but it does have some negative side

936
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639
um but it does have some negative side
 

937
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,269
um but it does have some negative side
effects

938
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
effects
 

939
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,269
effects
one of those being orange sand i believe

940
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
one of those being orange sand i believe
 

941
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,990
one of those being orange sand i believe
is quite rare it's uh

942
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
is quite rare it's uh
 

943
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,069
is quite rare it's uh
it's not so bad there's very little

944
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
it's not so bad there's very little
 

945
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,990
it's not so bad there's very little
though it's just like on the very edges

946
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
though it's just like on the very edges
 

947
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,790
though it's just like on the very edges
of the

948
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
of the
 

949
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,150
of the
the terrain i'm pretty sure okay there's

950
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
the terrain i'm pretty sure okay there's
 

951
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,269
the terrain i'm pretty sure okay there's
a bit of a patch there

952
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,279
a bit of a patch there
 

953
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,790
a bit of a patch there
there's a bit of a patch there okay

954
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800
there's a bit of a patch there okay
 

955
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,710
there's a bit of a patch there okay
maybe it's not as bad as i remembered i

956
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
maybe it's not as bad as i remembered i
 

957
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,430
maybe it's not as bad as i remembered i
thought it was

958
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
thought it was
 

959
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,949
thought it was
like really bad

960
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959

 

961
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,629

yeah we can get little bits here and

962
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
yeah we can get little bits here and
 

963
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,069
yeah we can get little bits here and
there but the thing is because most of

964
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
there but the thing is because most of
 

965
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:48,629
there but the thing is because most of
the

966
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:48,639
the
 

967
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,870
the
terrain is amplified the orange sand

968
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880
terrain is amplified the orange sand
 

969
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,949
terrain is amplified the orange sand
doesn't generate there it has to be at a

970
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
doesn't generate there it has to be at a
 

971
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,670
doesn't generate there it has to be at a
lower elevation so it's like just on the

972
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680

like
 

1097
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,190
like
they're way too far away for me to pick

1098

they're way too far away for me to pick
 

1099
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,110
they're way too far away for me to pick
up and i got to make a second pass

1100
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,120
up and i got to make a second pass
 

1101

or maybe like when you're farming kelp

1102
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960
or maybe like when you're farming kelp
 

1103
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,310
or maybe like when you're farming kelp
in the ocean a lot of times you can't

1104
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
in the ocean a lot of times you can't
 

1105
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,990
in the ocean a lot of times you can't
pick up everything at once it's pretty

1106
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
pick up everything at once it's pretty
 

1107
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,110
pick up everything at once it's pretty
annoying

1108
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
annoying
 

1109
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,950
annoying
i i kind of would like it actually i

1110
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
i i kind of would like it actually i
 

1111
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,630
i i kind of would like it actually i
think yeah i think we're ready for

1112
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
think yeah i think we're ready for
 

1113
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,510
think yeah i think we're ready for
something like that

1114
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
something like that
 

1115
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,029
something like that
i think it would probably work best as

1116
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
i think it would probably work best as
 

1117
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,870
i think it would probably work best as
an enchantment and the more pieces of

1118
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
an enchantment and the more pieces of
 

1119
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,470
an enchantment and the more pieces of
armor with the enchantment

1120
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
armor with the enchantment
 

1121
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,630
armor with the enchantment
then the stronger the effect like the

1122
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:18,640
then the stronger the effect like the
 

1123
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,830
then the stronger the effect like the
further away you can pick stuff

1124
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
further away you can pick stuff
 

1125
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,430
further away you can pick stuff
up i think that's the way i would like

1126
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
up i think that's the way i would like
 

1127
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,669
up i think that's the way i would like
to see it done uh but yeah we got it

1128

and then for the final row in these
 

1373
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,909
and then for the final row in these
ender chest loaders i just put whatever

1374
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919
ender chest loaders i just put whatever
 

1375

either
um it could definitely be improved a lot

1396
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
um it could definitely be improved a lot
 

1397
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,149
um it could definitely be improved a lot
though this isn't

1398

though this isn't
 

1399
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,350
though this isn't
an ideal design we kind of put it

1400
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,360
an ideal design we kind of put it
 

1401
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,750
an ideal design we kind of put it
together afterwards when uh

1402
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:03,760
together afterwards when uh
 

1403
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,870
together afterwards when uh
they made it where you could shoot the

1404
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:04,880
they made it where you could shoot the
 

1405
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,110
they made it where you could shoot the
flowers off with the arrows wait what

1406
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120
flowers off with the arrows wait what
 

1407
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,710
flowers off with the arrows wait what
that one didn't get chopped

1408

that one didn't get chopped
 

1409
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,830

is that a glitch

1410
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:11,840

 

1411
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,909

unbelievable we had 34 when we started
 

1415
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,390
unbelievable we had 34 when we started
and we ended it with 34

1416
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
and we ended it with 34
 

1417

no change once again the way that farm
 

1419
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,870
no change once again the way that farm
works is it has an item sorter to

1420
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
works is it has an item sorter to
 

1421
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,310
works is it has an item sorter to
separate the coarse fruit

1422
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
separate the coarse fruit
 

1423
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,630
separate the coarse fruit
seeds and then the actual coarse fruits

1424
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
seeds and then the actual coarse fruits
 

1425
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,909
seeds and then the actual coarse fruits
whatever they're called this coarse

1426
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:31,919
whatever they're called this coarse
 

1427
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,549
whatever they're called this coarse
fruit goes to this building over here

1428
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559
fruit goes to this building over here
 

1429
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,630
fruit goes to this building over here
and gets smelted in these furnaces

1430
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:36,640
and gets smelted in these furnaces
 

1431
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,549
and gets smelted in these furnaces
and then this is the pop stuff that we

1432
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
and then this is the pop stuff that we
 

1433
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,710
and then this is the pop stuff that we
make the per per blocks out of

1434
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:40,720
make the per per blocks out of
 

1435
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,310
make the per per blocks out of
it's gonna take a bit of time though oh

1436
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,320
it's gonna take a bit of time though oh

1443
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,830
don't buy clay from villagers i realized
this is actually a bad deal let's assume

1444
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
this is actually a bad deal let's assume
 

1445
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,310
this is actually a bad deal let's assume
you have

1446
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,320
you have
 

1447
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,990
you have
infinite emeralds and they have no value

1448
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
infinite emeralds and they have no value
 

1449
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,310
infinite emeralds and they have no value
to you it's still not worth it because

1450
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
to you it's still not worth it because
 

1451
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,149
to you it's still not worth it because
when you do the trade you can only get

1452
00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:58,159
when you do the trade you can only get
 

1453
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,390
when you do the trade you can only get
12

1454
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,400
12
 

1455
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,430
12
and it's not worth the time to click

1456
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,440
and it's not worth the time to click
 

1457
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,549
and it's not worth the time to click
here and do that because you can mine 20

1458
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559
here and do that because you can mine 20
 

1459
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,710
here and do that because you can mine 20
clay a second i believe

1460
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,720
clay a second i believe
 

1461
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,230
clay a second i believe
and it takes longer than a second to do

1462
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,240
and it takes longer than a second to do
 

1463
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,830
and it takes longer than a second to do
that so you're just better off going to

1464
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
that so you're just better off going to
 

1465
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,549
that so you're just better off going to
a mesa

1466
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
a mesa
 

1467
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,710
a mesa
anyways it's about time we have to wrap

1468
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
anyways it's about time we have to wrap
 

1469
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,549
anyways it's about time we have to wrap
up our episode for today

1470
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
up our episode for today
 

1471
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,070
up our episode for today
is a weird one right we didn't do any

1472
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,080
is a weird one right we didn't do any
 

1473
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,390
is a weird one right we didn't do any
building which is kind of against

1474
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,400
building which is kind of against
 

1475
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,390
building which is kind of against
my rules for the series i try to do a

1476
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
my rules for the series i try to do a
 

1477
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,390
my rules for the series i try to do a
little bit of building every episode

1478
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
little bit of building every episode
 

1479
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,549
little bit of building every episode
uh it's a weird uh weird episode though

1480
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
uh it's a weird uh weird episode though
 

1481
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,149
uh it's a weird uh weird episode though
i kind of wanted to stand out as a

1482
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:28,159
i kind of wanted to stand out as a
 

1483
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,110
i kind of wanted to stand out as a
different one

1484
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,120
different one
 

1485
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,190
different one
uh we will do just a little bit of

1486
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,200
uh we will do just a little bit of
 

1487
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,870
uh we will do just a little bit of
building mode just just because we have

1488
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
building mode just just because we have
 

1489
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,269
building mode just just because we have
to

1490
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279
to
 

1491
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,549
to
just a little bit um around the nexus

1492
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
just a little bit um around the nexus
 

1493
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,590
just a little bit um around the nexus
here i'm going to add some

1494
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600
here i'm going to add some
 

1495
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,750
here i'm going to add some
andesite this is supposed to be like a

1496
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:39,760
andesite this is supposed to be like a
 

1497
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,350
andesite this is supposed to be like a
transition

1498
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360
transition
 

1499
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,590
transition
material because it kind of works with

1500
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600
material because it kind of works with
 

1501
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,950
material because it kind of works with
all these blocks it kind of works with

1502
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:44,960
all these blocks it kind of works with
 

1503
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,310
all these blocks it kind of works with
grass kind of works with this kind of

1504
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:46,320
grass kind of works with this kind of
 

1505
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,029
grass kind of works with this kind of
works with that

1506
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
works with that
 

1507
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,310
works with that
instead of going straight from the

1508
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
instead of going straight from the
 

1509
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,470
instead of going straight from the
building to the grass it looks weird

1510
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:50,480
building to the grass it looks weird
 

1511
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,149
building to the grass it looks weird
right like it's got a

1512
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:52,159
right like it's got a
 

1513
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,110
right like it's got a
very strong contrast by putting a border

1514
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
very strong contrast by putting a border
 

1515
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,070
very strong contrast by putting a border
around this it'll

1516
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,080
around this it'll
 

1517
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,909
around this it'll
transition a little bit easier and also

1518
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
transition a little bit easier and also
 

1519
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,190
transition a little bit easier and also
looks like the building will have a bit

1520
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
looks like the building will have a bit
 

1521
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,909
looks like the building will have a bit
more of a foundation

1522
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919

 

1523
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,909

the front of the nexus looks very dark

1524
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:03,919
the front of the nexus looks very dark
 

1525
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,430
the front of the nexus looks very dark
because it's pretty much just the dark

1526
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
because it's pretty much just the dark
 

1527
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,549
because it's pretty much just the dark
concrete there

1528
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:06,559
concrete there
 

1529
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,070
concrete there
other parts of the building are have

1530
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
other parts of the building are have
 

1531
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,590
other parts of the building are have
other stuff mixed in with it

1532
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:09,600
other stuff mixed in with it
 

1533
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,830
other stuff mixed in with it
so let's try and mix some stuff in with

1534
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:11,840
so let's try and mix some stuff in with
 

1535
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,430
so let's try and mix some stuff in with
with the front here as well

1536
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:13,440
with the front here as well
 

1537
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,669
with the front here as well
we're going to add some slabs over top

1538
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
we're going to add some slabs over top
 

1539
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,630
we're going to add some slabs over top
this middle section to keep this theme

1540
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640
this middle section to keep this theme
 

1541
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,070
this middle section to keep this theme
that we have in other areas like we have

1542
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,080
that we have in other areas like we have
 

1543
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,990
that we have in other areas like we have
slabs here we have slabs above

1544
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,000
slabs here we have slabs above
 

1545
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,230
slabs here we have slabs above
the concrete there let's do it in the

1546
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240
the concrete there let's do it in the
 

1547
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,909
the concrete there let's do it in the
middle as well

1548
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:25,919
middle as well
 

1549
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,190
middle as well
and i think we're going to add some

1550
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
and i think we're going to add some
 

1551
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,909
and i think we're going to add some
light blue clay around this landing zone

1552
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:29,919
light blue clay around this landing zone
 

1553
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,870
light blue clay around this landing zone
as well

1554
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:30,880
as well
 

1555
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,190
as well
maybe we'll we'll build it up like this

1556
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,200
maybe we'll we'll build it up like this
 

1557
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,149
maybe we'll we'll build it up like this
and just go around

1558
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159
and just go around
 

1559
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,269
and just go around
all the concrete uh-huh so i think i

1560
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279
all the concrete uh-huh so i think i
 

1561
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,549
all the concrete uh-huh so i think i
like that a bit more

1562
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:38,559
like that a bit more
 

1563
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,149
like that a bit more
got the andesite around the building the

1564
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:40,159
got the andesite around the building the
 

1565
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,029
got the andesite around the building the
light blue clay uh slabs over the middle

1566
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
light blue clay uh slabs over the middle
 

1567
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:43,750
light blue clay uh slabs over the middle
there

1568
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,760
there
 

1569
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,750
there
and we even added in a staircase and

1570
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:45,760
and we even added in a staircase and
 

1571
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,590
and we even added in a staircase and
connected it up to the path here

1572
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
connected it up to the path here
 

1573
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,430
connected it up to the path here
probably will be making some tweaks to

1574
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:49,440
probably will be making some tweaks to
 

1575
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,269
probably will be making some tweaks to
it in the future but just for now

1576
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:51,279
it in the future but just for now
 

1577
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,350
it in the future but just for now
i think it's a bit of an improvement so

1578
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:53,360
i think it's a bit of an improvement so
 

1579
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,710
i think it's a bit of an improvement so
i'm happy with that

1580
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
i'm happy with that
 

1581
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,630
i'm happy with that
let's get to the comment of the day it

1582
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:56,640
let's get to the comment of the day it
 

1583
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,750
let's get to the comment of the day it
says hey etho

1584
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:57,760
says hey etho

the new snapshot that came out changed
 

1587
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,149
the new snapshot that came out changed
to the new cave gin what

the new snapshot that came out changed
 

1591
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,430
the new snapshot that came out changed
the new cave generation let's go with

1592
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
the new cave generation let's go with
 

1593
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,070
the new cave generation let's go with
that

1594
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,080
that
 

1595
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,590
that
and lower the bedrock level to minus 64.

1596
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
and lower the bedrock level to minus 64.
 

1597
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,269
and lower the bedrock level to minus 64.
i think everyone following your let's

1598
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:13,279
i think everyone following your let's
 

1599
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,750
i think everyone following your let's
play must be wondering

1600
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:15,760
play must be wondering
 

1601
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,269
play must be wondering
are we gonna be seeing a man cave 2.0

1602
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:19,279
are we gonna be seeing a man cave 2.0
 

1603
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,149
are we gonna be seeing a man cave 2.0
in the future now i've thought about

1604
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:22,159
in the future now i've thought about
 

1605
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:22,630
in the future now i've thought about
this

1606
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:22,640
this
 

1607
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,750
this
i thought about this so if you guys

1608
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:23,760
i thought about this so if you guys
 

1609
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,830
i thought about this so if you guys
didn't hear they're adding 64 blocks

1610
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
didn't hear they're adding 64 blocks
 

1611
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,029
didn't hear they're adding 64 blocks
below

1612
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:27,039
below
 

1613
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,350
below
the world and 64 blocks to the top of

1614
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,360
the world and 64 blocks to the top of
 

1615
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,590
the world and 64 blocks to the top of
the world another 128

1616
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:31,600
the world another 128
 

1617
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,830
the world another 128
blocks of play space which is pretty

1618
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:33,840
blocks of play space which is pretty
 

1619
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,789
blocks of play space which is pretty
cool

1620
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799
cool
 

1621
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,390
cool
now i don't think we will ever do

1622
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:36,400
now i don't think we will ever do
 

1623
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,149
now i don't think we will ever do
another man cave the same

1624
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:38,159
another man cave the same
 

1625
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,750
another man cave the same
as what we did over there there would be

1626
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:39,760
as what we did over there there would be
 

1627
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,310
as what we did over there there would be
no point right if we want we can expand

1628
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,320
no point right if we want we can expand
 

1629
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,269
no point right if we want we can expand
that

1630
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:43,279
that
 

1631
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,510
that
the one we're living in but we might

1632
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:45,520
the one we're living in but we might
 

1633
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,630
the one we're living in but we might
live underground

1634
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:46,640
live underground
 

1635
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,510
live underground
but with a different style of base is

1636
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
but with a different style of base is
 

1637
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,950
but with a different style of base is
that something that would interest you

1638
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
that something that would interest you
 

1639
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,310
that something that would interest you
guys let me know in the comments

1640
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,320
guys let me know in the comments
 

1641
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,870
guys let me know in the comments
and if it is we'll go find a cave in the

1642
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
and if it is we'll go find a cave in the
 

1643
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,230
and if it is we'll go find a cave in the
next update and we'll

1644
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,240
next update and we'll
 

1645
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,630
next update and we'll
we'll set up there and not make another

1646
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:58,640
we'll set up there and not make another
 

1647
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,630
we'll set up there and not make another
man cave exactly we want different block

1648
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:00,640
man cave exactly we want different block
 

1649
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,110
man cave exactly we want different block
pellets

1650
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,120
pellets
 

1651
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,110
pellets
different rules and stuff i think the

1652
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,120
different rules and stuff i think the
 

1653
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,110
different rules and stuff i think the
next space i make i want to make it work

1654
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
next space i make i want to make it work
 

1655
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,590
next space i make i want to make it work
where you zoom around it with riptide

1656
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
where you zoom around it with riptide
 

1657
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,269
where you zoom around it with riptide
that's like something high on my

1658
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279
that's like something high on my
 

1659
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,669
that's like something high on my
priority list of fun you know

1660
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:11,679
priority list of fun you know
 

1661
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,510
priority list of fun you know
so we'll be designing around that most

1662
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,520
so we'll be designing around that most
 

1663
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,269
so we'll be designing around that most
likely um

1664
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
likely um
 

1665
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,310
likely um
but yeah with our current world here

1666
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:18,320
but yeah with our current world here
 

1667
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,269
but yeah with our current world here
what's what does this change mean for us

1668
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:21,279
what's what does this change mean for us
 

1669
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,590
what's what does this change mean for us
well we don't know exactly just yet but

1670
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:23,600
well we don't know exactly just yet but
 

1671
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:23,990
well we don't know exactly just yet but
i

1672
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,000
i
 

1673
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,950
i
suspect the world's not really going to

1674
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:26,960
suspect the world's not really going to
 

1675
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,430
suspect the world's not really going to
change

1676
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:27,440
change
 

1677
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,470
change
that's generated already which means i'm

1678
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
that's generated already which means i'm
 

1679
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,710
that's generated already which means i'm
going to have my bedrock at

1680
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720
going to have my bedrock at
 

1681
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,510
going to have my bedrock at
y zero and i think if we break a hole

1682
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:35,520
y zero and i think if we break a hole
 

1683
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,950
y zero and i think if we break a hole
through the bedrock we can go down

1684
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:36,960
through the bedrock we can go down
 

1685
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,190
through the bedrock we can go down
another 64 blocks i think that's the way

1686
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
another 64 blocks i think that's the way
 

1687
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,149
another 64 blocks i think that's the way
it's gonna work

1688
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:40,159
it's gonna work
 

1689
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,389
it's gonna work
but again i don't know for sure they

1690
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:42,399
but again i don't know for sure they
 

1691
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,070
but again i don't know for sure they
might change a generation so the first

1692
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,080
might change a generation so the first
 

1693
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,510
might change a generation so the first
time you load up your world it adds a

1694
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:45,520
time you load up your world it adds a
 

1695
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,029
time you load up your world it adds a
bunch of stone underneath

1696
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
bunch of stone underneath
 

1697
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,310
bunch of stone underneath
we'll see but uh yeah we might be able

1698
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
we'll see but uh yeah we might be able
 

1699
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,149
we'll see but uh yeah we might be able
to expand down in our

1700
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:52,159
to expand down in our
 

1701
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,630
to expand down in our
existing man cave as well which would be

1702
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,640
existing man cave as well which would be
 

1703
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,190
existing man cave as well which would be
cool

1704
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,200
cool
 

1705
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,190

gathering i was able to catch up and uh
 

1715
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,789
gathering i was able to catch up and uh
we invest now for the future right

1716
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:06,799
we invest now for the future right
 

1717
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,310
we invest now for the future right
something like that

1718
