56
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
you kind of do with your eyes i suppose
 

57
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,310

make a path underneath the path here

338
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
make a path underneath the path here
 

339
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:06,469
make a path underneath the path here
all around the city

340
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479

 

341
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,309

all right very good very good so we got

342
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
all right very good very good so we got
 

343
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,990
all right very good very good so we got
that all set up now we're ready to move

344
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
that all set up now we're ready to move
 

345
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,790
that all set up now we're ready to move
our dog

346
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
our dog
 

347
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,350
our dog
into place here this is a cool trick by

348
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
into place here this is a cool trick by
 

349
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,070
into place here this is a cool trick by
the way

350
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
the way
 

351
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,390
the way
if you have a mob in a boat and you know

352
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
if you have a mob in a boat and you know
 

353
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,749
if you have a mob in a boat and you know
sometimes when you try to get them out

354
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
sometimes when you try to get them out
 

355
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,350
sometimes when you try to get them out
yet you whack the boat and it hits the

356
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
yet you whack the boat and it hits the
 

357
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,550
yet you whack the boat and it hits the
animal instead

358
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
animal instead
 

359
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,070
animal instead
this is like a safe way of doing it just

360
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
this is like a safe way of doing it just
 

361
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,390
this is like a safe way of doing it just
use a lead pulls them right out

362
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
use a lead pulls them right out
 

363
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,390
use a lead pulls them right out
and also in minecraft 1.11.1 they made a

364
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
and also in minecraft 1.11.1 they made a
 

365
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,870
and also in minecraft 1.11.1 they made a
change a bug fix where you can actually

366
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
change a bug fix where you can actually
 

367
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,749
change a bug fix where you can actually
lead

368
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
lead
 

369
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,790
lead
hostile wolves this is not a tame globe

370
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
hostile wolves this is not a tame globe
 

371
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,629
hostile wolves this is not a tame globe
the hostile one which is what we need

372
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
the hostile one which is what we need
 

373
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,870
the hostile one which is what we need
because those stupid tamed wolves

374
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
because those stupid tamed wolves
 

375
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,390
because those stupid tamed wolves
they always teleport to you and die

376
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
they always teleport to you and die
 

377
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,869
they always teleport to you and die
even if they're in a minecart they're

378
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
even if they're in a minecart they're
 

379
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,950
even if they're in a minecart they're
like totally useless

380
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
like totally useless
 

381
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,150
like totally useless
so this guy he's going to stay

382
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
so this guy he's going to stay
 

383
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,309
so this guy he's going to stay
underneath our path here so i basically

384
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
underneath our path here so i basically
 

385
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,430
underneath our path here so i basically
just chiseled out an

386
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
just chiseled out an
 

387
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,950
just chiseled out an
area all the way under and i made it

388
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
area all the way under and i made it
 

389
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,629
area all the way under and i made it
fairly wide just to include

390
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
fairly wide just to include
 

391
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,070
fairly wide just to include
increases uh pathfinding chance

392
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
increases uh pathfinding chance
 

393
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,670
increases uh pathfinding chance
uh so hopefully he doesn't sit around

394
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
uh so hopefully he doesn't sit around
 

395
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,350
uh so hopefully he doesn't sit around
too much we'll let him go and to see how

396
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
too much we'll let him go and to see how
 

397
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,270
too much we'll let him go and to see how
he moves

398
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
he moves
 

399
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,550
he moves
i would love it if he would just like

400
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
i would love it if he would just like
 

401
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,150
i would love it if he would just like
run straight all the time but that's not

402
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
run straight all the time but that's not
 

403
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,589
run straight all the time but that's not
gonna happen

404
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
gonna happen
 

405
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,430
gonna happen
and i could put him in a minecart and

406
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
and i could put him in a minecart and
 

407
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,110
and i could put him in a minecart and
force them to move but it would be very

408
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
force them to move but it would be very
 

409
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,110
force them to move but it would be very
loud

410
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
loud
 

411
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,309
loud
and also they tend to fight minecarts

412
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
and also they tend to fight minecarts
 

413
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,670
and also they tend to fight minecarts
anyway can't really control them oh

414
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
anyway can't really control them oh
 

415
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,589
anyway can't really control them oh
please move at least a little bit though

416
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599

 

417
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,510

okay no that wasn't very good

418
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
okay no that wasn't very good
 

419
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,790
okay no that wasn't very good
hopefully hopefully he moves

420
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
hopefully hopefully he moves
 

421
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,469
hopefully hopefully he moves
a fair bit we might

422
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479

 

423
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,870

might need that minecart though

424
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
might need that minecart though
 

425
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,190
might need that minecart though
oh i heard the wolf all right we'll let

426
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,200
oh i heard the wolf all right we'll let
 

427
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,829
oh i heard the wolf all right we'll let
them go

428
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839

 

429
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,110

some of them found them yeah they found

430
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
some of them found them yeah they found
 

431
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,350
some of them found them yeah they found
them okay cool

432
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
them okay cool
 

433
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,670
them okay cool
so the idea is wherever the wolf goes is

434
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
so the idea is wherever the wolf goes is
 

435
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,110
so the idea is wherever the wolf goes is
where the llamas are gonna go

436
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
where the llamas are gonna go
 

437
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,070
where the llamas are gonna go
they won't break off from the wolf ever

438
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
they won't break off from the wolf ever
 

439
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,949
they won't break off from the wolf ever
so

440
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959
so
 

441
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,070
so
i don't have to worry about putting

442
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
i don't have to worry about putting
 

443
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,150
i don't have to worry about putting
these guys away they'll just

444
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
these guys away they'll just
 

445
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,269
these guys away they'll just
gravitate towards the wolf always

446
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
gravitate towards the wolf always
 

447
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,710
gravitate towards the wolf always
and i would like it if they would like

448
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
and i would like it if they would like
 

449
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,790
and i would like it if they would like
walk along the path here so that's why

450
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
walk along the path here so that's why
 

451
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,070
walk along the path here so that's why
we might need a minecart

452
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
we might need a minecart
 

453
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,950
we might need a minecart
because that wolf isn't moving very much

454
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:12,960

 

455
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,150

whoa okay that's a wild

458
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
whoa okay that's a wild
 

459
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,230
whoa okay that's a wild
wild rest right there so here's the

460
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
wild rest right there so here's the
 

461
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,190
wild rest right there so here's the
other problem

462
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
other problem
 

463
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,150
other problem
with uh using a minecart though i think

464
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
with uh using a minecart though i think
 

465
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,110
with uh using a minecart though i think
we're gonna have to

466
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
we're gonna have to
 

467
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,790
we're gonna have to
but we can't just run it straight

468
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
but we can't just run it straight
 

469
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,350
but we can't just run it straight
through here if we do

470
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
through here if we do
 

471
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,030
through here if we do
the wolf is gonna be faster than the

472
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
the wolf is gonna be faster than the
 

473
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,790
the wolf is gonna be faster than the
llamas and then

474
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
llamas and then
 

475
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,389
llamas and then
they'll break the connection if if he

476
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
they'll break the connection if if he
 

477
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,070
they'll break the connection if if he
gets away from them

478
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
gets away from them
 

479
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,310
gets away from them
so we have to do like the zigzag thing

480
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
so we have to do like the zigzag thing
 

481
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,190
so we have to do like the zigzag thing
and hopefully

482
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
and hopefully
 

483
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,230
and hopefully
they don't zigzag as well hopefully they

484
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
they don't zigzag as well hopefully they
 

485
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,230
they don't zigzag as well hopefully they
walk straight

486
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
walk straight
 

487
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,949
walk straight
and also hopefully the minecart doesn't

488
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
and also hopefully the minecart doesn't
 

489
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,190
and also hopefully the minecart doesn't
get stuck

490
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
get stuck
 

491
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,030
get stuck
a lot of possible complications with

492
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
a lot of possible complications with
 

493
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,030
a lot of possible complications with
this

494
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
this
 

495
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,630
this
okay he's moving pretty good i can hear

496
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
okay he's moving pretty good i can hear
 

497
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,150
okay he's moving pretty good i can hear
them moving above ground let's go check

498
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
them moving above ground let's go check
 

499
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,030
them moving above ground let's go check
him out

500
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
him out
 

501
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,110
him out
we cannot let the wolf see the llamas if

502
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
we cannot let the wolf see the llamas if
 

503
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,590
we cannot let the wolf see the llamas if
we do i think he'll get aggro

504
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
we do i think he'll get aggro
 

505
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,310
we do i think he'll get aggro
and then this is all done for possibly

506
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
and then this is all done for possibly
 

507
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,750
and then this is all done for possibly
i'm not sure though we might be able to

508
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
i'm not sure though we might be able to
 

509
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,230
i'm not sure though we might be able to
reset it somehow

510
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
reset it somehow
 

511
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,389
reset it somehow
um okay what are they doing

512
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
um okay what are they doing
 

513
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,710
um okay what are they doing
one of them one of them broke the

514
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
one of them one of them broke the
 

515
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,310
one of them one of them broke the
connection over here i guess he was too

516
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
connection over here i guess he was too
 

517
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,509
connection over here i guess he was too
far away

518
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
far away
 

519
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,389
far away
so bring him closer those guys are

520
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
so bring him closer those guys are
 

521
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,350
so bring him closer those guys are
following them they're kind of

522
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
following them they're kind of
 

523
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,110
following them they're kind of
zigzagging a little bit though it seems

524
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120

 

525
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,069

they look like they're drunk got a pack

526
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
they look like they're drunk got a pack
 

527
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:37,910
they look like they're drunk got a pack
of drunk llamas

528
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920

 

529
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,069

oh he did a spin even oh snap

530
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
oh he did a spin even oh snap
 

531
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,750
oh he did a spin even oh snap
we could probably move the wolf a little

532
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
we could probably move the wolf a little
 

533
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,350
we could probably move the wolf a little
bit faster than that but that looks kind

534
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
bit faster than that but that looks kind
 

535
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,550
bit faster than that but that looks kind
of funny too

536
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560

 

537
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,470

all right so it's kind of working right

538
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
all right so it's kind of working right
 

539
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,389
all right so it's kind of working right
now but not as well as i would like it

540
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
now but not as well as i would like it
 

541
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,030
now but not as well as i would like it
to

542
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
to
 

543
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,150
to
you see they keep breaking the

544
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
you see they keep breaking the
 

545
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,230
you see they keep breaking the
connection the wolf gets too

546
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
connection the wolf gets too
 

547
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,310
connection the wolf gets too
far ahead of them lost another one there

548
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
far ahead of them lost another one there
 

549
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,150
far ahead of them lost another one there
and then when it goes by they'll pick it

550
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
and then when it goes by they'll pick it
 

551
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,670
and then when it goes by they'll pick it
up again but uh

552
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
up again but uh
 

553
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,030
up again but uh
i think i'm gonna try to switch over to

554
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
i think i'm gonna try to switch over to
 

555
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,870
i think i'm gonna try to switch over to
water streams instead of the mine carts

556
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
water streams instead of the mine carts
 

557
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,750
water streams instead of the mine carts
see if that's any better

558
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
see if that's any better
 

559
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,550
see if that's any better
okay so i think i think i figured out a

560
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
okay so i think i think i figured out a
 

561
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,990
okay so i think i think i figured out a
pattern that'll work here

562
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
pattern that'll work here
 

563
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,790
pattern that'll work here
what we're gonna do is half slab and

564
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
what we're gonna do is half slab and
 

565
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,710
what we're gonna do is half slab and
then slab over there so it's gonna push

566
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
then slab over there so it's gonna push
 

567
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,269
then slab over there so it's gonna push
the wolf

568
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
the wolf
 

569
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,829
the wolf
up on top of the slab and then we're

570
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
up on top of the slab and then we're
 

571
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,509
up on top of the slab and then we're
gonna have another water stream over

572
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
gonna have another water stream over
 

573
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,710
gonna have another water stream over
here

574
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
here
 

575
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,230
here
it's been a while since i did anything

576
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
it's been a while since i did anything
 

577
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,350
it's been a while since i did anything
with uh moving mobs around with water

578
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
with uh moving mobs around with water
 

579
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,990
with uh moving mobs around with water
okay and i'm not sure i ever did figure

580
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
okay and i'm not sure i ever did figure
 

581
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,269
okay and i'm not sure i ever did figure
out a way of doing it with a one

582
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
out a way of doing it with a one
 

583
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,310
out a way of doing it with a one
tall mob like a wolf but this should

584
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
tall mob like a wolf but this should
 

585
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,310
tall mob like a wolf but this should
work

586
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
work
 

587
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,430
work
right maybe i did i just can't remember

588
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
right maybe i did i just can't remember
 

589
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,030
right maybe i did i just can't remember
um yes so if if he's stuck in this water

590
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
um yes so if if he's stuck in this water
 

591
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,790
um yes so if if he's stuck in this water
for too long he'll drown but he should

592
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
for too long he'll drown but he should
 

593
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,350
for too long he'll drown but he should
get pushed

594
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
get pushed
 

595
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,430
get pushed
through right away unless he gets stuck

596
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
through right away unless he gets stuck
 

597
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,629
through right away unless he gets stuck
on the stairs up there

598
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
on the stairs up there
 

599
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,870
on the stairs up there
hopefully i think he's bigger than that

600
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:56,880
hopefully i think he's bigger than that
 

601
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,389
hopefully i think he's bigger than that
the spacing between the stairs though

602
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
the spacing between the stairs though
 

603
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:58,949
the spacing between the stairs though
right

604
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
right
 

605
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,790
right
hopefully okay so that's kind of working

606
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
hopefully okay so that's kind of working
 

607
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,870
hopefully okay so that's kind of working
it's pretty slow though

608
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880

 

609
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,310

it would look better if there wasn't

610
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
it would look better if there wasn't
 

611
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,829
it would look better if there wasn't

but it's a lot more consistent than the
 

617
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,430
but it's a lot more consistent than the
minecart for sure

618

minecart for sure
 

619
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,629
minecart for sure

689
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,230
on here for today and i'll try to get
that fixed up for next time i think i

690
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
that fixed up for next time i think i
 

691
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,910
that fixed up for next time i think i
can get it working just by changing

692
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
can get it working just by changing
 

693
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,910
can get it working just by changing
those slaps to stairs but i could be

694
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
those slaps to stairs but i could be
 

695
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,389
those slaps to stairs but i could be
wrong and this could drag on forever

696
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:54,399
wrong and this could drag on forever
 

697
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,910
wrong and this could drag on forever
so uh what we're gonna do here

it might stick a little bit to this
 

761
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,389
it might stick a little bit to this
theme as well but then we got this whole

00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839
flat boring swamp we've seen a million
 

773
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,389
flat boring swamp we've seen a million
of

774
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
of
 

775
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,310
of
uh right next to my home here we should

776
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
uh right next to my home here we should
 

777
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,150
uh right next to my home here we should
try to do something a little bit cooler

778
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
try to do something a little bit cooler
 

779
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,269
try to do something a little bit cooler
i made one custom mushroom when these

780
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
i made one custom mushroom when these
 

781
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,870
i made one custom mushroom when these
first came out i think that looks pretty

782
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
first came out i think that looks pretty
 

783
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,310
first came out i think that looks pretty
good but i also want to try make some

784
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
good but i also want to try make some
 

785
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,710
good but i also want to try make some
big mushroom trees

786
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
big mushroom trees
 

787
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,189
big mushroom trees
to go along with like these smaller ones

788
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
to go along with like these smaller ones
 

789
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,550
to go along with like these smaller ones
um

790
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
um
 

791
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,069
um
so maybe we'll put one right over here

792
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
so maybe we'll put one right over here
 

793
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,590
so maybe we'll put one right over here
let's see if we can we can build one of

794
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
let's see if we can we can build one of
 

795
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,790
let's see if we can we can build one of
these together so it's kind of like

796
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
these together so it's kind of like
 

797
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,550
these together so it's kind of like
building a custom tree you just put down

798
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
building a custom tree you just put down
 

799
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,350
building a custom tree you just put down
like

800
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360
like
 

801
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,790
like
a base a trunk of some sort

802
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
a base a trunk of some sort
 

803
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,069
a base a trunk of some sort
give it a crazy random shape and then

804
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
give it a crazy random shape and then
 

805
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,670
give it a crazy random shape and then
start building it up

806
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:39,680
start building it up
 

807
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,030
start building it up
fattening it up as you go

808
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
fattening it up as you go
 

809
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,150
fattening it up as you go
and it's going to be amazing

810
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
and it's going to be amazing
 

811
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,629
and it's going to be amazing
i have a rough idea of how to do this

812
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
i have a rough idea of how to do this
 

813
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,590
i have a rough idea of how to do this
the cool thing about

814
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
the cool thing about
 

815
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,749
the cool thing about
building mushrooms compared to custom

816
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
building mushrooms compared to custom
 

817
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,230
building mushrooms compared to custom
trees is uh

818
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
trees is uh
 

819
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,470
trees is uh
with mushrooms you don't need to place a

820
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
with mushrooms you don't need to place a
 

821
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,749
with mushrooms you don't need to place a
million leaf blocks

822
00:15:59,749 --> 00:15:59,759
million leaf blocks
 

823
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,670
million leaf blocks
you just you can use a symmetrical

824
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
you just you can use a symmetrical
 

825
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,350
you just you can use a symmetrical
pattern even and it will look

826
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
pattern even and it will look
 

827
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,910
pattern even and it will look
good while custom trees you gotta place

828
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920
good while custom trees you gotta place
 

829
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,910
good while custom trees you gotta place
down so many leaves and it takes forever

830
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
down so many leaves and it takes forever
 

831
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,710
down so many leaves and it takes forever
to build them

832
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
to build them
 

833
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,990
to build them
because of that yeah i'm gonna make this

834
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
because of that yeah i'm gonna make this
 

835
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,069
because of that yeah i'm gonna make this
fairly tall

836
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
fairly tall
 

837
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,150
fairly tall
and probably about two three blocks

838
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
and probably about two three blocks
 

839
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,069
and probably about two three blocks
wide i would say maybe

840
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
wide i would say maybe
 

841
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,470
wide i would say maybe
how's that looking all right it's a

842
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
how's that looking all right it's a
 

843
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,550
how's that looking all right it's a
start it's a start

844
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
start it's a start
 

845
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,150
start it's a start
um now what i want to do is start

846
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
um now what i want to do is start
 

847
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,670
um now what i want to do is start
branching out as well

848
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
branching out as well
 

849
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,550
branching out as well
so like this looks a little weird over

850
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
so like this looks a little weird over
 

851
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,590
so like this looks a little weird over
here this is like

852
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
here this is like
 

853
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,189
here this is like
hanging off it looks like so we need to

854
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
hanging off it looks like so we need to
 

855
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,670
hanging off it looks like so we need to
change that so maybe

856
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
change that so maybe
 

857
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,670
change that so maybe
let's try to create a bit more continuum

858
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
let's try to create a bit more continuum
 

859
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,590
let's try to create a bit more continuum
here

860
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
here
 

861
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,110
here
well why is that broken that was weird

862
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120

 

863
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,470

start bulking this out

864
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480

 

865
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,389

yeah oh actually see like this is bad

866
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:56,399
yeah oh actually see like this is bad
 

867
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,670
yeah oh actually see like this is bad
when you have a

868
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680
when you have a
 

869
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,870
when you have a
block here and a block here you should

870
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880
block here and a block here you should
 

871
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,790
block here and a block here you should
always continue it

872
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
always continue it
 

873
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,269
always continue it
so i'm gonna put one more block right

874
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
so i'm gonna put one more block right
 

875
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,309
so i'm gonna put one more block right
there

876
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
there
 

877
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,110
there
there that looks better um maybe even a

878
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
there that looks better um maybe even a
 

879
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,029
there that looks better um maybe even a
block here

880
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,039
block here
 

881
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,870
block here
you don't want any like big flat spots

882
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
you don't want any like big flat spots
 

883
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,230
you don't want any like big flat spots
like this either you want to always put

884
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240
like this either you want to always put
 

885
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,669
like this either you want to always put
a block here or

886
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
a block here or
 

887
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,710
a block here or
or something like that and then we're

888
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
or something like that and then we're
 

889
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,230
or something like that and then we're
going to start making branches

890
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
going to start making branches
 

891
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,189
going to start making branches
so mushroom trees have branches in case

892
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
so mushroom trees have branches in case
 

893
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,949
so mushroom trees have branches in case
you didn't know

894
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
you didn't know
 

895
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,949
you didn't know
we're gonna probably just go out three

896
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
we're gonna probably just go out three
 

897
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,990
we're gonna probably just go out three
or four blocks

898
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000

 

899
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,470

start curving it up like that gonna keep

900
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
start curving it up like that gonna keep
 

901
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,070
start curving it up like that gonna keep
these pretty thin

902
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
these pretty thin
 

903
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,230
these pretty thin
and then maybe go up one more and then

904
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
and then maybe go up one more and then
 

905
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,110
and then maybe go up one more and then
we're gonna do a

906
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
we're gonna do a
 

907
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,029
we're gonna do a
three by three thing of this this stuff

908
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:39,039
three by three thing of this this stuff
 

909
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,870
three by three thing of this this stuff
and i'm not even really planning this

910
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
and i'm not even really planning this
 

911
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,430
and i'm not even really planning this
out too much as i go as you can tell

912
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
out too much as i go as you can tell
 

913
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,789
out too much as i go as you can tell
but i think it's gonna look pretty good

914
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
but i think it's gonna look pretty good
 

915
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,630
but i think it's gonna look pretty good
i tried making some of these in creative

916
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
i tried making some of these in creative
 

917
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,830
i tried making some of these in creative
and it was very easy and each one only

918
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
and it was very easy and each one only
 

919
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,830
and it was very easy and each one only
took like 5-10 minutes

920
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
took like 5-10 minutes
 

921
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,350
took like 5-10 minutes
so i'm pretty excited about this

922
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
so i'm pretty excited about this
 

923
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,310
so i'm pretty excited about this
okay another trick i've seen people do

924
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
okay another trick i've seen people do
 

925
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,190
okay another trick i've seen people do
is they grow

926
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
is they grow
 

927
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,870
is they grow
jungle trees and then they replace all

928
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:00,880
jungle trees and then they replace all
 

929
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,669
jungle trees and then they replace all
the leaves with uh

930
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
the leaves with uh
 

931
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,669
the leaves with uh
with these netherward blocks and then

932
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
with these netherward blocks and then
 

933
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,750
with these netherward blocks and then
the the trunk of the tree they replace

934
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
the the trunk of the tree they replace
 

935
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,350
the the trunk of the tree they replace
with bone and that looks pretty good too

936
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
with bone and that looks pretty good too
 

937
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,310
with bone and that looks pretty good too
but

938
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
but
 

939
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,669
but
you can't really do that in survival

940
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:11,679
you can't really do that in survival
 

941
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,270
you can't really do that in survival
because the tree will start dying as you

942
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,280
because the tree will start dying as you
 

943
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,990
because the tree will start dying as you
start replacing

944
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
start replacing
 

945
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,950
start replacing
the blocks yeah that's what i want to do

946
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
the blocks yeah that's what i want to do
 

947
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,830
the blocks yeah that's what i want to do
just like that

948
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
just like that
 

949
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,909
just like that
probably have like two of those two or

950
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
probably have like two of those two or
 

951
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,350
probably have like two of those two or
three of those branches on each of these

952
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
three of those branches on each of these
 

953
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,390
three of those branches on each of these
mushroom trees

954
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
mushroom trees
 

955
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,110
mushroom trees
sticking out so then i'll probably put

956
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
sticking out so then i'll probably put
 

957
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,549
sticking out so then i'll probably put
one a little bit higher up and

958
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
one a little bit higher up and
 

959
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,310
one a little bit higher up and
maybe one more and then a big cap on the

960
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,320
maybe one more and then a big cap on the
 

961
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,830
maybe one more and then a big cap on the
top

962
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
top
 

963
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,029
top
yeah so i'm trying to give this main

964
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
yeah so i'm trying to give this main
 

965
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,310
yeah so i'm trying to give this main
trunk a little bit of character so you

966
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
trunk a little bit of character so you
 

967
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,510
trunk a little bit of character so you
can see it kind of curves out to the

968
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520
can see it kind of curves out to the
 

969
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,029
can see it kind of curves out to the
right and it's starting to curve

970
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
right and it's starting to curve
 

971
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,350
right and it's starting to curve
back and i think that looks pretty cool

972
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
back and i think that looks pretty cool
 

973
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,950
back and i think that looks pretty cool
and wherever you can take advantage of

974
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:38,960
and wherever you can take advantage of
 

975
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,710
and wherever you can take advantage of
the the depth

976
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
the the depth
 

977
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,590
the the depth
of it uh try to so you can see it like

978
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
of it uh try to so you can see it like
 

979
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,789
of it uh try to so you can see it like
goes in over there and

980
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:44,799
goes in over there and
 

981
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,310
goes in over there and
and over there and it's out over here

982
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
and over there and it's out over here
 

983
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,230
and over there and it's out over here
it's not like a big flat thing

984
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
it's not like a big flat thing
 

985
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,190
it's not like a big flat thing
uh on this other side though we got a

986
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
uh on this other side though we got a
 

987
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,789
uh on this other side though we got a
bit of a flat thing going on right so

988
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
bit of a flat thing going on right so
 

989
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,230
bit of a flat thing going on right so
you got to try

990
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
you got to try
 

991
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,270
you got to try
try to break that up wherever you can

992
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
try to break that up wherever you can
 

993
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,909
try to break that up wherever you can
uh where does it make most sense so it's

994
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
uh where does it make most sense so it's
 

995
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,430
uh where does it make most sense so it's
it's thin here so maybe we

996
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
it's thin here so maybe we
 

997
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,990
it's thin here so maybe we
we bulked it up here all right

998
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
we bulked it up here all right
 

999
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,350
we bulked it up here all right
yeah i think that'll look good nope

1000
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,360
yeah i think that'll look good nope
 

1001
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,590
yeah i think that'll look good nope
it needs more if you just have like

1002
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
it needs more if you just have like
 

1003
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,870
it needs more if you just have like
little things like that sometimes it can

1004
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:12,880
little things like that sometimes it can
 

1005
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,230
little things like that sometimes it can
look weird too

1006
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,240
look weird too
 

1007
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,270
look weird too
um we could try to

1008
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,280

 

1009
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,789

maybe do that awesome so i'm pretty

1010
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
maybe do that awesome so i'm pretty
 

1011
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,990
maybe do that awesome so i'm pretty
happy with that for the trunk

1012
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
happy with that for the trunk
 

1013
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,470
happy with that for the trunk
i think that looks good nice and organic

1014
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
i think that looks good nice and organic
 

1015
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,390
i think that looks good nice and organic
uh looks good for most angles as well

1016
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
uh looks good for most angles as well
 

1017
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,350
uh looks good for most angles as well
you always want to

1018
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360
you always want to
 

1019
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,270
you always want to
take a look around just double check

1020
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
take a look around just double check
 

1021
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,190
take a look around just double check
this angle maybe not as nice

1022
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,200
this angle maybe not as nice
 

1023
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,430
this angle maybe not as nice
but you know you don't want to get too

1024
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
but you know you don't want to get too
 

1025
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,190
but you know you don't want to get too
crazy overboard or it'll spin forever on

1026
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
crazy overboard or it'll spin forever on
 

1027
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,950
crazy overboard or it'll spin forever on
this kind of stuff

1028
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:38,960
this kind of stuff
 

1029
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,590
this kind of stuff
um so now we gotta add maybe two more

1030
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
um so now we gotta add maybe two more
 

1031
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,310
um so now we gotta add maybe two more
branches and

1032
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
branches and
 

1033
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,549
branches and
the cap on the top and it's done i would

1034
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
the cap on the top and it's done i would
 

1035
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,510
the cap on the top and it's done i would
say

1036
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
say
 

1037
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,549
say
so the main

1038
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:48,559
so the main
 

1039
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,310
so the main
trunk goes off to the right curves to

1040
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
trunk goes off to the right curves to
 

1041
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,350
trunk goes off to the right curves to
the right and then we have a little

1042
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
the right and then we have a little
 

1043
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,230
the right and then we have a little
branch

1044
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
branch
 

1045
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,150
branch
um so it's kind of going up and then it

1046
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
um so it's kind of going up and then it
 

1047
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,510
um so it's kind of going up and then it
starts curving to the left so i think we

1048
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,520
starts curving to the left so i think we
 

1049
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,350
starts curving to the left so i think we
should put another branch over there

1050
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
should put another branch over there
 

1051
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,270
should put another branch over there
it's kind of how plants grow if you ever

1052
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
it's kind of how plants grow if you ever
 

1053
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,070
it's kind of how plants grow if you ever
like look at them and study them

1054
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
like look at them and study them
 

1055
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,630
like look at them and study them
if the main branch curves or if it grows

1056
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
if the main branch curves or if it grows
 

1057
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,310
if the main branch curves or if it grows
a branch then the main branch kind of

1058
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
a branch then the main branch kind of
 

1059
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,350
a branch then the main branch kind of
curves away from

1060
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
curves away from
 

1061
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,070
curves away from
the branch it just grew for a lot of

1062
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080
the branch it just grew for a lot of
 

1063
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,310
the branch it just grew for a lot of
plants

1064
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
plants
 

1065
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,350
plants
okay so maybe

1066
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
okay so maybe
 

1067
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,950
okay so maybe
we don't want to just do it straight

1068
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960
we don't want to just do it straight
 

1069
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,470
we don't want to just do it straight
either we want to add a bit of variety

1070
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
either we want to add a bit of variety
 

1071
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,190
either we want to add a bit of variety
to it

1072
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
to it
 

1073
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,830
to it
um it won't look as good as if we do it

1074
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:21,840
um it won't look as good as if we do it
 

1075
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,710
um it won't look as good as if we do it
straight

1076
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720
straight
 

1077
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,950
straight
but our eyes will kind of correct for

1078
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:24,960
but our eyes will kind of correct for
 

1079
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,909
but our eyes will kind of correct for
the

1080
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
the
 

1081
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,950
the
odd shape i think and then maybe we'll

1082
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960
odd shape i think and then maybe we'll
 

1083
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,990
odd shape i think and then maybe we'll
go over here

1084
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000

 

1085
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,270

yeah there we go i think that looks

1086
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,280
yeah there we go i think that looks
 

1087
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,710
yeah there we go i think that looks
pretty good that's the one we did

1088
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:34,720
pretty good that's the one we did
 

1089
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,830
pretty good that's the one we did
together

1090
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
together
 

1091
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,549
together
and it comes out two blocks uh forward

1092
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
and it comes out two blocks uh forward
 

1093
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,909
and it comes out two blocks uh forward
compared to this one

1094
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
compared to this one
 

1095
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,830
compared to this one
we also never want to have them on the

1096
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:41,840
we also never want to have them on the
 

1097
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,669
we also never want to have them on the
same height level so it's also two

1098
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:43,679
same height level so it's also two
 

1099
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,110
same height level so it's also two
blocks higher up

1100
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,120
blocks higher up
 

1101
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,029
blocks higher up
and just creates a staggered effect

1102
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
and just creates a staggered effect
 

1103
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,710
and just creates a staggered effect
looks good that way i think

1104
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
looks good that way i think
 

1105
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,990
looks good that way i think
i added one more on the back here

1106
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
i added one more on the back here
 

1107
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,909
i added one more on the back here
maybe not so good it looks weird it just

1108
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:55,919
maybe not so good it looks weird it just
 

1109
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,510
maybe not so good it looks weird it just
comes straight out maybe let's add one

1110
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520
comes straight out maybe let's add one
 

1111
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,870
comes straight out maybe let's add one
more bone block

1112
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:58,880
more bone block
 

1113
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,270
more bone block
right there does that help it

1114
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,280
right there does that help it
 

1115
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,950
right there does that help it
it looks it needs to look structurally

1116
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
it looks it needs to look structurally
 

1117
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,710
it looks it needs to look structurally
supported

1118
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
supported
 

1119
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,750
supported
uh yeah that would work except

1120
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
uh yeah that would work except
 

1121
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,990
uh yeah that would work except
now it looks weird over there you see we

1122
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
now it looks weird over there you see we
 

1123
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,350
now it looks weird over there you see we
have that block

1124
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,360
have that block
 

1125
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,789
have that block
and that block on the same height we

1126
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:14,799
and that block on the same height we
 

1127
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,549
and that block on the same height we
always want to stagger things if we can

1128
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
always want to stagger things if we can
 

1129
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,070
always want to stagger things if we can
and we definitely can here

1130
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
and we definitely can here
 

1131
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,350
and we definitely can here
maybe we'll go up two

1132
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360

 

1133
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,350

and should we take that out let's take

1134
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
and should we take that out let's take
 

1135
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,350
and should we take that out let's take
that out fix that

1136
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,360

 

1137
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,870

okay so then at the top of the trunk

1138
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:28,880
okay so then at the top of the trunk
 

1139
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,470
okay so then at the top of the trunk
we're going to do the big mushroom cap

1140
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,480
we're going to do the big mushroom cap
 

1141
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:30,950
we're going to do the big mushroom cap
on

1142
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
on
 

1143
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,430
on
on the very tippy top we're going to do

1144
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:33,440
on the very tippy top we're going to do
 

1145
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,110
on the very tippy top we're going to do
pretty much the same shape except uh

1146
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
pretty much the same shape except uh
 

1147
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,669
pretty much the same shape except uh
we'll

1148
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
we'll
 

1149
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,070
we'll
make it come out on the sides here make

1150
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,080
make it come out on the sides here make
 

1151
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,510
make it come out on the sides here make
it a little bit bigger than

1152
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,520
it a little bit bigger than
 

1153
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,390
it a little bit bigger than
the little ones and then we're going to

1154
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:42,400
the little ones and then we're going to
 

1155
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,430
the little ones and then we're going to
do two rings

1156
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
do two rings
 

1157
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,789
do two rings
down from that so come out one block and

1158
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
down from that so come out one block and
 

1159
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,830
down from that so come out one block and
one block down

1160
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:49,840

 

1161
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,750

like this uh yeah kind of keep that

1162
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
like this uh yeah kind of keep that
 

1163
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,350
like this uh yeah kind of keep that
shape and then come out one more after

1164
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:55,360
shape and then come out one more after
 

1165
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,350
shape and then come out one more after
that

1166
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
that
 

1167
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,270
that
like that

1168
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,280

 

1169
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,830
