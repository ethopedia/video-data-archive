done nexus here
and uh i think we'll try to make a

178
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
and uh i think we'll try to make a
 

179
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,710
and uh i think we'll try to make a
building for it today if we can

180
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
building for it today if we can
 

181
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,470
building for it today if we can
as it is right now it's functional we

182
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
as it is right now it's functional we
 

183
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,949
as it is right now it's functional we
have a face plates we can operate it

184
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
have a face plates we can operate it
 

185
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,229
have a face plates we can operate it
every time i use it i'm worried a

people have
 

203
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,350
people have
actually working designs so i might just

204
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
actually working designs so i might just
 

205
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,110
actually working designs so i might just
copy one of those later

206
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
copy one of those later
 

207
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,710
copy one of those later
but right now it's in the way so we're

but right now it's in the way so we're
 

209
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,310
but right now it's in the way so we're
going to move it here

210
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
going to move it here
 

211
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,629

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
those are the main part of the room
 

233
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,909

really these buttons here we really want

234
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
really these buttons here we really want
 

235
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,909
really these buttons here we really want
them to stand out

00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
them to stand out
 

237
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,270

so i've been playing around with color
schemes a little bit at first i was

240
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
schemes a little bit at first i was
 

241
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,950
schemes a little bit at first i was
thinking of using emeralds

242
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
thinking of using emeralds
 

243
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,870
thinking of using emeralds
for behind the buttons because they they

244
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
for behind the buttons because they they
 

245
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,390
for behind the buttons because they they
really stand out

246
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
really stand out
 

247
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,430
really stand out
and i like green a lot

248
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
and i like green a lot
 

249
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,790
and i like green a lot
but uh like

250
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
but uh like
 

251
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,990
but uh like
lime clay and that a lot of people it's

252
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
lime clay and that a lot of people it's
 

253
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,749
lime clay and that a lot of people it's
kind of hard to use it in a way that

254
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
kind of hard to use it in a way that
 

255
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,189
kind of hard to use it in a way that
it's gonna look nice that everybody

256
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
it's gonna look nice that everybody
 

257
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,870
it's gonna look nice that everybody
likes you know so

258
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
likes you know so
 

259
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,710
likes you know so
i think blue is a little easier to pull

260
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
i think blue is a little easier to pull
 

261
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,350
i think blue is a little easier to pull
off so instead of using emeralds behind

262
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
off so instead of using emeralds behind
 

263
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,830
off so instead of using emeralds behind
these buttons we're gonna use

264
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840
these buttons we're gonna use
 

265
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,909
these buttons we're gonna use
diamonds blue shiny rocks they're

266
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
diamonds blue shiny rocks they're
 

267
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,790
diamonds blue shiny rocks they're
they actually look pretty decent here um

268
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
they actually look pretty decent here um
 

269
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,950
they actually look pretty decent here um
i think

270
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
i think
 

271
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,029
i think
so let's see how hard is this gonna be

272
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
so let's see how hard is this gonna be
 

273
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,029
so let's see how hard is this gonna be
to change

274
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
to change
 

275
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,550
to change
looks like we just got some redstone

276
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
looks like we just got some redstone
 

277
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,990
looks like we just got some redstone
torches back here so we'll pull these

278
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
torches back here so we'll pull these
 

279
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,550
torches back here so we'll pull these
out

280
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560

 

281
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,029

light blue clay
 

337
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,749
light blue clay
as our main building block and then for

00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
as our main building block and then for
 

339
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,390
as our main building block and then for
the floor the bulk of the floor

340
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400

 

341
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,350

clay oh we had so much clay left over

342
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
clay oh we had so much clay left over
 

343
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,350
clay oh we had so much clay left over
from that big build i decided yeah let's

344
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
from that big build i decided yeah let's
 

345
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,870
from that big build i decided yeah let's
let's try it out here

346
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
let's try it out here
 

347
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,350
let's try it out here
uh it actually has a bit of a bluish

348
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
uh it actually has a bit of a bluish
 

349
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,629
uh it actually has a bit of a bluish
tinge

350
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
tinge
 

351
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,670
tinge
to it so it might not be terrible

352
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
to it so it might not be terrible
 

353
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,670
to it so it might not be terrible
we'll see like this is one of those

354
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
we'll see like this is one of those
 

355
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,270
we'll see like this is one of those
building blocks people don't use very

356
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
building blocks people don't use very
 

357
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,510
building blocks people don't use very
often

358
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
often
 

359
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,670
often
but i kind of think they go together

360
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
but i kind of think they go together
 

361
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,790
but i kind of think they go together
right

362
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
right
 

363
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,110
right
and hopefully hopefully the texture is

364
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
and hopefully hopefully the texture is
 

365
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,629
and hopefully hopefully the texture is
not terrible it kind of reminds me like

366
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
not terrible it kind of reminds me like
 

367
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,189
not terrible it kind of reminds me like
of concrete you know

368
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
of concrete you know
 

369
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,629
of concrete you know
interesting okay okay i'm not

370
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
interesting okay okay i'm not
 

371
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,670
interesting okay okay i'm not
sold on it just yet uh before we decide

372
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
sold on it just yet uh before we decide
 

373
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,790
sold on it just yet uh before we decide
with the floor though let's actually

374
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
with the floor though let's actually
 

375
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,110
with the floor though let's actually
work on the walls and the roof

376
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
work on the walls and the roof
 

377
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,270
work on the walls and the roof
and then it might blend better because

378
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
and then it might blend better because
 

379
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,749
and then it might blend better because
i'm gonna be adding more blue and stuff

380
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
i'm gonna be adding more blue and stuff
 

381
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,629
i'm gonna be adding more blue and stuff
uh oh yeah and by the way like every

382
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
uh oh yeah and by the way like every
 

383
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,029
uh oh yeah and by the way like every
time

384
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
time
 

385
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,309
time
we do something with the nexus

386
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
we do something with the nexus
 

387
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,510
we do something with the nexus
somebody's like ito what's the nexus

388
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
somebody's like ito what's the nexus
 

389
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,950
somebody's like ito what's the nexus
it's a giant storage room with automatic

390
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
it's a giant storage room with automatic
 

391
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,870
it's a giant storage room with automatic
item sorting and item retrieval so right

392
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
item sorting and item retrieval so right
 

393
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,830
item sorting and item retrieval so right
now i need some

394
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
now i need some
 

395
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,469
now i need some
court stairs actually so court stairs

396
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
court stairs actually so court stairs
 

397
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,710
court stairs actually so court stairs
have the code 6e

398
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
have the code 6e
 

399
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,990
have the code 6e
to request them we press 6

401
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,309

actually i think it's reversed right now

402
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
actually i think it's reversed right now
 

403
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,790

405
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,909
6 e
and hopefully we get court stairs so

406
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
and hopefully we get court stairs so
 

407
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,869
and hopefully we get court stairs so
this should request

408
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
this should request
 

409
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,070
this should request
16 of them i think uh yeah let's work on

410

16 of them i think uh yeah let's work on
 

411
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,270
16 of them i think uh yeah let's work on
the walls though here

412
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
the walls though here
 

413
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,430
the walls though here
it does take a moment to arrive oh and

414
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
it does take a moment to arrive oh and
 

415
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,070
it does take a moment to arrive oh and
there's some garbage in there

416
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
there's some garbage in there
 

417
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,350
there's some garbage in there
so very important we want to connect to

418
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
so very important we want to connect to
 

419
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,790
so very important we want to connect to
the tunnels we have over there that's

420
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
the tunnels we have over there that's
 

421
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,629
the tunnels we have over there that's
where the items are actually stored

422
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
where the items are actually stored
 

423
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,029
where the items are actually stored
uh there there's no real reason to go

424
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
uh there there's no real reason to go
 

425
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,230
uh there there's no real reason to go
there

426
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
there
 

427
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,469
there
but it's built you know i want some way

428
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
but it's built you know i want some way
 

429
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,830
but it's built you know i want some way
of connecting there anyway

430
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840
of connecting there anyway
 

431
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,270
of connecting there anyway
um let's go ahead and sleep here real

432
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
um let's go ahead and sleep here real
 

433
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,550

quick
 

435
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,309
quick
so yeah i think i'm going to put a a

436
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
so yeah i think i'm going to put a a
 

437
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,710
so yeah i think i'm going to put a a
passageway over here on both sides one

438
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
passageway over here on both sides one
 

439
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,629
passageway over here on both sides one
over here one over there

440
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
over here one over there
 

441
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,790
over here one over there
did they arrive okay i don't think there

442
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
did they arrive okay i don't think there
 

443
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,589
did they arrive okay i don't think there
was 16 in the system we got 15.

444
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
was 16 in the system we got 15.
 

445
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,070
was 16 in the system we got 15.
so yeah i wanted to try put those over

446
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
so yeah i wanted to try put those over
 

447
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,150
so yeah i wanted to try put those over
here

448
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
here
 

449
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,870
here
all right and the great news is bone

450
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
all right and the great news is bone
 

451
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,709
all right and the great news is bone
blocks are a thing now so

452
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
blocks are a thing now so
 

453
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,350
blocks are a thing now so
i don't have to go mine for a bajillion

454
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
i don't have to go mine for a bajillion
 

455
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,909
i don't have to go mine for a bajillion
courts

456
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
courts
 

457
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,230
courts
to finish up this project we're going to

458
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
to finish up this project we're going to
 

459
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,790
to finish up this project we're going to
switch over to using bone blocks and

460
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
switch over to using bone blocks and
 

461
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,870
switch over to using bone blocks and
this middle is kind of the feature of

462
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
this middle is kind of the feature of
 

463
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,190
this middle is kind of the feature of
the room so it'll be a bit brighter

464
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
the room so it'll be a bit brighter
 

465
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,790
the room so it'll be a bit brighter
and stand out so i think this is going

466
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,800
and stand out so i think this is going
 

467
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,829
and stand out so i think this is going
to work out pretty good actually

468
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
to work out pretty good actually
 

469
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,110
to work out pretty good actually
so i think we'll do this

470
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
so i think we'll do this
 

471
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,230
so i think we'll do this
maybe come out one more and then we'll

472
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
maybe come out one more and then we'll
 

473
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,670
maybe come out one more and then we'll
leave a

474
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
leave a
 

475
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,590
leave a
three or five wide passage let's leave a

476
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
three or five wide passage let's leave a
 

477
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,310
three or five wide passage let's leave a
five i think

478
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
five i think
 

479
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,910
five i think
and then do something like that so the

480
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
and then do something like that so the
 

481
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,070
and then do something like that so the
passageway will be over here

482
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
passageway will be over here
 

483
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,389
passageway will be over here
uh so let's get rid of this then

484
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
uh so let's get rid of this then
 

485
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,350
uh so let's get rid of this then
start making the border go this way like

486
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
start making the border go this way like
 

487
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,389
start making the border go this way like
that

488
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
that
 

489
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:45,030
that
this will be clay

490
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040

 

491
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,949

f zero haha

492
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
f zero haha
 

493
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,430
f zero haha

i'm gonna try to do the roof now uh
 

507
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,790
i'm gonna try to do the roof now uh
let's see

508
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
let's see
 

509
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,670
let's see
my plan is to do like an arch because

510
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
my plan is to do like an arch because
 

511
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,829
my plan is to do like an arch because
because you know me i like my arches so

512
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
because you know me i like my arches so
 

513
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,150
because you know me i like my arches so
probably yeah probably about that shape

514
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
probably yeah probably about that shape
 

515
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,509
probably yeah probably about that shape
there

516
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
there
 

517
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,350
there
uh do i got some dirt on me yeah let's

518
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
uh do i got some dirt on me yeah let's
 

519
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,590
uh do i got some dirt on me yeah let's
let's fill her up here

520
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
let's fill her up here
 

521
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,590
let's fill her up here
f zero is sea lanterns by the way i

522
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
f zero is sea lanterns by the way i
 

523
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,949
f zero is sea lanterns by the way i
don't i don't know what's up with these

524
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
don't i don't know what's up with these
 

525
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,710
don't i don't know what's up with these
buttons i'm getting like random amounts

526
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
buttons i'm getting like random amounts
 

527
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,269
buttons i'm getting like random amounts
of

528
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
of
 

529
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,069
of
stuff it's not 16 i got 25 there somehow

530
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
stuff it's not 16 i got 25 there somehow
 

531
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,870
stuff it's not 16 i got 25 there somehow
i was gonna put those down here get a

532
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
i was gonna put those down here get a
 

533
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,750
i was gonna put those down here get a
little light in

534
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
little light in
 

535
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,630
little light in
into the situation and you can see i did

536
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
into the situation and you can see i did
 

537
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,269
into the situation and you can see i did
like an ether door over there

538
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
like an ether door over there
 

539
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,710
like an ether door over there
uh which will up open up to the

540
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
uh which will up open up to the
 

541
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,190
uh which will up open up to the
passageways

542
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
passageways
 

543
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,790
passageways
all right do the same on that side i'll

544
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
all right do the same on that side i'll
 

545
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,230
all right do the same on that side i'll
do that off camera

546
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
do that off camera
 

547
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,790
do that off camera
and let's go up here and try to mark

548
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
and let's go up here and try to mark
 

549
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,550
and let's go up here and try to mark
this out

550
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
this out
 

551
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,670
this out
so maybe

552
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680

 

553
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,949

um there's some wire there let's start

554
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
um there's some wire there let's start
 

555
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,230
um there's some wire there let's start
on this side because it's blocked a

556
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
on this side because it's blocked a
 

557
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,550
on this side because it's blocked a
little bit more yeah maybe we'll do

558
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
little bit more yeah maybe we'll do
 

559
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,590
little bit more yeah maybe we'll do
something like

560
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
something like
 

561
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,670
something like
this go up two

562
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
this go up two
 

563
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,870
this go up two
and then maybe two again

564
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
and then maybe two again
 

565
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,230
and then maybe two again
and then fill in the middle

566
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
and then fill in the middle
 

567
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,990
and then fill in the middle
let's see how let's see how this works

568
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
let's see how let's see how this works
 

569
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,990
let's see how let's see how this works
out i find building episodes a little

570
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
out i find building episodes a little
 

571
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,350
out i find building episodes a little
bit tricky

572
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
bit tricky
 

573
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,750
bit tricky
it's like and now i'm going to place

574
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
it's like and now i'm going to place
 

575
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,110
it's like and now i'm going to place
this block over here

576
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
this block over here
 

577
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,269
this block over here
and this block over here i'm not exactly

578
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
and this block over here i'm not exactly
 

579
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,949
and this block over here i'm not exactly
sure a good way of doing them you know

580
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
sure a good way of doing them you know
 

581
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,470
sure a good way of doing them you know
it's i'm more use more used to logical

582
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
it's i'm more use more used to logical
 

583
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,110
it's i'm more use more used to logical
stuff

584
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
stuff
 

585
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,389
stuff
instead of actually building but

586
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
instead of actually building but
 

587
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,389
instead of actually building but
building is good

588
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
building is good
 

589
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,829
building is good
is this uh oh it is the middle okay

590
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
is this uh oh it is the middle okay
 

591
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,710
is this uh oh it is the middle okay
good so that works out to five

592
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720

 

593
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,910

and then we'll do two and then

594
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
and then we'll do two and then
 

595
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,310
and then we'll do two and then
two more and then maybe we'll switch

596
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
two more and then maybe we'll switch
 

597
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,470
two more and then maybe we'll switch
over to one

598
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
over to one
 

599
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,069
over to one
oh i fall down how does that work out

600
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
oh i fall down how does that work out
 

601
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,430
oh i fall down how does that work out
so this would go here

602
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440

 

603
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,030

bring that out here

604
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040

 

605
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,389

yeah so i'm gonna i'm gonna bring this

606
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
yeah so i'm gonna i'm gonna bring this
 

607
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,470
yeah so i'm gonna i'm gonna bring this
out a bit more

608
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
out a bit more
 

609
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,269
out a bit more
um maybe span quite a distance here

610
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
um maybe span quite a distance here
 

611
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,069
um maybe span quite a distance here
actually

612
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
actually
 

613
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,190
actually
and see what that looks like okay so

614
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
and see what that looks like okay so
 

615
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,069
and see what that looks like okay so
check it out guys

616
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
check it out guys
 

617
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,310
check it out guys
got a bit of an arch here i do really

618
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
got a bit of an arch here i do really
 

619
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,509
got a bit of an arch here i do really
like the shape of this

620
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
like the shape of this
 

621
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,629
like the shape of this
i think that's good but uh

622
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
i think that's good but uh
 

623
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,310
i think that's good but uh
you know there's a lot of white in this

624
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
you know there's a lot of white in this
 

625
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,550
you know there's a lot of white in this
build which i think is fine

626
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
build which i think is fine
 

627
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,470
build which i think is fine
but we gotta set a limit somewhere right

628
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,480
but we gotta set a limit somewhere right
 

629
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,910
but we gotta set a limit somewhere right
if we do this

630
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
if we do this
 

631
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,590
if we do this
and i haven't even gone as far as i want

632
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
and i haven't even gone as far as i want
 

633
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,150
and i haven't even gone as far as i want
with it it's gonna be so much white

634
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
with it it's gonna be so much white
 

635
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,030
with it it's gonna be so much white
so let's try to mix in some blue uh with

636
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
so let's try to mix in some blue uh with
 

637
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,670
so let's try to mix in some blue uh with
this i was thinking about doing a line

638
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680
this i was thinking about doing a line
 

639
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,710
this i was thinking about doing a line
uh with a pattern like a line going all

640
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
uh with a pattern like a line going all
 

641
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,310
uh with a pattern like a line going all
the way across here

642
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
the way across here
 

643
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,470
the way across here
so probably five wide thing

644
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
so probably five wide thing
 

645
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,550
so probably five wide thing
either this pattern

646
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560

 

647
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,470

something like that or we'll do

648
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
something like that or we'll do
 

649
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,829
something like that or we'll do
this one

650
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839

 

651
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,150

or my other idea is to do this

652
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160

 

653
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,590

what do i mean you'll see what i mean in

654
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
what do i mean you'll see what i mean in
 

655
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,509
what do i mean you'll see what i mean in
a second i'm gonna try this one out

656
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
a second i'm gonna try this one out
 

657
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,790
a second i'm gonna try this one out
first though and just see what it looks

658
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
first though and just see what it looks
 

659
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,190
first though and just see what it looks
like here

660
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
like here
 

661
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,590
like here
okay let's check this out i did all

662
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
okay let's check this out i did all
 

663
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,760
okay let's check this out i did all
three patterns we'll pick our favorites

664
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:15,770

 

665
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,829

[Music]

666
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839
[Music]
 

667
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,310
[Music]
oh

668
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
oh
 

669
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,870
oh
i think i'm gonna go with the middle one

670
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
i think i'm gonna go with the middle one
 

671
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,030
i think i'm gonna go with the middle one

unfortunately so need to figure out what
 

965
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,430
unfortunately so need to figure out what
to do about that too

966
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440
to do about that too
 

967
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,230

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,390
it goes down and
up um but there'll be probably be some

984
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:52,400
up um but there'll be probably be some
 

985
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,669
up um but there'll be probably be some
sort of a tunnel

986

1009
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,950
so let's do this decide to go for light
gray glass it's pretty close in color to

1010
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:20,960
gray glass it's pretty close in color to
 

1011
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,789
gray glass it's pretty close in color to
the quartz

1012
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
the quartz
 

1013
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,390
the quartz
and let's see what that looks like from

1014
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
and let's see what that looks like from
 

1015
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,510
and let's see what that looks like from
below

1016
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:27,520

 

1017
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,190

yeah i think that's fine we'll go with

1018
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,200
yeah i think that's fine we'll go with
 

1019
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,310
yeah i think that's fine we'll go with
that

1020
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320

 

1021
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,750

okay so let's figure out this tunnel

1022
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
okay so let's figure out this tunnel
 

1023
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,430
okay so let's figure out this tunnel
here a little bit uh if we go through

1024
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
here a little bit uh if we go through
 

1025
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,710
here a little bit uh if we go through
the door

1026
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
the door
 

1027
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,510
the door
uh i found out the very center of the

1028
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,520
uh i found out the very center of the
 

1029
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,430
uh i found out the very center of the
the storage room up ahead is actually

1030
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:41,440
the storage room up ahead is actually
 

1031
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,490
the storage room up ahead is actually
right down here

1032
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:42,500
right down here
 

1033
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,750
right down here
[Music]

1034
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:43,760
[Music]
 

1035
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,549
[Music]
portal's so loud so yeah we will uh

1036
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
portal's so loud so yeah we will uh
 

1037
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,950
portal's so loud so yeah we will uh
probably have some sort of a door frame

1038
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
probably have some sort of a door frame
 

1039
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,789
probably have some sort of a door frame
here as well

1040
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:52,799
here as well
 

1041
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,430
here as well
kind of even that out you come out here

1042
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
kind of even that out you come out here
 

1043
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,190
kind of even that out you come out here
and then on this side we have

1044
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
and then on this side we have
 

1045
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,350
and then on this side we have
all this wiring right and i think that

1046
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
all this wiring right and i think that
 

1047
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,909
all this wiring right and i think that
looks pretty cool

1048
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:01,919
looks pretty cool
 

1049
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,070
looks pretty cool
so we're going to leave that visible

1050
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
so we're going to leave that visible
 

1051
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,190
so we're going to leave that visible
we're going to clean up we're going to

1052
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,200
we're going to clean up we're going to
 

1053
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,230
we're going to clean up we're going to
get rid of the grass

1054
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
get rid of the grass
 

1055
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,430
get rid of the grass
and all that kind of stuff but we'll

1056
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
and all that kind of stuff but we'll
 

1057
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,669
and all that kind of stuff but we'll
leave the wire visible and that will

1058
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
leave the wire visible and that will
 

1059
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,390
leave the wire visible and that will
kind of make up

1060
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
kind of make up
 

1061
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,029
kind of make up
one of the walls on this other side

1062
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
one of the walls on this other side
 

1063
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,830
one of the walls on this other side
though

1064
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:14,840
though
 

1065
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,510
though
um i was thinking about adding a window

1066
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
um i was thinking about adding a window
 

1067
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,430
um i was thinking about adding a window
at first then it's like well

1068
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440
at first then it's like well
 

1069
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,190
at first then it's like well
you got this giant hill in the way even

1070
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,200
you got this giant hill in the way even
 

1071
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,430
you got this giant hill in the way even
if we bold those this hill

1072
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,440
if we bold those this hill
 

1073
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,110
if we bold those this hill
further out here there's just some trees

1074
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
further out here there's just some trees
 

1075
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,789
further out here there's just some trees
there's not really much of a view this

1076
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
there's not really much of a view this
 

1077
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,230
there's not really much of a view this
way

1078
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
way
 

1079
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,549
way
so we should make some solid wall on

1080
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:30,559
so we should make some solid wall on
 

1081
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,390
so we should make some solid wall on
this side as well

1082
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
this side as well
 

1083
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,750
this side as well
and since it's a nexus here i had an

1084
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
and since it's a nexus here i had an
 

1085
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,710
and since it's a nexus here i had an
idea

1086
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
idea
 

1087
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,110
idea
i've been wanting to use somewhere we'll

1088
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,120
i've been wanting to use somewhere we'll
 

1089
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,950
i've been wanting to use somewhere we'll
see if it looks any good or not

1090
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960
see if it looks any good or not
 

1091
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,950
see if it looks any good or not
i want to try to make a circuit board

1092
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
i want to try to make a circuit board
 

1093
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,149
i want to try to make a circuit board
wall

1094
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
wall
 

1095
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,669
wall
something that resembles a real life

1096
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
something that resembles a real life
 

1097
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,350
something that resembles a real life
circuit board

1098
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
circuit board
 

1099
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,950
circuit board
pcb so this is kind of the color we're

1100
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:50,960
pcb so this is kind of the color we're
 

1101
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,669
pcb so this is kind of the color we're
going to go for

1102
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
going to go for
 

1103
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,950
going to go for
dark green and then

1104
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
dark green and then
 

1105
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,950
dark green and then
actual circuits like the wiring is going

1106
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
actual circuits like the wiring is going
 

1107
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,230
actual circuits like the wiring is going
to be the lime

1108
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,240
to be the lime
 

1109
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,149
to be the lime
clay there and i want to try build like

1110
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159
clay there and i want to try build like
 

1111
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,149
clay there and i want to try build like
electronic components on the circuit

1112
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:04,159
electronic components on the circuit
 

1113
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,750
electronic components on the circuit
board and just see if it looks any good

1114
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
board and just see if it looks any good
 

1115
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,470
board and just see if it looks any good
or not

1116
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
or not
 

1117
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,909
or not
we'll have to make them pretty small

1118
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
we'll have to make them pretty small
 

1119
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,310
we'll have to make them pretty small
because it's minecraft i don't really

1120
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,320
because it's minecraft i don't really
 

1121
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,830
because it's minecraft i don't really
have a lot of uh

1122
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
have a lot of uh
 

1123
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,950
have a lot of uh
freedom here so let's say we want to

1124
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:16,960
freedom here so let's say we want to
 

1125
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,909
freedom here so let's say we want to
make a

1126
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919
make a
 

1127
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,870
make a
a processor a microprocessor or

1128
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880
a processor a microprocessor or
 

1129
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,390
a processor a microprocessor or
something

1130
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,400
something
 

1131
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,110
something
microprocessor microchip i mean what am

1132
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
microprocessor microchip i mean what am
 

1133
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,390
microprocessor microchip i mean what am
i saying so it could

1134
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
i saying so it could
 

1135
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,070
i saying so it could
look like oh not bone blocks i want to

1136
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
look like oh not bone blocks i want to
 

1137
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,029
look like oh not bone blocks i want to
use the

1138
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:31,039
use the
 

1139
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,310
use the
the quartz pillars yeah

1140
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
the quartz pillars yeah
 

1141
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,029
the quartz pillars yeah
yeah these so a microchip might look

1142
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
yeah these so a microchip might look
 

1143
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,070
yeah these so a microchip might look
something like

1144
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080
something like
 

1145
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,270
something like
this man that's huge

1146
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280

 

1147
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,029

i thought this was going to be small but

1148
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,039
i thought this was going to be small but
 

1149
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,590
i thought this was going to be small but
nope

1150
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:47,600

 

1151
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,110

um so as you walk

1152
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,120
um so as you walk
 

1153
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,510
um so as you walk
by you can't really see the details

1154
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,520
by you can't really see the details
 

1155
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,630
by you can't really see the details
though

1156
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
though
 

1157
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,230
though
it might not work so good on a wall

1158
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
it might not work so good on a wall
 

1159
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,710
it might not work so good on a wall
maybe it'd be better on a flat ground

1160
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
maybe it'd be better on a flat ground
 

1161
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:07,430
maybe it'd be better on a flat ground
like for a floor um

1162
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440

 

1163
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,990

see a capacitor could be

1164
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000

 

1165
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,070

something like this

1166
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,080

 

1167
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,390

nah it's too big and clunky isn't it

1168
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
nah it's too big and clunky isn't it
 

1169
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,110
nah it's too big and clunky isn't it
darn

1170
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
darn
 

1171
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,870
darn
i was gonna try like draw lines like

1172
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
i was gonna try like draw lines like
 

1173
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,710
i was gonna try like draw lines like
going from

1174
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:22,720
going from
 

1175
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,390
going from
