the mask because it looked really weird
 

135
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,120

if you look as the arms are swinging I

248
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
if you look as the arms are swinging I
 

249
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,120
if you look as the arms are swinging I
even have the mask going around all

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,939

it so there's that I'm I think it will

256
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:42,949
it so there's that I'm I think it will
 

257
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:45,429
it so there's that I'm I think it will
look really funny I can't see it from my

258
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:45,439
look really funny I can't see it from my
 

259
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,110
look really funny I can't see it from my
camera angle but I think if I have my

260
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
camera angle but I think if I have my
 

261
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,369
camera angle but I think if I have my
head back like this and I'm running

262
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:48,379
head back like this and I'm running
 

263
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,830
head back like this and I'm running
forward it's gonna look like I have a

264
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:50,840
forward it's gonna look like I have a
 

265
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,369
forward it's gonna look like I have a
very short body or my head's missing

266
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:54,379
very short body or my head's missing
 

267
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,559
very short body or my head's missing
because they'll see the head but they

268
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:56,569
because they'll see the head but they
 

269
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:58,480
because they'll see the head but they
won't see the other one that's tilted

270
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:58,490
won't see the other one that's tilted
 

271
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,869
won't see the other one that's tilted
back I can't say for sure what it looks

272
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:01,879
back I can't say for sure what it looks
 

273
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,209
back I can't say for sure what it looks
like I haven't seen it anyway so that's

274
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:04,219
like I haven't seen it anyway so that's
 

275
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:08,740
like I haven't seen it anyway so that's
the new skin pretty happy with it there

276
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:08,750
the new skin pretty happy with it there
 

277
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,570
the new skin pretty happy with it there
is of course many fancy versions of

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:12,580
is of course many fancy versions of
 

279
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,730
is of course many fancy versions of
Kakashi with shading and all that I

280
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:15,740
Kakashi with shading and all that I
 

281
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,409
Kakashi with shading and all that I
don't really like that I like this is

282
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:17,419
don't really like that I like this is
 

283
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:18,790
don't really like that I like this is
what I'm used to this is what I want to

284
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
what I'm used to this is what I want to
 

285
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,860
what I'm used to this is what I want to
keep even though it's a little plain I

286
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:20,870
keep even though it's a little plain I
 

287
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,480
keep even though it's a little plain I
like it it's Who I am because I've had

288
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,490
like it it's Who I am because I've had
 

289
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,790
like it it's Who I am because I've had
this skin for like three years so just a

290
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:27,800
this skin for like three years so just a
 

291
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,240
this skin for like three years so just a
few little tweaks to it nothing major uh

292
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,250
few little tweaks to it nothing major uh
 

293
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,409
few little tweaks to it nothing major uh
today guys we're up to fifteen with our

294
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:35,419
today guys we're up to fifteen with our
 

295
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,559
today guys we're up to fifteen with our
skull so I think we should go kill them

296
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:37,569
skull so I think we should go kill them
 

297
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:40,600
skull so I think we should go kill them
the problem is we've got to do it quick

298
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:40,610
the problem is we've got to do it quick
 

299
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,589
the problem is we've got to do it quick
otherwise it's going to take the whole

300
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
otherwise it's going to take the whole
 

301
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,240
otherwise it's going to take the whole
episode so we kind of have to fight all

302
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,250
episode so we kind of have to fight all
 

303
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,659
episode so we kind of have to fight all
five at a time and I can barely handle

304
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:46,669
five at a time and I can barely handle
 

305
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:49,749
five at a time and I can barely handle
one at a time so I think we either are

306
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
one at a time so I think we either are
 

307
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,540
one at a time so I think we either are
going to fight it in a cave or we're

308
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:52,550
going to fight it in a cave or we're
 

309
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,730
going to fight it in a cave or we're
going to fight them above ground and

310
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:54,740
going to fight them above ground and
 

311
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,360
going to fight them above ground and
I'll set up like healing stations and oh

312
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,370
I'll set up like healing stations and oh
 

313
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,499

610
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
that applies for like sometime or
 

611
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,150
that applies for like sometime or
permanently because I'm surprised that

612
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
permanently because I'm surprised that
 

613
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,650
permanently because I'm surprised that
they get destroyed we got all five

614
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:29,660
they get destroyed we got all five

00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:43,340
after the fight but even still I'm
 

625
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,540
after the fight but even still I'm
surprised they all survived there that

626
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:46,550
surprised they all survived there that
 

627
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,370

to go in my nether fortress so that I

634
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
to go in my nether fortress so that I
 

635
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,960
to go in my nether fortress so that I
can farm more withers quicker that's

636
