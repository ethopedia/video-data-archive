172
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
calling it ctm map
 

173
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,390
calling it ctm map
uh throughout this and we'll probably

174
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
uh throughout this and we'll probably
 

175
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,910
uh throughout this and we'll probably
i'll probably take you through the map

176
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
i'll probably take you through the map
 

177
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,149
i'll probably take you through the map
uh show you some cool things i like

178

the decision to not

188
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
the decision to not
 

189
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,910
the decision to not
or to discontinue that's going to say

190
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
or to discontinue that's going to say
 

191

not continue this discontinued
 

193
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,110
not continue this discontinued
the decision to discontinue this came

194
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
the decision to discontinue this came
 

195
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,630
the decision to discontinue this came
from

196
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
from
 

197
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,509
from
i got a new map plan a new style map i

198
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
i got a new map plan a new style map i
 

199
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,550
i got a new map plan a new style map i
want to make

200
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
want to make
 

201
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,070
want to make
as i was building this i kind of

202
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
as i was building this i kind of
 

203
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,750
as i was building this i kind of
realized my favorite parts

204
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
realized my favorite parts
 

205
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,190
realized my favorite parts
of map making is setting up situations

206
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
of map making is setting up situations
 

207
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,990
of map making is setting up situations
for the player you know setting up traps

208
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
for the player you know setting up traps
 

209
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,909
for the player you know setting up traps
and mechanisms and that type of thing

210
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
and mechanisms and that type of thing
 

211
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,469
and mechanisms and that type of thing
not really the whole

212
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
not really the whole
 

213
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,749
not really the whole
building or making terrain or that type

214
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
building or making terrain or that type
 

215
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,390
building or making terrain or that type
of thing

216
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400

 

217
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,629

that's not what i found fun i like the

218
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
that's not what i found fun i like the
 

219
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,390
that's not what i found fun i like the
the mechanisms

220
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
the mechanisms
 

221
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,790
the mechanisms
so the new map style i have will take

222
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
so the new map style i have will take
 

223
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,830
so the new map style i have will take
advantage of that

224
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
advantage of that
 

225
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,990
advantage of that
it'll mostly just be setting up

226
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
it'll mostly just be setting up
 

227
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,150
it'll mostly just be setting up
mechanisms and stuff

228
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
mechanisms and stuff
 

229
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,430
mechanisms and stuff
um and also while i was building this

230
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
um and also while i was building this
 

231
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,510
um and also while i was building this
a lot of patches came out a lot of

232
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
a lot of patches came out a lot of
 

233
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,270
a lot of patches came out a lot of
changes were made

234
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
changes were made
 

235
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,469
changes were made
interestingly yeah

236
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
interestingly yeah
 

237
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,070
interestingly yeah
one of the patches that came out made

238
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
one of the patches that came out made
 

239
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,670
one of the patches that came out made
these fall off and now

240
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
these fall off and now
 

241
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,350
these fall off and now
now it's back again where they can stay

242
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
now it's back again where they can stay
 

243
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,150
now it's back again where they can stay
on mob eggs came out

244
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
on mob eggs came out
 

245
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,030
on mob eggs came out
that's a huge thing kind of removes the

246
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
that's a huge thing kind of removes the
 

247
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,909
that's a huge thing kind of removes the
need for

248
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
need for
 

249
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,550
need for
spawners because you can control how

250
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
spawners because you can control how
 

251
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,270
spawners because you can control how
many mobs yet which is huge

252
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
many mobs yet which is huge
 

253
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,590
many mobs yet which is huge
with my setup in this map i was relying

254
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
with my setup in this map i was relying
 

255
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,270
with my setup in this map i was relying
on natural spawns and

256
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
on natural spawns and
 

257
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,390
on natural spawns and
and mobs from spawners mostly

258
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
and mobs from spawners mostly
 

259
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,189
and mobs from spawners mostly
and it made setting up mechanisms very

260
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
and it made setting up mechanisms very
 

261
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,150
and it made setting up mechanisms very
challenging

262
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
challenging
 

263
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,270
challenging
to do it with spawners compared to eggs

264
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
to do it with spawners compared to eggs
 

265
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,790
to do it with spawners compared to eggs
you know

266
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
you know
 

267
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,510
you know

once all the natural mob spotting rates
 

455
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,829
once all the natural mob spotting rates
were figured out and all

456
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
were figured out and all
 

457
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,829
were figured out and all
everything was figured out then i would

458
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
everything was figured out then i would
 

459
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,990
everything was figured out then i would
put items into

put items into
 

461
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,990

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,910
but how does it work well if you
break this wood block or you can break

there we go so

00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
there we go so
 

777
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,909
there we go so
then creepers start falling down but you

778
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
then creepers start falling down but you
 

779
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,069
then creepers start falling down but you
have to get in there to get your

780
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
have to get in there to get your
 

781
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,549
have to get in there to get your
to get wood you know to get saplings

782
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
to get wood you know to get saplings
 

783
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,150
to get wood you know to get saplings
longer you wait to go in the more

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
longer you wait to go in the more
 

785
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,949
longer you wait to go in the more
creepers

786
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
creepers
 

787
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,630
creepers
will fill up the room they fall in from

788
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
will fill up the room they fall in from
 

789
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,990
will fill up the room they fall in from

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,830

although that was changed slightly

792
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:30,840

 

793
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,029

00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
somehow
 

795
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,830

so that's kind of like uh what you have

796
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
so that's kind of like uh what you have
 

797
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,669
so that's kind of like uh what you have
to do to get the wood in this map

thought if someone was to destroy it it
would do the same effect

860
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
would do the same effect
 

861
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,750
would do the same effect
so we need a a way of determining if

862
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:21,760
so we need a a way of determining if
 

863
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,190
so we need a a way of determining if
an eye was placed in or if uh it was

864
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
an eye was placed in or if uh it was
 

865
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,549
an eye was placed in or if uh it was
actually destroyed

866
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
actually destroyed
 

867
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,909
actually destroyed
so it can it can sense both but later i

868
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919
so it can it can sense both but later i
 

869
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,870
so it can it can sense both but later i
realized that you can't actually destroy

870
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
realized that you can't actually destroy
 

871
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,190
realized that you can't actually destroy
ender portals i thought you could for

872
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
ender portals i thought you could for
 

873
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,270
ender portals i thought you could for
some reason so that is uh

874
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
some reason so that is uh
 

875
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,310
some reason so that is uh
pointless

876
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320

 

877
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,150

go through here at this point of making

878
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
go through here at this point of making
 

879
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,710
go through here at this point of making
the map i was just kind of a little bit

880
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
the map i was just kind of a little bit
 

881
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,950
the map i was just kind of a little bit
i wanted to get a lot done so i just

882
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:48,960
i wanted to get a lot done so i just
 

883
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,870
i wanted to get a lot done so i just
copied this room

884
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
copied this room
 

885
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,950
copied this room
over and over and over again and kind of

886
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:52,960
over and over and over again and kind of
 

887
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,750
over and over and over again and kind of
made like a maze out of it

888
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760

 

889
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,110

and you go through each area

890
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
and you go through each area
 

891
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,350
and you go through each area
doing that and these would be full of

892
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:03,360
doing that and these would be full of
 

893
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,549
doing that and these would be full of
mobs

894
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
mobs
 

895
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,470
mobs
and these rooms are not set up they're

896
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
and these rooms are not set up they're
 

897
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,470
and these rooms are not set up they're
supposed to be

898
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,480
supposed to be
 

899
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,909
supposed to be
mob spawners in each one this here

900
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
mob spawners in each one this here
 

901
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,270
mob spawners in each one this here
is an idea i had for

902
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
is an idea i had for
 

903
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,669
is an idea i had for
special stations that will heal you or

904
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:17,679
special stations that will heal you or
 

905
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,270
special stations that will heal you or
give you a speed increase or strength

906
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
give you a speed increase or strength
 

907
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,549
give you a speed increase or strength
if you walk into it you get a a speed

908
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
if you walk into it you get a a speed
 

909
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,230
if you walk into it you get a a speed
potion

910
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,240

 

911
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,750

because this area is pretty big i want

912
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
because this area is pretty big i want
 

913
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,110
because this area is pretty big i want
the player to be able to get through it

914
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,120
the player to be able to get through it
 

915
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,870
the player to be able to get through it
really quick

916
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
really quick
 

917
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,149
really quick
it's challenging making

918
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
it's challenging making
 

919
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,149
it's challenging making
something like this though because you

920
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:38,159
something like this though because you
 

921
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,390
something like this though because you
don't want the player to get the potions

922
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400

 

923
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,669

which is only possible if you do a three

924
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
which is only possible if you do a three
 

925
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,870
which is only possible if you do a three
by three thing of bedrock around

926
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
by three thing of bedrock around
 

927
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,110
by three thing of bedrock around
a dispenser because if you

928
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120

 

929
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,950

if you have bedrock like that for

930
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
if you have bedrock like that for
 

931
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,149
if you have bedrock like that for
example if

932
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:58,159
example if
 

933
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,549
example if
they set off a tnt here it can pass

934
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:00,559
they set off a tnt here it can pass
 

935
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,510
they set off a tnt here it can pass
through a block

936
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:01,520
through a block
 

937
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,950
through a block
diagonally and blow up the dispenser

938
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
diagonally and blow up the dispenser
 

939
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,149
diagonally and blow up the dispenser
and they could get potions that way so

940
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159

 

941
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,270

if you're if you got a lot of mob eggs

942
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,280
if you're if you got a lot of mob eggs
 

943
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,029
if you're if you got a lot of mob eggs
or a lot of potions somewhere you have

944
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,039
or a lot of potions somewhere you have
 

945
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,789
or a lot of potions somewhere you have
to make sure the player can't get it

946
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
to make sure the player can't get it
 

947
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,830
to make sure the player can't get it
which is a real challenge

948
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
which is a real challenge
 

949
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,430
which is a real challenge
oh i got something my throat i'll be

950
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,440
oh i got something my throat i'll be
 

951
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,149
oh i got something my throat i'll be
right back

952
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159

 

953
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,510

all right that's better i had a little

954
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
all right that's better i had a little
 

955
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,549
all right that's better i had a little
bit of a drink here let's continue

956
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
bit of a drink here let's continue
 

957
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,230
bit of a drink here let's continue
there's not a whole lot more left to

958
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,240
there's not a whole lot more left to
 

959
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,669
there's not a whole lot more left to
show but

960
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:31,679
show but
 

961
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,510
show but
but yeah this first area was going to be

962
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
but yeah this first area was going to be
 

963
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,789
but yeah this first area was going to be
kind of like a maze

964
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
kind of like a maze
 

965
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,149
kind of like a maze
although you could easily figure out

966
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:36,159
although you could easily figure out
 

967
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,230
although you could easily figure out
places you've been if the door is down

968
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
places you've been if the door is down
 

969
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,630
places you've been if the door is down
like this

970
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
like this
 

971
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,909
like this
and each of these rooms is going to be

972
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
and each of these rooms is going to be
 

973
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,270
and each of these rooms is going to be
customized a little bit

974
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
customized a little bit
 

975
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,950
customized a little bit
different spawners different amounts of

976
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:46,960
different spawners different amounts of
 

977
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,789
different spawners different amounts of
spawners and

978
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:48,799
spawners and
 

979
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,350
spawners and
you know some might have laven or water

980
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,360
you know some might have laven or water
 

981
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,070
you know some might have laven or water
but i never got to that point

982
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,080
but i never got to that point
 

983
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,270
but i never got to that point
these doors are actually really simple

984
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
these doors are actually really simple
 

985
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,630
these doors are actually really simple
i like them a lot though it's just

986
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,640

 

987
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,390

pressing the button updates the sand

988
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
pressing the button updates the sand
 

989
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,510
pressing the button updates the sand
which makes it fall

990
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,520

 

991
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,470

that's all there is to it i like it

992
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
that's all there is to it i like it
 

993
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,390
that's all there is to it i like it
so yeah the idea is they would run

994
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,400
so yeah the idea is they would run
 

995
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,549
so yeah the idea is they would run
through this pretty quick

996
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:16,559
through this pretty quick
 

997
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,430
through this pretty quick
and fight all the mobs i see on the way

998
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
and fight all the mobs i see on the way
 

999
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,350
and fight all the mobs i see on the way
and there might be some healing stations

1000
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,360
and there might be some healing stations
 

1001
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,149
and there might be some healing stations
throughout

1002
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
throughout
 

1003
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,190
throughout
just to help them moving quick help them

1004
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:25,200
just to help them moving quick help them
 

1005
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,310
just to help them moving quick help them
move quicker

1006
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,320
move quicker
 

1007
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,230
move quicker
some of the dead end rooms might have

1008
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,240
some of the dead end rooms might have
 

1009
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,990
some of the dead end rooms might have
chests in

1010
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,000
chests in
 

1011
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,350
chests in
but

1012
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360

 

1013
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,270

you can see you could get lost pretty

1014
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,280
you can see you could get lost pretty
 

1015
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,430
you can see you could get lost pretty
easily just because it's so

1016
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
easily just because it's so
 

1017
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,789
easily just because it's so
so massive and it kind of loops back too

1018
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
so massive and it kind of loops back too
 

1019
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,430
so massive and it kind of loops back too
so if you

1020
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,440
so if you
 

1021
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,190
so if you
go one way you might end up back at the

1022
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
go one way you might end up back at the
 

1023
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,070
go one way you might end up back at the
beginning

1024
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080

 

1025
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,750

this here is a little bit of a

1026
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760
this here is a little bit of a
 

1027
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,029
this here is a little bit of a
oh it's triggered

1028
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039

 

1029
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,870

uh-oh

1030
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880

 

1031
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,310

yeah triggered already uh when i did

1032
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,320
yeah triggered already uh when i did
 

1033
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,230
yeah triggered already uh when i did
the restore i didn't delete the folder

1034
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,240
the restore i didn't delete the folder
 

1035
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,750
the restore i didn't delete the folder
so i think some of this stuff

1036
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,760
so i think some of this stuff
 

1037
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,149
so i think some of this stuff
is messed up

1038
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:10,159

 

1039
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,110

let's see if there's more than one nope

1040
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120

 

1041
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,549

well this

1042
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559

 

1043
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,990

too bad uh there was a a gas station

1044
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,000
too bad uh there was a a gas station
 

1045
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,149
too bad uh there was a a gas station
here

1046
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:28,159

 

1047
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,710

and this door was up so when you got to

1048
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:30,720

and this door was up so when you got to
the door

1050
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
the door
 

1051
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,669
the door

you since it's a long
 

1053
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,430
you since it's a long
long hallway here you might have thought

1054
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,440
long hallway here you might have thought
 

1055
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,029
long hallway here you might have thought
this was the end

1056
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:39,039
this was the end
 

1057
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,230
this was the end
or the destination you were looking for

1058
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,240
or the destination you were looking for
 

1059
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,080
or the destination you were looking for
but uh when you open the door falls down

1060
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,090
but uh when you open the door falls down
 

1061
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,549
but uh when you open the door falls down
[Music]

1062
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:48,559
[Music]
 

1063
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,840
[Music]
you get that

1064
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:49,850
you get that
 

1065
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,470
you get that
[Applause]

1066
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,480
[Applause]
 

1067
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,590
[Applause]
supposed to scare the player

1068
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600

 

1069
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,470

but uh yeah not the best demonstration

1070
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,480
but uh yeah not the best demonstration
 

1071
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,830
but uh yeah not the best demonstration
there because it's already

1072
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:02,840

 

1073
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,070

activated

1074
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,080
activated
 

1075
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,590
activated
but anyway um i guess we'll just cheat

1076
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600
but anyway um i guess we'll just cheat
 

1077
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,149
but anyway um i guess we'll just cheat
here

1078
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159

 

1079
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,430

this is the maze again

1080
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,440
this is the maze again
 

1081
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,190
this is the maze again
this is the room we're looking for this

1082
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,200
this is the room we're looking for this
 

1083
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,470
this is the room we're looking for this
one here

1084
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:16,480
one here
 

1085
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,230
one here
i kind of graphed this out on paper

1086
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
i kind of graphed this out on paper
 

1087
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,750
i kind of graphed this out on paper
first and just

1088
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:19,760
first and just
 

1089
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,310
first and just
play connect the dots and that's how i

1090
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
play connect the dots and that's how i
 

1091
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,950
play connect the dots and that's how i
came up with the pattern

1092
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:28,960

 

1093
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,549

let's go to this one we'll switch it

1094
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559
let's go to this one we'll switch it
 

1095
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,510
let's go to this one we'll switch it
back to peaceful

1096
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:35,520

 

1097
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,549

oh and this is trigger two dang it

1098
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:38,559
oh and this is trigger two dang it
 

1099
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,390
oh and this is trigger two dang it
uh i should have just deleted the folder

1100
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
uh i should have just deleted the folder
 

1101
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,669
uh i should have just deleted the folder
basically

1102
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:45,679

 

1103
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,390

there's a sand door here too i actually

1104
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
there's a sand door here too i actually
 

1105
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,390
there's a sand door here too i actually
think it was at this level

1106
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
think it was at this level
 

1107
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,710
think it was at this level
and there was a lever in the middle when

1108
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,720
and there was a lever in the middle when
 

1109
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,230
and there was a lever in the middle when
you pulled the lever

1110
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
you pulled the lever
 

1111
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,390
you pulled the lever
it caused the sand to fall down this

1112
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:56,400
it caused the sand to fall down this
 

1113
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,190
it caused the sand to fall down this
hole

1114
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200

 

1115
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,470

to here

1116
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,480

 

1117
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,669

we'll just mimic it

1118
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679

 

1119
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,870

and if the sand in the corner falls

1120
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
and if the sand in the corner falls
 

1121
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:16,710
and if the sand in the corner falls
in the corner here does this

1122
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,720

 

1123
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,710

kind of cool way of making a staircase

1124
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
kind of cool way of making a staircase
 

1125
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,830
kind of cool way of making a staircase
for the player to get down

1126
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840

 

1127
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,590

and the sand would land like this so it

1128
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
and the sand would land like this so it
 

1129
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,149
and the sand would land like this so it
would have been flat

1130
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
would have been flat
 

1131
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,310
would have been flat
and then this was going to be the wall

1132
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
and then this was going to be the wall
 

1133
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,669
and then this was going to be the wall
room area

1134
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,679
room area
 

1135
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,149
room area
uh there's going to be by this point in

1136
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
uh there's going to be by this point in
 

1137
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:32,789
uh there's going to be by this point in
the game

1138
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:32,799
the game
 

1139
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,190
the game
uh ma biggs came out and i was going to

1140
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,200
uh ma biggs came out and i was going to
 

1141
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,630
uh ma biggs came out and i was going to
set up an ambush here

1142
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:36,640
set up an ambush here
 

1143
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,990
set up an ambush here
for the player and the wall room

1144
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,000
for the player and the wall room
 

1145
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,789
for the player and the wall room
pretty close to over there first wall

1146
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:42,799
pretty close to over there first wall
 

1147
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,950
pretty close to over there first wall
but that's about as far as i got so you

1148
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
but that's about as far as i got so you
 

1149
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,710
but that's about as far as i got so you
could imagine

1150
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:46,720
could imagine
 

1151
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,549
could imagine
i've spent oh probably at least 10 hours

1152
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:50,559
i've spent oh probably at least 10 hours
 

1153
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,590
i've spent oh probably at least 10 hours
on this map

1154
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
on this map
 

1155
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,990
on this map
and i didn't even get the first wall

1156
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,000
and i didn't even get the first wall
 

1157
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,510
and i didn't even get the first wall
down so that's like

1158
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:55,520
down so that's like
 

1159
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,110
down so that's like
not even 1 16 of the map done

1160
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,120
not even 1 16 of the map done
 

1161
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,470
not even 1 16 of the map done
no terrain was made so to actually

1162
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:02,480
no terrain was made so to actually
 

1163
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,909
no terrain was made so to actually
complete the map probably would have

1164
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:03,919
complete the map probably would have
 

1165
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,350
complete the map probably would have
taken me

1166
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:05,360
taken me
 

1167
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,630
taken me
well over 200 hours or so

1168
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
well over 200 hours or so
 

1169
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,990
well over 200 hours or so
and i just don't want to put that kind

1170
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000
and i just don't want to put that kind
 

1171
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,830
and i just don't want to put that kind
of time into it

1172
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:13,840

 

1173
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,549

and again like i said there's a

1174
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:16,559
and again like i said there's a
 

1175
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,710
and again like i said there's a
different map style i'd rather do that i

1176
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
different map style i'd rather do that i
 

1177
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,630
different map style i'd rather do that i
think i could actually finish and would

1178
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640
think i could actually finish and would
 

1179
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,149
think i could actually finish and would
be a lot more fun

1180
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:22,159
be a lot more fun
 

1181
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,350
be a lot more fun
for myself and the player

1182
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
for myself and the player
 

1183
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,510
for myself and the player
so that's what i'm going to do and

1184
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:29,520
so that's what i'm going to do and
 

1185
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,230
so that's what i'm going to do and
with the new map style i plan on

1186
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,240
with the new map style i plan on
 

1187
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,470
with the new map style i plan on
streaming it on twitch tv when i work on

1188
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:34,480
streaming it on twitch tv when i work on
 

1189
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,029
streaming it on twitch tv when i work on
it

1190
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:35,039
it
 

1191
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,029
it
instead of having it all secret because

1192
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
instead of having it all secret because
 

1193
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,630
instead of having it all secret because
once you know the traps in this it kind

1194
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
once you know the traps in this it kind
 

1195
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,990
once you know the traps in this it kind
of

1196
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,000
of
 

1197

i got one of these set up just to try it

1236
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:37,679
i got one of these set up just to try it
 

1237
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,909
i got one of these set up just to try it
make sure it works

1238
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:41,919

 

1239
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,350

that would trigger a light or a note

1240
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,360
that would trigger a light or a note

you you got the wool placed
 

1247
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,669
you you got the wool placed
um something you guys might find

1248
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679
um something you guys might find
 

1249
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,190
um something you guys might find
interesting i'm sure most people know

1250

this uh you can actually hack

1252
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:57,279
this uh you can actually hack
 

1253
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,950
this uh you can actually hack

a normal speed to splash potion
 

1257
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,549
a normal speed to splash potion
lasts for oh

1258
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
lasts for oh
 

1259
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,669
lasts for oh
you can also make them stack like that

1260
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:13,679

 

1261
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,990

it usually lasts for one minute and

1262
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
it usually lasts for one minute and
 

1263
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,430
it usually lasts for one minute and
seven seconds but you can

1264
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,440
seven seconds but you can
 

1265
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,750
seven seconds but you can
add an extended factor to it so it's

1266
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:19,760
add an extended factor to it so it's
 

1267
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,909
add an extended factor to it so it's
actually three minutes

1268
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:21,919
actually three minutes
 

1269
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,950
actually three minutes
which is kind of cool so you normally in

1270
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:24,960
which is kind of cool so you normally in
 

1271
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,070
which is kind of cool so you normally in
the game you can

1272
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,080
the game you can
 

1273
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,269
the game you can
you either only get extended or you know

1274
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:29,279
you either only get extended or you know
 

1275
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,789
you either only get extended or you know
tier two

1276
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:30,799
tier two
 

1277
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,269
tier two
but if you hack it you can get tier two

1278
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:33,279
but if you hack it you can get tier two
 

1279
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,230
but if you hack it you can get tier two
and extended

1280
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,240
and extended
 

1281
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,310
and extended
combined which is cool and this was just

1282
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,320
combined which is cool and this was just
 

1283
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,750
combined which is cool and this was just
a little

1284
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:39,760
a little
 

1285
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,950
a little
experiment i was doing

1286
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:44,960
experiment i was doing
 

1287
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,350
experiment i was doing
um whoa whoa whoa

1288
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:51,360

 

1289
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,190

get back up

glass i thought one of these had there
 

1293
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,870
glass i thought one of these had there
it is

1294
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:00,880
it is
 

1295
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,389
it is
uh you can put other entities in these

1296
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:04,399
uh you can put other entities in these
 

1297
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,750
uh you can put other entities in these
spawn eggs

1298
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
spawn eggs
 

1299
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,750
spawn eggs
and in one point in the game you could

1300
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:07,760
and in one point in the game you could
 

1301
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,110
and in one point in the game you could
uh

1302
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
uh
 

1303
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,909
uh
like shoot tnt off that instantly

1304
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:11,919
like shoot tnt off that instantly
 

1305
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,430
like shoot tnt off that instantly
explodes for example

1306
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,440
explodes for example
 

1307
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,389
explodes for example
but that was later taken out and now

1308
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:16,399
but that was later taken out and now
 

1309
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,350
but that was later taken out and now
just shoots nothing

1310
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360

 

1311
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,269

or you could spawn boats that way or

1312
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:21,279
or you could spawn boats that way or
 

1313
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,430
or you could spawn boats that way or
mine carts from eggs

1314

might take some of the rooms and use it

1324
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:36,960
might take some of the rooms and use it
 

1325
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,510
might take some of the rooms and use it
in future projects

1326
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
in future projects
 

1327
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,029
in future projects
but i would rather just start fresh

1328
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:43,039
but i would rather just start fresh
 

1329
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,710
but i would rather just start fresh
something new that i want to work on

something new that i want to work on
 

1331
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,430
something new that i want to work on
so that's what we're gonna do

checking out the map um

1338
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
checking out the map um
 

1339
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,549

to me it's not really sad saying goodbye

1340
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:00,559
to me it's not really sad saying goodbye

the type of person that clings to things
i'm a little worried though that some

1348
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
i'm a little worried though that some
 

1349
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,789
i'm a little worried though that some
people might

1350
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:08,799
people might
 

1351
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,669
people might
be disappointed as they were looking

1352
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:11,679
be disappointed as they were looking
 

1353
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,310
be disappointed as they were looking
forward to

1354
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,320
forward to
 

1355
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,590
forward to
playing it i know but

1356
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
playing it i know but
 

1357
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,830
playing it i know but
i just think my efforts would be better

1358
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:17,840
i just think my efforts would be better
 

1359
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,669
i just think my efforts would be better
spent making

1360
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:19,679
spent making
 

1361
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,350
spent making
a simpler map that's more fun

1362
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,360
a simpler map that's more fun
 

1363
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,190
a simpler map that's more fun
as i guess the way i would say it the

1364
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
as i guess the way i would say it the
 

1365
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,350
as i guess the way i would say it the
the new map idea i have is to kind of

1366
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,360
the new map idea i have is to kind of
 

1367
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,950
the new map idea i have is to kind of
make like a dungeon

1368
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:28,960
make like a dungeon
 

1369
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,310
make like a dungeon
style game where you have uh

1370
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,320
style game where you have uh
 

1371
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,190
style game where you have uh
mobs spawning specific specific number

1372
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,200
mobs spawning specific specific number
 

1373
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,789
mobs spawning specific specific number
of mobs spawning from

1374
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:36,799
of mobs spawning from
 

1375
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,830
of mobs spawning from
mob eggs and

1376
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:39,840
mob eggs and
 

1377
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,669
mob eggs and
as you go through the dungeon you get

1378
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
as you go through the dungeon you get
 

1379
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,389
as you go through the dungeon you get
different loot and

1380
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:44,399
different loot and
 

1381
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,710
different loot and
gets more challenging as you progress

1382
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:46,720
gets more challenging as you progress
 

1383
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,149
gets more challenging as you progress
further

1384
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:48,159
further
 

1385
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,510
further
type thing and there'd be traps hidden

1386
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,520
type thing and there'd be traps hidden
 

1387
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,070
type thing and there'd be traps hidden
and that's the type of map i would

1388
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,080
and that's the type of map i would
 

1389
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,789
and that's the type of map i would
rather make

1390
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:54,799
rather make
 

1391
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,909
rather make
instead of you know focusing on

1392
00:30:57,909 --> 00:30:57,919
instead of you know focusing on
 

1393
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,149
instead of you know focusing on
making something that's fun to explore

1394
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
making something that's fun to explore
 

1395
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,190
making something that's fun to explore
and

1396
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,200
and
 

1397
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,750
and
the way i had that that ctm map setup

1398
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:03,760
the way i had that that ctm map setup
 

1399
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,110
the way i had that that ctm map setup
wasn't very good it was

1400
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,120
wasn't very good it was
 

1401
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,590
wasn't very good it was
there's too many traps i i was having

1402
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:07,600
there's too many traps i i was having
 

1403
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,789
there's too many traps i i was having
too much fun

1404
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:08,799
too much fun
 

1405
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,350
too much fun
adding them and it would would have been

1406
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,360
adding them and it would would have been
 

1407
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,909
adding them and it would would have been
overwhelming to the player i think

1408
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:13,919
overwhelming to the player i think
 

1409
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,870
overwhelming to the player i think
to have all that going on constantly and

1410
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:16,880
to have all that going on constantly and
 

1411
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,590
to have all that going on constantly and
that's also

1412
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:17,600
that's also
 

1413
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,710
that's also
what was making it take so long to build

1414
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:22,720
what was making it take so long to build
 

1415
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,350
what was making it take so long to build
but uh next made a really good point in

1416
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:25,360
but uh next made a really good point in
 

1417
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,750
but uh next made a really good point in
one of his videos that it's a lot easier

1418
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:27,760
one of his videos that it's a lot easier
 

1419
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,430
one of his videos that it's a lot easier
to

1420
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,440
to
 

1421
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,590
to
work with negative space than it is with

1422
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:31,600
work with negative space than it is with
 

1423
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,110
work with negative space than it is with
positive space so

1424
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,120
positive space so
 

1425
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,549
positive space so
to start with a big lump of land and

1426
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:36,559
to start with a big lump of land and
 

1427
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,230
to start with a big lump of land and
then take away

1428
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:38,240
then take away
 

1429
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,230
then take away
from it to make your map instead of

1430
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,240
from it to make your map instead of
 

1431
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,870
from it to make your map instead of
starting from nothing and building

1432
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:42,880
starting from nothing and building
 

1433
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,430
starting from nothing and building
from scratch your map it's a lot easier

1434
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,440
from scratch your map it's a lot easier
 

1435
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,230
from scratch your map it's a lot easier
to work

1436
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,240
to work
 

1437
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,950
to work
with negative space and i made the

1438
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
with negative space and i made the
 

1439
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,750
with negative space and i made the
mistake of going with positive

1440
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:51,760
mistake of going with positive
 

1441
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,630
mistake of going with positive
space because pretty much everything you

1442
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:54,640
space because pretty much everything you
 

1443
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,830
space because pretty much everything you
saw there was

1444
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:55,840
saw there was
 

1445
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,190
saw there was
place block by block which is no way

1446
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,200
place block by block which is no way
 

1447
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,549
place block by block which is no way
to make a map a big map

1448
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:04,559

 

1449
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,789

but anyway i rambled enough for today i

1450
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:06,799
but anyway i rambled enough for today i
 

1451
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,549
but anyway i rambled enough for today i
