00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,710
where there's no pistons
but anyway let's go for a ride on our rv

178
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
but anyway let's go for a ride on our rv
 

179
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,909
but anyway let's go for a ride on our rv
conveyor here

180
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919

 

181
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,790

so it should be pretty quick as soon as

182
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
so it should be pretty quick as soon as
 

183
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,629
so it should be pretty quick as soon as
the blades fall down they'll get

184
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
the blades fall down they'll get
 

185
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,070
the blades fall down they'll get
pushed over here pretty quick and then

186
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
pushed over here pretty quick and then
 

187
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,710
pushed over here pretty quick and then
i'm going to have lava here

188
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
i'm going to have lava here
 

189
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,309
i'm going to have lava here
that will carry them up and the plan is

190
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
that will carry them up and the plan is
 

191
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,830
that will carry them up and the plan is
like originally this was going to be the

192
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
like originally this was going to be the
 

193
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,909
like originally this was going to be the
main floor down here

194
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
main floor down here
 

195
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,909
main floor down here
but now well that just messed with my

196
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
but now well that just messed with my
 

197
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,590
but now well that just messed with my
mind

198
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
mind
 

199
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,670
mind
but now i'm thinking i'll have the main

200
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
but now i'm thinking i'll have the main
 

201
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,950
but now i'm thinking i'll have the main
floor up here

202
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
floor up here
 

203
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,309
floor up here
at this height here so

204
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
at this height here so
 

205
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,230
at this height here so
we'll have it'll look pretty cool we'll

206
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
we'll have it'll look pretty cool we'll
 

207
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,189
we'll have it'll look pretty cool we'll
have the blaze spawners on both sides

208
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
have the blaze spawners on both sides
 

209
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,909
have the blaze spawners on both sides
and uh then over here right in front of

210
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
and uh then over here right in front of
 

211
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:38,629
and uh then over here right in front of
us still

212
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
us still
 

213
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,029
us still
is where the blazer gonna collect the

214
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
is where the blazer gonna collect the
 

215
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,710
is where the blazer gonna collect the
lava will bring them up

216
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
lava will bring them up
 

217
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,749
lava will bring them up
to a few blocks in front of us here and

218
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
to a few blocks in front of us here and
 

219
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,270
to a few blocks in front of us here and
it will all be centered

220
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
it will all be centered
 

221
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,309
it will all be centered
and should be pretty good and then we'll

222
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
and should be pretty good and then we'll
 

223
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,070
and should be pretty good and then we'll
have our controls and stuff up here too

224
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
have our controls and stuff up here too
 

225
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,990
have our controls and stuff up here too
so yep i haven't tried this out yet but

226
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
so yep i haven't tried this out yet but
 

227
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,070
so yep i haven't tried this out yet but
i think it's gonna work out really nice

228
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
i think it's gonna work out really nice
 

229
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,510
i think it's gonna work out really nice
so there's a problem with this thing

230
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
so there's a problem with this thing
 

231
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,029
so there's a problem with this thing
right now that you might have noticed

232
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
right now that you might have noticed
 

233
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:05,990
right now that you might have noticed
when i wrote it

234
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
when i wrote it
 

235
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,390
when i wrote it
but when you get to the end

236
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400

 

237
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,550

i take that little bit of damage uh

238
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
i take that little bit of damage uh
 

239
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,510
i take that little bit of damage uh
that's going to be a big

240
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
that's going to be a big
 

241
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,629
that's going to be a big
problem if i don't fix it so i think

242
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
problem if i don't fix it so i think
 

243
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,710
problem if i don't fix it so i think
what's happening is a piston is pushing

244
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
what's happening is a piston is pushing
 

245
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,189
what's happening is a piston is pushing
me

246
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
me
 

247
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,230
me
slightly more than one block and

248
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
slightly more than one block and
 

249
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,670
slightly more than one block and
like i think pistons always push you

250
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
like i think pistons always push you
 

251
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,990
like i think pistons always push you
slightly more than one block even though

252
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
slightly more than one block even though
 

253
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,469
slightly more than one block even though
they only extend one block so i'm

254
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
they only extend one block so i'm
 

255
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,110
they only extend one block so i'm
slightly

256
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
slightly
 

257
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,230
slightly
clipped into one of these blocks

258
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
clipped into one of these blocks
 

259
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,110
clipped into one of these blocks
and when this one pushes me back i'm

260
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
and when this one pushes me back i'm
 

261
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,950
and when this one pushes me back i'm
inside of them for a little bit before

262
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
inside of them for a little bit before
 

263
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,150
inside of them for a little bit before
the game

264
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
the game
 

265
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,710
the game
auto adjusts my position into the air

266
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
auto adjusts my position into the air
 

267
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,270
auto adjusts my position into the air
space here

268
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
space here
 

269
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,550
space here
so that's going to happen to the blaze

270
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
so that's going to happen to the blaze
 

271
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,390
so that's going to happen to the blaze
too we need to prevent that from

272
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
too we need to prevent that from
 

273
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,029
too we need to prevent that from
happening

274
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
happening
 

275
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,950
happening
so my idea

276
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
so my idea
 

277
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,830
so my idea
here

278
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840

 

279
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,830

when instead of having just one of these

280
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
when instead of having just one of these
 

281
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,749
when instead of having just one of these
extend like this one here

282
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
extend like this one here
 

283
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,189
extend like this one here
i'm going to try to make it so this

284
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
i'm going to try to make it so this
 

285
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,309
i'm going to try to make it so this
pressure plate

286
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:06,319

 

287
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,629

this pressure plate and this one are

288
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
this pressure plate and this one are
 

289
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,430
this pressure plate and this one are
connected

290
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
connected
 

291
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,790
connected
so that if either of them are pressed

292
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
so that if either of them are pressed
 

293
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,950
so that if either of them are pressed
both of these extend and that way

294
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
both of these extend and that way
 

295
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,390
both of these extend and that way
if they're both extended it will have a

296
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
if they're both extended it will have a
 

297
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,869
if they're both extended it will have a
block

298
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
block
 

299
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,309
block
for the blades to align against so

300
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
for the blades to align against so
 

301
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,790
for the blades to align against so
to do that we're going to get rid of the

302
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
to do that we're going to get rid of the
 

303
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,909
to do that we're going to get rid of the
repeaters we don't

304
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
repeaters we don't
 

305
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,389
repeaters we don't
want to use repeaters i guess and

306
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
want to use repeaters i guess and
 

307
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,550
want to use repeaters i guess and
see if we can wire this up on camera

308
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
see if we can wire this up on camera
 

309
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,630
see if we can wire this up on camera
without me freaking out

310
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
without me freaking out
 

311
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,949
without me freaking out
okay so go underneath and

312
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959

 

313
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,110

have a block there block there

314
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
have a block there block there
 

315
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,870
have a block there block there
oh good i've heard start on me too

316
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
oh good i've heard start on me too
 

317
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,630
oh good i've heard start on me too
so now we need to join the two pressure

318
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
so now we need to join the two pressure
 

319
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,990
so now we need to join the two pressure
plates together

320
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
plates together
 

321
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,910
plates together
and we also have to be careful not to

322
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
and we also have to be careful not to
 

323
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,470
and we also have to be careful not to
have this one interfere in the middle

324
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
have this one interfere in the middle
 

325
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,230
have this one interfere in the middle
so an easy way of doing that is just to

326
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
so an easy way of doing that is just to
 

327
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,110
so an easy way of doing that is just to
go down one block so it's out of range

328
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
go down one block so it's out of range
 

329
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,310
go down one block so it's out of range
of the pressure plate above

330
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
of the pressure plate above
 

331
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,710
of the pressure plate above
so now they're joined together and we

332
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
so now they're joined together and we
 

333
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,470
so now they're joined together and we
just need to hook the wire to both

334
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
just need to hook the wire to both
 

335
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,389
just need to hook the wire to both
pistons

336
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
pistons
 

337
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,829
pistons
and i think i'll try to use redstone

338
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839
and i think i'll try to use redstone
 

339
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,190
and i think i'll try to use redstone
torches

340
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
torches
 

341
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,470
torches
if we can so

342
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
if we can so
 

343
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,269
if we can so
i would put one there and i have

344
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
i would put one there and i have
 

345
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,550
i would put one there and i have
redstone torches awesome

346
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560

 

347
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,110

go up and then where's that piston

348
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120

 

349
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,470

so much stuff in my way okay so we got

350
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
so much stuff in my way okay so we got
 

351
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,949
so much stuff in my way okay so we got
to get it up to here

352
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
to get it up to here
 

353
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,790
to get it up to here
um

354
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800

 

355
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,150

that's probably gonna be tough to do

356
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
that's probably gonna be tough to do
 

357
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,750
that's probably gonna be tough to do
maybe we'll go like this

358
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
maybe we'll go like this
 

359
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,790
maybe we'll go like this
it has to be have to use two here to

360
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
it has to be have to use two here to
 

361
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,829
it has to be have to use two here to
make it inverted

362
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
make it inverted
 

363
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,509
make it inverted
and we'll make that sandstone

364
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
and we'll make that sandstone
 

365
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,710
and we'll make that sandstone
there that's

366
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
there that's
 

367
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,590
there that's
yeah it works good so we can probably

368
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
yeah it works good so we can probably
 

369
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,269
yeah it works good so we can probably
fill that in

370
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
fill that in
 

371
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,710
fill that in
and then we'll do the same for the other

372
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
and then we'll do the same for the other
 

373
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,269
and then we'll do the same for the other
side here

374
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279

 

375
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,550

redstone torch block

376
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
redstone torch block
 

377
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,389
redstone torch block
torch

378
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399

 

379
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,150

and sandstone okay so now they should be

380
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
and sandstone okay so now they should be
 

381
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,509
and sandstone okay so now they should be
both connected together

382
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519

 

383
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,790

and the middle one doesn't seem to

384
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
and the middle one doesn't seem to
 

385
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,990
and the middle one doesn't seem to
affect them that's good

386
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000

 

387
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,590

yeah okay

388
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600

 

389
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,030

so let's get this back together and

390
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
so let's get this back together and
 

391
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,870
so let's get this back together and
we'll try it out

392
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
we'll try it out
 

393
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,870
we'll try it out
and i'll probably put half slabs down

394
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
and i'll probably put half slabs down
 

395
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,150
and i'll probably put half slabs down
there and stuff so there's no empty

396
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
there and stuff so there's no empty
 

397
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,630
there and stuff so there's no empty
space

398
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
space
 

399
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,509
space
for a zombie pigment to spawn

400
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519

 

401
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,069

okay let's ride it i think that will

402
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
okay let's ride it i think that will
 

403
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,509
okay let's ride it i think that will
work

404
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
work
 

405
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,949
work
if i can get out of here

406
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959

 

407
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,829

yeah i think this is probably the best

408
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
yeah i think this is probably the best
 

409
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,509
yeah i think this is probably the best
way of doing it

410
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
way of doing it
 

411
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,829
way of doing it
the furnace minecarts would be cool if

412
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
the furnace minecarts would be cool if
 

413
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,509
the furnace minecarts would be cool if
you had to move them a long distance but

414
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
you had to move them a long distance but
 

415
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,790
you had to move them a long distance but
this is still

416
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
this is still
 

417
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,990
this is still
not that far so pistons are

418
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
not that far so pistons are
 

419
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,350
not that far so pistons are
pretty good choice they're just

420
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
pretty good choice they're just
 

421
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,269
pretty good choice they're just
expensive there's lots of pistons in

422
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
expensive there's lots of pistons in
 

423
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,430
expensive there's lots of pistons in
this probably

424
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440

 

425
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,110

and all the blaze farms and the conveyor

426
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
and all the blaze farms and the conveyor
 

427
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,550
and all the blaze farms and the conveyor
belt it's at least

428
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
belt it's at least
 

429
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,350
belt it's at least
probably a hundred i would well yeah

430
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
probably a hundred i would well yeah
 

431
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,990
probably a hundred i would well yeah
probably around 100 or so

432
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000

 

433
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,949

there we go no damage that's good that's

434
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
there we go no damage that's good that's
 

435
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,430
there we go no damage that's good that's
what we wanted

436
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
what we wanted
 

437
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,750
what we wanted
and then okay well i'll fill in the

438
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
and then okay well i'll fill in the
 

439
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,829
and then okay well i'll fill in the
empty space i got left down here

440
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
empty space i got left down here
 

441
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,949
empty space i got left down here
and then i'll be back

442
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959

 

443
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,710

okay don't worry i did change this so

444
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
okay don't worry i did change this so
 

445
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,310
okay don't worry i did change this so
that uh

446
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
that uh
 

447
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,990
that uh
the torch goes straight up to another

448
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
the torch goes straight up to another
 

449
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,509
the torch goes straight up to another
torch here and then to the piston

450
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
torch here and then to the piston
 

451
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,949
torch here and then to the piston
instead of

452
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
instead of
 

453
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,550
instead of
that roundabout way with the wire and

454
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
that roundabout way with the wire and
 

455
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,910
that roundabout way with the wire and
everything i don't know why i did it

456
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
everything i don't know why i did it
 

457
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,990
everything i don't know why i did it
like that before

458
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
like that before
 

459
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,190
like that before
i think i may have been worried the

460
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
i think i may have been worried the
 

461
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,790
i think i may have been worried the
torch would be visible but that doesn't

462
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
torch would be visible but that doesn't
 

463
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,269
torch would be visible but that doesn't
really matter

464
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
really matter
 

465
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,190
really matter
since we have repeaters and stuff in

466
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
since we have repeaters and stuff in
 

467
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,110
since we have repeaters and stuff in
there too

468
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
there too
 

469
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,430
there too
i got a half slab there just so zombie

470
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
i got a half slab there just so zombie
 

471
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,829
i got a half slab there just so zombie
pigmen can't spawn in my wiring

472
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
pigmen can't spawn in my wiring
 

473
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,829
pigmen can't spawn in my wiring
not that that makes much difference

474
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839

 

475
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,310

and fill this in put that there

476
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
and fill this in put that there
 

477
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,150
and fill this in put that there
put one here okay so now we need to do

478
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
put one here okay so now we need to do
 

479
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,430
put one here okay so now we need to do
our lava

480
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
our lava
 

481
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,790
our lava
mava favorite lava mob evader

482
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
mava favorite lava mob evader
 

483
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,150
mava favorite lava mob evader
too many v's and that's gonna go right

484
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
too many v's and that's gonna go right
 

485
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,310
too many v's and that's gonna go right
here i think we can do it without using

486
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
here i think we can do it without using
 

487
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,990
here i think we can do it without using
any signs even

488
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
any signs even
 

489
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,190
any signs even
uh if we

490
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200

 

491
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,110

actually no we don't even need to do

492
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
actually no we don't even need to do
 

493
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,269
actually no we don't even need to do
that

494
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
that
 

495
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,910
that
oh i want that back sandstone it's

496
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
oh i want that back sandstone it's
 

497
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,470
oh i want that back sandstone it's
pretty rare for me at the moment

498
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
pretty rare for me at the moment
 

499
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,590
pretty rare for me at the moment
okay we'll have the wall here the

500
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
okay we'll have the wall here the
 

501
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,710
okay we'll have the wall here the
pressure plate will hold

502
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
pressure plate will hold
 

503
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,310
pressure plate will hold
the lava in place so i don't need

504
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
the lava in place so i don't need
 

505
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,949
the lava in place so i don't need
anything i just need

506
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:04,959
anything i just need
 

507
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,870
anything i just need
to drop a bucket of lava down here it

508
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
to drop a bucket of lava down here it
 

509
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,790
to drop a bucket of lava down here it
doesn't need to be full

510
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
doesn't need to be full
 

511
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,389
doesn't need to be full
source blocks because as we found out

512
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
source blocks because as we found out
 

513
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:12,870
source blocks because as we found out
before

514
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
before
 

515
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,430
before
lava doesn't push mobs at all so

516
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
lava doesn't push mobs at all so
 

517
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,269
lava doesn't push mobs at all so
downward flow doesn't matter they still

518
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
downward flow doesn't matter they still
 

519
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,150
downward flow doesn't matter they still
treat it like a lava source block

520
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
treat it like a lava source block
 

521
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,389
treat it like a lava source block
and this will go up as high as we want

522
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
and this will go up as high as we want
 

523
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,470
and this will go up as high as we want
it to go

524
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
it to go
 

525
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,069
it to go
and i think we can test this out pretty

526
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
and i think we can test this out pretty
 

527
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,910
and i think we can test this out pretty
soon

528
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
soon
 

529
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,870
soon
i'm excited to see how quick it works

530
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
i'm excited to see how quick it works
 

531
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,990
i'm excited to see how quick it works
yeah maybe we'll go a little bit

532
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
yeah maybe we'll go a little bit
 

533
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,990
yeah maybe we'll go a little bit
higher

534
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,000

 

535
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,430

okay we'll go up to there for now and

536
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
okay we'll go up to there for now and
 

537
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,509
okay we'll go up to there for now and
just see how this works out uh i will

538
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
just see how this works out uh i will
 

539
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,470
just see how this works out uh i will
put

540
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
put
 

541
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,509
put
um let's put the lava one block lower

542
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
um let's put the lava one block lower
 

543
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,550
um let's put the lava one block lower
over here it'll flow down and we'll put

544
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
over here it'll flow down and we'll put
 

545
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,670
over here it'll flow down and we'll put
a cap on top just for now

546
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
a cap on top just for now
 

547
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,790
a cap on top just for now
okay so i'm gonna

548
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
okay so i'm gonna
 

549
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,110
okay so i'm gonna
i'm gonna enable one side of this and

550
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
i'm gonna enable one side of this and
 

551
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,069
i'm gonna enable one side of this and
we'll see how it turns out

552
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079

 

553
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,629

okay first test here let's shut this off

554
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
okay first test here let's shut this off
 

555
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,990
okay first test here let's shut this off
blaze will be able to spawn and what

556
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
blaze will be able to spawn and what
 

557
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,430
blaze will be able to spawn and what
should happen is they should make it all

558
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
should happen is they should make it all
 

559
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,470
should happen is they should make it all
the way up to the top here on their own

560
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,480
the way up to the top here on their own
 

561
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,189
the way up to the top here on their own
relatively quickly

562
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199

 

563
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,430

while we're standing here

564
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440

 

565
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,110

okay there he goes

566
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120

 

567
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,310

that looks awesome

568
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320

 

569
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,750

yeah he's making his way up and i don't

570
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
yeah he's making his way up and i don't
 

571
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,110
yeah he's making his way up and i don't
think he's agro

572
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
think he's agro
 

573
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,710
think he's agro
so that's good too

574
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720

 

575
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,310

it does take him a while to get up that

576
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
it does take him a while to get up that
 

577
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,030
it does take him a while to get up that
motivator though

578
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040

 

579
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,629

yeah he's not a girl awesome

580
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639

 

581
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,870

so one thing i'm concerned about is how

582
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,880
so one thing i'm concerned about is how
 

583
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,790
so one thing i'm concerned about is how
it's gonna

584
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
it's gonna
 

585
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,509
it's gonna
react if there's multiple blades going

586
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
react if there's multiple blades going
 

587
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,430
react if there's multiple blades going
through it at the same time

588
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,440
through it at the same time
 

589
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,350
through it at the same time
so maybe we'll get the other one going

590
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
so maybe we'll get the other one going
 

591
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,870
so maybe we'll get the other one going
here too

592
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
here too
 

593
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,150
here too
let's get just to get the numbers up

594
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
let's get just to get the numbers up
 

595
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,990
let's get just to get the numbers up
to maximum spawning rates up to maximum

596
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
to maximum spawning rates up to maximum
 

597
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,110
to maximum spawning rates up to maximum
and i think if they are to interfere

598
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
and i think if they are to interfere
 

599
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,189
and i think if they are to interfere
uh the blaze will just get stuck in a

600
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
uh the blaze will just get stuck in a
 

601
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,949
uh the blaze will just get stuck in a
block and suffocate and then it'll fix

602
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
block and suffocate and then it'll fix
 

603
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:25,269
block and suffocate and then it'll fix
itself but we might lose a few from that

604
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279

 

605
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,370

it's looking good oh

606
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:27,380
it's looking good oh
 

607
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,710

you got a suffocator

610
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440

 

611
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,949

okay it's still working though that's

612
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
okay it's still working though that's
 

613
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,949
okay it's still working though that's
good

614
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
good
 

615
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,550
good
oh you know what they can see me through

616
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,560
oh you know what they can see me through
 

617
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,550
oh you know what they can see me through
these pistons too so i'll have to cover

618
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
these pistons too so i'll have to cover
 

619
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,550
these pistons too so i'll have to cover
them up

620
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560

 

621
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,069

or i don't think they see me through the

622
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
or i don't think they see me through the
 

623
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,829
or i don't think they see me through the
pistons i think they see me when they

624
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:52,839
pistons i think they see me when they
 

625
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,230
pistons i think they see me when they
extend

626
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
extend
 

627
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:07,990
extend
if i'm down here another suffocator

628
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
if i'm down here another suffocator
 

629
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,030
if i'm down here another suffocator
oh man another suffocator so i might

630
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
oh man another suffocator so i might
 

631
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,870
oh man another suffocator so i might
have to play around with delays too

632
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
have to play around with delays too
 

633
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,020
have to play around with delays too
if this happens a lot

634
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,030
if this happens a lot

i wasn't expecting this many

638
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800

 

639
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,550

but overall it seems to be working

where they join together there that's
 

647
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,949
where they join together there that's
what i was most concerned about

649
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,710

oh they're mad at me up there too i must
have holes somewhere or else they're

658
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
have holes somewhere or else they're
 

659
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,990
have holes somewhere or else they're
seeing me through these pistons i don't

seeing me through these pistons i don't

okay well i think i'm gonna leave this

668
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
okay well i think i'm gonna leave this
 

669
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,230
okay well i think i'm gonna leave this
area and uh

670
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
area and uh
 

671
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,029
area and uh
make a few adjustments here i'll think

672
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
make a few adjustments here i'll think
 

673
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:11,909
make a few adjustments here i'll think
about that first

674
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:11,919
about that first
 

675
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,829
about that first
fall i'm gonna set a delay for sure

676
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:13,839
fall i'm gonna set a delay for sure
 

677
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,069
fall i'm gonna set a delay for sure
because that's where they seem to

678

because that's where they seem to
 

679
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,390
because that's where they seem to
get stuck a lot and

680
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
get stuck a lot and
 

681
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,710
get stuck a lot and
look for any holes in this thing because

682
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
look for any holes in this thing because
 

683
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,429
look for any holes in this thing because
they're seeing me somehow

684
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439

 

685
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,990

okay i got this disabled again all the

686
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
okay i got this disabled again all the
 

687
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,230
okay i got this disabled again all the
blades are gone

688
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
blades are gone
 

689
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,630
blades are gone
there was a hole up there in the glass i

690
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
there was a hole up there in the glass i
 

691
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,150
there was a hole up there in the glass i
got it patched that's how they

692
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,160
got it patched that's how they
 

693
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,230
got it patched that's how they
saw me before and i have added glass

694
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
saw me before and i have added glass
 

695
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,230
saw me before and i have added glass
all along the blocks that move with the

696
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
all along the blocks that move with the
 

697
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,150
all along the blocks that move with the
pistons so

698
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160
pistons so
 

699
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,430
pistons so
they shouldn't be able to see me if i'm

700
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
they shouldn't be able to see me if i'm
 

701
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,070
they shouldn't be able to see me if i'm
down here either anymore

702
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
down here either anymore
 

703
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,070
down here either anymore
now i'm pretty sure i found the cause of

704
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
now i'm pretty sure i found the cause of
 

705
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,510
now i'm pretty sure i found the cause of
them suffocating over here

706
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
them suffocating over here
 

707
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,710
them suffocating over here
the issue is wow

708
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
the issue is wow
 

709
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,230
the issue is wow
i actually used like half my pick

710
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
i actually used like half my pick
 

711
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,789
i actually used like half my pick
already just building this thing

712
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:00,799
already just building this thing
 

713
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,909
already just building this thing
the issue is um

714
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919
the issue is um
 

715
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,270
the issue is um
if they go on this like if there's a

716
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
if they go on this like if there's a
 

717
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,070
if they go on this like if there's a
blaze down below there

718
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
blaze down below there
 

719
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,750
blaze down below there
i want to show you but i can't do it

720
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
i want to show you but i can't do it
 

721
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,870
i want to show you but i can't do it
without dying

722
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
without dying
 

723
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,390
without dying
quick yes okay

724
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,400
quick yes okay
 

725
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,830
quick yes okay
um right so

726
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:23,840

 

727
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,669

if there's a blaze down there and

728
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:25,679
if there's a blaze down there and
 

729
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,270
if there's a blaze down there and
there's one up here on this pressure

730
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,280
there's one up here on this pressure
 

731
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,870
there's one up here on this pressure
plates

732
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
plates
 

733
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,110
plates
i still can't demonstrate it without

734
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120
i still can't demonstrate it without
 

735
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,470
i still can't demonstrate it without
getting rid of it

736
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
getting rid of it
 

737
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,390
getting rid of it
okay i'm just gonna switch this pressure

738
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400
okay i'm just gonna switch this pressure
 

739
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,470
okay i'm just gonna switch this pressure
plate with a lever so we can control it

740
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480

 

741
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,510

that's what happens if a blaze steps on

742
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
that's what happens if a blaze steps on
 

743
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,950
that's what happens if a blaze steps on
that pressure plate it causes through

744
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:44,960
that pressure plate it causes through
 

745
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,270
that pressure plate it causes through
the pistons to extend

746
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
the pistons to extend
 

747
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,750
the pistons to extend
and there's no way for a blaze below

748
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:49,760
and there's no way for a blaze below
 

749
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,310
and there's no way for a blaze below
that to get through

750
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
that to get through
 

751
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,270
that to get through
so it just suffocates so

752
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
so it just suffocates so
 

753
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,430
so it just suffocates so
we need to change this and the reason

754
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
we need to change this and the reason
 

755
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,230
we need to change this and the reason
this one's extending

756
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240

 

757
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,630

there we go is because uh

758
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
there we go is because uh
 

759
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,510
there we go is because uh
the block one up and diagonal to it can

760
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
the block one up and diagonal to it can
 

761
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,510
the block one up and diagonal to it can
power it so this block is powering this

762
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
power it so this block is powering this
 

763
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,630
power it so this block is powering this
piston here

764
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640
piston here
 

765
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,470
piston here
believe it or not

766
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,480

 

767
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,710

and we need to fix that so the only way

768
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
and we need to fix that so the only way
 

769
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,270
and we need to fix that so the only way
i can think of is to move this up

770
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,280
i can think of is to move this up
 

771
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,390
i can think of is to move this up
one oh oh no

772
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
one oh oh no
 

773
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,430
one oh oh no
no no stop

774
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440

 

775
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,710

oh man that's freaky got lava at the end

776
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
oh man that's freaky got lava at the end
 

777
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,590
oh man that's freaky got lava at the end
of this thing

778
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
of this thing
 

779
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,430
of this thing
why did i stop here

780
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440

 

781
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,270

oh there's a repeater missing uh where

782
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
oh there's a repeater missing uh where
 

783
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,430
oh there's a repeater missing uh where
am i

784
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
am i
 

785
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,549
am i
i gotta get out of here i almost died

786
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559

 

787
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,310

i should really get some fire resistant

788
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
i should really get some fire resistant
 

789
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,789
i should really get some fire resistant
potions

790
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
potions
 

791
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,510
potions
okay give me a sec to fix this

792
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520
okay give me a sec to fix this
 

793
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,510
okay give me a sec to fix this
i've been thinking about it and i think

794
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
i've been thinking about it and i think
 

795
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,669
i've been thinking about it and i think
the only

796
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
the only
 

797
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,070
the only
proper way to fix this would be to lower

798
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080
proper way to fix this would be to lower
 

799
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,909
proper way to fix this would be to lower
the whole conveyor thing

800
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
the whole conveyor thing
 

801
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,590
the whole conveyor thing
down one block and that doesn't sound

802
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
down one block and that doesn't sound
 

803
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:15,909
down one block and that doesn't sound
like

804
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919
like
 

805
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,149
like
fun so i've thought of a new cheat way

806
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:18,159
fun so i've thought of a new cheat way
 

807
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,549
fun so i've thought of a new cheat way
of doing it too

808
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:20,559
of doing it too
 

809
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,549
of doing it too
instead of having

810
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
instead of having
 

811
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,310
instead of having
pressure plate here and one here we'll

812
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
pressure plate here and one here we'll
 

813
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,990
pressure plate here and one here we'll
just set it up so there's one here and

814
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,000
just set it up so there's one here and
 

815
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,590
just set it up so there's one here and
one here

816
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600
one here
 

817
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,870
one here
and then this first piston here won't be

818
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
and then this first piston here won't be
 

819
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,390
and then this first piston here won't be
activated so

820
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
activated so
 

821
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,950
activated so
we're going to move this and it should

822
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
we're going to move this and it should
 

823
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,750
we're going to move this and it should
still function

824
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:37,760
still function
 

825
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,350
still function
pretty much the same i would imagine

826
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,360
pretty much the same i would imagine
 

827
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,669
pretty much the same i would imagine
so we're not we're not cheating to

828
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
so we're not we're not cheating to
 

829
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,950
so we're not we're not cheating to
we're not cheating in a way that's going

830
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:46,960
we're not cheating in a way that's going
 

831
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,870
we're not cheating in a way that's going
to make this less effective we're just

832
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
to make this less effective we're just
 

833
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,310
to make this less effective we're just
changing it

834
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320

 

835
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,950

so we will have the piston here

836
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960

 

837
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,710

so if it was less effective i think i

838
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
so if it was less effective i think i
 

839
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,830
so if it was less effective i think i
would lower it just because it would bug

840
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:00,840
would lower it just because it would bug
 

841
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,510
would lower it just because it would bug
me

842
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:03,520
me
 

843
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,710
me
and do that

844
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
and do that
 

845
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,390
and do that
block there and then the repeater will

846
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
block there and then the repeater will
 

847
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,750
block there and then the repeater will
go

848
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
go
 

849
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,110
go
here and hopefully that will that won't

850
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,120
here and hopefully that will that won't
 

851
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,029
here and hopefully that will that won't
cause any problems i'll have to watch it

852
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,039
cause any problems i'll have to watch it
 

853
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,149
cause any problems i'll have to watch it
i think

854
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:18,159

 

855
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,010

um

856
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,020

i may have to adjust the delay on one of

860
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:24,559
i may have to adjust the delay on one of
 

861
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,110
i may have to adjust the delay on one of
these

862
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
these
 

863
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,789
these
i don't know should be about the same

864
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:30,799
i don't know should be about the same
 

865
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:31,990
i don't know should be about the same
okay so i'll close this up and then

866
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
okay so i'll close this up and then
 

867
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,510
okay so i'll close this up and then
we'll try it again and keep an eye on

868
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
we'll try it again and keep an eye on
 

869
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,549
we'll try it again and keep an eye on
this

870
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559

 

871
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,470

okay first test here they're coming down

872
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,480

 

873
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,669

lava should disable soon

874
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679

 

875
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,909

come on oh he's right above

876
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919

 

877
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:58,149

do you not get pushed

878
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
do you not get pushed
 

879
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,909
do you not get pushed
good good

880
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
good good
 

881
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,350
good good
so they were getting stuck in the corner

882
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360
so they were getting stuck in the corner
 

883
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,750
so they were getting stuck in the corner
like that too before

884
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
like that too before
 

885
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,070
like that too before
that's okay um

886
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080

 

887
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,270

you know what i should do is put the

888
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
you know what i should do is put the
 

889
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,590
you know what i should do is put the
sign over there so they'll wander off

890
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
sign over there so they'll wander off
 

891
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,510
sign over there so they'll wander off
too

892
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:15,520
too
 

893
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,750
too
right now he thinks he's stuck

894
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:21,760

 

895
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,830

will you move on your own i wonder you

896
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
will you move on your own i wonder you
 

897
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,190
will you move on your own i wonder you
should

898
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,200
should
 

899
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,350
should
don't seem to want to move

900
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,360

there he goes and he didn't fall down

904
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:38,840
there he goes and he didn't fall down

darn so it might be less effective

906
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
darn so it might be less effective
 

907
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,830
darn so it might be less effective
after all

908
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840

 

909
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,070

okay i may have figured it out here or

910
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
okay i may have figured it out here or
 

911
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,310
okay i may have figured it out here or
at least something that'll work better

912
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,320
at least something that'll work better
 

913
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,430
at least something that'll work better
i do have the sign back again so if they

914
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,440
i do have the sign back again so if they
 

915
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,990
i do have the sign back again so if they
land on

916
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
land on
 

917
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,870
land on
this block they will have an increased

918
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:56,880
this block they will have an increased
 

919
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,430
this block they will have an increased
chance

920
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
chance
 

921
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,830
chance
of wandering over here with their

922
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
of wandering over here with their
 

923
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,190
of wandering over here with their
pathfinding

924
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,200
pathfinding
 

925
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,070
pathfinding
because they view this as a solid block

926
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,080
because they view this as a solid block
 

927
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,110
because they view this as a solid block
so they will try to walk over it

928
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120
so they will try to walk over it
 

929
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,990
so they will try to walk over it
they can walk down there normally too

930
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,000
they can walk down there normally too
 

931
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,950
they can walk down there normally too
but

932
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
but
 

933
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,510
but
the way the pathfinding works uh there's

934
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,520
the way the pathfinding works uh there's
 

935
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:13,990
the way the pathfinding works uh there's
a

936
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,000
a
 

937
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,590
a
increased chance of them doing it if

938
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:15,600
increased chance of them doing it if
 

939
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,270
increased chance of them doing it if
it's at the same level

940
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,280
it's at the same level
 

941
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,430
it's at the same level
the block so that'll help i've also done

942
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
the block so that'll help i've also done
 

943
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,470
the block so that'll help i've also done
one other really important thing here

944
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
one other really important thing here
 

945
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,470
one other really important thing here
there's no reason i can't have one

946
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:26,480
there's no reason i can't have one
 

947
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,190
there's no reason i can't have one
pressure plate control two pistons so

948
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,200
pressure plate control two pistons so
 

949
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,110
pressure plate control two pistons so
now when they step on the one over there

950
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
now when they step on the one over there
 

951
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,890
now when they step on the one over there
two pistons go out instead of just one

952
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:35,900
two pistons go out instead of just one
 

953
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,070

and the way i rigged that up we'll go

956
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
and the way i rigged that up we'll go
 

957
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,149
and the way i rigged that up we'll go
behind here

958
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
behind here
 

959
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,390
behind here
had to use a little bit of wire

960
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400

 

961
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,350

so the first pistons there repeaters to

962
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
so the first pistons there repeaters to
 

963
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,350
so the first pistons there repeaters to
the left of this block so

964
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
the left of this block so
 

965
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,070
the left of this block so
repeater sends power to this block and

966
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,080
repeater sends power to this block and
 

967
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,029
repeater sends power to this block and
then you can

968
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
then you can
 

969
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,110
then you can
steal that power with this wire here and

970
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
steal that power with this wire here and
 

971
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,230
steal that power with this wire here and
it carries it up over

972
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240
it carries it up over
 

973
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,510
it carries it up over
to our piston our second piston here

974
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,520
to our piston our second piston here
 

975
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,350
to our piston our second piston here
so that should make that a lot better

976
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
so that should make that a lot better
 

977
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,590
so that should make that a lot better
i think we're gonna try it out here

978
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
i think we're gonna try it out here
 

979
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,590
i think we're gonna try it out here
pretty quick i got that side all ready

980
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:11,600
pretty quick i got that side all ready
 

981
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,549
pretty quick i got that side all ready
too

982
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
too
 

983
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,630
too
so let me get them spawning again and

984
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:14,640
so let me get them spawning again and
 

985
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,950
so let me get them spawning again and
we'll see how this works now

986
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:18,960
we'll see how this works now
 

987
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,470
we'll see how this works now
yeah i just got it up and running and

988
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
yeah i just got it up and running and
 

989
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,870
yeah i just got it up and running and
right off the bat we have a suffocator

990
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:22,880
right off the bat we have a suffocator
 

991
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,990
right off the bat we have a suffocator
so i'm going to

992
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
so i'm going to
 

993
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,510
so i'm going to
adjust this one to

994
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520

 

995
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,870

and adjust this to two ticks

996
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:36,880
and adjust this to two ticks
 

997
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,430
and adjust this to two ticks
or two torch delays i should say

998
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440

 

999
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,630

and hopefully that'll help okay

1000
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:44,640
and hopefully that'll help okay
 

1001
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,190
and hopefully that'll help okay
they're corrected now let's see if we

1002
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
they're corrected now let's see if we
 

1003
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,630
they're corrected now let's see if we
get any more suffocators

1004
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:52,640

 

1005
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,669

yeah not much i can do about that

1006
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:55,679
yeah not much i can do about that
 

1007
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,110
yeah not much i can do about that
what just happened there they were too

1008
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
what just happened there they were too
 

1009
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,669
what just happened there they were too
close together

1010
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:01,679
close together
 

1011
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,590
close together
uh nice thing is it seems to kind of

1012
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
uh nice thing is it seems to kind of
 

1013
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,710
uh nice thing is it seems to kind of
self-regulate itself

1014
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:08,720

 

1015
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,830

it's good

1016
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:11,840

 

1017
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,070

because uh these things these things

1018
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,080
because uh these things these things
 

1019
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,909
because uh these things these things
kind of uh

1020
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:15,919
kind of uh
 

1021
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,390
kind of uh
close off areas so they one blaze has to

1022
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
close off areas so they one blaze has to
 

1023
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,149
close off areas so they one blaze has to
wait for another blaze to go through

1024
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
wait for another blaze to go through
 

1025
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,269
wait for another blaze to go through
before it can unless they're really

1026
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:23,279
before it can unless they're really
 

1027
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,149
before it can unless they're really
close together

1028
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:28,159
