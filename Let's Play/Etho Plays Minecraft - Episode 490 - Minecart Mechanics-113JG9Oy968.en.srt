00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,609
mushroom farm this little nasty project
of ours this is supposed to be one of

12
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:22,619
of ours this is supposed to be one of
 

13
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,410
of ours this is supposed to be one of
those eight-hour projects and I'm well

14
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:24,420
those eight-hour projects and I'm well
 

15
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,339
those eight-hour projects and I'm well
into it now I just redid the water

16
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:28,349
into it now I just redid the water
 

17
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,470
into it now I just redid the water
system so we got two dispensers there

18
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
system so we got two dispensers there
 

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,179
system so we got two dispensers there
last episode we tried it out with just

20
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:32,189
last episode we tried it out with just
 

21
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,780
last episode we tried it out with just
one didn't work so added a second one

22
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:35,790
one didn't work so added a second one
 

23
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,720
one didn't work so added a second one
I'll just jump up here and show you the

24
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:38,730
I'll just jump up here and show you the
 

25
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,780
I'll just jump up here and show you the
wiring because I know I know guys you

26
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:41,790
wiring because I know I know guys you
 

27
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,549
wiring because I know I know guys you
can't sleep soundly tonight unless you

28
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:43,559
can't sleep soundly tonight unless you
 

29
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,139
can't sleep soundly tonight unless you
see it you must know how it works right

30
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:47,149
see it you must know how it works right
 

31
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:50,869
see it you must know how it works right
I'm going to show you so basically we

32
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
I'm going to show you so basically we
 

33
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,610
I'm going to show you so basically we
have to power these four dispensers

34
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:52,620
have to power these four dispensers
 

35
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,670
have to power these four dispensers
right so we set repeater going into this

36
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
right so we set repeater going into this
 

37
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,380
right so we set repeater going into this
block which then powers this redstone

38
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:57,390
block which then powers this redstone
 

39
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,319
block which then powers this redstone
dust and this is pointing all four

40
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:00,329
dust and this is pointing all four
 

41
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,939
dust and this is pointing all four
directions of this redstone dust so it

42
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:01,949
directions of this redstone dust so it
 

43
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,700
directions of this redstone dust so it
goes to this and this dispenser then

44
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:04,710
goes to this and this dispenser then
 

45
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,530
goes to this and this dispenser then
into this block which also powers this

46
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:06,540
into this block which also powers this
 

47
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,080
into this block which also powers this
one in this one and then we bolus Lido

48
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,090
one in this one and then we bolus Lido
 

49
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,420
one in this one and then we bolus Lido
through with this repeater now if we

50
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:11,430
through with this repeater now if we
 

51
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,890
through with this repeater now if we
just had like a piece of redstone dust

52
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:12,900
just had like a piece of redstone dust
 

53
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,270
just had like a piece of redstone dust
here for example it wouldn't work

54
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:14,280
here for example it wouldn't work
 

55
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,580
here for example it wouldn't work
because then this goes up and down it

56
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:16,590
because then this goes up and down it
 

57
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,969
because then this goes up and down it
doesn't go to this dispenser or this one

58
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:18,979
doesn't go to this dispenser or this one
 

59
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,010
doesn't go to this dispenser or this one
amazing right you can go to sleep

60

welcome haha I know you don't care
anyways Oh had a redstone problem with

66
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,150
anyways Oh had a redstone problem with
 

67
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,480
anyways Oh had a redstone problem with
this thing and I could spend thirty

68
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,490
this thing and I could spend thirty
 

69
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,960
this thing and I could spend thirty
minutes trying to figure it out this the

70
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:38,970
minutes trying to figure it out this the
 

71
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,999
minutes trying to figure it out this the
answer was so simple I just want to

72
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:41,009
answer was so simple I just want to
 

73
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,920
answer was so simple I just want to
smack my head against the desk like

74
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:42,930
smack my head against the desk like
 

75
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,280
smack my head against the desk like
really so when we went to use this some

76
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,290
really so when we went to use this some
 

77
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,679
really so when we went to use this some
of the pistons were getting left in the

78
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:48,689
of the pistons were getting left in the
 

79
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,600
of the pistons were getting left in the
wrong spot like they were would stay

80
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:50,610
wrong spot like they were would stay
 

81
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,240
wrong spot like they were would stay
over here and some of them were going

82
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,250
over here and some of them were going
 

83
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,770
over here and some of them were going
down like they're supposed to they were

84
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:54,780
down like they're supposed to they were
 

85
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,399
down like they're supposed to they were
retracting on these double extenders and

86
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:57,409
retracting on these double extenders and
 

87
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,950
retracting on these double extenders and
I could not figure out why why were some

88
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
I could not figure out why why were some
 

89
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,980
I could not figure out why why were some
working and some were not so I set up a

90
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:03,990
working and some were not so I set up a
 

91
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,359
working and some were not so I set up a
thing here to try it out and I was

92
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:08,369
thing here to try it out and I was
 

93
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:09,979
thing here to try it out and I was
playing with the timings and trying it

94
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:09,989
playing with the timings and trying it
 

95
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,400
playing with the timings and trying it
out and all seemed good

96
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,410
out and all seemed good
 

97
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,620
out and all seemed good
that's basically what we want to happen

98
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:14,630
that's basically what we want to happen
 

99
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,660
that's basically what we want to happen
and then I would set it up here and it

100
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:16,670
and then I would set it up here and it
 

101
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,010
and then I would set it up here and it
wouldn't work and I was like well what's

102
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,020
wouldn't work and I was like well what's
 

103
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,110
wouldn't work and I was like well what's
going on what's what's wrong with this

104
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,120
going on what's what's wrong with this
 

105
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,530
going on what's what's wrong with this
thing guess what guess what the problem

106
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:23,540
thing guess what guess what the problem
 

107
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,840
thing guess what guess what the problem
was some of them had sticky pistons and

108
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:28,850
was some of them had sticky pistons and
 

109
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,560
was some of them had sticky pistons and
some of them didn't that's all it was

110
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:32,570
some of them didn't that's all it was
 

111
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,330
some of them didn't that's all it was
and I couldn't see it like this one

112
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:34,340
and I couldn't see it like this one
 

113
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,540
and I couldn't see it like this one
didn't get retracted oh I wonder why

114
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:36,550
didn't get retracted oh I wonder why
 

115
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,720
didn't get retracted oh I wonder why
because this is not a sticky piston here

116
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:39,730
because this is not a sticky piston here
 

117
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,880
because this is not a sticky piston here
supposed to be a sticky piston so simple

118
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:44,890
supposed to be a sticky piston so simple
 

119
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,230
supposed to be a sticky piston so simple
anyways I'm going to go and that fix all

120
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:47,240
anyways I'm going to go and that fix all
 

121
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,510
anyways I'm going to go and that fix all
these and then this is going to be

122
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:49,520
these and then this is going to be
 

123
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:57,130
these and then this is going to be
pretty close to done then okay very good

124
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,140
pretty close to done then okay very good
 

125
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,860
pretty close to done then okay very good
very good I think the double extenders

126
00:02:59,860 --> 00:02:59,870
very good I think the double extenders
 

127
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,450
very good I think the double extenders
have been fixed we'll test them out in

128
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:01,460
have been fixed we'll test them out in
 

129
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,280
have been fixed we'll test them out in
just two set in we're going to try to

130
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,290
just two set in we're going to try to
 

131
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,480
just two set in we're going to try to
have the whole farm working before we

132
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,490
have the whole farm working before we
 

133
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,500
have the whole farm working before we
try it

134
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:05,510
try it
 

135
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,080
try it
so we have our bonemeal dispenser thing

136
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,090
so we have our bonemeal dispenser thing
 

137
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,180
so we have our bonemeal dispenser thing
that works we tried that before it'll

138
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,190
that works we tried that before it'll
 

139
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,570
that works we tried that before it'll
grow the mushroom then we chopper down

140
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:12,580
grow the mushroom then we chopper down
 

141
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,490
grow the mushroom then we chopper down
the mushrooms land on the dirt here then

142
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:15,500
the mushrooms land on the dirt here then
 

143
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,530
the mushrooms land on the dirt here then
the water streams will will fall down

144
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:17,540
the water streams will will fall down
 

145
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,270
the water streams will will fall down
and push everything towards these holes

146
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
and push everything towards these holes
 

147
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,810
and push everything towards these holes
all the way down and we set up the

148
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:22,820
all the way down and we set up the
 

149
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,480
all the way down and we set up the
minecart stuff already down here that

150
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,490
minecart stuff already down here that
 

151
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,420
minecart stuff already down here that
runs underneath those those holes so

152
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:28,430
runs underneath those those holes so
 

153
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,340
runs underneath those those holes so
we'll have hopper minecarts running on

154
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,350
we'll have hopper minecarts running on
 

155
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,500
we'll have hopper minecarts running on
this track and like a bug here is one of

156
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:32,510
this track and like a bug here is one of
 

157
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,090
this track and like a bug here is one of
the holes it'll pick it up through the

158
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,100
the holes it'll pick it up through the
 

159
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,880
the holes it'll pick it up through the
through the ground and make its way all

160
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:36,890
through the ground and make its way all
 

161
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,310
through the ground and make its way all
the way around the farm the last little

162
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:39,320
the way around the farm the last little
 

163
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,500
the way around the farm the last little
challenge though is we don't have a

164
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:41,510
challenge though is we don't have a
 

165
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,420
challenge though is we don't have a
start and stop to this minecart track

166
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:43,430
start and stop to this minecart track
 

167
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,260
start and stop to this minecart track
thing so what we need to do is send like

168
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,270
thing so what we need to do is send like
 

169
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,060
thing so what we need to do is send like
six or seven hopper mine carts down the

170
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,070
six or seven hopper mine carts down the
 

171
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,400
six or seven hopper mine carts down the
track all at once and then unload them

172
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,410
track all at once and then unload them
 

173
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,930
track all at once and then unload them
somewhere and like I would like to do it

174
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:55,940
somewhere and like I would like to do it
 

175
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,390
somewhere and like I would like to do it
like this right but you can't like where

176
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
like this right but you can't like where
 

177
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,620
like this right but you can't like where
you put the hopper my card in the

178
00:03:59,620 --> 00:03:59,630
you put the hopper my card in the
 

179
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,270
you put the hopper my card in the
dispenser and then when you want to want

180
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
dispenser and then when you want to want
 

181
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,870
dispenser and then when you want to want
to use it you just send it down its way

182
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:04,880
to use it you just send it down its way
 

183
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,550
to use it you just send it down its way
and it'll pick stuff up and then when

184
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
and it'll pick stuff up and then when
 

185
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,310
and it'll pick stuff up and then when
you're done pop into the cactus that

186
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:09,320
you're done pop into the cactus that
 

187
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,650
you're done pop into the cactus that
splits minecart Tsin into pieces though

188
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:11,660
splits minecart Tsin into pieces though
 

189
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,750
splits minecart Tsin into pieces though
and I was thinking about that today does

190
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
and I was thinking about that today does
 

191
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,820
and I was thinking about that today does
anybody actually like that because I

192
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:15,830
anybody actually like that because I
 

193
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,420
anybody actually like that because I
sure don't like that's that's the way

194
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,430
sure don't like that's that's the way
 

195
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,190
sure don't like that's that's the way
the game has always been and it's like I

196
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,200
the game has always been and it's like I
 

197
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,810
the game has always been and it's like I
can't think of one instance where I

198
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:22,820
can't think of one instance where I
 

199
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,580
can't think of one instance where I
actually prefer it that way I I think

200
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:24,590
actually prefer it that way I I think
 

201
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,140
actually prefer it that way I I think
when a hopper minecart it's the

202
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,150
when a hopper minecart it's the
 

203
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,030
when a hopper minecart it's the
droid I want it to be a hopper minecart

204
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,040
droid I want it to be a hopper minecart
 

205
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,040
droid I want it to be a hopper minecart
or a storage minecart should stay at

206
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,050
or a storage minecart should stay at
 

207
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,350
or a storage minecart should stay at
storage minecart otherwise it

208
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:32,360
storage minecart otherwise it
 

209
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,810
storage minecart otherwise it
complicates things right it limits what

210
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:34,820
complicates things right it limits what
 

211
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,200
complicates things right it limits what
you can do in my opinion so what we're

212
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,210
you can do in my opinion so what we're
 

213
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,850
you can do in my opinion so what we're
going to have to do is keep the hopper

214
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:39,860
going to have to do is keep the hopper
 

215
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,680
going to have to do is keep the hopper
minecarts like in their minecart form so

216
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:44,690
minecarts like in their minecart form so
 

217
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,129
minecarts like in their minecart form so
how do we stack six or seven hopper mine

218
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:48,139
how do we stack six or seven hopper mine
 

219
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,960
how do we stack six or seven hopper mine
carts together that's what we got to

220
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:49,970
carts together that's what we got to
 

221
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,670
carts together that's what we got to
figure out let's figure it out so I

222
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:54,680
figure out let's figure it out so I
 

223
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,480
figure out let's figure it out so I
think I think we can do it like this

224
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:00,490
think I think we can do it like this
 

225
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,670
think I think we can do it like this
let's see what are we doing here

226
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
let's see what are we doing here
 

227
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,850
let's see what are we doing here
oh I don't want those to connect though

228
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:05,860
oh I don't want those to connect though
 

229
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,930
oh I don't want those to connect though
so maybe let's go up one block higher

230
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:09,940
so maybe let's go up one block higher
 

231
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,460
so maybe let's go up one block higher
we'll try drop it on a minecart track

232
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:12,470
we'll try drop it on a minecart track
 

233
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,170
we'll try drop it on a minecart track
and see if they stayed together or if

234
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,180
and see if they stayed together or if
 

235
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,589
and see if they stayed together or if
they like push each other and not stay

236
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:17,599
they like push each other and not stay
 

237
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:21,219
they like push each other and not stay
in the spot if you know what I mean

238
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:21,229
in the spot if you know what I mean
 

239
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,170
in the spot if you know what I mean
you probably don't you'll see okay so

240
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:25,180
you probably don't you'll see okay so
 

241
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,520
you probably don't you'll see okay so
that's the block back there do we have a

242
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:27,530
that's the block back there do we have a
 

243
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,610
that's the block back there do we have a
lever we do very good so that should

244
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:30,620
lever we do very good so that should
 

245
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,370
lever we do very good so that should
drop it down and they'll stack together

246
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:32,380
drop it down and they'll stack together
 

247
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,629
drop it down and they'll stack together
the question is do they stay in that

248
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
the question is do they stay in that
 

249
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,730
the question is do they stay in that
spot or does them being together push

250
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:36,740
spot or does them being together push
 

251
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,700
spot or does them being together push
them down the track we want them to stay

252
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:39,710
them down the track we want them to stay
 

253
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,170
them down the track we want them to stay
in the spot it looks like they're going

254
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:41,180
in the spot it looks like they're going
 

255
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,140
in the spot it looks like they're going
to stay in the spot okay good that's

256
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,150
to stay in the spot okay good that's
 

257
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,810
to stay in the spot okay good that's
what we want and then when we tell them

258
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:46,820
what we want and then when we tell them
 

259
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,409
what we want and then when we tell them
to go do they all go together because

260
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:50,419
to go do they all go together because
 

261
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:53,050
to go do they all go together because
that's also what we want they do okay

262
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,060
that's also what we want they do okay
 

263
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,689
that's also what we want they do okay
good actually before we commit to that

264
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:55,699
good actually before we commit to that
 

265
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:57,909
good actually before we commit to that
idea let's test it for realsies here on

266
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
idea let's test it for realsies here on
 

267
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,589
idea let's test it for realsies here on
our actual track we will let out six six

268
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:02,599
our actual track we will let out six six
 

269
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:05,260
our actual track we will let out six six
hopper mine cards here all in the same

270
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:05,270
hopper mine cards here all in the same
 

271
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,140
hopper mine cards here all in the same
spots and then we'll turn it on the

272
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,150
spots and then we'll turn it on the
 

273
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,700
spots and then we'll turn it on the
reason I want to try it out here is

274
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:09,710
reason I want to try it out here is
 

275
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,550
reason I want to try it out here is
because this is all very time-sensitive

276
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:11,560
because this is all very time-sensitive
 

277
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,110
because this is all very time-sensitive
this micro track this detector rail

278
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:14,120
this micro track this detector rail
 

279
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,450
this micro track this detector rail
flips the junction for just a certain

280
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:16,460
flips the junction for just a certain
 

281
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,659
flips the junction for just a certain
amount of time and possibly having six

282
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:19,669
amount of time and possibly having six
 

283
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,390
amount of time and possibly having six
of them together here we'll mess that up

284
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:23,400

 

285
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:31,340

yeah that's what I was afraid of huh so

286
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,350
yeah that's what I was afraid of huh so
 

287
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,439
yeah that's what I was afraid of huh so
they're moving faster now because

288
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:33,449
they're moving faster now because
 

289
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:36,620
they're moving faster now because
they're together what do we do about

290
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:36,630
they're together what do we do about
 

291
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,490
they're together what do we do about
that okay maybe we'll try to keep them

292
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:40,500
that okay maybe we'll try to keep them
 

293
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,340
that okay maybe we'll try to keep them
minecart separate after all keeping them

294
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:43,350
minecart separate after all keeping them
 

295
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,870
minecart separate after all keeping them
separate we're less likely to have

296
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
separate we're less likely to have
 

297
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,110
separate we're less likely to have
trouble but it'll take up more space and

298
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,120
trouble but it'll take up more space and
 

299
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,870
trouble but it'll take up more space and
be slightly more complicated but yeah I

300
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
be slightly more complicated but yeah I
 

301
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,550
be slightly more complicated but yeah I
want to try something out here if we put

302
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
want to try something out here if we put
 

303
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,480
want to try something out here if we put
cobble in this one and then we put

304
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,490
cobble in this one and then we put
 

305
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,510
cobble in this one and then we put
coarse dirt in there and let's put

306
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
coarse dirt in there and let's put
 

307
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,219
coarse dirt in there and let's put
regular dirt in this one let's let's see

308
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:01,229
regular dirt in this one let's let's see
 

309
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,310
regular dirt in this one let's let's see
if we can unload through the slab here

310
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:03,320
if we can unload through the slab here
 

311
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,890
if we can unload through the slab here
break that one break that one break that

312
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:06,900
break that one break that one break that
 

313
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,180
break that one break that one break that
one okay so they're going to be on top

314
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,190
one okay so they're going to be on top
 

315
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,560
one okay so they're going to be on top
of each other like that Pez dispensers

316
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:09,570
of each other like that Pez dispensers
 

317
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,850
of each other like that Pez dispensers
style then Oh

318
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:13,860
style then Oh
 

319
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,590
style then Oh
oh yeah they all owe ya that works out

320
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:15,600
oh yeah they all owe ya that works out
 

321
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,700
oh yeah they all owe ya that works out
really good actually because they all

322
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:16,710
really good actually because they all
 

323
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,939
really good actually because they all
drain to the bottom one right and then

324
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:19,949
drain to the bottom one right and then
 

325
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:22,700
drain to the bottom one right and then
if if they can get picked up through a

326
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:22,710
if if they can get picked up through a
 

327
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,730
if if they can get picked up through a
hopper here yeah oh that will work out

328
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:25,740
hopper here yeah oh that will work out
 

329
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,839
hopper here yeah oh that will work out
just fine yes not as complicated as I

330
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:29,849
just fine yes not as complicated as I
 

331
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,150
just fine yes not as complicated as I
thought so then then we just want to

332
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
thought so then then we just want to
 

333
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,990
thought so then then we just want to
send one off all we got to do is this so

334
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
send one off all we got to do is this so
 

335
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,760
send one off all we got to do is this so
why did that get moved okay I guess

336
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:37,770
why did that get moved okay I guess
 

337
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,570
why did that get moved okay I guess
we're gonna have to have blocks

338
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:38,580
we're gonna have to have blocks
 

339
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,450
we're gonna have to have blocks
surrounding this too because this should

340
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:41,460
surrounding this too because this should
 

341
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,290
surrounding this too because this should
have dropped on the slab and it didn't

342
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:44,300
have dropped on the slab and it didn't
 

343
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,310
have dropped on the slab and it didn't
alright everybody so that is the idea

344
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:46,320
alright everybody so that is the idea
 

345
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,990
alright everybody so that is the idea
we're going to go with here I got the

346
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
we're going to go with here I got the
 

347
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,070
we're going to go with here I got the
PEZ dispenser stack setup so let's try

348
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
PEZ dispenser stack setup so let's try
 

349
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,379
PEZ dispenser stack setup so let's try
it out make sure it works

350
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:53,389
it out make sure it works
 

351
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:58,310
it out make sure it works
for realsies so I left a little bit of

352
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:58,320
for realsies so I left a little bit of
 

353
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,589
for realsies so I left a little bit of
space in k-6 minecarts is not enough we

354
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:00,599
space in k-6 minecarts is not enough we
 

355
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,339
space in k-6 minecarts is not enough we
might be able to do seven or eight let's

356
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:04,349
might be able to do seven or eight let's
 

357
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:07,010
might be able to do seven or eight let's
go for six right now so those all line

358
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,020
go for six right now so those all line
 

359
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,379
go for six right now so those all line
up nicely in our our Pez stack here and

360
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:09,389
up nicely in our our Pez stack here and
 

361
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,180
up nicely in our our Pez stack here and
then we'll have some way of activating

362
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,190
then we'll have some way of activating
 

363
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:16,370
then we'll have some way of activating
this such as a button it only lets one

364
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:16,380
this such as a button it only lets one
 

365
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,830
this such as a button it only lets one
through and start it is it still going

366
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
through and start it is it still going
 

367
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,010
through and start it is it still going
too fast what's going on here oh man

368
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,020
too fast what's going on here oh man
 

369
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,930
too fast what's going on here oh man
like I tested that all out before let's

370
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:29,940
like I tested that all out before let's
 

371
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,770
like I tested that all out before let's
try now watch

372
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:35,780

 

373
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,870

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:50,310
snapshots definitely mine carts are not
 

379
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,180
snapshots definitely mine carts are not
moving at the same speed anymore okay

380
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:53,190
moving at the same speed anymore okay
 

381
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,780

384
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:55,560
I just realized what's wrong it's
 

385
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,320
I just realized what's wrong it's
because when I tested this I wasn't

386
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,330
because when I tested this I wasn't
 

387
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,880
because when I tested this I wasn't
using hopper mine carts I was using

388
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:58,890
using hopper mine carts I was using
 

389
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,360
using hopper mine carts I was using
regular mine carts which if you didn't

390
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,370
regular mine carts which if you didn't
 

391
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,310
regular mine carts which if you didn't
know actually move slower a lot slower

392
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
know actually move slower a lot slower
 

393
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,170

00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:10,980
it was regular mine carts that's what it
 

397
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,880
it was regular mine carts that's what it
was all configured for so I'm going to

398
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:13,890
was all configured for so I'm going to
 

399
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,880

these three power rails with regular
 

405
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,860
these three power rails with regular
rails and that seems to slow it down

406
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:21,870
rails and that seems to slow it down
 

407
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,010
rails and that seems to slow it down
enough and don't have to make any major

408
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,020
enough and don't have to make any major
 

409
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,660
enough and don't have to make any major

minecart thing here now we don't want to
press the button six times like if we

442
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,110
press the button six times like if we
 

443
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,840
press the button six times like if we
have six hopper mine carts here right so

444
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:05,850
have six hopper mine carts here right so
 

445
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,240
have six hopper mine carts here right so
we need to do something a little bit

446
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,250
we need to do something a little bit
 

447
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,910
we need to do something a little bit
fancy with the redstone my plan is to

448
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:12,920
fancy with the redstone my plan is to
 

449
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,180
fancy with the redstone my plan is to
set up a tripwire thing here we will

450
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,190
set up a tripwire thing here we will
 

451
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,950
set up a tripwire thing here we will
detect if there's any mine cards here

452
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:18,960
detect if there's any mine cards here
 

453
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,050
detect if there's any mine cards here
and when they're all gone then we shut

454
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,060
and when they're all gone then we shut
 

455
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,140
and when they're all gone then we shut
shut this off we're going to set up a

456
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,150
shut this off we're going to set up a
 

457
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,950
shut this off we're going to set up a
clock that runs to activate this piston

458
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:26,960
clock that runs to activate this piston
 

459
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,850
clock that runs to activate this piston
that's that's the dream here so let's

460
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:31,860
that's that's the dream here so let's
 

461
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,100
that's that's the dream here so let's
see if we can do this quickly all right

462

see if we can do this quickly all right
 

463
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,320
see if we can do this quickly all right
get some string there can we place the

464

get some string there can we place the
 

465
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:42,710
get some string there can we place the
string where the minecarts are I don't

466

string where the minecarts are I don't
 

467
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,980
string where the minecarts are I don't
think so oh please

468

we'll do is then put a torch this is

478
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:02,890
we'll do is then put a torch this is
 

479
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,920
we'll do is then put a torch this is
going to have to go to a monostable

480
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:04,930
going to have to go to a monostable
 

481
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,090
going to have to go to a monostable
circuit so the stare into the monostable

482
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:09,100
circuit so the stare into the monostable
 

483
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,699
circuit so the stare into the monostable
circuits then we want a T flip-flop that

484
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:11,709
circuits then we want a T flip-flop that
 

485
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:15,180
circuits then we want a T flip-flop that
this thing controls so set a repeater to

486
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,190
this thing controls so set a repeater to
 

487
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,380
this thing controls so set a repeater to
one tick like a so and I think we'll

488
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:19,390
one tick like a so and I think we'll
 

489
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,500
one tick like a so and I think we'll
Bend back this way now this will go to a

490
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:22,510
Bend back this way now this will go to a
 

491
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,900
Bend back this way now this will go to a
sticky piston with a redstone block so

492
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:24,910
sticky piston with a redstone block so
 

493
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,269
sticky piston with a redstone block so
depending on if this block is extended

494
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
depending on if this block is extended
 

495
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,639
depending on if this block is extended
or retracted it will turn the clock on

496
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:29,649
or retracted it will turn the clock on
 

497
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,019
or retracted it will turn the clock on
or off which will activate this so the

498
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:34,029
or off which will activate this so the
 

499
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:39,870
or off which will activate this so the
clock we want to lock I think will go

500
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:39,880
clock we want to lock I think will go
 

501
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,449
clock we want to lock I think will go
over here it'll activate this redstone

502
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:42,459
over here it'll activate this redstone
 

503
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:44,160
over here it'll activate this redstone
dust will shut which will shut the clock

504
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,170
dust will shut which will shut the clock
 

505
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:49,230
dust will shut which will shut the clock
off I think probably a two two by four

506
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:49,240
off I think probably a two two by four
 

507
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,210
off I think probably a two two by four
clock will be big enough yeah let's put

508
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:54,220
clock will be big enough yeah let's put
 

509
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,000
clock will be big enough yeah let's put
a redstone torch here and then three

510
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,010
a redstone torch here and then three
 

511
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,420
a redstone torch here and then three
repeaters well set these at four just to

512
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:00,430
repeaters well set these at four just to
 

513
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,650
repeaters well set these at four just to
begin with but we'll probably be able to

514
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:01,660
begin with but we'll probably be able to
 

515
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,540
begin with but we'll probably be able to
shorten the time on this to like we

516
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:03,550
shorten the time on this to like we
 

517
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,220
shorten the time on this to like we
don't want to send all the minecarts at

518
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,230
don't want to send all the minecarts at
 

519
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,750
don't want to send all the minecarts at
once because then they'll bump into each

520
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:06,760
once because then they'll bump into each
 

521
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,550
once because then they'll bump into each
other too you know we have to space them

522
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560
other too you know we have to space them
 

523
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,670
other too you know we have to space them
out a little bit which is why why we

524
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
out a little bit which is why why we
 

525
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,120
out a little bit which is why why we
want this clock here yeah and then this

526
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,130
want this clock here yeah and then this
 

527
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,630
want this clock here yeah and then this
will go to that and send off the

528
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:18,640
will go to that and send off the
 

529
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,829
will go to that and send off the
minecarts then when they're all gone

530
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
minecarts then when they're all gone
 

531
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,730
minecarts then when they're all gone
this will shut off I think it might

532
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:23,740
this will shut off I think it might
 

533
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,350
this will shut off I think it might
actually be set right right now if if

534
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:28,360
actually be set right right now if if
 

535
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,139
actually be set right right now if if
the tripwire was there anyway let's see

536
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:31,149
the tripwire was there anyway let's see
 

537
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:34,069
the tripwire was there anyway let's see
what happens uh-huh

538
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
what happens uh-huh
 

539
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,030
what happens uh-huh
they're actually getting sent pretty

540
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,040
they're actually getting sent pretty
 

541
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,579
they're actually getting sent pretty
quickly aren't they oh it's the well

542
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:41,589
quickly aren't they oh it's the well
 

543
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:43,079
quickly aren't they oh it's the well
they're bouncing backwards I know that's

544
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:43,089
they're bouncing backwards I know that's
 

545
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:45,240
they're bouncing backwards I know that's
what I was afraid of so I probably sent

546
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,250
what I was afraid of so I probably sent
 

547
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,540
what I was afraid of so I probably sent
them too quickly there okay I think this

548
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:48,550
them too quickly there okay I think this
 

549
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,670
them too quickly there okay I think this
is good to go now guys I got rid of the

550
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:50,680
is good to go now guys I got rid of the
 

551
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,470
is good to go now guys I got rid of the
redstone torch that was here put a

552
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
redstone torch that was here put a
 

553
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,750
redstone torch that was here put a
redstone dust there and I made the clock

554
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:54,760
redstone dust there and I made the clock
 

555
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,430
redstone dust there and I made the clock
a little bit bigger too so there should

556
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:56,440
a little bit bigger too so there should
 

557
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,079
a little bit bigger too so there should
be more spacing between the minecarts

558
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:58,089
be more spacing between the minecarts
 

559
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:00,809
be more spacing between the minecarts
and I put a redstone torch here so this

560
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:00,819
and I put a redstone torch here so this
 

561
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:04,049
and I put a redstone torch here so this
is retracted by default so this is our

562
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:04,059
is retracted by default so this is our
 

563
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:07,319
is retracted by default so this is our
startup the way they look to actually

564
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:07,329
startup the way they look to actually
 

565
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,359
startup the way they look to actually
start this thing we sent one redstone

566
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:09,369
start this thing we sent one redstone
 

567
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:11,579
start this thing we sent one redstone
pulse to this piston so I got a button

568
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:11,589
pulse to this piston so I got a button
 

569
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,340
pulse to this piston so I got a button
here to do that and that should send the

570
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:14,350
here to do that and that should send the
 

571
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,859
here to do that and that should send the
mic rats on their way that'll activate

572
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:16,869
mic rats on their way that'll activate
 

573
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:22,859
mic rats on their way that'll activate
the clock right yeah now that's a really

574
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:22,869
the clock right yeah now that's a really
 

575
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,829
the clock right yeah now that's a really
long time ago I put a redstone torch

576
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
long time ago I put a redstone torch
 

577
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,629
long time ago I put a redstone torch
there before that's that's why it's so

578
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:27,639
there before that's that's why it's so
 

579
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,979
there before that's that's why it's so
fast and this clock should run until

580
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:31,989
fast and this clock should run until
 

581
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:33,569
fast and this clock should run until
they come back then this will get

582
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:33,579
they come back then this will get
 

583
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:43,219
they come back then this will get
extended again oh is that a problem

584
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:43,229

 

585
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:46,349

wait a minute wait a minute it'll take

586
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:46,359
wait a minute wait a minute it'll take
 

587
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,519
wait a minute wait a minute it'll take
them a little while to get back here so

588
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:47,529
them a little while to get back here so
 

589
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:51,239
them a little while to get back here so
I'll just throw one in oh yeah that

590
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:51,249
I'll just throw one in oh yeah that
 

591
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:53,099
I'll just throw one in oh yeah that
retracts that piston over there okay so

592
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:53,109
retracts that piston over there okay so
 

593
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:55,139
retracts that piston over there okay so
we're good so it's it's back the way it

594
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:55,149
we're good so it's it's back the way it
 

595
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:57,150
we're good so it's it's back the way it
was at the starts until we press this

596
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,160
was at the starts until we press this
 

597
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:04,499
was at the starts until we press this
button again alright so we got this

598
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:04,509
button again alright so we got this
 

599
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:07,259
button again alright so we got this
working like I wanted to and like we saw

600
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:07,269
working like I wanted to and like we saw
 

601
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:08,819
working like I wanted to and like we saw
before if that top minecart has

602
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:08,829
before if that top minecart has
 

603
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:10,590
before if that top minecart has
mushroomed blocks in they will funnel

604
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:10,600
mushroomed blocks in they will funnel
 

605
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,239
mushroomed blocks in they will funnel
all the way down to the bottom and

606
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:12,249
all the way down to the bottom and
 

607
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:14,489
all the way down to the bottom and
that's where we have two hopper here so

608
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:14,499
that's where we have two hopper here so
 

609
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:15,719
that's where we have two hopper here so
it's going to pull items out of this

610
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:15,729
it's going to pull items out of this
 

611
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,699
it's going to pull items out of this
bottom line kurtz and go into that chest

612
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:17,709
bottom line kurtz and go into that chest
 

613
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:20,460
bottom line kurtz and go into that chest
and i've added on to the puzzle over

614
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:20,470
and i've added on to the puzzle over
 

615
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,979
and i've added on to the puzzle over
here another piece that we will check

616
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:22,989
here another piece that we will check
 

617
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:25,679
here another piece that we will check
out this will fill up with mushroom

618
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:25,689
out this will fill up with mushroom
 

619
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:28,619
out this will fill up with mushroom
blocks and we have the storage minecart

620
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:28,629
blocks and we have the storage minecart
 

621
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:31,379
blocks and we have the storage minecart
here and you can see it's within range

622
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:31,389
here and you can see it's within range
 

623
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:34,379
here and you can see it's within range
it'll you'll get the items so that's

624
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:34,389
it'll you'll get the items so that's
 

625
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:36,239
it'll you'll get the items so that's
good this is something I'm actually very

626
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:36,249
good this is something I'm actually very
 

627
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:38,399
good this is something I'm actually very
proud of I for the longest time

628
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:38,409
proud of I for the longest time
 

629
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:40,819
proud of I for the longest time
struggled with figuring out how to

630
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:40,829
struggled with figuring out how to
 

631
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:45,119
struggled with figuring out how to
detect when a minecart is full or detect

632
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:45,129
detect when a minecart is full or detect
 

633
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:47,549
detect when a minecart is full or detect
when it's half-full or whatever this can

634
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:47,559
when it's half-full or whatever this can
 

635
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:50,429
when it's half-full or whatever this can
do it and this is a very compact way of

636
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:50,439
do it and this is a very compact way of
 

637
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:54,509
do it and this is a very compact way of
doing it - I would say so basically this

638
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:54,519
doing it - I would say so basically this
 

639
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,729
doing it - I would say so basically this
block keeps the minecart from rolling

640
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:56,739
block keeps the minecart from rolling
 

641
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:58,590
block keeps the minecart from rolling
down the hill here it's on a detector

642
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:58,600
down the hill here it's on a detector
 

643
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,139
down the hill here it's on a detector
rail and if a storage minecart is on a

644
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:01,149
rail and if a storage minecart is on a
 

645
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,269
rail and if a storage minecart is on a
detector rail you can use a comparator

646
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
detector rail you can use a comparator
 

647
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,399
detector rail you can use a comparator
to figure out what or how much stuff is

648
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:05,409
to figure out what or how much stuff is
 

649
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,379
to figure out what or how much stuff is
inside so there's nothing in right now

650
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:07,389
inside so there's nothing in right now
 

651
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:09,389
inside so there's nothing in right now
this is off if we put a little bit of

652
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:09,399
this is off if we put a little bit of
 

653
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,009
this is off if we put a little bit of
stuff in this will turn on probably with

654
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:11,019
stuff in this will turn on probably with
 

655
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:13,829
stuff in this will turn on probably with

well there goes my cards so if this is

666
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:26,860
well there goes my cards so if this is
 

667
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,540
well there goes my cards so if this is
at 15 and this gets to 15 15 - 15 0 and

668
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:30,550
at 15 and this gets to 15 15 - 15 0 and
 

669
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,559
at 15 and this gets to 15 15 - 15 0 and
then this retracts aha let's go catch up

670
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:34,569
then this retracts aha let's go catch up
 

671
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:38,309
then this retracts aha let's go catch up
to it so this tunnel here goes down to

00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:38,319
to it so this tunnel here goes down to

the super smeltery building we finished
 

675
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:42,720
the super smeltery building we finished
that just last episode and now we have

676
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:42,730
that just last episode and now we have
 

677
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:46,230
that just last episode and now we have
the the furnace fuel our mushroom farm

thing pretty much all done now this over

680
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:49,209
thing pretty much all done now this over

here is the Nexus by the way that we

682
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:51,309
here is the Nexus by the way that we
 

683
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:54,660
here is the Nexus by the way that we
just passed under oh don't don't bump me

684
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:54,670
just passed under oh don't don't bump me
 

685
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,019
just passed under oh don't don't bump me
back now that doesn't look quite right

686
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:58,029
back now that doesn't look quite right
 

687
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:00,389
back now that doesn't look quite right
it's a visual click temperature okay

688
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
it's a visual click temperature okay
 

689
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,309
it's a visual click temperature okay
we're almost there anyways so this goes

690
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:02,319
we're almost there anyways so this goes
 

691
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:05,730
we're almost there anyways so this goes
up to the internal workings of the super

692
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:05,740
up to the internal workings of the super

unloading go for saf here okay tell you

696
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:17,709
unloading go for saf here okay tell you
 

697
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,110
unloading go for saf here okay tell you
what I'll just put a block here while

698
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,120
what I'll just put a block here while
 

699
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,860
what I'll just put a block here while
while we talk so no creepers sneak in

700
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:21,870
while we talk so no creepers sneak in
 

701
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,929
while we talk so no creepers sneak in
but yeah the micro comes up to here to

702
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:24,939
but yeah the micro comes up to here to
 

703
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:28,379
but yeah the micro comes up to here to
this unloading system goes right into

704
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:28,389
this unloading system goes right into
 

705
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:30,629
this unloading system goes right into
the chest and this chest has hoppers

706
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
the chest and this chest has hoppers
 

707
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,829
the chest and this chest has hoppers
that go to these chests over here

708
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:33,839
that go to these chests over here
 

709
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,329
that go to these chests over here
anyways I think this is going to be the

710
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:36,339
anyways I think this is going to be the
 

711
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:38,910
anyways I think this is going to be the
big moment now guys this is where we try

712
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:38,920
big moment now guys this is where we try
 

713
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,400
big moment now guys this is where we try
it out so we've added a lot of stuff on

714
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:41,410
it out so we've added a lot of stuff on
 

715
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,049
it out so we've added a lot of stuff on
to this thing since the last test

716
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:43,059
to this thing since the last test
 

717
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:45,809
to this thing since the last test
there's a good chance something will go

718
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:45,819
there's a good chance something will go
 

719
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:48,600
there's a good chance something will go
wrong but I don't want anything to go

720
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:48,610
wrong but I don't want anything to go
 

721
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,759
wrong but I don't want anything to go
wrong we wanted to work flawlessly so

722
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:50,769
wrong we wanted to work flawlessly so
 

723
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:54,889
wrong we wanted to work flawlessly so
here we go first step grow the mushrooms

724
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:54,899

 

725
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,579

that's so cool

726
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:56,589
that's so cool
 

727
00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:01,169
that's so cool
oh man it causes so much lag though to

728
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:01,179
oh man it causes so much lag though to
 

729
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:05,429
oh man it causes so much lag though to
see uh-huh I think they're just about

730
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
see uh-huh I think they're just about
 

731
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,760
see uh-huh I think they're just about
all done yeah so we're gonna have to

732
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:08,770
all done yeah so we're gonna have to
 

733
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,559
all done yeah so we're gonna have to
keep that lever flip for quite a while

734
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:10,569
keep that lever flip for quite a while
 

735
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:13,319
keep that lever flip for quite a while
it seems yeah the last thing to do with

736
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:13,329
it seems yeah the last thing to do with
 

737
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,779
it seems yeah the last thing to do with
this farm is to like do something about

738
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:15,789
this farm is to like do something about
 

739
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:18,389
this farm is to like do something about
these loose wires the redstone we want a

740
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:18,399
these loose wires the redstone we want a
 

741
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:20,669
these loose wires the redstone we want a
control panel somewhere that has these

742
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:20,679
control panel somewhere that has these
 

743
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,389
control panel somewhere that has these
in all nicely situated you know we have

744
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:24,399
in all nicely situated you know we have
 

745
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:25,769
in all nicely situated you know we have
three wires that's kind of randomly

746
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:25,779
three wires that's kind of randomly
 

747
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,189
three wires that's kind of randomly
placed right now which isn't so nice

748
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:28,199
placed right now which isn't so nice
 

749
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,859
placed right now which isn't so nice
anyway so we grow the mushrooms now we

750
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:30,869
anyway so we grow the mushrooms now we
 

751
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:35,119
anyway so we grow the mushrooms now we
run along here and I wonder how much

752
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:35,129
run along here and I wonder how much
 

753
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:36,830
run along here and I wonder how much
your ability to take off our axe

754
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:36,840
your ability to take off our axe
 

755
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,430
your ability to take off our axe
probably quite a bit but chop them all

756
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:40,440
probably quite a bit but chop them all
 

757
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,909
probably quite a bit but chop them all
down

758
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:40,919
down
 

759
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,830
down
and this is something we won't have to

760
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:42,840
and this is something we won't have to
 

761
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,570
and this is something we won't have to
do very often I don't because we are

762
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:44,580
do very often I don't because we are
 

763
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,509
do very often I don't because we are
going to get that Sun from this oh I

764
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:50,519
going to get that Sun from this oh I
 

765
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,180
going to get that Sun from this oh I
fall down okay so the finish chopping

766
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,190
fall down okay so the finish chopping
 

767
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,139
fall down okay so the finish chopping
both sides

768
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:54,149
both sides
 

769
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:56,570
both sides
I guess maybe there's another step I

770
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:56,580
I guess maybe there's another step I
 

771
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,519
I guess maybe there's another step I
didn't synched up with this let's sleep

772
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:58,529
didn't synched up with this let's sleep
 

773
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:01,039
didn't synched up with this let's sleep
real quick I think we got to eject the

774
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:01,049
real quick I think we got to eject the
 

775
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:05,599
real quick I think we got to eject the
mushroom stems actually before we do the

776
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:05,609
mushroom stems actually before we do the
 

777
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:08,989
mushroom stems actually before we do the
water so we are going to press this

778
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:08,999
water so we are going to press this
 

779
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:13,129
water so we are going to press this
button this is something I'm very scared

780
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:13,139
button this is something I'm very scared
 

781
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:15,919
button this is something I'm very scared
about I think that works doesn't look

782
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:15,929
about I think that works doesn't look
 

783
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,930
about I think that works doesn't look
like they glitched out and then I have

784
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:17,940
like they glitched out and then I have
 

785
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,340
like they glitched out and then I have
to run down the middle here and get rid

786
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:19,350
to run down the middle here and get rid
 

787
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,580
to run down the middle here and get rid
of all this loose garbage but I leave

788
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:22,590
of all this loose garbage but I leave
 

789
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,450
of all this loose garbage but I leave
these two blocks there Oh some of them

790
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:26,460
these two blocks there Oh some of them
 

791
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,570

gonna be
 

847
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,520
gonna be
few blocks on the on the side here

848
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:43,530
few blocks on the on the side here
 

849
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,850
few blocks on the on the side here
that's fine this is looking very good

see them down there and now we want the
 

855
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,560
see them down there and now we want the
minecart to pick them up through the

856
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:54,570
minecart to pick them up through the
 

857
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,140
minecart to pick them up through the
block that's the next really Oh their D

858
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,150
block that's the next really Oh their D
 

859
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,570
block that's the next really Oh their D
spawning No

860

okay okay we got to go here what's the

862
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:02,970
okay okay we got to go here what's the
 

863
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,530
okay okay we got to go here what's the
minecart one oh it's this button over

864
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:06,540
minecart one oh it's this button over
 

865
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,360
minecart one oh it's this button over
here right okay that'll send the

866
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:08,370
here right okay that'll send the
 

867
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:14,960
here right okay that'll send the
minecarts yeah okay long story short

868
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:14,970
minecarts yeah okay long story short
 

869
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,880
minecarts yeah okay long story short
here this did not work very good all the

870
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:16,890
here this did not work very good all the
 

871
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,000
here this did not work very good all the
minecarts got stuck for some reason

872
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,010
minecarts got stuck for some reason
 

873
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,280
minecarts got stuck for some reason
possibly because I decided to shorten

874
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,290
possibly because I decided to shorten
 

875
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,220
possibly because I decided to shorten
this delay I'm going to extend it again

876
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,230
this delay I'm going to extend it again
 

877
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,080
this delay I'm going to extend it again
ah man

878
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,090
ah man
 

879
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,970
ah man
okay so I just did another full run I

880
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:28,980
okay so I just did another full run I
 

881
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,770
okay so I just did another full run I
grew the mushrooms I chopped them down

882
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:30,780
grew the mushrooms I chopped them down
 

883
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,690
grew the mushrooms I chopped them down
did the water stream thing and then when

884
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:32,700
did the water stream thing and then when
 

885
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,330
did the water stream thing and then when
the minecarts went they got jammed again

886
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:35,340
the minecarts went they got jammed again
 

887
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,310
the minecarts went they got jammed again
like the first one picked up a few

888
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:37,320
like the first one picked up a few
 

889
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,690
like the first one picked up a few
blocks but I don't know what happened

890
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:43,700
blocks but I don't know what happened
 

891
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,280
blocks but I don't know what happened
because I did a dry run with this longer

892
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,290
because I did a dry run with this longer
 

893
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,460
because I did a dry run with this longer
delay and it worked absolutely

894
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:48,470
delay and it worked absolutely
 

895
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,110
delay and it worked absolutely
flawlessly and now that we're actually

896
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
flawlessly and now that we're actually
 

897
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,360
flawlessly and now that we're actually
picking up items it got stuck and I

898
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,370
picking up items it got stuck and I
 

899
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,570
picking up items it got stuck and I
don't know why all right let's run

900
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:56,580
don't know why all right let's run
 

901
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,880
don't know why all right let's run
another test here the one ID I haves

902
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:58,890
another test here the one ID I haves
 

903
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,580
another test here the one ID I haves
maybe mine carts move faster if they

904
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:01,590
maybe mine carts move faster if they
 

905
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,920
maybe mine carts move faster if they
have items inside I know that was true

906
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:03,930
have items inside I know that was true
 

907
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,530
have items inside I know that was true
at one point like when they were when

908
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:06,540
at one point like when they were when
 

909
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,970
at one point like when they were when
they did the SuperSpeed minecart

910
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:07,980
they did the SuperSpeed minecart
 

911
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,090
they did the SuperSpeed minecart
snapshot the more items you had in the

912
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:11,100
snapshot the more items you had in the
 

913
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,950
snapshot the more items you had in the
minecart the faster they moved those

914
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:15,960
minecart the faster they moved those
 

915
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,250
minecart the faster they moved those
look pretty neck-and-neck to me this

916
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:19,260
look pretty neck-and-neck to me this
 

917
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,690
look pretty neck-and-neck to me this
one's not full of stuff though let's put

918
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:20,700
one's not full of stuff though let's put
 

919
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,279
one's not full of stuff though let's put
more in

920
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:24,289

 

921
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:26,930

ya know they seem to go to the same

922
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:26,940
ya know they seem to go to the same
 

923
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,259
ya know they seem to go to the same
speed I don't know why it's Jamie no

924
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:30,269
speed I don't know why it's Jamie no
 

925
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:32,719
speed I don't know why it's Jamie no
clue I haven't changed anything here but

926
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:32,729
clue I haven't changed anything here but
 

927
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:34,489
clue I haven't changed anything here but
we're gonna do another dry run just to

928
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:34,499
we're gonna do another dry run just to
 

929
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:38,299
we're gonna do another dry run just to
see what's going on see if you get the

930
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:38,309
see what's going on see if you get the
 

931
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:45,249
see what's going on see if you get the
jams and if it does why so here we go

932
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:45,259
jams and if it does why so here we go
 

933
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:48,319
jams and if it does why so here we go
like once one of them jams they all Jam

934
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:48,329
like once one of them jams they all Jam
 

935
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:51,109
like once one of them jams they all Jam
that's that's an issue I've noticed but

936
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:51,119
that's that's an issue I've noticed but
 

937
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,609
that's that's an issue I've noticed but
why are they jamming like there's a huge

938
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:52,619
why are they jamming like there's a huge
 

939
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:55,249
why are they jamming like there's a huge
space between them there's no way

940
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:55,259
space between them there's no way
 

941
00:21:55,259 --> 00:22:01,359
space between them there's no way
they're gonna run into each other uh-huh

942
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:01,369
they're gonna run into each other uh-huh
 

943
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:04,639
they're gonna run into each other uh-huh
uh-huh now that it doesn't oh how did it

944
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:04,649
uh-huh now that it doesn't oh how did it
 

945
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:09,369
uh-huh now that it doesn't oh how did it
catch up okay well that's the problem

946
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:09,379
catch up okay well that's the problem
 

947
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:12,169
catch up okay well that's the problem
why did it catch up I don't understand

948
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:12,179
why did it catch up I don't understand
 

949
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:18,680
why did it catch up I don't understand

955
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:29,389
but in the moment it picks them up let's
do another test okay to mine carts both

00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:29,399
do another test okay to mine carts both
 

957
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:31,999
do another test okay to mine carts both
of them empty we'll start them out empty

958
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:32,009
of them empty we'll start them out empty
 

959
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:33,289

then I'll throw something on the track
 

961
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:39,729
then I'll throw something on the track
and see if their distance changes so

962
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:39,739

 

963
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:41,569

know I don't know what I think anymore

982
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:15,049

 

983
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:17,930

like that one was going so fast right

984
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:17,940
like that one was going so fast right
 

985
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,669
like that one was going so fast right
when I collided with other one why does

986
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:19,679
when I collided with other one why does
 

987
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,869
when I collided with other one why does
it get such a speed boost Oh actually we

988
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:23,879
it get such a speed boost Oh actually we
 

989
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:27,889
it get such a speed boost Oh actually we
can do it like this yes okay

990
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:27,899
can do it like this yes okay
 

991
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:29,569
can do it like this yes okay
this will be fine I mean put a repeater

992
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:29,579
this will be fine I mean put a repeater
 

993
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:33,139
this will be fine I mean put a repeater
down here and then we can bridge the gap

994
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:33,149
down here and then we can bridge the gap
 

995
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:35,539
down here and then we can bridge the gap
like this so instead of doing this big

996
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:35,549
like this so instead of doing this big
 

997
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:37,410
like this so instead of doing this big
fancy rail thing like

998
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:37,420
fancy rail thing like
 

999
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,030
fancy rail thing like
are doing or just going to make the rail

1000
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,040
are doing or just going to make the rail
 

1001
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,610
are doing or just going to make the rail
go in a straight line because rails are

1002
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:41,620
go in a straight line because rails are
 

1003
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,140
go in a straight line because rails are
evil today for some reason

1004
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,150
evil today for some reason
 

1005
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,560
evil today for some reason
so we're ripping out this section here

1006
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:46,570
so we're ripping out this section here
 

1007
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,290
so we're ripping out this section here
and it's not going to do the bet the

1008
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:49,300
and it's not going to do the bet the
 

1009
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,700
and it's not going to do the bet the
bouncing back and forth thing anymore

1010
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:50,710
bouncing back and forth thing anymore
 

1011
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,680
bouncing back and forth thing anymore
it's going to go in a straight line so

1012
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:52,690
it's going to go in a straight line so
 

1013
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,040
it's going to go in a straight line so
this gets replaced this gets broken we

1014
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,050
this gets replaced this gets broken we
 

1015
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,880
this gets replaced this gets broken we
bridge the gap here the reason I didn't

1016
00:23:59,880 --> 00:23:59,890
bridge the gap here the reason I didn't
 

1017
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,320
bridge the gap here the reason I didn't
do it like it like that before was

1018
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:01,330
do it like it like that before was
 

1019
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,210
do it like it like that before was
because we had redstone here I thought

1020
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:03,220
because we had redstone here I thought
 

1021
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,090
because we had redstone here I thought
it would be a problem but all we got to

1022
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:06,100
it would be a problem but all we got to
 

1023
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,980
it would be a problem but all we got to
do is break this go down one blocks and

1024
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:07,990
do is break this go down one blocks and
 

1025
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,610
do is break this go down one blocks and
that's it's pretty simple that's not a

1026
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:11,620
that's it's pretty simple that's not a
 

1027
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,330
that's it's pretty simple that's not a
repeater there we go all right guys well

1028
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:15,340
repeater there we go all right guys well
 

1029
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,710
repeater there we go all right guys well
I think we are going to wrap up the

1030

1072
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:04,870
sound deeper and smoother now you sound
 

1073
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:10,410

1075
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,360
kind of uppity and dorky yeah just got
off of a long shift so maybe it's just

1076
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:12,370
off of a long shift so maybe it's just
 

1077
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:17,130
off of a long shift so maybe it's just
me aha so I haven't changed anything

1078

me aha so I haven't changed anything
with the microphone at all so if I sound

1080
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
with the microphone at all so if I sound
 

1081
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,540
with the microphone at all so if I sound
different it's because I'm speaking

1082
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:21,550
different it's because I'm speaking
 

1083
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,480
different it's because I'm speaking
