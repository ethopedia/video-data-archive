00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:32,690
hey this is all got destroyed so I
placed it with ladders and I don't

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:32,700
placed it with ladders and I don't
 

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,529
placed it with ladders and I don't
really have any plans this episode but

12
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:36,539
really have any plans this episode but
 

13
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,450
really have any plans this episode but
at the same time I wanted to get one out

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:38,460
at the same time I wanted to get one out
 

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,139
at the same time I wanted to get one out
because people get antsy if there's not

16
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:42,149
because people get antsy if there's not
 

17
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:50,810
because people get antsy if there's not
one every day so this is new as is

18
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:50,820
one every day so this is new as is
 

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,210
one every day so this is new as is
playing around with mine carts and I

20
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:53,220
playing around with mine carts and I
 

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,910
playing around with mine carts and I
think I invented a new type of booster

22
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920

 

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,460

not a very good booster but it and I

24
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:01,470
not a very good booster but it and I
 

25
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,290
not a very good booster but it and I
don't know anyone watch you use it but

26
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,300
don't know anyone watch you use it but
 

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,789
don't know anyone watch you use it but
it's kind of an interesting thing this

28
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:07,799
it's kind of an interesting thing this
 

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,920
it's kind of an interesting thing this
goes on forever because it's uh goes

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:12,930
goes on forever because it's uh goes
 

31
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:19,279
goes on forever because it's uh goes
down a down slope at every corner and if

32
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:19,289
down a down slope at every corner and if
 

33
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:22,370
down a down slope at every corner and if
you hop in it it speeds up to the

34
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:22,380
you hop in it it speeds up to the
 

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,370
you hop in it it speeds up to the
maximum speed because it's like you're

36
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:25,380
maximum speed because it's like you're
 

37
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,710
maximum speed because it's like you're
going downhill

38
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:29,720

 

39
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,610

so I think you could hook up a track

40
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:34,620
so I think you could hook up a track
 

41
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,050
so I think you could hook up a track
junction to send it out onto a track and

42
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:39,060
junction to send it out onto a track and
 

43
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,080
junction to send it out onto a track and
it's kind of like a booster without

44
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,090
it's kind of like a booster without
 

45
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,610
it's kind of like a booster without
needing another minecart to boost it

46
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:45,620

 

47
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:53,540

kind of weird I thought it's actually

48
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:53,550
kind of weird I thought it's actually
 

49
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:59,010
kind of weird I thought it's actually
useful for anything

50
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,020

 

51
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:10,030

well it does make me laugh and I was

52
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,040
well it does make me laugh and I was
 

53
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,830
well it does make me laugh and I was
doing a test over here I needed to know

54
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:14,840
doing a test over here I needed to know
 

55
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,010
doing a test over here I needed to know
what happens if you try to stack my

56
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,020
what happens if you try to stack my
 

57
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,540
what happens if you try to stack my
carts like the PEZ dispenser method if

58
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:22,550
carts like the PEZ dispenser method if
 

59
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,010
carts like the PEZ dispenser method if
there's mobs inside try show you guys

60
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,020
there's mobs inside try show you guys
 

61
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,990
there's mobs inside try show you guys
and go too easy into pieces skeleton

62
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
and go too easy into pieces skeleton
 

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:50,470
and go too easy into pieces skeleton
comes out here of course um I hate doing

64
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
comes out here of course um I hate doing
 

65
00:02:50,480 --> 00:03:03,180
comes out here of course um I hate doing
that but oops also I've spent some time

66
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,190
that but oops also I've spent some time
 

67
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,210
that but oops also I've spent some time
down below at the mob spawning grounds

68
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:07,220
down below at the mob spawning grounds
 

69
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,000
down below at the mob spawning grounds
and I've been making it bigger and also

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,010
and I've been making it bigger and also
 

71
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,470
and I've been making it bigger and also
I've made a few adjustments down there

72
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:11,480
I've made a few adjustments down there
 

73
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,140
I've made a few adjustments down there
to make it more efficient and I'll

74
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,150
to make it more efficient and I'll
 

75
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,790
to make it more efficient and I'll
probably show you guys that this episode

76
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:15,800
probably show you guys that this episode
 

77
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,190
probably show you guys that this episode
- I still haven't quite figure out how

78
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
- I still haven't quite figure out how
 

79
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,880
- I still haven't quite figure out how
to how I want to set up our station here

80
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:26,890
to how I want to set up our station here
 

81
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,500
to how I want to set up our station here
is really what I'm building here is a

82
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:31,510
is really what I'm building here is a
 

83
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,630
is really what I'm building here is a
minecart station for it for the mobs

84
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
minecart station for it for the mobs
 

85
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,650
minecart station for it for the mobs
really but instead of only handling like

86
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:41,660
really but instead of only handling like
 

87
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,130
really but instead of only handling like
one player it's like handling hundreds

88
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,140
one player it's like handling hundreds
 

89
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,940
one player it's like handling hundreds
because I have I think up to 200 mobs at

90
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:48,950
because I have I think up to 200 mobs at
 

91
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,699
because I have I think up to 200 mobs at
a time

92
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:51,709

 

93
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,050

so it's going to require quite a bit of

94
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,060
so it's going to require quite a bit of
 

95
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:04,970
so it's going to require quite a bit of
planning the gnosis is sped up quite a

96
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:04,980
planning the gnosis is sped up quite a
 

97
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:30,310
planning the gnosis is sped up quite a
bit now brilliant skeletons here no good

98
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
bit now brilliant skeletons here no good
 

99
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,320
bit now brilliant skeletons here no good
alright I'm gonna stop in I'll show it

100
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,330
alright I'm gonna stop in I'll show it
 

101
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,969
alright I'm gonna stop in I'll show it
once I get it going good

102
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:36,979

 

103
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:38,930

all right I think it's gonna look this

104
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:38,940
all right I think it's gonna look this
 

105
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:51,140
all right I think it's gonna look this
time so yeah I guess that they would

106
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,150
time so yeah I guess that they would
 

107
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,390
time so yeah I guess that they would
suffocate if you stack one on top but I

108
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:53,400
suffocate if you stack one on top but I
 

109
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,890
suffocate if you stack one on top but I
guess they don't it just goes right on

110
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:57,900
guess they don't it just goes right on
 

111
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,840
guess they don't it just goes right on
top the head of the mob below

112
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:01,850
top the head of the mob below
 

113
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,410
top the head of the mob below
so this guy's really like two blocks I I

114
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:05,420
so this guy's really like two blocks I I
 

115
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:13,930
so this guy's really like two blocks I I
think so you can stack them like that

116
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:13,940
think so you can stack them like that
 

117
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,870
think so you can stack them like that
it just takes up two spots and if the

118
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:17,880
it just takes up two spots and if the
 

119
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:25,810
it just takes up two spots and if the
guy blow moves out of the way or dies

120
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:25,820

 

121
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:36,800

then the next cart falls down so kinda

122
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:36,810
then the next cart falls down so kinda
 

123
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,410
then the next cart falls down so kinda
interesting it was important that I

124
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:39,420
interesting it was important that I
 

125
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,610
interesting it was important that I
figured that out because I might stack

126
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:43,620
figured that out because I might stack
 

127
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:50,330
figured that out because I might stack
you guys to save space I'm not sure or I

128
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:50,340
you guys to save space I'm not sure or I
 

129
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,380
you guys to save space I'm not sure or I
might send them into the water somehow

130
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:53,390
might send them into the water somehow
 

131
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:59,480
might send them into the water somehow
into water streams inside charts not

132
00:05:59,480 --> 00:05:59,490
into water streams inside charts not
 

133
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,010
into water streams inside charts not
really sure something else I've been

134
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,020
really sure something else I've been
 

135
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,050
really sure something else I've been
playing around with is our panel here

136
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:08,060
playing around with is our panel here
 

137
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,370
playing around with is our panel here
just trying to figure out some way to

138
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:10,380
just trying to figure out some way to
 

139
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,570
just trying to figure out some way to
have a button to shoot out one and I'll

140
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:14,580
have a button to shoot out one and I'll
 

141
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,370
have a button to shoot out one and I'll
leave her above to trigger a clock to

142
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:19,380
leave her above to trigger a clock to
 

143
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:30,320
leave her above to trigger a clock to
shoot out lots at a time and pretty much

144
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,330
shoot out lots at a time and pretty much
 

145
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:40,540
shoot out lots at a time and pretty much
figured out it's not going to work

146
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:40,550

 

147
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:55,020

because

148
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,030

 

149
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:00,960

know what I'm saying yes I got a 5

150
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:00,970
know what I'm saying yes I got a 5
 

151
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,360
know what I'm saying yes I got a 5
o'clock here with a wire long and it

152
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,370
o'clock here with a wire long and it
 

153
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:12,090
o'clock here with a wire long and it
sends power to all five of these but the

154
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,100
sends power to all five of these but the
 

155
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,690
sends power to all five of these but the
problem is if so you could override it

156
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:15,700
problem is if so you could override it
 

157
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,070
problem is if so you could override it
by having a lever and you would have

158
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
by having a lever and you would have
 

159
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,470
by having a lever and you would have
that down to shut it off and then if you

160
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:22,480
that down to shut it off and then if you
 

161
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,000
that down to shut it off and then if you
wanted lots to come out you flick that

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,010
wanted lots to come out you flick that
 

163
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,850
wanted lots to come out you flick that
up and keep shooting but the problem

164
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:29,860
up and keep shooting but the problem
 

165
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,760
up and keep shooting but the problem
with that idea is you would need it

166
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:32,770
with that idea is you would need it
 

167
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:40,080
with that idea is you would need it
wouldn't work because the this lever

168
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,090
wouldn't work because the this lever
 

169
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,850
wouldn't work because the this lever
would be down on all of them so it would

170
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:41,860
would be down on all of them so it would
 

171
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:49,650
would be down on all of them so it would
always be overridden if that makes sense

172
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:49,660
always be overridden if that makes sense
 

173
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,280
always be overridden if that makes sense
so you would need to have some sort of

174
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,290
so you would need to have some sort of
 

175
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:58,730
so you would need to have some sort of
an end date on every one of them and

176
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:58,740
an end date on every one of them and
 

177
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,200
an end date on every one of them and
pretty sure I could do that pretty

178
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,210
pretty sure I could do that pretty
 

179
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:07,560
pretty sure I could do that pretty
compact but the other issue is see what

180
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:07,570
compact but the other issue is see what
 

181
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,719
compact but the other issue is see what
this button is doing it's very important

182
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:09,729
this button is doing it's very important
 

183
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:12,210
this button is doing it's very important
that only one comes out that's what I

184
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:12,220
that only one comes out that's what I
 

185
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,100
that only one comes out that's what I
want but the thing is if there's power

186
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,110
want but the thing is if there's power
 

187
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,200
want but the thing is if there's power
anywhere near a dispenser pressing a

188
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,210
anywhere near a dispenser pressing a
 

189
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:29,790
anywhere near a dispenser pressing a
button makes to come up so I'm probably

190
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:29,800
button makes to come up so I'm probably
 

191
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,170
button makes to come up so I'm probably
just going to keep it really simple and

192
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:31,180
just going to keep it really simple and
 

193
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,219
just going to keep it really simple and
just have one button like I originally

194
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:35,229
just have one button like I originally
 

195
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,850
just have one button like I originally
was planning and not have a 5 o'clock or

196
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:38,860
was planning and not have a 5 o'clock or
 

197
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,270
was planning and not have a 5 o'clock or
pulse or anything like that because it

198
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:42,280
pulse or anything like that because it
 

199
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,600
pulse or anything like that because it
just complicates things too much and

200
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:45,610
just complicates things too much and
 

201
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,170
just complicates things too much and
there's no good way of doing it without

202
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:48,180
there's no good way of doing it without
 

203
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,560
there's no good way of doing it without
using up a lot of space that I can think

204
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:52,570
using up a lot of space that I can think
 

205
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,770
using up a lot of space that I can think
of

206
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:55,780

 

207
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:02,050

so next thing we should do said I was

208
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,060
so next thing we should do said I was
 

209
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,640
so next thing we should do said I was
going to show you the mob grounds and it

210
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:03,650
going to show you the mob grounds and it
 

211
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:14,310
going to show you the mob grounds and it
changes this is my total TNT stock oh

212
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320

 

213
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,300

yeah another thing I did

214
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:16,310
yeah another thing I did
 

215
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:23,140
yeah another thing I did
off-camera I found I found a tape system

216
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,150
off-camera I found I found a tape system
 

217
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,780
off-camera I found I found a tape system
that I went exploring I was going to

218
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:25,790
that I went exploring I was going to
 

219
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,350
that I went exploring I was going to
record it but it ended up taking about

220
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,360
record it but it ended up taking about
 

221
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,630
record it but it ended up taking about
three hours and I found probably uh

222
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
three hours and I found probably uh
 

223
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,310
three hours and I found probably uh
about seven stacks of iron and tons of

224
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:39,320
about seven stacks of iron and tons of
 

225
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,290
about seven stacks of iron and tons of
redstone like twelve diamonds and

226
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:43,300
redstone like twelve diamonds and
 

227
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,720
redstone like twelve diamonds and
probably oh I don't know fifteen stacks

228
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:46,730
probably oh I don't know fifteen stacks
 

229
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:51,280
probably oh I don't know fifteen stacks
of coal and two stacks of gold and it's

230
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,290
of coal and two stacks of gold and it's
 

231
00:09:51,290 --> 00:10:00,910
of coal and two stacks of gold and it's
a huge cave so yeah I've been making

232
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:00,920
a huge cave so yeah I've been making
 

233
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,070
a huge cave so yeah I've been making
this bigger there's probably you

234
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,080
this bigger there's probably you
 

235
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,080
this bigger there's probably you
probably can't see it but I think I got

236
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,090
probably can't see it but I think I got
 

237
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,830
probably can't see it but I think I got
12 or 13 pads now before I only had

238
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:08,840
12 or 13 pads now before I only had
 

239
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,320
12 or 13 pads now before I only had
eight as going to ask you guys opinion

240
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,330
eight as going to ask you guys opinion
 

241
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,070
eight as going to ask you guys opinion
on something

242
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:15,080
on something
 

243
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,520
on something
I was thinking of abandoning this road

244
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:18,530
I was thinking of abandoning this road
 

245
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,980
I was thinking of abandoning this road
and building another one above-ground I

246
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:22,990
and building another one above-ground I
 

247
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:32,940
and building another one above-ground I
wanted to try out a few new designs oh

248
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:32,950

 

249
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,390

and the reason for that is because this

250
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:37,400
and the reason for that is because this
 

251
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,210
and the reason for that is because this
is kind of a prime location for the mob

252
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,220
is kind of a prime location for the mob
 

253
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,450
is kind of a prime location for the mob
spawning grounds I want to put pads in

254
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:43,460
spawning grounds I want to put pads in
 

255
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,780
spawning grounds I want to put pads in
here and it just so happens the road is

256
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:46,790
here and it just so happens the road is
 

257
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:53,320
here and it just so happens the road is
the exact same height as these pads so

258
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,330
the exact same height as these pads so
 

259
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,650
the exact same height as these pads so
it's in the way and I kind of want to

260
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:56,660
it's in the way and I kind of want to
 

261
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,980
it's in the way and I kind of want to
get rid of it and reuse this area for

262
00:10:59,980 --> 00:10:59,990
get rid of it and reuse this area for
 

263
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,710
get rid of it and reuse this area for
the spawning grounds

264
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:03,720

 

265
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:11,220

and then try build up roads at the

266
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,230
and then try build up roads at the
 

267
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,870
and then try build up roads at the
surface because it will be easier and

268
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
surface because it will be easier and
 

269
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,270
surface because it will be easier and
faster anyway the only reason I was

270
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:18,280
faster anyway the only reason I was
 

271
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,530
faster anyway the only reason I was
building one down here is because I

272
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:19,540
building one down here is because I
 

273
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,810
building one down here is because I
needed cobblestone once I started this

274
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:21,820
needed cobblestone once I started this
 

275
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,260
needed cobblestone once I started this
world but now I have tons there's no

276
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,270
world but now I have tons there's no
 

277
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:33,480
world but now I have tons there's no
points going slowly underground and the

278
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:33,490
points going slowly underground and the
 

279
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,250
points going slowly underground and the
way I've been making up these mob pads

280
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:35,260
way I've been making up these mob pads
 

281
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:41,880
way I've been making up these mob pads
bigger is basically now I'm finding four

282
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:41,890
bigger is basically now I'm finding four
 

283
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:48,300
bigger is basically now I'm finding four
squares in a skip two blocks four

284
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,310
squares in a skip two blocks four
 

285
00:11:48,310 --> 00:12:03,750
squares in a skip two blocks four
squares in kind of like this some of my

286
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
squares in kind of like this some of my
 

287
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,690
squares in kind of like this some of my
comments are suggested that there's a

288
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:05,700
comments are suggested that there's a
 

289
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,050
comments are suggested that there's a
more efficient ways of using the TNT and

290
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,060
more efficient ways of using the TNT and
 

291
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:33,390
more efficient ways of using the TNT and
they are right basically if you have air

292
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:33,400
they are right basically if you have air
 

293
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,220
they are right basically if you have air
spaces around the TNT it will blow up

294
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:35,230
spaces around the TNT it will blow up
 

295
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:42,600
spaces around the TNT it will blow up
more area when it blows up and so

296
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:42,610
more area when it blows up and so
 

297
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,520
more area when it blows up and so
digging for blocks is pretty easy and

298
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:44,530
digging for blocks is pretty easy and
 

299
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,060
digging for blocks is pretty easy and
then what I do is I just place it three

300
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,070
then what I do is I just place it three
 

301
00:12:48,070 --> 00:13:01,050
then what I do is I just place it three
blocks in

302
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,060

 

303
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:23,010

all along and then you just run across

304
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,020

 

305
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,900

pretty cool only downside is it blows up

306
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:28,910
pretty cool only downside is it blows up
 

307
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,730
pretty cool only downside is it blows up
some of your iron and coal but not a big

308
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:33,740
some of your iron and coal but not a big
 

309
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,880
some of your iron and coal but not a big
deal

310
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:35,890
deal
 

311
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,360
deal
saves a lot of time and then you just

312
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,370
saves a lot of time and then you just
 

313
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:46,990
saves a lot of time and then you just
clean it up a bit so every TT that way

314
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,000
clean it up a bit so every TT that way
 

315
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,700
clean it up a bit so every TT that way
pretty much blows out 40 blocks which

316
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:51,710
pretty much blows out 40 blocks which
 

317
00:13:51,710 --> 00:14:09,370
pretty much blows out 40 blocks which
saves a lot of time and wanted to show

318
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:09,380
saves a lot of time and wanted to show
 

319
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,890
saves a lot of time and wanted to show
my new method of doing the water streams

320
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:13,900

 

321
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,300

so the issue with them right now is I

322
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,310
so the issue with them right now is I
 

323
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:22,720
so the issue with them right now is I
have a these gaps in between I tried

324
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:22,730
have a these gaps in between I tried
 

325
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,330
have a these gaps in between I tried
going over before but then the mobs were

326
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:25,340
going over before but then the mobs were
 

327
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:30,670
going over before but then the mobs were
going back on the pads and then some

328
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:30,680
going back on the pads and then some
 

329
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,560
going back on the pads and then some
people suggested I should take one block

330
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:32,570
people suggested I should take one block
 

331
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:38,020
people suggested I should take one block
lower ah that would work but it requires

332
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,030
lower ah that would work but it requires
 

333
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:46,660
lower ah that would work but it requires
a lot more digging so the way I

334
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:46,670
a lot more digging so the way I
 

335
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:52,310
a lot more digging so the way I
decide to do it now I use signs instead

336
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
decide to do it now I use signs instead
 

337
00:14:52,320 --> 00:15:09,980
decide to do it now I use signs instead
of pressure plates of course gives me

338
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:09,990
of pressure plates of course gives me
 

339
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:19,730
of pressure plates of course gives me
the feather and same positioning two

340
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:19,740
the feather and same positioning two
 

341
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,510
the feather and same positioning two
blocks from these edges what I do is I

342
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:25,520
blocks from these edges what I do is I
 

343
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,860
blocks from these edges what I do is I
have a sign where the pressure plates

344
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:27,870
have a sign where the pressure plates
 

345
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:36,260
have a sign where the pressure plates
were Oh actually gay yeah I forgot

346
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,270
were Oh actually gay yeah I forgot
 

347
00:15:36,270 --> 00:16:00,030
were Oh actually gay yeah I forgot
something I need some stairs for this

348
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,040

 

349
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:11,020

and so what you do is get the pressure

350
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,030
and so what you do is get the pressure
 

351
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,350
and so what you do is get the pressure
plates dug out and you dig down one

352
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:14,360
plates dug out and you dig down one
 

353
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,630
plates dug out and you dig down one
block and you dig down one block this

354
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:19,640
block and you dig down one block this
 

355
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:30,190
block and you dig down one block this
way one block this way and then you have

356
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:30,200
way one block this way and then you have
 

357
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,040
way one block this way and then you have
still water here

358
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,050
still water here
 

359
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,830
still water here
so that's bad then what you do is you

360
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:35,840
so that's bad then what you do is you
 

361
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,780
so that's bad then what you do is you
place two stairs here and it creates the

362
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:40,790
place two stairs here and it creates the
 

363
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:47,470
place two stairs here and it creates the
flow again and so the mobs just keep

364
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:47,480
flow again and so the mobs just keep
 

365
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,140
flow again and so the mobs just keep
going through and they have pushed it up

366
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,150
going through and they have pushed it up
 

367
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,810
going through and they have pushed it up
the stairs and it's like there's no

368
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:52,820
the stairs and it's like there's no
 

369
00:16:52,820 --> 00:17:02,530
the stairs and it's like there's no
space so it's a better way of doing it I

370
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:02,540
space so it's a better way of doing it I
 

371
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,510
space so it's a better way of doing it I
think I noticed the quite a bit of

372
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
think I noticed the quite a bit of
 

373
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,300
think I noticed the quite a bit of
improvement right after I changed a lot

374
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,310
improvement right after I changed a lot
 

375
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:25,809
improvement right after I changed a lot
of it

376
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:25,819

 

377
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:29,540

so yeah I'm going to keep building this

378
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:29,550
so yeah I'm going to keep building this
 

379
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,730
so yeah I'm going to keep building this
bigger this area and mobs will spawn

380
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:31,740
bigger this area and mobs will spawn
 

381
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:39,040
bigger this area and mobs will spawn
faster and I changed the water at the

382
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,050
faster and I changed the water at the
 

383
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:47,690
faster and I changed the water at the
start here a bit too so unless you guys

384
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:47,700
start here a bit too so unless you guys
 

385
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,430
start here a bit too so unless you guys
oh yeah so unless you guys say don't

386
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
oh yeah so unless you guys say don't
 

387
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,290
oh yeah so unless you guys say don't
tear this out I'm probably going to and

388
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:54,300
tear this out I'm probably going to and
 

389
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:00,230
tear this out I'm probably going to and
just build it at the surface

390
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240

 

391
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,910

a guy named uh oxys a youtuber has been

392
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:04,920
a guy named uh oxys a youtuber has been
 

393
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,750
a guy named uh oxys a youtuber has been
working on eats road designs and I kind

394
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:08,760
working on eats road designs and I kind
 

395
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,160
working on eats road designs and I kind
of wanted to try out some of his new

396
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,170
of wanted to try out some of his new
 

397
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:25,120
of wanted to try out some of his new
roads so the way I have the water now um

398
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,130

 

399
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:30,710

don't think this these this water was

400
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
don't think this these this water was
 

401
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:38,270
don't think this these this water was
here before so it all merges together

402
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,280
here before so it all merges together
 

403
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,240
here before so it all merges together
here these signs keep the water from

404
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,250
here these signs keep the water from
 

405
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,010
here these signs keep the water from
flowing back toward me there's no dead

406
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,020
flowing back toward me there's no dead
 

407
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:52,280
flowing back toward me there's no dead
spots anymore I still have the angled

408
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,290
spots anymore I still have the angled
 

409
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,299
spots anymore I still have the angled
thing here to keep the tall mobs from

410
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:56,309
thing here to keep the tall mobs from
 

411
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,520
thing here to keep the tall mobs from
getting stuck over here you get pushed

412
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:58,530
getting stuck over here you get pushed
 

413
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:05,000
getting stuck over here you get pushed
to the left and everything else is

414
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,010
to the left and everything else is
 

415
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,250
to the left and everything else is
pretty much the same

416
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:10,260

 

417
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:16,080

so soon as mobs get passed through here

418
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,090
so soon as mobs get passed through here
 

419
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,820
so soon as mobs get passed through here
they're pretty much forced all the way

420
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:17,830
they're pretty much forced all the way
 

421
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,510
they're pretty much forced all the way
through because they can't jump which

422
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
through because they can't jump which
 

423
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:28,770
through because they can't jump which
means they can't go back you can keep a

424
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:28,780
means they can't go back you can keep a
 

425
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,500
means they can't go back you can keep a
mob from jumping he won't be able to go

426
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:31,510
mob from jumping he won't be able to go
 

427
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,120
mob from jumping he won't be able to go
against the stream like I'm doing right

428
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,130
against the stream like I'm doing right
 

429
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:45,210
against the stream like I'm doing right
now but this mob system is far from

430
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:45,220
now but this mob system is far from
 

431
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,649
now but this mob system is far from
perfect because I still have issues with

432
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:49,659
perfect because I still have issues with
 

433
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:52,740
perfect because I still have issues with
spiders climbing around in here even

434
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:52,750
spiders climbing around in here even
 

435
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,360
spiders climbing around in here even
after they fall in the water can Alice

436
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:54,370
after they fall in the water can Alice
 

437
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:59,549
after they fall in the water can Alice
Li can climb out if they want but it

438
00:19:59,549 --> 00:19:59,559
Li can climb out if they want but it
 

439
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:04,080
Li can climb out if they want but it
does pretty good with spiders and like

440
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,090
does pretty good with spiders and like
 

441
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,460
does pretty good with spiders and like
I've said before I think the main

442
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:08,470
I've said before I think the main
 

443
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,370
I've said before I think the main
purpose of this mob system is control

444
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:11,380
purpose of this mob system is control
 

445
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,870
purpose of this mob system is control
it's not yet as many items as possible

446
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:14,880
it's not yet as many items as possible
 

447
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,760
it's not yet as many items as possible
there are much better designs for doing

448
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:17,770
there are much better designs for doing
 

449
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,180
there are much better designs for doing
that you should be trying to kill the

450
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,190
that you should be trying to kill the
 

451
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,600
that you should be trying to kill the
mobs as fast as possible if you want a

452
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:23,610
mobs as fast as possible if you want a
 

453
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:30,990
mobs as fast as possible if you want a
mob system solely for items the goal

454
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,000
mob system solely for items the goal
 

455
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,310
mob system solely for items the goal
this is control so I can kill them if I

456
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,320
this is control so I can kill them if I
 

457
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,970
this is control so I can kill them if I
want I can send them to other places if

458
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:38,980
want I can send them to other places if
 

459
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,510
want I can send them to other places if
I want I can sort them if I want that's

460
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:42,520
I want I can sort them if I want that's
 

461
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:53,820
I want I can sort them if I want that's
kind of what I'm trying to do so what

462
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:53,830
kind of what I'm trying to do so what
 

463
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,810
kind of what I'm trying to do so what
should we do now

464
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:54,820
should we do now
 

465
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,180
should we do now
I'm going to check the time and maybe

466
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,190
I'm going to check the time and maybe
 

467
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:02,200
I'm going to check the time and maybe
figure out something fun we can do

468
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,210

 

469
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,180

Wow yes it's been like 20 minutes

470
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,190
Wow yes it's been like 20 minutes
 

471
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:19,619
Wow yes it's been like 20 minutes
already yes we should should end it here

472
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:19,629

 

473
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:23,049

thanks for watching
