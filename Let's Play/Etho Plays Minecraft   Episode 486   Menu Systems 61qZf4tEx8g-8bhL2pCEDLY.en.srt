a change with pistons
 

25
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,390
a change with pistons
where they will actually suffocate a mob

26
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
where they will actually suffocate a mob

00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
out the
 

37
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,790
out the
the pistons with stained glass

38
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
the pistons with stained glass
 

39
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,510
the pistons with stained glass
just just go in please there we go um

40
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
just just go in please there we go um
 

41
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,950
just just go in please there we go um
and then

42
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
and then
 

43
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,029
and then
to do this we can't just place the block

44
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
to do this we can't just place the block
 

45
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,029
to do this we can't just place the block
where we want it because the sheep is in

46
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
where we want it because the sheep is in
 

47
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:49,910
where we want it because the sheep is in
the way

48
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
the way
 

49
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,110
the way
so we have to do a bit of a puzzle here

50
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
so we have to do a bit of a puzzle here
 

51
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,270
so we have to do a bit of a puzzle here
i think we want this facing down or

52
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
i think we want this facing down or
 

53
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,790
i think we want this facing down or
facing up

54
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
facing up
 

55
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,069
facing up
we grab a regular piston face that down

56
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
we grab a regular piston face that down
 

57
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,110
we grab a regular piston face that down
and we pull that

58
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
and we pull that
 

59
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,190
and we pull that
put another one there and then

60
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
put another one there and then
 

61
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,230
put another one there and then
push the glass block down yep

62
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
push the glass block down yep
 

63
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,590
push the glass block down yep
and then put our lamp back yes

64
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
and then put our lamp back yes
 

65
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,310
and then put our lamp back yes
and that is how we do it all right so

66
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
and that is how we do it all right so
 

67
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,070
and that is how we do it all right so
for today's episode guys i thought we

68
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
for today's episode guys i thought we
 

69
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,710
for today's episode guys i thought we
would check out a new concept here

70
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
would check out a new concept here
 

71
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,390
would check out a new concept here
uh remember i teased we were gonna look

72
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
uh remember i teased we were gonna look
 

73
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,390
uh remember i teased we were gonna look
at a new idea

74
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
at a new idea
 

75
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,310
at a new idea
and you all hated me for it last episode

76
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
and you all hated me for it last episode
 

77

and you all hated me for it last episode
well today's the day

78
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
well today's the day
 

79
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,390
well today's the day
uh we're gonna be looking into the idea

80
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
uh we're gonna be looking into the idea
 

81
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,190
uh we're gonna be looking into the idea
of using menus and control panels

82
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
of using menus and control panels
 

83
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,910
of using menus and control panels
in minecraft now i know what you're

84
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
in minecraft now i know what you're
 

85
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,670
in minecraft now i know what you're
thinking doesn't sound very interesting

86
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
thinking doesn't sound very interesting
 

87
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,030
thinking doesn't sound very interesting
but it is a cool idea

88
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
but it is a cool idea
 

89
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,830
but it is a cool idea
trust me on it it is something we have

90
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
trust me on it it is something we have
 

91
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,350
trust me on it it is something we have
kind of done already

92
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
kind of done already
 

93
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,749
kind of done already
in the past year like for example i

94
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
in the past year like for example i
 

95
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,670
in the past year like for example i
think the first menu i have made in

96
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
think the first menu i have made in
 

97
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,749
think the first menu i have made in
minecraft is this

98
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
minecraft is this
 

99
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,990
minecraft is this
menu system at the nexus here so this is

100
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
menu system at the nexus here so this is
 

101
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,149
menu system at the nexus here so this is
an information menu all it does is give

102
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
an information menu all it does is give
 

103
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,350
an information menu all it does is give
us information

104
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
us information
 

105
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,670
us information
doesn't do anything else so when we

106
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
doesn't do anything else so when we
 

107
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,590
doesn't do anything else so when we
hover over one of these uh

108
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
hover over one of these uh
 

109
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,469
hover over one of these uh
items it gives us the code the number

110
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
items it gives us the code the number
 

111
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,109
items it gives us the code the number
for it there

112
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
for it there
 

113
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,990
for it there
so for example if we want to get stone

114
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
so for example if we want to get stone
 

115
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,309
so for example if we want to get stone
brick out of the system that's bd

116
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
brick out of the system that's bd
 

117
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,510
brick out of the system that's bd
then we hit bd on on our thing here

118
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
then we hit bd on on our thing here
 

119
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,830
then we hit bd on on our thing here
and the menu gives us this information

120
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
and the menu gives us this information
 

121
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,830
and the menu gives us this information
so it's a handy thing to have here i use

122
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
so it's a handy thing to have here i use
 

123
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,589
so it's a handy thing to have here i use
it all the time

124
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
it all the time
 

125
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,030
it all the time
then we just flip the lever and we'll

126
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
then we just flip the lever and we'll
 

127
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,710
then we just flip the lever and we'll
get the stone brick

128
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
get the stone brick
 

129
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,110
get the stone brick
in here eventually why is there a button

130
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
in here eventually why is there a button
 

131
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,460
in here eventually why is there a button
in there

132
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:25,470

 

133
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,589

[Laughter]

134
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
[Laughter]
 

135
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,710
[Laughter]
i don't even know how that got there oh

136
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
i don't even know how that got there oh
 

137
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,030
i don't even know how that got there oh
uh oh

138
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
uh oh
 

139
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,470
uh oh
oh i bet you the codes reversed uh what

140
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
oh i bet you the codes reversed uh what
 

141
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,990
oh i bet you the codes reversed uh what
is uh what is that

142
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
is uh what is that
 

143
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,869
is uh what is that
db yeah bd db i put in backwards

144
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
db yeah bd db i put in backwards
 

145
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,030
db yeah bd db i put in backwards
anyways let's look at another example of

146
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
anyways let's look at another example of
 

147
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,150
anyways let's look at another example of
a menu or a control panel system

148
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
a menu or a control panel system
 

149
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,550
a menu or a control panel system
we did before here the pixel has a

150
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
we did before here the pixel has a
 

151
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,589
we did before here the pixel has a
really cool one

152
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
really cool one
 

153
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,790
really cool one
if i do say so myself uh not only is

154
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
if i do say so myself uh not only is
 

155
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,949
if i do say so myself uh not only is
this like an information menu

156
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
this like an information menu
 

157
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,790
this like an information menu
it actually is interactive you can make

158
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
it actually is interactive you can make
 

159
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,869
it actually is interactive you can make
choices with it so

160
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
choices with it so
 

161
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,350
choices with it so
uh let's say for example we want to look

162
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
uh let's say for example we want to look
 

163
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,030
uh let's say for example we want to look
for sand i've shown this before

164
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
for sand i've shown this before
 

165
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,550
for sand i've shown this before
several times but we'll do it one more

166
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
several times but we'll do it one more
 

167
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,390
several times but we'll do it one more
time um

168
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
time um
 

169
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,390
time um
so we got sand in our menu here to make

170
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
so we got sand in our menu here to make
 

171
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,430
so we got sand in our menu here to make
our choice we hover

172
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
our choice we hover
 

173
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,630
our choice we hover
over it with our mouse press q

174
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
over it with our mouse press q
 

175
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,070
over it with our mouse press q
and that makes the selection so it

176
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
and that makes the selection so it
 

177
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,990
and that makes the selection so it
shoots the sand out of our inventory

178
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
shoots the sand out of our inventory
 

179
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,110
shoots the sand out of our inventory
here goes into the hopper and then that

180
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
here goes into the hopper and then that
 

181
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,030
here goes into the hopper and then that
replaces the item filter with a piece of

182
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
replaces the item filter with a piece of
 

183
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,990
replaces the item filter with a piece of
sand

184
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
sand
 

185
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,589
sand
and then any shulker boxes that have

186
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
and then any shulker boxes that have
 

187
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,509
and then any shulker boxes that have
sand inside get matched up with that

188
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
sand inside get matched up with that
 

189
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,830
sand inside get matched up with that
and they show up here is the way this

190
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
and they show up here is the way this
 

191
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,949
and they show up here is the way this
works

192
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
works
 

193
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,030
works
so this is a menu that is actually

194
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
so this is a menu that is actually
 

195
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,949
so this is a menu that is actually
interactive that's the key i'm trying to

196
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
interactive that's the key i'm trying to
 

197
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,789
interactive that's the key i'm trying to
drive home here so there's different

198
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
drive home here so there's different
 

199
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,390
drive home here so there's different
types of menus

200
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
types of menus
 

201
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,750
types of menus
and you can make them do a lot of

202
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
and you can make them do a lot of
 

203
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,309
and you can make them do a lot of
different things yeah so last episode i

204
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
different things yeah so last episode i
 

205
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,070
different things yeah so last episode i
kind of hinted i would want to use this

206
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
kind of hinted i would want to use this
 

207
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,309
kind of hinted i would want to use this
idea for a future base

208
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
idea for a future base
 

209
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,990
idea for a future base
so let me try explain that a little bit

210
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
so let me try explain that a little bit
 

211
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,430
so let me try explain that a little bit
better if i can

212
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
better if i can
 

213
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,070
better if i can
like even even in chocolate island days

214
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
like even even in chocolate island days
 

215
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,789
like even even in chocolate island days
i had a central control room

216
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
i had a central control room
 

217
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,630
i had a central control room
there was like six levers in it i could

218
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
there was like six levers in it i could
 

219
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,710
there was like six levers in it i could
turn the mob system on and off i could

220
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
turn the mob system on and off i could
 

221
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,030
turn the mob system on and off i could
choose to sort spiders and i think there

222
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
choose to sort spiders and i think there
 

223
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,110
choose to sort spiders and i think there
was a lever for turning lights on and

224
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
was a lever for turning lights on and
 

225
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,990
was a lever for turning lights on and
off

226
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
off
 

227
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,830
off
very simple functionality but i thought

228
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
very simple functionality but i thought
 

229
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,750
very simple functionality but i thought
it was the coolest thing

230
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
it was the coolest thing
 

231
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,589
it was the coolest thing
and ever since then i've kind of dreamt

232
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
and ever since then i've kind of dreamt
 

233
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,110
and ever since then i've kind of dreamt
about making a

234
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
about making a
 

235
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,509
about making a
a grand base with lots of functionality

236
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
a grand base with lots of functionality
 

237
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,949
a grand base with lots of functionality
that you could like turn the lights on

238
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
that you could like turn the lights on
 

239
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,590
that you could like turn the lights on
and off

240
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
and off
 

241
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,789
and off
turn the mob system on on on and off and

242
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
turn the mob system on on on and off and
 

243
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,230
turn the mob system on on on and off and
um you know open doors closed doors do

244
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
um you know open doors closed doors do
 

245
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,749
um you know open doors closed doors do
do all sorts of different things from a

246
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
do all sorts of different things from a
 

247
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,670
do all sorts of different things from a
central computer but i've kind of

248
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
central computer but i've kind of
 

249
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,350
central computer but i've kind of
realized you don't need a computer all

250
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
realized you don't need a computer all
 

251
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,270
realized you don't need a computer all
you need is a chest

252
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
you need is a chest
 

253
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,030
you need is a chest
it's actually really easy to do so let

254
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
it's actually really easy to do so let
 

255
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,590

me let me show you just how easy it is
let's say for example you wanted a

258
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
let's say for example you wanted a
 

259
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,950
let's say for example you wanted a
function to play a song

260
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
function to play a song
 

261
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,629
function to play a song
so let's let's call this play song

262
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
so let's let's call this play song
 

263
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,710
so let's let's call this play song
all right and that did not work

264
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
all right and that did not work
 

265
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,590
all right and that did not work
why play song

do i pull him out of here i like never
name things

270
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080

 

271
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,590

is this broken uh oh

272
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600

things in the anvil for some reason
 

277
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,510
things in the anvil for some reason
is it because this is about to break

278
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
is it because this is about to break
 

279
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,790
is it because this is about to break
i don't know okay let's pretend this

280
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
i don't know okay let's pretend this
 

281
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,710
i don't know okay let's pretend this
says play song right so

282
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
says play song right so
 

283
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,390
says play song right so
we would have an item filter all you

284
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
we would have an item filter all you
 

285
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,150
we would have an item filter all you
need is item filters

286
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
need is item filters
 

287
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,629
need is item filters
most of us know how to make those um set

288
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
most of us know how to make those um set
 

289
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,749
most of us know how to make those um set
this up

290
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
this up
 

291
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,880
this up
so this needs 41 items

292
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:27,890
so this needs 41 items
 

293
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,590
so this needs 41 items
[Music]

294
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
[Music]
 

295
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,909
[Music]
all right so that goes to 41 items and

296
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
all right so that goes to 41 items and
 

297
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,830
all right so that goes to 41 items and
then you have like a stack of ice

298
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
then you have like a stack of ice
 

299
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,110
then you have like a stack of ice
that's a place song in this chest

300
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
that's a place song in this chest
 

301
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,270
that's a place song in this chest
that's one function added to this thing

302
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
that's one function added to this thing
 

303
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,469
that's one function added to this thing
all we got to do is

304
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
all we got to do is
 

305
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,430
all we got to do is
attach redstone over here to some note

306
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
attach redstone over here to some note
 

307
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,909
attach redstone over here to some note
blocks and it'll play a little tune

308
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
blocks and it'll play a little tune
 

309
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,430
blocks and it'll play a little tune
over here we have a dispenser with

310
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
over here we have a dispenser with
 

311
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,029
over here we have a dispenser with
fireworks in so if we add another

312
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
fireworks in so if we add another
 

313
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,070
fireworks in so if we add another
function let's say

314
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
function let's say
 

315
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,189
function let's say
use pistons this time 41 pistons in here

316
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
use pistons this time 41 pistons in here
 

317
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,469
use pistons this time 41 pistons in here
pretend they say shoot firework that i

318
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
pretend they say shoot firework that i
 

319
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,430
pretend they say shoot firework that i
named them

320
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
named them
 

321
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,590
named them
and then you have shoot firework

322
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
and then you have shoot firework
 

323
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,270
and then you have shoot firework
function in our chest here in our

324
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
function in our chest here in our
 

325
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,029
function in our chest here in our
our central control panel so you can

326
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
our central control panel so you can
 

327
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,790
our central control panel so you can
have like up to 54 different functions

328
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
have like up to 54 different functions
 

329
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,550
have like up to 54 different functions
in the double chest right

330
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
in the double chest right
 

331
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,990
in the double chest right
so if we want to play a song all we got

332
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
so if we want to play a song all we got
 

333

to do now is just throw the ice in
 

335
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,390
to do now is just throw the ice in
if we want to shoot a firework all we

336
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
if we want to shoot a firework all we
 

337
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,990
if we want to shoot a firework all we
got to do is

338
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
got to do is
 

339
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,909
got to do is
do that oh it's super simple right you

340
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
do that oh it's super simple right you
 

341
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,510
do that oh it's super simple right you
can do a lot of cool stuff with this

342
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
can do a lot of cool stuff with this
 

343
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,950
can do a lot of cool stuff with this
uh menu system idea i'll give you guys a

344
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
uh menu system idea i'll give you guys a
 

345
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,469
uh menu system idea i'll give you guys a
few more applications of this because i

346
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
few more applications of this because i
 

347
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,870
few more applications of this because i
think there are quite a few actually

348
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
think there are quite a few actually
 

349
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,189
think there are quite a few actually
so for example i might make a minecart

350
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
so for example i might make a minecart
 

351
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:31,990
so for example i might make a minecart
system in our

352
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
system in our
 

353
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,469
system in our
our world here where it's in the mine

354
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
our world here where it's in the mine
 

355
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,430
our world here where it's in the mine
carts

356
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
carts
 

357
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,430
carts
and then you have a chest full of of

358
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
and then you have a chest full of of
 

359
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,189
and then you have a chest full of of
choices like let's say we want to go to

360
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
choices like let's say we want to go to
 

361
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,590
choices like let's say we want to go to
the nexus or the man cave or

362
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
the nexus or the man cave or
 

363
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,550
the nexus or the man cave or
or guardian farm you know you select

364
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
or guardian farm you know you select
 

365
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,909
or guardian farm you know you select
whatever choice you want press

366
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
whatever choice you want press
 

367
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,950
whatever choice you want press
q shoots item out into a hopper

368
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
q shoots item out into a hopper
 

369
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,309
q shoots item out into a hopper
and then that would make the minecart

370
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
and then that would make the minecart
 

371
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,990
and then that would make the minecart
start moving and switch the junctions

372
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
start moving and switch the junctions
 

373
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,589
start moving and switch the junctions
according to whatever choice you make

374
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
according to whatever choice you make
 

375
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,629
according to whatever choice you make
you know

376
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639

379
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,990
um and it'll take you right to where you
want to go that would be a really nice

380
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
want to go that would be a really nice
 

381
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,589
want to go that would be a really nice
way of doing a rail system i think

382
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
way of doing a rail system i think
 

383
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,430
way of doing a rail system i think
instead of having like a bajillion

384
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
instead of having like a bajillion
 

385
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,189
instead of having like a bajillion
levers or buttons to

408
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
i built this kind of as a prototype like
 

409
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,189
i built this kind of as a prototype like
i wanted to see what you guys would say

410

about it and also it was just a really
 

413
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,309
about it and also it was just a really
good learning experience like i learned

414
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
good learning experience like i learned
 

415
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,270
good learning experience like i learned
a lot of stuff

416
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
a lot of stuff
 

417
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,150
a lot of stuff
building this and now that we have an

418
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
building this and now that we have an
 

419
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,909
building this and now that we have an
example of it actually working i can

420
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
example of it actually working i can
 

421
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:36,870
example of it actually working i can
improve upon it

422
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
improve upon it
 

423
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,029
improve upon it
that's what we want to do because you

424
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
that's what we want to do because you
 

425
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,710
that's what we want to do because you
guys really like this thing but it

426
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
guys really like this thing but it
 

427
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,629
guys really like this thing but it
is it does have a problem it's kind of

428
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
is it does have a problem it's kind of
 

429
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,749
is it does have a problem it's kind of
slow

430
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:43,759
slow
 

431
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,230
slow
once you get to about 30 or 40 shocker

432
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,240
once you get to about 30 or 40 shocker
 

433
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,790
once you get to about 30 or 40 shocker
boxes

434
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
boxes
 

435
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,469
boxes
it's going to take quite a few seconds

436
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
it's going to take quite a few seconds
 

437
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,150
it's going to take quite a few seconds
to actually uh

438
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
to actually uh
 

439
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,629
to actually uh
find an item for you right it's a linear

440
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
find an item for you right it's a linear
 

441
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,670
find an item for you right it's a linear
search

442
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
search
 

443
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,710
search
so we got to make that better there's

444
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
so we got to make that better there's
 

445
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,390
so we got to make that better there's
also another problem of there being

446
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
also another problem of there being
 

447
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,589
also another problem of there being
about four or 500

448
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
about four or 500
 

449
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,110
about four or 500
items in minecraft so

450
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
items in minecraft so
 

451
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,869
items in minecraft so
yeah we can have six double chests of

452
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
yeah we can have six double chests of
 

453
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,230
yeah we can have six double chests of
items or whatever here

454
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
items or whatever here
 

455
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,710
items or whatever here
but you got to look through all those

456
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
but you got to look through all those
 

457
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,510
but you got to look through all those
and find the item you're looking for

458
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
and find the item you're looking for
 

459
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,589
and find the item you're looking for
start your search it would be really

460
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
start your search it would be really
 

461
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,510
start your search it would be really
cool if we could do it all from a single

462
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
cool if we could do it all from a single
 

463
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:15,990
cool if we could do it all from a single
chest

464
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
chest
 

465
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,270
chest
right yeah so i think for the next

466
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
right yeah so i think for the next
 

467
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,110
right yeah so i think for the next
version of that what we really want to

468
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
version of that what we really want to
 

469
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,070
version of that what we really want to
do is break the items up into categories

470
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
do is break the items up into categories
 

471
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,909
do is break the items up into categories
that'll make the search faster and it

472
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
that'll make the search faster and it
 

473
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,469
that'll make the search faster and it
will also be easier to uh

474
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
will also be easier to uh
 

475
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,710
will also be easier to uh
to find what we're looking for when when

476
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
to find what we're looking for when when
 

477
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,149
to find what we're looking for when when
we're starting the search

478
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
we're starting the search
 

479
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,430
we're starting the search
instead of having all those double

480
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
instead of having all those double
 

481
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,509
instead of having all those double
chests we can maybe get it down to a

482
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
chests we can maybe get it down to a
 

483
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,110
chests we can maybe get it down to a
single chest here

484
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
single chest here
 

485
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,230
single chest here
um what we want to do is build a menu

486
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
um what we want to do is build a menu
 

487
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,509
um what we want to do is build a menu
that we can navigate

488
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
that we can navigate
 

489
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,310
that we can navigate
basically add an extra level of

490
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
basically add an extra level of
 

491
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,150
basically add an extra level of
complication to our life here

492
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
complication to our life here
 

493
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,150
complication to our life here
so for example we might have a selection

494
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
so for example we might have a selection
 

495
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,070
so for example we might have a selection
here for a redstone

496
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
here for a redstone
 

497
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,509
here for a redstone
category not just the redstone dust

498
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
category not just the redstone dust
 

499
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,190
category not just the redstone dust
piece but everything in the redstone

500
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
piece but everything in the redstone
 

501
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,110
piece but everything in the redstone
category so we'd have like redstone

502
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
category so we'd have like redstone
 

503
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,070
category so we'd have like redstone
blocks

504
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
blocks
 

505
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,190
blocks
maybe lamps in that category um

506
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
maybe lamps in that category um
 

507
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,710
maybe lamps in that category um
you know all this kind of stuff here in

508
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
you know all this kind of stuff here in
 

509
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,790
you know all this kind of stuff here in
our redstone chest repeaters

510
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
our redstone chest repeaters
 

511
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,110
our redstone chest repeaters
comparators then we might have like a

512
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
comparators then we might have like a
 

513
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,990
comparators then we might have like a
clay category

514
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
clay category
 

515
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,230
clay category
so this would be hard and clay in the 16

516
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
so this would be hard and clay in the 16
 

517
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,710
so this would be hard and clay in the 16
different colors and maybe regular clay

518
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
different colors and maybe regular clay
 

519
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,910
different colors and maybe regular clay
would go into that so yeah basically

520
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
would go into that so yeah basically
 

521
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,350
would go into that so yeah basically
what we're doing here is we want to have

522
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
what we're doing here is we want to have
 

523
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,269
what we're doing here is we want to have
two levels to our menu system so we

524
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
two levels to our menu system so we
 

525
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,350
two levels to our menu system so we
would have our main categories

526
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
would have our main categories
 

527
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,269
would have our main categories
to choose from first you choose the

528
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
to choose from first you choose the
 

529
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,910
to choose from first you choose the
categories such as clay

530
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
categories such as clay
 

531
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,509
categories such as clay
by doing that and then you want all the

532
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
by doing that and then you want all the
 

533
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,190
by doing that and then you want all the
items to leave this chest

534
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
items to leave this chest
 

535
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,590
items to leave this chest
and then that category selection to come

536
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
and then that category selection to come
 

537
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,790
and then that category selection to come
up so it would be

538
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
up so it would be
 

539
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,790
up so it would be
hard and clay the 16 different colors

540
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
hard and clay the 16 different colors
 

541
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,990
hard and clay the 16 different colors
regular clay would then come

542
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
regular clay would then come
 

543
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,990
regular clay would then come
up in this chest then you make your next

544
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
up in this chest then you make your next
 

545
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,910
up in this chest then you make your next
choice of what item you specifically

546
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
choice of what item you specifically
 

547
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,509
choice of what item you specifically
want to search for

548
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
want to search for
 

549
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,630
want to search for
so choose one of the colors for example

550
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
so choose one of the colors for example
 

551
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,150
so choose one of the colors for example
then items would leave this chest and it

552
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
then items would leave this chest and it
 

553
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,150
then items would leave this chest and it
would go back to the main

554
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
would go back to the main
 

555
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,710
would go back to the main
choice main category choices i know it

556
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
choice main category choices i know it
 

557
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,910
choice main category choices i know it
sounds a little complicated

558
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
sounds a little complicated
 

559
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,590
sounds a little complicated
i actually got to set this up for you to

560
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
i actually got to set this up for you to
 

561
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,590
i actually got to set this up for you to
probably understand it better

562
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
probably understand it better
 

563
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,829
probably understand it better
um so you probably have a hopper here

564
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
um so you probably have a hopper here
 

565
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,710
um so you probably have a hopper here
that you throw the item into

566
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
that you throw the item into
 

567
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,550
that you throw the item into
okay so i think this might take care of

568
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
okay so i think this might take care of
 

569
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,150
okay so i think this might take care of
the first step of our problem

570
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
the first step of our problem
 

571
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,430
the first step of our problem
so let's pretend these are different

572
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
so let's pretend these are different
 

573
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,509
so let's pretend these are different
categories like hard and clay wool

574
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
categories like hard and clay wool
 

575
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,710
categories like hard and clay wool
glass redstone

576
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
glass redstone
 

577
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,310
glass redstone
after we make our choice of what

578
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
after we make our choice of what
 

579
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,470
after we make our choice of what
category we want we then want these

580
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
category we want we then want these
 

581
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,630
category we want we then want these
items to leave the chest

582
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
items to leave the chest
 

583
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,670
items to leave the chest
okay so to do that right now

584
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
okay so to do that right now
 

585
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,150
okay so to do that right now
these two hoppers are locked under the

586
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
these two hoppers are locked under the
 

587
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,230
these two hoppers are locked under the
chest by the wire here

588
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
chest by the wire here
 

589
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,990
chest by the wire here
when we throw an item in this hopper

590
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
when we throw an item in this hopper
 

591
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,990
when we throw an item in this hopper
it's going to make the piston push the

592
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
it's going to make the piston push the
 

593
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,870
it's going to make the piston push the
block over

594
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
block over
 

595
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,069
block over
and unlock this so let's say we pick

596
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
and unlock this so let's say we pick
 

597
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,190
and unlock this so let's say we pick
card and clay as our category

598
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
card and clay as our category
 

599
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,110
card and clay as our category
that gets pushed over these items leave

600
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
that gets pushed over these items leave
 

601
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,870
that gets pushed over these items leave
fairly quickly

602
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
fairly quickly
 

603
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,910
fairly quickly
they go down to uh a storage minecart

604
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
they go down to uh a storage minecart
 

605
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,230
they go down to uh a storage minecart
down here did they all go in

606
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
down here did they all go in
 

607
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,030
down here did they all go in
or did one get left behind no i think

608
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
or did one get left behind no i think
 

609
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,430
or did one get left behind no i think
everything went in that's good

610
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
everything went in that's good
 

611
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,750
everything went in that's good
okay and then we need to re-lock this

612
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:51,760
okay and then we need to re-lock this
 

613
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,110
okay and then we need to re-lock this
chest

614
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
chest
 

615
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,430
chest
uh which we do by detecting when it's

616
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
uh which we do by detecting when it's
 

617
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,389
uh which we do by detecting when it's
empty then this

618
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
empty then this
 

619
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,150
empty then this
this gets powered over here and pushes

620
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
this gets powered over here and pushes
 

621
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,430
this gets powered over here and pushes
the block back

622
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
the block back
 

623
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,829
the block back
so now we're ready for new items to come

624
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
so now we're ready for new items to come
 

625
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,110
so now we're ready for new items to come
in here and they won't

626
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
in here and they won't
 

627
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,069
in here and they won't
they won't get put into the mine cart

628
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
they won't get put into the mine cart
 

629
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,590
they won't get put into the mine cart
below

630
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
below
 

631
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,590
below
okay i got a rough working example of

632
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
okay i got a rough working example of
 

633
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,190
okay i got a rough working example of
stage two now

634
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
stage two now
 

635
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,710
stage two now
this should clarify what i'm trying to

636
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
this should clarify what i'm trying to
 

637
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,470
this should clarify what i'm trying to
do quite a bit in peace in case you're

638
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
do quite a bit in peace in case you're
 

639
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,310
do quite a bit in peace in case you're
not quite getting it

640
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
not quite getting it
 

641
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,829
not quite getting it
so let's pretend we're picking our main

642
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
so let's pretend we're picking our main
 

643
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,590
so let's pretend we're picking our main
category here we're going to pick hard

644
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
category here we're going to pick hard
 

645
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,190
category here we're going to pick hard
and clay

646
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
and clay
 

647
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,430
and clay
the items the categories leave the chest

648
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
the items the categories leave the chest
 

649
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,750
the items the categories leave the chest
and then our selection comes up

650
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
and then our selection comes up
 

651
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,069
and then our selection comes up
so now these are the hard and clay

652
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
so now these are the hard and clay
 

653
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,829
so now these are the hard and clay
category choices so we would then

654
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
category choices so we would then
 

655
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,430
category choices so we would then
specifically choose

656
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
specifically choose
 

657
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,150
specifically choose
what item we're looking for and let's

658
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
what item we're looking for and let's
 

659
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,230
what item we're looking for and let's
say we do green and then ideally we want

660
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
say we do green and then ideally we want
 

661
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,550
say we do green and then ideally we want
that

662
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
that
 

663
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,670
that
main category to come back up so those

664
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
main category to come back up so those
 

665
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,310
main category to come back up so those
items went down to the storage mine cart

666
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
items went down to the storage mine cart
 

667
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,949
items went down to the storage mine cart
uh we need to like bring them back up to

668
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:44,959
uh we need to like bring them back up to
 

669
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,030
uh we need to like bring them back up to
this chest

670
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
this chest
 

671
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,269
this chest
okay so the next part of this guys is

672
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
okay so the next part of this guys is
 

673
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,190
okay so the next part of this guys is
the most tricky part of it so we're not

674
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
the most tricky part of it so we're not
 

675
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,870
the most tricky part of it so we're not
gonna do it today we're gonna save it

676
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
gonna do it today we're gonna save it
 

677
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,990
gonna do it today we're gonna save it
for another day

678
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
for another day
 

679
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,269
for another day
because we've been working on this whole

680
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
because we've been working on this whole
 

681
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,430
because we've been working on this whole
episode let's try to do something else

682
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
episode let's try to do something else
 

683
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,389
episode let's try to do something else
here too

684
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
here too
 

685
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,310
here too
uh but yeah but basically let's say we

686
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
uh but yeah but basically let's say we
 

687
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,550
uh but yeah but basically let's say we
have 15 categories to choose from

688
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
have 15 categories to choose from
 

689
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,430
have 15 categories to choose from
in our our chest here then we need 16

690
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
in our our chest here then we need 16
 

691
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,389
in our our chest here then we need 16
storage mine carts one for each category

692
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
storage mine carts one for each category
 

693
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,069
storage mine carts one for each category
and then another storage minecart to

694
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
and then another storage minecart to
 

695
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,910
and then another storage minecart to
hold the categories

696
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
hold the categories
 

697
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,550
hold the categories
right um so after we make a specific

698
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
right um so after we make a specific
 

699
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,310
right um so after we make a specific
selection we want the

700
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
selection we want the
 

701
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,310
selection we want the
minecart that holds the categories to

702
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
minecart that holds the categories to
 

703
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,509
minecart that holds the categories to
come back

704
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:19,519
come back
 

705
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,710
come back
empty out its contents into the chest

706
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
empty out its contents into the chest
 

707
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,629
empty out its contents into the chest
then when we choose the main category we

708
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
then when we choose the main category we
 

709
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,269
then when we choose the main category we
need one of the 15

710
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
need one of the 15
 

711
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,509
need one of the 15
storage minecarts the one we choose we

712
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
storage minecarts the one we choose we
 

713
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,990
storage minecarts the one we choose we
got to detect which category we choose

714
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
got to detect which category we choose
 

715
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,750
got to detect which category we choose
and then have that storage minecart come

716
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
and then have that storage minecart come
 

717
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,550
and then have that storage minecart come
over here empty out into the chest

718
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
over here empty out into the chest
 

719
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,389
over here empty out into the chest
and then somehow get its contents back

720
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
and then somehow get its contents back
 

721
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,750
and then somehow get its contents back
and put back into place

722
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
and put back into place
 

723
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,269
and put back into place
it's going to be a big thing and we got

724
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
it's going to be a big thing and we got
 

725
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,190
it's going to be a big thing and we got
to make it fast too so we can't just use

726
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
to make it fast too so we can't just use
 

727
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,710
to make it fast too so we can't just use
item filters and

728
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
item filters and
 

729
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,190
item filters and
probably got to do something super fancy

730
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
probably got to do something super fancy
 

731
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,870
probably got to do something super fancy
but we'll we'll work it out another time

732
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
but we'll we'll work it out another time
 

733
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,470
but we'll we'll work it out another time
okay

734
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
okay
 

735
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,470
okay
so let's head over to our underground

736
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
so let's head over to our underground
 

737
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,509
so let's head over to our underground
village now guys

738
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
village now guys
 

739
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,509
village now guys
and i thought we would try build an

740
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
and i thought we would try build an
 

741
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,110
and i thought we would try build an
elevator here

742
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
elevator here
 

743
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,910
elevator here
because we really need one there's no

744
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
because we really need one there's no
 

745
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,910
because we really need one there's no
elevator nearby i have to

746
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
elevator nearby i have to
 

747
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,150
elevator nearby i have to
either fly out of here or go a long ways

748
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
either fly out of here or go a long ways
 

749
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,550
either fly out of here or go a long ways
to get up to the surface again

750
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:06,560
to get up to the surface again
 

751
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,870
to get up to the surface again
uh so let's see maybe we'll just put it

752
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
uh so let's see maybe we'll just put it
 

753
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,990
uh so let's see maybe we'll just put it
over here

754
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000

 

755
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,910

oh hey we got a nitwit hey buddy

756
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
oh hey we got a nitwit hey buddy
 

757
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,949
oh hey we got a nitwit hey buddy
where did you come from i can't trade

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
what oh no i'm thinking of the librarian
 

767
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,389
what oh no i'm thinking of the librarian
that's right nitwits are totally useless

768
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
that's right nitwits are totally useless
 

769
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,230
that's right nitwits are totally useless
i think of the new cartograph

770
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
i think of the new cartograph
 

771
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,190
i think of the new cartograph
or cartographer uh guy i thought he was

772
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
or cartographer uh guy i thought he was
 

773
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,190
or cartographer uh guy i thought he was
the green guy for a second

774
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
the green guy for a second
 

775
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,269
the green guy for a second
uh-huh no nitwits are totally useless

776
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
uh-huh no nitwits are totally useless
 

777
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,949
uh-huh no nitwits are totally useless
they don't have a trade

778
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:40,959
they don't have a trade
 

779
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,389
they don't have a trade
all right hey cool

780
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
all right hey cool
 

781
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,389
all right hey cool
i think that'll be a good spot for it

782
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
i think that'll be a good spot for it
 

783
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,509
i think that'll be a good spot for it
over here so

784
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
over here so
 

785
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,829
over here so
let's get to building we want a two by

786
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
let's get to building we want a two by
 

787
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,590
let's get to building we want a two by
two thing going up to the surface so

788
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
two thing going up to the surface so
 

789
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,189
two thing going up to the surface so
we'll probably go to the top and just

790
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
we'll probably go to the top and just
 

791
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,470
we'll probably go to the top and just
dig down to do that

792
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
dig down to do that
 

793
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,269
dig down to do that
the easiest way but uh let's experiment

794
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:57,279
the easiest way but uh let's experiment
 

795
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,430
the easiest way but uh let's experiment
a little bit with the idea

796
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,440
a little bit with the idea
 

797
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,750
a little bit with the idea
so i want to do a boat elevator guys

798
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,760
so i want to do a boat elevator guys
 

799
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,269
so i want to do a boat elevator guys
we're going to challenge ourselves try

800
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
we're going to challenge ourselves try
 

801
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,870
we're going to challenge ourselves try
something new here

802
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
something new here
 

803
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,590
something new here
and hopefully it works out okay so i

804
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
and hopefully it works out okay so i
 

805
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,949
and hopefully it works out okay so i
figure

806
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959
figure
 

807
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,069
figure
have two pressure plates

808
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
have two pressure plates
 

809
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,629
have two pressure plates
like that and then the boats and

810
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
like that and then the boats and
 

811
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,509
like that and then the boats and
hopefully

812
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
hopefully
 

813
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,470
hopefully
like if the boats on these uh they're

814
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
like if the boats on these uh they're
 

815
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,470
like if the boats on these uh they're
not going to activate until we go inside

816
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
not going to activate until we go inside
 

817
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,790
not going to activate until we go inside
right and hopefully it clicks

818
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
right and hopefully it clicks
 

819
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,110
right and hopefully it clicks
yeah we got the click good and then i

820
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
yeah we got the click good and then i
 

821
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,829
yeah we got the click good and then i
want this

822
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
want this
 

823
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,990
want this
to get uh launched up to the surface

824
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
to get uh launched up to the surface
 

825
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,509
to get uh launched up to the surface
hopefully as soon as we go inside

826
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
hopefully as soon as we go inside
 

827
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,430
hopefully as soon as we go inside
oh this has to be higher up but yes yeah

828
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
oh this has to be higher up but yes yeah
 

829
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,870
oh this has to be higher up but yes yeah
because the

830
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
because the
 

831
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,430
because the
the boat's kind of fat right all right

832
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
the boat's kind of fat right all right
 

833
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,269
the boat's kind of fat right all right
so let's raise that up too

834
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
so let's raise that up too
 

835
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,790
so let's raise that up too
so probably just use slime block

836
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
so probably just use slime block
 

837
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,550
so probably just use slime block
launchers to do this we'll put the slime

838
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
launchers to do this we'll put the slime
 

839
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,110
launchers to do this we'll put the slime
block launcher over here

840
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
block launcher over here
 

841
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,069
block launcher over here
and something like this oh we'll have to

842
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
and something like this oh we'll have to
 

843
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,670
and something like this oh we'll have to
do it so it doesn't stick to anything

844
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
do it so it doesn't stick to anything
 

845
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,710
do it so it doesn't stick to anything
too

846
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
too
 

847
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,430
too
let's grab some note blocks here just to

848
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
let's grab some note blocks here just to
 

849
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,910
let's grab some note blocks here just to
try this

850
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
try this
 

851
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,110
try this
oh i got him on me i got him on me

852
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
oh i got him on me i got him on me
 

853
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,030
oh i got him on me i got him on me
okay so these have to be note blocks

854
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
okay so these have to be note blocks
 

855
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,629
okay so these have to be note blocks
i heard they're gonna make it so i think

856
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
i heard they're gonna make it so i think
 

857
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,550
i heard they're gonna make it so i think
it was the glazed terracotta blocks are

858
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
it was the glazed terracotta blocks are
 

859
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,910
it was the glazed terracotta blocks are
not gonna be

860
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
not gonna be
 

861
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,550
not gonna be
uh sticky to slime blocks in a future

862
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
uh sticky to slime blocks in a future
 

863
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,790
uh sticky to slime blocks in a future
update here hopefully that's true

864
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:12,800
update here hopefully that's true
 

865
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,230
update here hopefully that's true
because we don't have a lot of choices

866
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
because we don't have a lot of choices
 

867
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,030
because we don't have a lot of choices
for

868
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,040
for
 

869
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,350
for
blocks that don't stick to slime blocks

870
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
blocks that don't stick to slime blocks
 

871
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,790
blocks that don't stick to slime blocks
they were going to do it but i heard

872
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
they were going to do it but i heard
 

873
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,509
they were going to do it but i heard
they

874
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
they
 

875
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,990
they
forgot forgot to add in before the

876
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
forgot forgot to add in before the
 

877
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,030
forgot forgot to add in before the
snapshot but maybe

878
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
snapshot but maybe
 

879
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,069
snapshot but maybe
maybe next one okay let's do that

880
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
maybe next one okay let's do that
 

881
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,430
maybe next one okay let's do that
put that back and there we go so if we

882
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
put that back and there we go so if we
 

883
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,550
put that back and there we go so if we
go into the boat here

884
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
go into the boat here
 

885
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,829
go into the boat here
oh what's going on oh yeah it does

886
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
oh what's going on oh yeah it does
 

887
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,110
oh what's going on oh yeah it does
launch us okay

888
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
launch us okay
 

889
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,150
launch us okay
is it getting stuck on

890
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
is it getting stuck on
 

891
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,670
is it getting stuck on
getting stuck on something here

892
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
getting stuck on something here
 

893
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,330
getting stuck on something here
sometimes

894
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:45,340
sometimes
 

895
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,269
sometimes
[Music]

896
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279

 

897
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,710

what's going on guys like sometimes it

898
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,720
what's going on guys like sometimes it
 

899
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,150
what's going on guys like sometimes it
doesn't launch

900
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
doesn't launch
 

901
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,749
doesn't launch
and sometimes it does every third time

902
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
and sometimes it does every third time
 

903
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,069
and sometimes it does every third time
it launches

904
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
it launches
 

905
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,550
it launches
hmm one two

906
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
hmm one two
 

907
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,030
hmm one two
oh oh is it just because i think slime

908
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040
oh oh is it just because i think slime
 

909
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,389
oh oh is it just because i think slime
blocks are glitched out right okay if i

910
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
blocks are glitched out right okay if i
 

911
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,749
blocks are glitched out right okay if i
got the coordinates right this is going

912
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
got the coordinates right this is going
 

913
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,590
got the coordinates right this is going
to be the spot over here

914
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
to be the spot over here
 

915
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,949
to be the spot over here
hopefully uh if the slime blocks don't

916
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
hopefully uh if the slime blocks don't
 

917
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,550
hopefully uh if the slime blocks don't
work out we might just do a zipper

918
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
work out we might just do a zipper
 

919
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,629
work out we might just do a zipper
elevator

920
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
elevator
 

921
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,150
elevator
because they might be glitched i'm not

922
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
because they might be glitched i'm not
 

923
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,310
because they might be glitched i'm not
sure if it's gonna work but we'll try it

924
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
sure if it's gonna work but we'll try it
 

925
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,710
sure if it's gonna work but we'll try it
we'll try it first

926
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
we'll try it first
 

927
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,790
we'll try it first
okay so i had to put some fence gates

928
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
okay so i had to put some fence gates
 

929
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,030
okay so i had to put some fence gates
here because the villagers

930
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
here because the villagers
 

931
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,550
here because the villagers
kept going in the boat and killing

932
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
kept going in the boat and killing
 

933
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,069
kept going in the boat and killing
themselves

934
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,079
themselves
 

935
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,269
themselves
from the fall damage so uh if we got the

936
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
from the fall damage so uh if we got the
 

937
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,949
from the fall damage so uh if we got the
boat in the right place the sun block

938
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
boat in the right place the sun block
 

939
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,269
boat in the right place the sun block
seems to work okay

940
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
seems to work okay
 

941
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,189
seems to work okay
oh i say that it fails the first try

942
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
oh i say that it fails the first try
 

943
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,069
oh i say that it fails the first try
really it was working perfect before

944
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:46,079

 

945
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,550

um maybe just got unlucky there

946
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
um maybe just got unlucky there
 

947
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,550
um maybe just got unlucky there
yeah and it launches us pretty high each

948
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
yeah and it launches us pretty high each
 

949
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,150
yeah and it launches us pretty high each
time like that's that's the cool thing

950
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
time like that's that's the cool thing
 

951
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,069
time like that's that's the cool thing
about using boats they go a long ways

952
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079

 

953
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,509

let's see so it's above the dirt blocks

954
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
let's see so it's above the dirt blocks
 

955
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,029
let's see so it's above the dirt blocks
by maybe one block or two blocks

956
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
by maybe one block or two blocks
 

957
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,110
by maybe one block or two blocks
yeah so if i was to guess we were being

958
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
yeah so if i was to guess we were being
 

959
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,549
yeah so if i was to guess we were being
launched to about that height

960
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
launched to about that height
 

961
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,549
launched to about that height
there so we want the slime block to be

962
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
there so we want the slime block to be
 

963
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,829
there so we want the slime block to be
at this height

964
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
at this height
 

965
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,870
at this height
and then push us up right it's my best

966
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
and then push us up right it's my best
 

967
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,990
and then push us up right it's my best
guess

968
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000
guess
 

969
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,510
guess
we'll try it out if it doesn't work i'll

970
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
we'll try it out if it doesn't work i'll
 

971
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,510
we'll try it out if it doesn't work i'll
adjust it and then we'll count it and

972
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
adjust it and then we'll count it and
 

973
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,029
adjust it and then we'll count it and
figure out what height we actually need

974
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:21,039
figure out what height we actually need
 

975
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,829
figure out what height we actually need
here

976
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
here
 

977
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,909
here
but we're gonna do like a tripwire thing

978
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
but we're gonna do like a tripwire thing
 

979
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,110
but we're gonna do like a tripwire thing
here

980
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
here
 

981
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,350
here
um so we want this slime block to get

982
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360
um so we want this slime block to get
 

983
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,590
um so we want this slime block to get
pushed out and then pushed up

984
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600
pushed out and then pushed up
 

985
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,510
pushed out and then pushed up
right that's our goal so this block over

986
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,520
right that's our goal so this block over
 

987
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,270
right that's our goal so this block over
here

988
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
here
 

989
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,710
here
or let's do it out of stone brick so

990
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
or let's do it out of stone brick so
 

991
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,150
or let's do it out of stone brick so
it's a little clearer i'll probably

992
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
it's a little clearer i'll probably
 

993
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,909
it's a little clearer i'll probably
change out this whole elevator to clay

994
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
change out this whole elevator to clay
 

995
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,789
change out this whole elevator to clay
afterwards though

996
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
afterwards though
 

997
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,909
afterwards though
or some or maybe even concrete uh

998
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
or some or maybe even concrete uh
 

999
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,029
or some or maybe even concrete uh
but we want this block to get powered

1000
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
but we want this block to get powered
 

1001
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,990
but we want this block to get powered
so i'm going to just try put a trip wire

1002
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
so i'm going to just try put a trip wire
 

1003
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,470
so i'm going to just try put a trip wire
over

1004
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
over
 

1005
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,230
over
here and one over here so when the boat

1006
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
here and one over here so when the boat
 

1007
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,830
here and one over here so when the boat
passes through the trip wire it

1008
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
passes through the trip wire it
 

1009
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,750
passes through the trip wire it
activates this thing

1010
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
activates this thing
 

1011
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,789
activates this thing
run some string across okay so that

1012
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:00,799
run some string across okay so that
 

1013
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,630
run some string across okay so that
is right there right so if we put

1014
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
is right there right so if we put
 

1015
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,789
is right there right so if we put
a piece of redstone here this block will

1016
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:06,799
a piece of redstone here this block will
 

1017
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,630
a piece of redstone here this block will
get powered from that

1018
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
get powered from that
 

1019
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,789
get powered from that
and then we need to run it over to the

1020
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799
and then we need to run it over to the
 

1021
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:17,750
and then we need to run it over to the
pistons here

1022
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760

 

1023
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,070

what's the best way of doing that guys

1024
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080
what's the best way of doing that guys
 

1025
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,310
what's the best way of doing that guys
uh maybe we'll put it over there

1026
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
uh maybe we'll put it over there
 

1027
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,510
uh maybe we'll put it over there
let's try this redstone dust up there

1028
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
let's try this redstone dust up there
 

1029
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,470
let's try this redstone dust up there
we need at least a two tick thing or two

1030
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
we need at least a two tick thing or two
 

1031
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,390
we need at least a two tick thing or two
take difference here with the

1032
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,400
take difference here with the
 

1033
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,750
take difference here with the
repeaters let's try that out see if that

1034
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:33,760
repeaters let's try that out see if that
 

1035
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,350
repeaters let's try that out see if that
works

1036
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360

 

1037
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,750

and no why did that not work

1038
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
and no why did that not work
 

1039
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,789
and no why did that not work
good question oh because uh

1040
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:44,799
good question oh because uh
 

1041
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,909
good question oh because uh
right if we do that

1042
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
right if we do that
 

1043
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,950
right if we do that
the the wire is facing this way not not

1044
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
the the wire is facing this way not not
 

1045
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,150
the the wire is facing this way not not
into the block

1046
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,160
into the block
 

1047
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,390
into the block
so we need to move this block over

1048
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
so we need to move this block over
 

1049
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,150
so we need to move this block over
oh yeah let's just do it like that and

1050
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
oh yeah let's just do it like that and
 

1051
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,070
oh yeah let's just do it like that and
put a block here

1052
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
put a block here
 

1053
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,950
put a block here
uh-huh and now um

1054
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:04,960
uh-huh and now um
 

1055
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,950
uh-huh and now um
perfect okay so hopefully that works out

1056
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
perfect okay so hopefully that works out
 

1057
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,990
perfect okay so hopefully that works out
let's sleep real quick

1058
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
let's sleep real quick
 

1059
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,630
let's sleep real quick
here um we'll break the blocks we'll

1060
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:12,640
here um we'll break the blocks we'll
 

1061
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,830
here um we'll break the blocks we'll
take the boat up and see if it gets

1062
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
take the boat up and see if it gets
 

1063
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,470
take the boat up and see if it gets
launched here

1064
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
launched here
 

1065
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,310
launched here
possibly the tripwire is also in the

1066
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
possibly the tripwire is also in the
 

1067
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,990
possibly the tripwire is also in the
wrong place could be another issue

1068
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,000
wrong place could be another issue
 

1069
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,669
wrong place could be another issue
but this is how you figure things out

1070
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:21,679
but this is how you figure things out
 

1071
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,750
but this is how you figure things out
all right let's try it out

1072
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:25,760
all right let's try it out
 

1073
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,310
all right let's try it out
oh something happened

1074
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320

 

1075
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,150

oh i think it's pretty close but uh

1076
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
oh i think it's pretty close but uh
 

1077
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,430
oh i think it's pretty close but uh
it might not be getting launched high

1078
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
it might not be getting launched high
 

1079
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,750
it might not be getting launched high
enough for it to work

1080
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:37,760
enough for it to work
 

1081
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,150
enough for it to work
oh that time it worked

1082
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,160

 

1083
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,430

this is going to be a really bad

1084
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
this is going to be a really bad
 

1085
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,909
this is going to be a really bad
elevator isn't it

1086
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:45,919
elevator isn't it
 

1087
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,909
elevator isn't it
hey it worked that time again

1088
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919

 

1089
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,830

things are don't seem super consistent

1090
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:51,840
things are don't seem super consistent
 

1091
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,470
things are don't seem super consistent
though

1092
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480

 

1093
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,310

i have to like push forward on the boat

1094
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
i have to like push forward on the boat
 

1095
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,780
i have to like push forward on the boat
for the pressure plates to activate

1096
00:19:59,780 --> 00:19:59,790
for the pressure plates to activate
 

1097
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,190
for the pressure plates to activate
[Music]

1098
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200
[Music]
 

1099
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,310
[Music]
and then that pushes me over

1100
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
and then that pushes me over
 

1101
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,630
and then that pushes me over
oh that time we went too high

1102
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640

 

1103
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,909

oh it's a disaster guys

1104
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
oh it's a disaster guys
 

1105
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,630
oh it's a disaster guys
i don't know okay one thing i've done

1106
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
i don't know okay one thing i've done
 

1107
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,710
i don't know okay one thing i've done
now guys is i changed the side these

1108
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
now guys is i changed the side these
 

1109
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,230
now guys is i changed the side these
pistons are on like they used to be on

1110
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240
pistons are on like they used to be on
 

1111
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,789
pistons are on like they used to be on
this side

1112
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
this side
 

1113
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,270
this side
now they're on this side so when they

1114
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
now they're on this side so when they
 

1115
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,909
now they're on this side so when they
push us

1116
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
push us
 

1117
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,270
push us
it doesn't push us off the pressure

1118
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,280
it doesn't push us off the pressure
 

1119
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,029
it doesn't push us off the pressure
plates and it seems to be making this

1120
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:25,039
plates and it seems to be making this
 

1121
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,470
plates and it seems to be making this
thing a lot more consistent

1122
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:26,480
thing a lot more consistent
 

1123
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,270
thing a lot more consistent
although it's still not great i don't

1124
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
although it's still not great i don't
 

1125
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,430
although it's still not great i don't
know if i would recommend it

1126
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
know if i would recommend it
 

1127
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,470
know if i would recommend it
but we'll try it out here this is a good

1128
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
but we'll try it out here this is a good
 

1129
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:34,950
but we'll try it out here this is a good
ex

1130
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:34,960
ex
 

1131
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,149
ex
good learning experience okay so do that

1132
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:38,159
good learning experience okay so do that
 

1133
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,510
good learning experience okay so do that
and that's

1134
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,520
and that's
 

1135
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,830
and that's
uh you only need one piston here because

1136
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:41,840
uh you only need one piston here because
 

1137
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,350
uh you only need one piston here because
the slime block uh

1138
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,360
the slime block uh
 

1139
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,510
the slime block uh
brings this back you don't need the one

1140
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
brings this back you don't need the one
 

1141
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,270
brings this back you don't need the one
down below here

1142
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
down below here
 

1143
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,710
down below here
okay and then this is good hopefully got

1144
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
okay and then this is good hopefully got
 

1145
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,710
okay and then this is good hopefully got
the right height here

1146
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
the right height here
 

1147
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,310
the right height here
let's go put another one there good

1148
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,320
let's go put another one there good
 

1149
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,710
let's go put another one there good
all good yep seems to be working so

1150
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
all good yep seems to be working so
 

1151
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,549
all good yep seems to be working so
let's go down again

1152
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:00,559
let's go down again
 

1153
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,950
let's go down again
see if we can triple triple jump now

1154
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
see if we can triple triple jump now
 

1155
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,310
see if we can triple triple jump now
all right boat goes there and

1156
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,320
all right boat goes there and
 

1157
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,630
all right boat goes there and
it seems to work best if you're aligned

1158
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
it seems to work best if you're aligned
 

1159
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,909
it seems to work best if you're aligned
in a certain spot

1160
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919

 

1161
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,789

but i don't know what that spot is the

1162
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
but i don't know what that spot is the
 

1163
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,549
but i don't know what that spot is the
sweet spot we gotta find the sweet spot

1164
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:18,559
sweet spot we gotta find the sweet spot
 

1165
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,190
sweet spot we gotta find the sweet spot
with it

1166
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,200
with it
 

1167
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,230
with it
oh i don't know if that third one's

1168
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,240
oh i don't know if that third one's
 

1169
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,789
oh i don't know if that third one's
working

1170
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:24,799

 

1171
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,230

so the problem is sometimes the slime

1172
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,240
so the problem is sometimes the slime
 

1173
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,830
so the problem is sometimes the slime
block just pushes you up like a normal

1174
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:27,840
block just pushes you up like a normal
 

1175
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,830
block just pushes you up like a normal
block and it doesn't actually bounce you

1176
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:29,840
block and it doesn't actually bounce you
 

1177
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,470
block and it doesn't actually bounce you
right

1178
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,480
right
 

1179
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,990
right
that's the issue with slime blocks right

1180
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
that's the issue with slime blocks right
 

1181
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,110
that's the issue with slime blocks right
now that seems to be happening a lot

1182
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
now that seems to be happening a lot
 

1183
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,710
now that seems to be happening a lot
with this

1184
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:38,720

 

1185
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,830

hmm well it works every single time if

1186
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:41,840
hmm well it works every single time if
 

1187
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,029
hmm well it works every single time if
we're not in the boat

1188
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
we're not in the boat
 

1189
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,110
we're not in the boat
so it has to do with the client server

1190
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
so it has to do with the client server
 

1191
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,110
so it has to do with the client server
lag too

1192
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
lag too
 

1193
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,870
lag too
which i thought like if you're riding an

1194
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880
which i thought like if you're riding an
 

1195
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,669
which i thought like if you're riding an
entity that's not an issue

1196
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:53,679
entity that's not an issue
 

1197
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,909
entity that's not an issue
but i guess i got that wrong like i

1198
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
but i guess i got that wrong like i
 

1199
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,190
but i guess i got that wrong like i
thought if you're riding a boat or a

1200
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
thought if you're riding a boat or a
 

1201
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,710
thought if you're riding a boat or a
minecart then that's no longer a problem

1202
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
minecart then that's no longer a problem
 

1203
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,350
minecart then that's no longer a problem
but yeah obviously it's not working too

1204
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360
but yeah obviously it's not working too
 

1205
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,149
but yeah obviously it's not working too
well

1206
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:04,159
well
 

1207
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,630
well
uh so maybe one last ditch effort here

1208
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
uh so maybe one last ditch effort here
 

1209
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,750
uh so maybe one last ditch effort here
i'm gonna get a horse

1210
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760
i'm gonna get a horse
 

1211
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,590
i'm gonna get a horse
and then we'll ride the horse up while

1212
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
and then we'll ride the horse up while
 

1213
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,340
and then we'll ride the horse up while
it rides the boat and see if that works

1214
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:13,350
it rides the boat and see if that works
 

1215
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:18,310
it rides the boat and see if that works
[Laughter]

1216
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,320
[Laughter]
 

1217
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,909
[Laughter]
i don't know how i did that i got off

1218
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
i don't know how i did that i got off
 

1219
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,750
i don't know how i did that i got off
the horse weird apparently

1220
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:21,760
the horse weird apparently
 

1221
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,190
the horse weird apparently
oh he stopped that was awesome i wonder

1222
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:25,200
oh he stopped that was awesome i wonder
 

1223
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,870
oh he stopped that was awesome i wonder
if we can do that again

1224
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
if we can do that again
 

1225
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,950
if we can do that again
i was like moving while i got off the

1226
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:28,960
i was like moving while i got off the
 

1227
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,909
i was like moving while i got off the
horse

1228
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:31,919

 

1229
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,630

or maybe i jumped oh yeah if i jump

1230
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:38,640

 

1231
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,830

oh it's great uh okay so having a little

1232
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
oh it's great uh okay so having a little
 

1233
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,669
oh it's great uh okay so having a little
trouble here

1234
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
trouble here
 

1235
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,310
trouble here
even if we can get the horse into the

1236
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,320
even if we can get the horse into the
 

1237
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,149
even if we can get the horse into the
boat

1238
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:48,159
boat
 

1239
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,669
boat
uh we won't be able to activate the

1240
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679
uh we won't be able to activate the
 

1241
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,909
uh we won't be able to activate the
pressure plates and also

1242
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:51,919
pressure plates and also
 

1243
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,430
pressure plates and also
i can't get the horse into the boat for

1244
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,440
i can't get the horse into the boat for
 

1245
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,990
i can't get the horse into the boat for
some reason

1246
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000

 

1247
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,430

i don't think you can put them in boats

1248
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
i don't think you can put them in boats
 

1249
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,070
i don't think you can put them in boats
right is that what's going on

1250
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
right is that what's going on
 

1251
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,990
right is that what's going on
what if we remove the saddle

1252
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,000

 

1253
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,830

yeah he doesn't want to go in there for

1254
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
yeah he doesn't want to go in there for
 

1255
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,630
yeah he doesn't want to go in there for
some reason

1256
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
some reason
 

1257
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,630
some reason
okay so if we can't use horses let's try

1258
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:10,640
okay so if we can't use horses let's try
 

1259
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,070
okay so if we can't use horses let's try
llamas

1260
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,080
llamas
 

1261
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,230
llamas
so they go in boats for sure and

1262
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,240
so they go in boats for sure and
 

1263
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,549
so they go in boats for sure and
let's see how do we do this guys we

1264
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:18,559
let's see how do we do this guys we
 

1265
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,750
let's see how do we do this guys we
probably only got one shot of this

1266
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:19,760
probably only got one shot of this
 

1267
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,070
probably only got one shot of this
because this guy's probably gonna die

1268
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
because this guy's probably gonna die
 

1269
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,590
because this guy's probably gonna die
maybe we'll take away all the pressure

1270
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:23,600
maybe we'll take away all the pressure
 

1271
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,909
maybe we'll take away all the pressure
plates first

1272
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
plates first
 

1273
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,870
plates first
then get him into position we should be

1274
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:28,880
then get him into position we should be
 

1275
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,830
then get him into position we should be
able to ride him

1276
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:29,840
able to ride him
 

1277
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,110
able to ride him
oh what there he goes should be able to

1278
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
oh what there he goes should be able to
 

1279
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,070
oh what there he goes should be able to
ride the llama

1280
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
ride the llama
 

1281
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,110
ride the llama
while he's riding the boat

1282
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
while he's riding the boat
 

1283
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,110
while he's riding the boat
let's double check yeah looks like we

1284
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
let's double check yeah looks like we
 

1285
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,390
let's double check yeah looks like we
can good

1286
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,400
can good
 

1287
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,390
can good
so then if we put the pressure plates

1288
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:42,400
so then if we put the pressure plates
 

1289
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,830
so then if we put the pressure plates
back

1290
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:43,840
back
 

1291
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,750
back
or maybe i'll just use a button to try

1292
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
or maybe i'll just use a button to try
 

1293
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,830
or maybe i'll just use a button to try
this

1294
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:47,840
this
 

1295
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,269
this
yeah that's probably a smarter idea

1296
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:49,279
yeah that's probably a smarter idea
 

1297
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,029
yeah that's probably a smarter idea
instead of using the pressure plates

1298
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,039
instead of using the pressure plates
 

1299
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,950
instead of using the pressure plates
so put the button over there hopefully

1300
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960
so put the button over there hopefully
 

1301
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,789
so put the button over there hopefully
i'll be able to click it

1302
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799

 

1303
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,070

that didn't work what's going on we're

1304
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,080
that didn't work what's going on we're
 

1305
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,149
that didn't work what's going on we're
not getting launch design now

1306
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:04,159
not getting launch design now
 

1307
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,070
not getting launch design now
man um

1308
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
man um
 

1309
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,990
man um
yeah we're not going nearly as high as

1310
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,000
yeah we're not going nearly as high as
 

1311
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,070
yeah we're not going nearly as high as
before

1312
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,080
before
 

1313
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,590
before
or are we getting stuck on the piston

1314
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600
or are we getting stuck on the piston
 

1315
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,710
or are we getting stuck on the piston
how you doing on health buddy oh i can't

1316
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:18,720
how you doing on health buddy oh i can't
 

1317
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,350
how you doing on health buddy oh i can't
see his

1318
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,360
see his
 

1319
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,269
see his
oh he's got uh he's two hearts now it's

1320
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:21,279
oh he's got uh he's two hearts now it's
 

1321
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,269
oh he's got uh he's two hearts now it's
not too bad uh maybe we gotta

1322
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
not too bad uh maybe we gotta
 

1323
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,950
not too bad uh maybe we gotta
make the pistons take longer to go out

1324
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
make the pistons take longer to go out
 

1325
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,549
make the pistons take longer to go out
then

1326
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
then
 

1327
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,310
then
if we're not riding the llama then he

1328
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,320
if we're not riding the llama then he
 

1329
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,149
if we're not riding the llama then he
goes all the way is he gonna splat when

1330
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:30,159
goes all the way is he gonna splat when
 

1331
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,789
goes all the way is he gonna splat when
he hits the ground

1332
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
he hits the ground
 

1333
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:38,630
he hits the ground
no he's fine

1334
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,640

 

1335
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,750

this just is not working is it here we

1336
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
this just is not working is it here we
 

1337
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,950
this just is not working is it here we
go again

1338
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:46,960
go again
 

1339
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,149
go again
oh it worked it actually worked

1340
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:52,159

 

1341
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:58,830

is it consistent it might be consistent

1342
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:58,840

 

1343
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,390

okay we might have a winner here guys

1344
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400

 

1345
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,750

yeah i think it's actually consistent

1346
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,760
yeah i think it's actually consistent
 

1347
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,430
yeah i think it's actually consistent
now look at that

1348
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,440
now look at that
 

1349
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,669
now look at that
so i had to change some timings here

1350
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
so i had to change some timings here
 

1351
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,909
so i had to change some timings here
let's go back up here

1352
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:11,919
let's go back up here
 

1353
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,430
let's go back up here
what did we actually do let's figure

1354
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:13,440
what did we actually do let's figure
 

1355
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,669
what did we actually do let's figure
this out i've just been uh

1356
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
this out i've just been uh
 

1357
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,470
this out i've just been uh
adding one to the timing over and over

1358
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,480
adding one to the timing over and over
 

1359
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,149
adding one to the timing over and over
until it finally worked here

1360
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
until it finally worked here
 

1361
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,510
until it finally worked here
trial and error so this is at

1362
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:23,520
trial and error so this is at
 

1363
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,710
trial and error so this is at
seven that's from the tripwire

1364
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,720
seven that's from the tripwire
 

1365
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,750
seven that's from the tripwire
seven delay then it goes to uh this

1366
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
seven delay then it goes to uh this
 

1367
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,029
seven delay then it goes to uh this
block that we need to power

1368
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
block that we need to power
 

1369
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,149
block that we need to power
one delay later so eight ticks

1370
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159
one delay later so eight ticks
 

1371
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,390
one delay later so eight ticks
and then add two ticks extra from this

1372
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,400
and then add two ticks extra from this
 

1373
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,390
and then add two ticks extra from this
to the piston yes

1374
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,400
to the piston yes
 

1375
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,230
to the piston yes
all right it works it works

1376
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,240

 

1377
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,630

okay big moment guys for llama vader's

1378
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640
okay big moment guys for llama vader's
 

1379
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,390
okay big moment guys for llama vader's
everywhere is it going to work now i

1380
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,400
everywhere is it going to work now i
 

1381
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,110
everywhere is it going to work now i
changed the second one

1382
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,120
changed the second one
 

1383
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,870
changed the second one
all right so if they're both changed

1384
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
all right so if they're both changed
 

1385
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,990
all right so if they're both changed
is that good enough is it going to work

1386
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,000
is that good enough is it going to work
 

1387
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,390
is that good enough is it going to work
first one's good second one's good

1388
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,400

 

1389
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,990

let's try that again one

1390
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000
let's try that again one
 

1391
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,750
let's try that again one
two consistent oh my goodness

1392
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:13,760
two consistent oh my goodness
 

1393
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,350
two consistent oh my goodness
i don't believe it that's amazing

1394
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,360
i don't believe it that's amazing
 

1395
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,669
i don't believe it that's amazing
except it's not going as high now right

1396
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:19,679
except it's not going as high now right
 

1397
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,110
except it's not going as high now right
or is it oh i can't get off the llama

1398
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
or is it oh i can't get off the llama
 

1399
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,950
or is it oh i can't get off the llama
let's try that again see if i can hop

1400
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:24,960
let's try that again see if i can hop
 

1401
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,470
let's try that again see if i can hop
off the llama

1402
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,480

 

1403
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,549

yeah all right cool

1404
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559
yeah all right cool
 

1405
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,990
yeah all right cool
and let's check out the block heights

1406
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,000
and let's check out the block heights
 

1407
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,830
and let's check out the block heights
here guys just in case for some reason

1408
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:35,840
here guys just in case for some reason
 

1409
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,350
here guys just in case for some reason
you want to copy this

1410
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:37,360
you want to copy this
 

1411
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,549
you want to copy this
three four

1412
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:40,559

 

1413
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,590

five six seven eight nine

1414
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,600
five six seven eight nine
 

1415
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,390
five six seven eight nine
ten eleven so at the 11th block is where

1416
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:46,400
ten eleven so at the 11th block is where
 

1417
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,630
ten eleven so at the 11th block is where
the first slime block is

1418
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:48,640
the first slime block is
 

1419
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,590
the first slime block is
okay so then from that one two three

1420
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:51,600
okay so then from that one two three
 

1421
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,149
okay so then from that one two three
four

1422
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:52,159
four
 

1423
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,149
four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven

1424
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:56,159
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
 

1425
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,350
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve so it's not quite the same

1426
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360
twelve so it's not quite the same
 

1427
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,230
twelve so it's not quite the same
eleven then twelve and i'm guessing the

1428
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,240
eleven then twelve and i'm guessing the
 

1429
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,870
eleven then twelve and i'm guessing the
next one would be twelve two

1430
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:04,880
next one would be twelve two
 

1431
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,950
next one would be twelve two
i tell you i was about to give up on

1432
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
i tell you i was about to give up on
 

1433
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,110
i tell you i was about to give up on
that whole elevator idea but we did get

1434
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,120
that whole elevator idea but we did get
 

1435
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,710
that whole elevator idea but we did get
it working in the end so i'm happy about

1436
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:10,720
it working in the end so i'm happy about
 

1437
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,430
it working in the end so i'm happy about
that

1438
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
that
 

1439
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,190
that
uh but i think it's time we wrap up for

1440
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,200
uh but i think it's time we wrap up for
 

1441
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,269
uh but i think it's time we wrap up for
today guys so here is the comment i

1442
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
today guys so here is the comment i
 

1443
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:15,830
today guys so here is the comment i
picked out

1444
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:15,840
picked out
 

1445
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,470
picked out
the technical question it says why is it

1446
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
the technical question it says why is it
 

1447
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,470
the technical question it says why is it
that when i use his world seed

1448
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:20,480
that when i use his world seed
 

1449
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,310
that when i use his world seed
and go to the coordinates where the man

1450
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
and go to the coordinates where the man
 

1451
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,549
and go to the coordinates where the man
cave is for example it's not the right

1452
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:24,559
cave is for example it's not the right
 

1453
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,149
cave is for example it's not the right
biome at all

1454
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
biome at all
 

1455
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,269
biome at all
i guess a new question but still so i

1456
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:29,279
i guess a new question but still so i
 

1457
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:29,669
i guess a new question but still so i
made

1458
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
made
 

1459
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,029
made
this world back in minecraft 1.9

1460
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:33,039
this world back in minecraft 1.9
 

1461
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,389
this world back in minecraft 1.9
pre-release 3 i think and since then

1462
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:36,399
pre-release 3 i think and since then
 

1463
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,750
pre-release 3 i think and since then
there has been a biome

1464
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:37,760
there has been a biome
 

1465
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,909
there has been a biome
update so they added jungles after i

1466
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
update so they added jungles after i
 

1467
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,350
update so they added jungles after i
made this world

1468
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:41,360
made this world
 

1469
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,630
made this world
and all the existing biomes changed

1470
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:44,640
and all the existing biomes changed
 

1471
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,590
and all the existing biomes changed
positions

1472
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:45,600
positions
 

1473
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,149
positions
so if you load up the world or the seed

1474
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:48,159
so if you load up the world or the seed
 

1475
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,310
so if you load up the world or the seed
in the current generator

1476
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
in the current generator
 

1477
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,389
in the current generator
uh you actually get a world that's like

1478
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:52,399
uh you actually get a world that's like
 

1479
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,029
uh you actually get a world that's like
mesa and there's a whole bunch of ocean

1480
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:55,039
mesa and there's a whole bunch of ocean
 

1481
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,909
mesa and there's a whole bunch of ocean
like um nearby here too so it's a

1482
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:57,919
like um nearby here too so it's a
 

1483
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,750
like um nearby here too so it's a
completely different world

1484
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
completely different world
 

1485
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,870
completely different world
and which is why this world's so special

1486
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:04,880

 

1487
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,870

anyways thought i would answer that one

1488
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:06,880
anyways thought i would answer that one
 

1489
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,149
anyways thought i would answer that one
hopefully you guys enjoyed today's

1490
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
