we'll need it for

214
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
we'll need it for
 

215
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,510
we'll need it for
later too and i

216
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
later too and i
 

217
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,749
later too and i
don't think the portal needs it to be

218
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
don't think the portal needs it to be
 

219
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,830
don't think the portal needs it to be
around i hope

220
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
around i hope
 

221
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,870
around i hope
pretty sure it doesn't

222
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880

 

223
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,749

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,150
it's going to kill it oh
before it kills me nope nope too late

230
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
before it kills me nope nope too late

bad

234
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759

 

235
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,990

uh i can't really shut down the spawner

236
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
uh i can't really shut down the spawner
 

237
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,550
uh i can't really shut down the spawner
too well either

238
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
too well either
 

239
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,590
too well either
because they i read the wiki and it said

240
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
because they i read the wiki and it said
 

241
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,670
because they i read the wiki and it said
light level 11

242
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
light level 11
 

243
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,430
light level 11
or lower they can spawn from the spawner

244
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
or lower they can spawn from the spawner
 

245
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,110
or lower they can spawn from the spawner
uh we'll probably test that ourselves

246
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
uh we'll probably test that ourselves
 

247
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,710
uh we'll probably test that ourselves
just to check

248
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
just to check
 

249
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,310
just to check
in a little bit here

250
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320

 

251
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,990

fill this in

252
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000

 

253
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,909

yeah i would definitely die today if i

254
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
yeah i would definitely die today if i
 

255
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,990
yeah i would definitely die today if i
didn't do that now the big problem we

256
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
didn't do that now the big problem we
 

257
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,790
didn't do that now the big problem we
have is just

258
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
have is just
 

259
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,189
have is just
portals in the way

260
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199

 

261
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,510

we could remove it and this would be a

262
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
we could remove it and this would be a
 

263
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,230
we could remove it and this would be a
lot easier to build then

264
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
lot easier to build then
 

265
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,150
lot easier to build then
and it would also work better but

266
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160

 

267
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,629

this is also my only portal to the end

268
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
this is also my only portal to the end
 

269
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,830
this is also my only portal to the end
that i have

270
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
that i have
 

271
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,510
that i have
i wasn't able to locate any other

272
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
i wasn't able to locate any other
 

273
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,870
i wasn't able to locate any other
strongholds yet

274
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
strongholds yet
 

275
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,790
strongholds yet
so oh it did go out

276
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
so oh it did go out
 

277
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,830
so oh it did go out
nope one thing i didn't want to come

278
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840
nope one thing i didn't want to come
 

279
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,990
nope one thing i didn't want to come
here

280
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
here
 

281
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,189
here
uh okay i'll be right back

282
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199

 

283
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,710

okay i made it back here and i've

284
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
okay i made it back here and i've
 

285
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,110
okay i made it back here and i've
started making a case around the spawner

286
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
started making a case around the spawner
 

287
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,710
started making a case around the spawner
like i usually do

288
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
like i usually do
 

289
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,430
like i usually do
um it's gonna be that eight by eight

290
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
um it's gonna be that eight by eight
 

291
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,909
um it's gonna be that eight by eight
thing

292
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919

 

293
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,150

spawner is below this block here

294
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
spawner is below this block here
 

295
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,270
spawner is below this block here
and goes out four blocks this way from

296
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
and goes out four blocks this way from
 

297
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,749
and goes out four blocks this way from
that

298
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
that
 

299
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,469
that
and three blocks this way numbers get

300
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
and three blocks this way numbers get
 

301
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,029
and three blocks this way numbers get
lower

302
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
lower
 

303
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,870
lower
this direction so that's how i figure

304
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
this direction so that's how i figure
 

305
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,469
this direction so that's how i figure
that out

306
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
that out
 

307
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,670
that out
um and that thing with the portal it's

308
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
um and that thing with the portal it's
 

309
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,670
um and that thing with the portal it's
just a visual thing

310
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
just a visual thing
 

311
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,550
just a visual thing
you all probably knew that um but you

312
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
you all probably knew that um but you
 

313
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,150
you all probably knew that um but you
can see it from on top and not

314
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
can see it from on top and not
 

315
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,230
can see it from on top and not
from below even though it's there

316
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240

 

317
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,270

so yeah i'm trying not to

318
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
so yeah i'm trying not to
 

319
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,629
so yeah i'm trying not to
break this portal here if i can help it

320
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
break this portal here if i can help it
 

321
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,350
break this portal here if i can help it
i would get better rates if i did and

322
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
i would get better rates if i did and
 

323
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,990
i would get better rates if i did and
this would be a lot

324
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
this would be a lot
 

325
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,990
this would be a lot
easier to do if i did but this is my

326
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
easier to do if i did but this is my
 

327
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,870
easier to do if i did but this is my
only portal i know of

328
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
only portal i know of
 

329
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,469
only portal i know of
in my world i've tried finding more

330
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
in my world i've tried finding more
 

331
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,670
in my world i've tried finding more
strongholds but i haven't succeeded yet

332
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
strongholds but i haven't succeeded yet
 

333
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,749
strongholds but i haven't succeeded yet
i haven't looked really hard but i have

334
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
i haven't looked really hard but i have
 

335
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,150
i haven't looked really hard but i have
thrown pearls around to check

336
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
thrown pearls around to check
 

337
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,909
thrown pearls around to check
and haven't found any new ones

338
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919

 

339
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,510

a lot of people say there's more than

340
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
a lot of people say there's more than
 

341
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,870
a lot of people say there's more than
three per world but as far as i've seen

342
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880
three per world but as far as i've seen
 

343
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,469
three per world but as far as i've seen
so far i haven't seen any evidence

344
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
so far i haven't seen any evidence
 

345
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,990
so far i haven't seen any evidence
suggesting there's more

346
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000

 

347
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,230

not saying there isn't but i haven't

348
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
not saying there isn't but i haven't
 

349
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,990
not saying there isn't but i haven't
seen any proof of there being more than

350
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
seen any proof of there being more than
 

351
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,230
seen any proof of there being more than
three per world so

352
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
three per world so
 

353
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,909
three per world so
i don't want to risk destroying one of

354
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
i don't want to risk destroying one of
 

355
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,430
i don't want to risk destroying one of
these portals if i can help it

356
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440

 

357
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,869

and uh so that means i'm gonna try and

358
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
and uh so that means i'm gonna try and
 

359
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,629
and uh so that means i'm gonna try and
make my case around it

360
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
make my case around it
 

361
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,830
make my case around it
and just incorporate it inside and see

362
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
and just incorporate it inside and see
 

363
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,830
and just incorporate it inside and see
how that goes

364
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
how that goes
 

365
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,990
how that goes
so i will work on making the

366
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
so i will work on making the
 

367
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,629
so i will work on making the
8x8 case and we will probably install a

368
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
8x8 case and we will probably install a
 

369
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,629
8x8 case and we will probably install a
lighting system to this

370
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639

 

371
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,350

once we figure out the exact light level

372
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
once we figure out the exact light level
 

373
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,309
once we figure out the exact light level
we'll make sure it's

374
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
we'll make sure it's
 

375
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,670
we'll make sure it's
11 or lower like the wiki says

376
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
11 or lower like the wiki says
 

377
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,990
11 or lower like the wiki says
so i will check back in a little bit

378
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
so i will check back in a little bit
 

379
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,309
so i will check back in a little bit
here and once i make some more progress

380
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319

 

381
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,230

okay i'm having silver fish problems

382
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240

 

383
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,710

my flint and steel broke so i've just

384
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
my flint and steel broke so i've just
 

385
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,909
my flint and steel broke so i've just
been hitting them

386
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
been hitting them
 

387
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,430

just to get rid of them all i want them

388
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
just to get rid of them all i want them
 

389
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,909
just to get rid of them all i want them
all to break from the blocks

390
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
all to break from the blocks
 

391
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,029
all to break from the blocks
and this reminds me of something too

392
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
and this reminds me of something too
 

393
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,509
and this reminds me of something too

enderman farm i decided to level up to

450
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
enderman farm i decided to level up to
 

451
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,470
enderman farm i decided to level up to
50 since we were so close

452
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
50 since we were so close
 

453
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,069
50 since we were so close
and here we go doing a pick

454
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
and here we go doing a pick
 

455
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,069
and here we go doing a pick
decent i like those not going to

456
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
decent i like those not going to
 

457
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,509
decent i like those not going to
complain about that

458
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519

 

459
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,630

so i've been playing around with the

460
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
so i've been playing around with the
 

461
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,949
so i've been playing around with the
lighting here and i'm still having them

462
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
lighting here and i'm still having them
 

463
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,430
lighting here and i'm still having them
spawn in the middle

464
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440

 

465
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,670

uh even with torches all around pretty

466
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
uh even with torches all around pretty
 

467
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,110
uh even with torches all around pretty
much except that side

468
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120

 

469
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,949

i think the only way i can actually make

470
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
i think the only way i can actually make
 

471
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,870
i think the only way i can actually make
a lighting system for this to turn it on

472
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
a lighting system for this to turn it on
 

473
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,350
a lighting system for this to turn it on
and off

474
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
and off
 

475
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,350
and off
is to replace entire ceiling with the

476
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
is to replace entire ceiling with the
 

477
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,870
is to replace entire ceiling with the
lamps because they'll be light level 15

478
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:34,880
lamps because they'll be light level 15
 

479
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,389
lamps because they'll be light level 15
and this would be 14 13 12 and if these

480
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:38,399
and this would be 14 13 12 and if these
 

481
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,430
and this would be 14 13 12 and if these
guys need

482
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
guys need
 

483
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,710
guys need
light level 11 or lower to spawn they

484
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
light level 11 or lower to spawn they
 

485
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,110
light level 11 or lower to spawn they
shouldn't

486
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
shouldn't
 

487
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,949
shouldn't
should be spawning at that

488
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959

 

489
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,310

so that's probably what i'll end up

490
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
so that's probably what i'll end up
 

491
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,790
so that's probably what i'll end up
doing

492
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800

 

493
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,150

these guys man um they don't seem to be

494
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
these guys man um they don't seem to be
 

495
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,990
these guys man um they don't seem to be
spawning around the portal

496
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
spawning around the portal
 

497
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,670
spawning around the portal
like i kind of thought they would spawn

498
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
like i kind of thought they would spawn
 

499
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,509
like i kind of thought they would spawn
above it and below it but that doesn't

500
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
above it and below it but that doesn't
 

501
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,670
above it and below it but that doesn't
seem to be happening

502
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
seem to be happening
 

503
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,389
seem to be happening
at all although it might be because of

504
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
at all although it might be because of
 

505
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,110
at all although it might be because of
the lights

506
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
the lights
 

507
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,350
the lights
but even before that i never noticed it

508
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360

 

509
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,430

so yeah i'll be back when this is

510
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
so yeah i'll be back when this is
 

511
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,470
so yeah i'll be back when this is
replaced

512
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
replaced
 

513
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,310
replaced
it's a little bit expensive but i

514
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
it's a little bit expensive but i
 

515
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,990
it's a little bit expensive but i
definitely want an on off for this

516
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
definitely want an on off for this
 

517
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,389
definitely want an on off for this
because these guys are extremely

518
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
because these guys are extremely
 

519
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,110
because these guys are extremely
annoying

520
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120

 

521
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,870

all right so that is definitely doing

522
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
all right so that is definitely doing
 

523
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,829
all right so that is definitely doing
the trick now we're not getting any more

524
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839
the trick now we're not getting any more
 

525
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,550
the trick now we're not getting any more
spawns

526
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
spawns
 

527
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,430
spawns
this is an 8x8 ceiling so that's 64

528
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
this is an 8x8 ceiling so that's 64
 

529
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,550
this is an 8x8 ceiling so that's 64
lamps i had to

530
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
lamps i had to
 

531
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,630
lamps i had to
put up here but there's no real way to

532
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
put up here but there's no real way to
 

533
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,910
put up here but there's no real way to
avoid that i could

534
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
avoid that i could
 

535
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,269
avoid that i could
probably have less if i was to put some

536
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
probably have less if i was to put some
 

537
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,030
probably have less if i was to put some
in the walls of this but then the wiring

538
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
in the walls of this but then the wiring
 

539
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,870
in the walls of this but then the wiring
becomes more complicated

540
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
becomes more complicated
 

541
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,389
becomes more complicated
and i just don't want to deal with that

542
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
and i just don't want to deal with that
 

543
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,389
and i just don't want to deal with that
because i'm not exactly sure how to

544
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
because i'm not exactly sure how to
 

545
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,829
because i'm not exactly sure how to
build this yet

546
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
build this yet
 

547
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,389
build this yet
so the simpler i can make it the better

548
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399

 

549
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,069

ideally when this is all done we want

550
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
ideally when this is all done we want
 

551
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,990
ideally when this is all done we want
this as dark as possible in here to

552
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
this as dark as possible in here to
 

553
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,629
this as dark as possible in here to
maximize the spawn rates as well

554
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:00,639
maximize the spawn rates as well
 

555
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,910
maximize the spawn rates as well
so we need to cover up this these portal

556
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
so we need to cover up this these portal
 

557
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,590
so we need to cover up this these portal
blocks because i think they let light

558
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
blocks because i think they let light
 

559
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,629
blocks because i think they let light
through

560
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:06,639
through
 

561
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,590
through
and we can't have them outside like this

562
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
and we can't have them outside like this
 

563
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:09,990
and we can't have them outside like this
or else

564
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
or else
 

565
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,590
or else
light will pass through into the

566
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
light will pass through into the
 

567
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,750
light will pass through into the
spawning room here we want it completely

568
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
spawning room here we want it completely
 

569
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,069
spawning room here we want it completely
sealed off when this is done

570
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,079
sealed off when this is done
 

571
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,190
sealed off when this is done
and i'm going to replace these this wood

572
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
and i'm going to replace these this wood
 

573
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,949
and i'm going to replace these this wood
i've put with sandstone i think

574
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
i've put with sandstone i think
 

575
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,829
i've put with sandstone i think
something

576
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839
something
 

577
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,750
something
non-flammable and we can't use a stone

578
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
non-flammable and we can't use a stone
 

579
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,430
non-flammable and we can't use a stone
cobblestone or these stone bricks

580
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
cobblestone or these stone bricks
 

581
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,829
cobblestone or these stone bricks
because

582
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
because
 

583
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,750
because
uh the silverfish will hide in them and

584
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
uh the silverfish will hide in them and
 

585
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,350
uh the silverfish will hide in them and
we can't have that either

586
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
we can't have that either
 

587
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,030
we can't have that either
i could use like the the cracked ones or

588
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
i could use like the the cracked ones or
 

589
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,470
i could use like the the cracked ones or
the mossy ones but uh they're more of a

590
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
the mossy ones but uh they're more of a
 

591
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,310
the mossy ones but uh they're more of a
rare block so i'd rather use sandstone

592
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
rare block so i'd rather use sandstone
 

593
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,790
rare block so i'd rather use sandstone
and also there's something very unique

594
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
and also there's something very unique
 

595
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,069
and also there's something very unique
about these

596
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
about these
 

597
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,550
about these
silver fish spawners as well even in

598
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,560
silver fish spawners as well even in
 

599
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:58,069
silver fish spawners as well even in
high light levels

600
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079

 

601
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,750

even in high light levels they can spawn

602
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
even in high light levels they can spawn
 

603
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,230
even in high light levels they can spawn
on stone

604
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
on stone
 

605
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,190
on stone
just stone i don't think cobblestone

606
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
just stone i don't think cobblestone
 

607
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,949
just stone i don't think cobblestone
works

608
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
works
 

609
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,110
works
um at least i hope they did

610
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
um at least i hope they did
 

611
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,150
um at least i hope they did
do otherwise i just lied well maybe put

612
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,160
do otherwise i just lied well maybe put
 

613
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,350
do otherwise i just lied well maybe put
a few more

614
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
a few more
 

615
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,310
a few more
increasing chances

616
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320

 

617
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,990

don't know why it's not happening

618
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000

 

619
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,629

come on so the only area they can spawn

620
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
come on so the only area they can spawn
 

621
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,430
come on so the only area they can spawn
in here is

622
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
in here is
 

623
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,670
in here is
these first these uh three layers here

624
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680
these first these uh three layers here
 

625
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,590
these first these uh three layers here
this one this one in this one

626
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
this one this one in this one
 

627
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,949
this one this one in this one
nothing below nothing above the spawners

628
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
nothing below nothing above the spawners
 

629
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,829
nothing below nothing above the spawners
the spawners in between at this layer

630
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:46,839

 

631
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,150

here

632
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
here
 

633
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,230
here
yeah they're not spawning when i tried

634
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
yeah they're not spawning when i tried
 

635
00:13:50,240 --> 00:14:00,310
yeah they're not spawning when i tried
it before in creative it worked

636
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320

 

637
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,350

unless that changed they really should

638
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
unless that changed they really should
 

639
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,710
unless that changed they really should
be spawning by now

640
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720

 

641
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,670

um

642
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680

 

643
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,870

don't know what the deal is oh there we

644
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:14,880
don't know what the deal is oh there we
 

645
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,069
don't know what the deal is oh there we
go

646
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
go
 

647
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,430
go
oh that's because the light was blocked

648
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
oh that's because the light was blocked
 

649
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,710
oh that's because the light was blocked
out though that doesn't count

650
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
out though that doesn't count
 

651
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,310
out though that doesn't count
um yeah i don't know why that's not

652
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
um yeah i don't know why that's not
 

653
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,069
um yeah i don't know why that's not
working now

654
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079

 

655
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,110

anyway i'll show you the wiring

656
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120
anyway i'll show you the wiring
 

657
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,710
anyway i'll show you the wiring
for the lights it's very simple

658
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
for the lights it's very simple
 

659
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,470
for the lights it's very simple
might be able to do a little better yet

660
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480

 

661
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,389

just an outer ring

662
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399

 

663
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,269

here and then little branches off here

664
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
here and then little branches off here
 

665
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,230
here and then little branches off here
for the corners

666
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,240
for the corners
 

667
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,629
for the corners
otherwise they wouldn't be lit and that

668
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
otherwise they wouldn't be lit and that
 

669
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:55,430
otherwise they wouldn't be lit and that
pretty much covers the whole thing

670
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440

 

671
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,189

okay so i'm going to finish this up i'm

672
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
okay so i'm going to finish this up i'm
 

673
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,870
okay so i'm going to finish this up i'm
going to replace it with sandstone and i

674
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:58,880
going to replace it with sandstone and i
 

675
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,310
going to replace it with sandstone and i
will be back

676
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320

 

677
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,670

oh yeah one other thing i was going to

678
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
oh yeah one other thing i was going to
 

679
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,150
oh yeah one other thing i was going to
show you is that mobs will spawn at

680
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
show you is that mobs will spawn at
 

681
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,870
show you is that mobs will spawn at
light level

682
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
light level
 

683
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,230
light level
11 or lower i just saw it

00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
the case is done pretty much i just made
 

709
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,110
the case is done pretty much i just made
a little viewing window here so i could

710
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
a little viewing window here so i could
 

711
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,590
a little viewing window here so i could
see

712
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
see
 

713
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,670
see
their behavior apparently

714
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
their behavior apparently
 

715
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,990
their behavior apparently
these guys have the same property that

716
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
these guys have the same property that
 

717
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,990
these guys have the same property that
spiders have where they will

are not property but behavior where they

720
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
are not property but behavior where they
 

721
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,150
are not property but behavior where they
will track your player

722
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
will track your player
 

723
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,030

727
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,509

um that might cause problems won't be

728
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
um that might cause problems won't be
 

729
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,110
um that might cause problems won't be
too big of an issue but as soon as you

730
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
too big of an issue but as soon as you
 

731
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,069
too big of an issue but as soon as you
get a little ways away from them

732
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
get a little ways away from them
 

733
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,509
get a little ways away from them
they start to wander around so if

734
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
they start to wander around so if
 

735
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,870
they start to wander around so if
if they're tracking like they were

736
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
if they're tracking like they were
 

737
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,189
if they're tracking like they were
before they won't enter

738
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:19,199
before they won't enter
 

739
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,430
before they won't enter
the stone blocks i'm pretty sure which

740
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
the stone blocks i'm pretty sure which
 

741
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,230
the stone blocks i'm pretty sure which
would prevent this all from working so

742
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,240
would prevent this all from working so
 

743
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,670
would prevent this all from working so
we need to make sure we

744
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
we need to make sure we
 

745
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,230
we need to make sure we
are it looks like it's only eight blocks

746
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
are it looks like it's only eight blocks
 

747
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,110
are it looks like it's only eight blocks
so one

748
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
so one
 

749
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,430
so one
two three four five six

750
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440

 

751
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,710

seven yeah it's about eight blocks

752
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:40,720
seven yeah it's about eight blocks
 

753
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,910
seven yeah it's about eight blocks
wait one two three four five

754
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
wait one two three four five
 

755
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,189
wait one two three four five
six seven eight um

756
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
six seven eight um
 

757
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,470
six seven eight um
maybe maybe like nine

758
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480

 

759
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,990

nine or ten so it's i don't think it's

760
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
nine or ten so it's i don't think it's
 

761
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,590
nine or ten so it's i don't think it's
quite as far as spiders

762
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
quite as far as spiders
 

763
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,189
quite as far as spiders
tracking ability uh

764
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
tracking ability uh
 

765
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,829
tracking ability uh
the way i'm doing the spawner i'm

766
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,839
the way i'm doing the spawner i'm
 

767
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,390
the way i'm doing the spawner i'm
dropping them down

768
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
dropping them down
 

769
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,590
dropping them down
let's see spawners at that level there

770
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
let's see spawners at that level there
 

771
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,270
let's see spawners at that level there
one two three four five blocks

772
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
one two three four five blocks
 

773
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,029
one two three four five blocks
that's so that these guys are out of

774
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
that's so that these guys are out of
 

775
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,110
that's so that these guys are out of
range of the spawner so that it'll keep

776
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
range of the spawner so that it'll keep
 

777
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,470
range of the spawner so that it'll keep
spawning

778
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
spawning
 

779
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,669
spawning
more so more than six will spawn

780
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
more so more than six will spawn
 

781
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,549
more so more than six will spawn
and after a long period of time this

782
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
and after a long period of time this
 

783
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,789
and after a long period of time this
room would just fill up

784
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
room would just fill up
 

785
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,669
room would just fill up
with hundreds of them you can see the

786
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
with hundreds of them you can see the
 

787
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,630
with hundreds of them you can see the
lights are off

788
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
lights are off
 

789
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,390
lights are off
but there's still light in here and

790
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
but there's still light in here and
 

791
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,830
but there's still light in here and
that's my next major

792
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
that's my next major
 

793
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,630
that's my next major
problem i've realized apparently that

794
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,350

so another reason i want to destroy it

800
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,360
so another reason i want to destroy it
 

801
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,669
so another reason i want to destroy it
but

802
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
but
 

803
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,190
but
at the same time i need it so

804
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
at the same time i need it so
 

805
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,270
at the same time i need it so
i'll have to probably encase it with

806
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
i'll have to probably encase it with
 

807
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,190
i'll have to probably encase it with
blocks

808
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200
blocks
 

809
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,830
blocks
but i'm going to first try making a

810
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
but i'm going to first try making a
 

811
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,909
but i'm going to first try making a
backup of my world here and

812
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919
backup of my world here and
 

813
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,470
backup of my world here and
maybe destroying some of the blocks see

814
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
maybe destroying some of the blocks see
 

815
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,830
maybe destroying some of the blocks see
if we can

816
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
if we can
 

817
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,870
if we can
and possibly make it smaller

818
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:04,880
and possibly make it smaller
 

819
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,470
and possibly make it smaller
and i'm going to try silk touch on it

820
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
and i'm going to try silk touch on it
 

821
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,549
and i'm going to try silk touch on it
too i don't know if we can actually even

822
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559
too i don't know if we can actually even
 

823
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,430
too i don't know if we can actually even
destroy

824
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
destroy
 

825
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,830
destroy
the frame but we're going to try it

826
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840
the frame but we're going to try it
 

827
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,310
the frame but we're going to try it
um

828
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320

 

829
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,430

this on
 

845
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,630
this on
stop the spawning and we're going to go

846
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:34,640
stop the spawning and we're going to go
 

847
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,549
stop the spawning and we're going to go
in there

848
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:38,559

854
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:49,760

 

855
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,830

i need to make a new set of armor i

856
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:54,840

 

857
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,590

guess

858
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,600
guess
 

859
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,470
guess
okay yeah so i'm just going to put down

860
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
okay yeah so i'm just going to put down
 

861
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,270
okay yeah so i'm just going to put down
some blocks here so we can observe the

862
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280
some blocks here so we can observe the
 

863
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,029
some blocks here so we can observe the
silverfish entering them

864
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
silverfish entering them
 

865
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,909
silverfish entering them
uh that's one there these are the three

866
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
uh that's one there these are the three
 

867
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:10,630
uh that's one there these are the three
types

868
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
types
 

869
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,630
types
they can enter them if they're directly

870
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:12,640
they can enter them if they're directly
 

871
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,430
they can enter them if they're directly
below too so if we put one

872
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440
below too so if we put one
 

873
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,590
below too so if we put one
like here they'll be able they'll be

874
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
like here they'll be able they'll be
 

875
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,870
like here they'll be able they'll be
able to enter that too

876
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880

 

877
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:28,870

okay so we're going to turn this back on

878
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880

 

879
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:36,789

and it hopefully won't take too long

880
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799

 

881
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:44,310

have to be away from them though

882
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,320

 

883
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,990

so it's kind of random it's like when

884
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000
so it's kind of random it's like when
 

885
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,310
so it's kind of random it's like when
they make contact with it then

886
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320

 

887
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,350

quite often they'll enter the block

888
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
quite often they'll enter the block
 

889
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,789
quite often they'll enter the block
or if it gets in their way when they're

890
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:54,799
or if it gets in their way when they're
 

891
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,870
or if it gets in their way when they're
walking

892
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880

 

893
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,230

that guy just walked over him but he

894
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
that guy just walked over him but he
 

895
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,470
that guy just walked over him but he
didn't go in so they don't always do it

896
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
didn't go in so they don't always do it
 

897
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,830
didn't go in so they don't always do it
but

898
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:04,840

 

899
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,630

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:19,600

 

1029
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,710

whoa open my water that i didn't place

1030
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:22,720
whoa open my water that i didn't place
 

1031
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,070
whoa open my water that i didn't place
it there did i

1032
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080

 

1033
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,110

i must have okay um

1034
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
i must have okay um
 

1035
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,750
i must have okay um
yeah we're going to be encasing it then

1036
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
yeah we're going to be encasing it then
 

1037
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,190
yeah we're going to be encasing it then
we will lose a fair bit of space in here

1038
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,200
we will lose a fair bit of space in here
 

1039
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,149
we will lose a fair bit of space in here
plus side is we can remove the lamps

1040
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
plus side is we can remove the lamps
 

1041
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:42,630
plus side is we can remove the lamps
above

1042
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:42,640
above
 

1043
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,149
above
and we'll have an easy way to get back

1044
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
and we'll have an easy way to get back
 

1045
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,669
and we'll have an easy way to get back
into the portal

1046
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:47,679

 

1047
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,590

but we will lose some spawning space

1048
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
but we will lose some spawning space
 

1049
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,830
but we will lose some spawning space
which means spawning rates will be

1050
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
which means spawning rates will be
 

1051
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,029
which means spawning rates will be
decreased slightly from it

1052
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
decreased slightly from it
 

1053
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,510
decreased slightly from it
so lower xp rates

1054
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,520

 

1055
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,190

here's another update for you guys i

1056
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
here's another update for you guys i
 

1057
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,950
here's another update for you guys i
have been busy here

1058
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
have been busy here
 

1059
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,149
have been busy here
i have in case the portal

1060
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:06,159
i have in case the portal
 

1061
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,149
i have in case the portal
that has reduced the amount of spawning

1062
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159
that has reduced the amount of spawning
 

1063
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,990
that has reduced the amount of spawning
space by about

1064
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,000
space by about
 

1065
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,149
space by about
a third so there's two thirds left or so

1066
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:14,159
a third so there's two thirds left or so
 

1067
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,909
a third so there's two thirds left or so
it's going to lower rates but we'll have

1068
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:15,919
it's going to lower rates but we'll have
 

1069
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,590
it's going to lower rates but we'll have
to deal with it

1070
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,600
to deal with it
 

1071
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,510
to deal with it
on top here now we can get into the

1072
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:21,520
on top here now we can get into the
 

1073
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,430
on top here now we can get into the
portal actually

1074
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,440
portal actually
 

1075
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,630
portal actually
just down here

1076
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640

 

1077
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,230

i'll probably adjust that yet make it

1078
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,240
i'll probably adjust that yet make it
 

1079
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,430
i'll probably adjust that yet make it
look a little better

1080
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440

 

1081
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,390

then i've started making a little place

1082
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,400
then i've started making a little place
 

1083
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,950
then i've started making a little place
for the silverfish to fall in this

1084
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
for the silverfish to fall in this
 

1085
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,029
for the silverfish to fall in this
this line here to get them a little bit

1086
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039
this line here to get them a little bit
 

1087
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,549
this line here to get them a little bit
more compressed

1088
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:40,559
more compressed
 

1089
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,950
more compressed
and then they're gonna come to the end

1090
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:42,960
and then they're gonna come to the end
 

1091
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,830
and then they're gonna come to the end
and fall down

1092
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:44,840
and fall down
 

1093
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,590
and fall down
here and i think i'm going to

1094
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:49,600
here and i think i'm going to
 

1095
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,269
here and i think i'm going to
put water along this wall here i'm not

1096
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
put water along this wall here i'm not
 

1097
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,909
put water along this wall here i'm not
sure if water's

1098
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:55,919
sure if water's
 

1099
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,950
sure if water's
better or not as far as

1100
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:58,960
better or not as far as
 

1101
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,710
better or not as far as
getting them to that spot there because

1102
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:00,720
getting them to that spot there because
 

1103
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,669
getting them to that spot there because
they fight the current really

1104
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
they fight the current really
 

1105
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,710
they fight the current really
aggressively but

1106
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
aggressively but
 

1107
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,870
aggressively but
doing this will ensure there's no other

1108
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
doing this will ensure there's no other
 

1109
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,630
doing this will ensure there's no other
mob spawns in here

1110
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,640
mob spawns in here
 

1111
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,510
mob spawns in here
so that's one of the main reasons i'm

1112
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
so that's one of the main reasons i'm
 

1113
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,870
so that's one of the main reasons i'm
doing that

1114
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880
doing that
 

1115
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,630
doing that
then for down there i think i'm just

1116
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:16,640
then for down there i think i'm just
 

1117
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,789
then for down there i think i'm just
going to put a half slab so we don't get

1118
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:18,799
going to put a half slab so we don't get
 

1119
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,630
going to put a half slab so we don't get
any mob spawns

1120
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:20,640
any mob spawns
 

1121
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,510
any mob spawns
and it will still be a block and a half

1122
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:23,520
and it will still be a block and a half
 

1123
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,510
and it will still be a block and a half
so they won't be able to jump up

1124
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,520
so they won't be able to jump up
 

1125
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,190
so they won't be able to jump up
and out of here

1126
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200
and out of here
 

1127
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,310
and out of here
um this will have to be moved i tested

1128
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,320
um this will have to be moved i tested
 

1129
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:32,630
um this will have to be moved i tested
this

1130
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,640
this
 

1131
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,630
this
and silver fish are taller than half a

1132
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:34,640
and silver fish are taller than half a
 

1133
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,750
and silver fish are taller than half a
block

1134
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
block
 

1135
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,430
block
so they would not be able to fall down

1136
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:37,440
so they would not be able to fall down
 

1137
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,470
so they would not be able to fall down
there

1138
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,480

 

1139
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,310

i guess now we can

1140
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320

 

1141
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:51,190

actually do this which is awesome

1142
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200

 

1143
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,990

yeah okay uh i'm using so much sandstone

1144
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,000
yeah okay uh i'm using so much sandstone
 

1145
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,390
yeah okay uh i'm using so much sandstone
on this but i love sandstone so

1146
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,400
on this but i love sandstone so
 

1147
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,830
on this but i love sandstone so
may as well

1148
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:03,840

 

1149
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,310

okay so i am going to get this

1150
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,320
okay so i am going to get this
 

1151
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,990
okay so i am going to get this
and

1152
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,000

 

1153
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,909

let's see we're going to put glass along

1154
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:15,919
let's see we're going to put glass along
 

1155
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,750
let's see we're going to put glass along
here just for now while we're testing

1156
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:17,760
here just for now while we're testing
 

1157
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,149
here just for now while we're testing
this so we can see what they're doing

1158
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
this so we can see what they're doing
 

1159
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,110
this so we can see what they're doing
hopefully um

1160
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,120
hopefully um
 

1161
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,710
hopefully um
yeah i'm just gonna try to turn it on

1162
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,720
yeah i'm just gonna try to turn it on
 

1163
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:37,990
yeah i'm just gonna try to turn it on
see what happens here

1164
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,000
see what happens here
 

1165
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,390
see what happens here
the silverfish go down already oh he did

1166
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,400
the silverfish go down already oh he did
 

1167
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,630
the silverfish go down already oh he did
because they're tracking me they just

1168
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
because they're tracking me they just
 

1169
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,549
because they're tracking me they just
bee lined right to the wall here

1170
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:46,559

 

1171
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,590

yeah so it's nice and dark in their net

1172
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:49,600
yeah so it's nice and dark in their net
 

1173
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,110
yeah so it's nice and dark in their net

1174
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,120
excuse me it's nice and dark in there
 

1175
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,710
excuse me it's nice and dark in there
now that i got that

1176
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:52,720
now that i got that
 

1177
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,149
now that i got that
portal encased

1178
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:56,159

 

1179
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,630

these guys it really doesn't matter how

1180
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:58,640
these guys it really doesn't matter how
 

1181
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,350
these guys it really doesn't matter how
much damage they get

1182
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
much damage they get
 

1183
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,390
much damage they get
while i'm processing them here in my

1184
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:04,400
while i'm processing them here in my
 

1185
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,269
while i'm processing them here in my
factory

1186
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:05,279
factory
 

1187
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,190
factory
because once they go in the block their

1188
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,200
because once they go in the block their
 

1189
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,710
because once they go in the block their
health will

1190
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:08,720
health will
 

1191
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,070
health will
get reset basically so if they have half

1192
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,080
get reset basically so if they have half
 

1193
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,430
get reset basically so if they have half
a heart and they

1194
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:13,440
a heart and they
 

1195
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,510
a heart and they
enter a block when they when you break

1196
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,520
enter a block when they when you break
 

1197
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,190
enter a block when they when you break
it they're gonna have four hearts again

1198
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,200
it they're gonna have four hearts again
 

1199
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,669
it they're gonna have four hearts again
so it resets when they get recreated

1200
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:21,679
so it resets when they get recreated
 

1201
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,470
so it resets when they get recreated
um okay i'm going to shut that off

1202
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480

 

1203
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,950

we're about to do we're about at the fun

1204
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:28,960
we're about to do we're about at the fun
 

1205
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,230
we're about to do we're about at the fun
part here

1206
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240
part here
 

1207
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,830
part here
uh just give me one moment and i'll be

1208
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:32,840
uh just give me one moment and i'll be
 

1209
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,029
uh just give me one moment and i'll be
back

1210
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
back
 

1211
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,549
back
actually i should probably explain the

1212
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:36,559
actually i should probably explain the
 

1213
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,710
actually i should probably explain the
idea to you a little bit more before we

1214
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:38,720
idea to you a little bit more before we
 

1215
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,549
idea to you a little bit more before we
advance any further here so what we have

1216
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559
advance any further here so what we have
 

1217
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,350
advance any further here so what we have
what we've built already is a way to

1218
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
what we've built already is a way to
 

1219
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,269
what we've built already is a way to
spawn silver fish

1220
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:47,279
spawn silver fish
 

1221
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,430
spawn silver fish
we can control when they spawn using our

1222
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,440
we can control when they spawn using our
 

1223
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,110
we can control when they spawn using our
lighting system

1224
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,120
lighting system
 

1225
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,549
lighting system
and then the water stream and their

1226
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:52,559
and then the water stream and their
 

1227
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,110
and then the water stream and their
pathfinding will bring them all to this

1228
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,120
pathfinding will bring them all to this
 

1229
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,070
pathfinding will bring them all to this
one spot

1230
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
one spot
 

1231
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,909
one spot
here they all concentrate here

1232
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919
here they all concentrate here
 

1233
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,950
here they all concentrate here
so beyond that in our factory we need a

1234
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
so beyond that in our factory we need a
 

1235
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,830
so beyond that in our factory we need a
way

1236
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
way
 

1237
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,110
way
to get them into the blocks the stone

1238
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,120
to get them into the blocks the stone
 

1239
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,789
to get them into the blocks the stone
cobblestone or these stone bricks

1240
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:10,799
cobblestone or these stone bricks
 

1241
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,110
cobblestone or these stone bricks
so that we can store their xp

1242
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,120

 

1243
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,909

and basically we're going to need lots

1244
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:17,919
and basically we're going to need lots
 

1245
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,669
and basically we're going to need lots
and lots and lots of blocks

1246
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:19,679
and lots and lots of blocks
 

1247
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,310
and lots and lots of blocks
because this thing's going to spawn an

1248
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,320
because this thing's going to spawn an
 

1249
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,110
because this thing's going to spawn an
infinite amount

1250
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
infinite amount
 

1251
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,590
infinite amount
of silver fish so ideally we want an

1252
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:25,600
of silver fish so ideally we want an
 

1253
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,909
of silver fish so ideally we want an
infinite amount of blocks so

1254
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:27,919
infinite amount of blocks so
 

1255
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,230
infinite amount of blocks so
the way i thought of doing that is just

1256
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
the way i thought of doing that is just
 

1257
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,110
the way i thought of doing that is just
to have

1258
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,120
to have
 

1259
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,750
to have
a smooth stone generator or cobblestone

1260
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:33,760
a smooth stone generator or cobblestone
 

1261
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,230
a smooth stone generator or cobblestone
generator whatever you choose

1262
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:36,240
generator whatever you choose
 

1263
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,110
generator whatever you choose
to create an infinite amount of blocks

1264
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,120
to create an infinite amount of blocks
 

1265
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,230
to create an infinite amount of blocks
for them to

1266
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,240
for them to
 

1267
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,430
for them to
hide in

1268
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440

 

1269
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,909

hello they're having a party over there

1270
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:47,919
hello they're having a party over there
 

1271
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,669
hello they're having a party over there
i blocked this area all up so that

1272
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:49,679
i blocked this area all up so that
 

1273
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,630
i blocked this area all up so that
creepers can't get here

1274
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,640
creepers can't get here
 

1275
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,029
creepers can't get here
but they can still look um yeah

1276
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:57,039
but they can still look um yeah
 

1277
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,029
but they can still look um yeah
so i was thinking there's two good ways

1278
00:28:59,029 --> 00:28:59,039
so i was thinking there's two good ways
 

1279
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,269
so i was thinking there's two good ways
of doing this really uh one would be to

1280
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:01,279
of doing this really uh one would be to
 

1281
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,149
of doing this really uh one would be to
have a room of cobblestone generators

1282
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:04,159
have a room of cobblestone generators
 

1283
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,269
have a room of cobblestone generators
um creating big like 12 by 12

1284
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:07,279
um creating big like 12 by 12
 

1285
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,470
um creating big like 12 by 12
slabs of smooth stone

1286
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
slabs of smooth stone
 

1287
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,510
slabs of smooth stone
that spider can get here and then

1288
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:13,520
that spider can get here and then
 

1289
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,590
that spider can get here and then
let the silverfish loose in the room and

1290
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:15,600
let the silverfish loose in the room and
 

1291
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,710
let the silverfish loose in the room and
let them wander around

1292
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:16,720
let them wander around
 

1293
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,070
let them wander around
and they'll randomly enter blocks and

1294
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
and they'll randomly enter blocks and
 

1295
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,110
and they'll randomly enter blocks and
uh then when you start the chain

1296
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,120
uh then when you start the chain
 

1297
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,149
uh then when you start the chain
reaction of

1298
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:24,159
reaction of
 

1299
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,549
reaction of
hitting the silverfish and making them

1300
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:26,559
hitting the silverfish and making them
 

1301
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,750
hitting the silverfish and making them
come out of the blocks

1302
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:29,760

 

1303
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,990

the slabs will get full of holes and

1304
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,000
the slabs will get full of holes and
 

1305
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,750
the slabs will get full of holes and
then the cobblestone generators will

1306
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:35,760
then the cobblestone generators will
 

1307
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,430
then the cobblestone generators will
create new blocks and make it all solid

1308
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:37,440
create new blocks and make it all solid
 

1309
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,990
create new blocks and make it all solid
again to restart the process

1310
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
again to restart the process
 

1311
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,110
again to restart the process
that's one idea that's the easy way of

1312
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,120
that's one idea that's the easy way of
 

1313
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,029
that's one idea that's the easy way of
doing it

1314
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
doing it
 

1315
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,070
doing it
there's mobs everywhere oh yeah and when

1316
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
there's mobs everywhere oh yeah and when
 

1317
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,269
there's mobs everywhere oh yeah and when
you break a block

1318
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:49,279
you break a block
 

1319
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,990
you break a block
that has a silverfish in or when you hit

1320
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
that has a silverfish in or when you hit
 

1321
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,230
that has a silverfish in or when you hit
a silverfish

1322
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:54,240
a silverfish
 

1323
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,590
a silverfish
and not kill them the game will check

1324
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:57,600
and not kill them the game will check
 

1325
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,269
and not kill them the game will check
a 10 by 10

1326
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:01,279

 

1327
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,110

area all around them like all around the

1328
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
area all around them like all around the
 

1329
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,669
area all around them like all around the
sides of the silverfish and a five above

1330
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:05,679
sides of the silverfish and a five above
 

1331
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,830
sides of the silverfish and a five above
and five below five blocks above and

1332
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:07,840
and five below five blocks above and
 

1333
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,029
and five below five blocks above and
below

1334
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:09,039
below
 

1335
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,389
below
the silver fish for any more silverfish

1336
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:12,399
the silver fish for any more silverfish
 

1337
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,510
the silver fish for any more silverfish
blocks and if there's

1338
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:13,520
blocks and if there's
 

1339
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,549
blocks and if there's
any in that range

1340
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
any in that range
 

1341
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,389
any in that range
then there's a possibility of them

1342
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:18,399
then there's a possibility of them
 

1343
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:26,789
then there's a possibility of them
coming out of other blocks

1344
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:26,799

 

1345
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,310

so in that way you can control uh where

1346
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,320
so in that way you can control uh where
 

1347
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,669
so in that way you can control uh where
they come out of blocks so you could

1348
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:33,679
they come out of blocks so you could
 

1349
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,710
they come out of blocks so you could
potentially set up rooms like if you

1350
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:36,720
potentially set up rooms like if you
 

1351
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,710
potentially set up rooms like if you
wanted to control how many levels you

1352
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:38,720
wanted to control how many levels you
 

1353
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,269
wanted to control how many levels you
gain

1354
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:39,279
gain
 

1355
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,430
gain
from breaking all the silverfish blocks

1356
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,440
from breaking all the silverfish blocks
 

1357
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,909
from breaking all the silverfish blocks
takes 4 625 xp to get to level

1358
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:47,919
takes 4 625 xp to get to level
 

1359
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,110
takes 4 625 xp to get to level
50 from level zero that's

1360
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,120
50 from level zero that's
 

1361
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,830
50 from level zero that's
would be 925 blocks you would need in a

1362
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:53,840
would be 925 blocks you would need in a
 

1363
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,669
would be 925 blocks you would need in a
room

1364
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679
room
 

1365
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,509
room
to make that happen because each

1366
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:57,519
to make that happen because each
 

1367
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,830
to make that happen because each
silverfish is 5xp

1368
00:30:59,830 --> 00:30:59,840
silverfish is 5xp
 

1369
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,590
silverfish is 5xp
so you could have several rooms fill up

1370
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:03,600
so you could have several rooms fill up
 

1371
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,110
so you could have several rooms fill up
and then every time you want to get a

1372
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,120
and then every time you want to get a
 

1373
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,789
and then every time you want to get a
level 50 enchantment you just go in the

1374
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:06,799
level 50 enchantment you just go in the
 

1375
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,830
level 50 enchantment you just go in the
room

1376
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:07,840
room
 

1377
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,310
room
uh make all the all the silverfish come

1378
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,320
uh make all the all the silverfish come
 

1379
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,190
uh make all the all the silverfish come
out

1380
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
out
 

1381
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,549
out
and you'll go from zero to 50 that way

1382
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:16,559
and you'll go from zero to 50 that way
 

1383
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,070
and you'll go from zero to 50 that way
and just space the rooms far enough

1384
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,080
and just space the rooms far enough
 

1385
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,549
and just space the rooms far enough
apart where uh breaking them in

1386
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:20,559
apart where uh breaking them in
 

1387
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,389
apart where uh breaking them in
or killing the silverfish in one room

1388
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:22,399
or killing the silverfish in one room
 

1389
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,470
or killing the silverfish in one room
won't affect them

1390
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,480
won't affect them
 

1391
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,110
won't affect them
in the other room i'm rambling a lot i'm

1392
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,120
in the other room i'm rambling a lot i'm
 

1393
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,430
in the other room i'm rambling a lot i'm
sorry

1394
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,440
sorry
 

1395
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,509
sorry
but the way we're doing this one is a

1396
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:31,519
but the way we're doing this one is a
 

1397
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,470
but the way we're doing this one is a
little bit different

1398
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:32,480
little bit different
 

1399
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,509
little bit different
this is the second idea i had

1400
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:35,519
this is the second idea i had
 

1401
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,830
this is the second idea i had
this is more controlled we're gonna make

1402
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:37,840
this is more controlled we're gonna make
 

1403
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,509
this is more controlled we're gonna make
the silverfish fall on this

1404
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
the silverfish fall on this
 

1405
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,110
the silverfish fall on this
sandstone here then where this glass

1406
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,120
sandstone here then where this glass
 

1407
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,230
sandstone here then where this glass
block is we're gonna

1408
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:44,240
block is we're gonna
 

1409
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,149
block is we're gonna
have our infinite line of smooth stone

1410
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:48,159
have our infinite line of smooth stone
 

1411
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,909
have our infinite line of smooth stone
from a generator

1412
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:49,919
from a generator
 

1413
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,350
from a generator
over there

1414
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:53,360

 

1415
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,269

and we'll put a bud switch next to this

1416
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:57,279
and we'll put a bud switch next to this
 

1417
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,710
and we'll put a bud switch next to this
smooth stone block here and it will

1418
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:00,720
smooth stone block here and it will
 

1419
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,669
smooth stone block here and it will
detect when a

1420
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:01,679
detect when a
 

1421
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,549
detect when a
silverfish enters the block and then it

1422
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:04,559
silverfish enters the block and then it
 

1423
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:04,950
silverfish enters the block and then it
will

1424
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:04,960
will
 

1425
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,269
will
tell the generator to create a new block

1426
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:07,279
tell the generator to create a new block
 

1427
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,950
tell the generator to create a new block
and it will push

1428
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
and it will push
 

1429
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,990
and it will push
silverfish block away and

1430
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,000
silverfish block away and
 

1431
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,830
silverfish block away and
put a fresh new smooth stone block

1432
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:15,840
put a fresh new smooth stone block
 

1433
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,789
put a fresh new smooth stone block
in its way for more silver fish to enter

1434
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:18,799
in its way for more silver fish to enter
 

1435
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,710
in its way for more silver fish to enter
and every time that happens

1436
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
and every time that happens
 

1437
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,870
and every time that happens
it will keep creating a chain of

1438
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:22,880
it will keep creating a chain of
 

1439
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,950
it will keep creating a chain of
silverfish blocks and then we can

1440
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:24,960
silverfish blocks and then we can
 

1441
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,350
silverfish blocks and then we can
clump them together in like big 12 by 12

1442
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
clump them together in like big 12 by 12
 

1443
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,630
clump them together in like big 12 by 12
by 12 cubes

1444
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:30,640

 

1445
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,149

at the end of all this so that's the

1446
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:32,159
at the end of all this so that's the
 

1447
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,430
at the end of all this so that's the
plan that's what we're trying to do here

1448
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:35,440
plan that's what we're trying to do here
 

1449
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,509
plan that's what we're trying to do here
it's very complicated actually and

1450
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:37,519
it's very complicated actually and
 

1451
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,269
it's very complicated actually and
getting this timed rate is going to be

1452
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:39,279
getting this timed rate is going to be
 

1453
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,870
getting this timed rate is going to be
very difficult

1454
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:40,880
very difficult
 

1455
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,789
very difficult
as i've played around with this before i

1456
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:42,799
as i've played around with this before i
 

1457
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,710
as i've played around with this before i
had a lot of trouble with it

1458
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:46,720

 

1459
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,789

okay so i think we're ready to build on

1460
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:48,799
okay so i think we're ready to build on
 

1461
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,070
okay so i think we're ready to build on
some more here

1462
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,080
some more here
 

1463
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,710
some more here
the next step to this is going to be

1464
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:52,720
the next step to this is going to be
 

1465
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,669
the next step to this is going to be
probably putting the

1466
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:53,679
probably putting the
 

1467
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,909
probably putting the
cobble stone generator smooth stone

1468
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919
cobble stone generator smooth stone
 

1469
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:56,950
cobble stone generator smooth stone
generator

1470
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:56,960
generator
 

1471
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,509
generator
if i say cobblestone generator i mean

1472
00:32:59,509 --> 00:32:59,519
if i say cobblestone generator i mean
 

1473
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,710
if i say cobblestone generator i mean
smooth stone

1474
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:02,720

 

1475
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,350

use that word inter changingly or

1476
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,360
use that word inter changingly or
 

1477
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,710
use that word inter changingly or
whatever

1478
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:06,720
whatever
 

1479
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,149
whatever
um i think this is a good enough

1480
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:10,159
um i think this is a good enough
 

1481
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,230
um i think this is a good enough
distance here if i remember right

1482
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,240
distance here if i remember right
 

1483
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,070
distance here if i remember right
i have built this before but i'm going

1484
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,080
i have built this before but i'm going
 

1485
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,230
i have built this before but i'm going
by memory

1486
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,240
by memory
 

1487
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,269
by memory
uh and i played around quite a bit with

1488
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:19,279
uh and i played around quite a bit with
 

1489
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,470
uh and i played around quite a bit with
different

1490
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:20,480
different
 

1491
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,430
different
ways of making the generator it's really

1492
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,440
ways of making the generator it's really
 

1493
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,430
ways of making the generator it's really
important that it's quick

1494
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,440
important that it's quick
 

1495
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,269
important that it's quick
and i was having a hard time making one

1496
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:29,279
and i was having a hard time making one
 

1497
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,669
and i was having a hard time making one
that could quickly produce blocks

1498
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:33,679

 

1499
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,269

came up with this design it's pretty

1500
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:35,279
came up with this design it's pretty
 

1501
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,350
came up with this design it's pretty
good it's not perfect

1502
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:37,360
good it's not perfect
 

1503
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,070
good it's not perfect
but it seems to do the trick not too bad

1504
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,080
but it seems to do the trick not too bad
 

1505
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,029
but it seems to do the trick not too bad
and it has a

1506
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:41,039
and it has a
 

1507
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,750
and it has a
safety to it as well if if it ever

1508
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:43,760
safety to it as well if if it ever
 

1509
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,110
safety to it as well if if it ever
glitches out where it doesn't

1510
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,120
glitches out where it doesn't
 

1511
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,029
glitches out where it doesn't
uh or where the lava flows through the

1512
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:49,039
uh or where the lava flows through the
 

1513
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,230
uh or where the lava flows through the
water

1514
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,240
water
 

1515
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,509
water
it's able to correct itself because it's

1516
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:53,519
it's able to correct itself because it's
 

1517
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,149
it's able to correct itself because it's
uh two generators into one

1518
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:58,159

 

1519
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,230

oh i'll be able to explain a little

1520
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,240
oh i'll be able to explain a little
 

1521
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,830
oh i'll be able to explain a little
better as we build it here

1522
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:01,840
better as we build it here
 

1523
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,230
better as we build it here
um so lava goes above the piston arms

1524
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:06,240
um so lava goes above the piston arms
 

1525
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,269
um so lava goes above the piston arms
there

1526
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:07,279
there
 

1527
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:13,909
there
and another one over here

1528
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:13,919

 

1529
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,109

like that lava will go right there and

1530
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:17,119
like that lava will go right there and
 

1531
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,510
like that lava will go right there and
right there okay

1532
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:21,520
right there okay
 

1533
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,710
right there okay
and then we need a place for the water

1534
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:24,720
and then we need a place for the water
 

1535
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,869
and then we need a place for the water
the water goes to the left and right of

1536
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:26,879
the water goes to the left and right of
 

1537
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,710
the water goes to the left and right of
this piston here this is the main one

1538
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:28,720
this piston here this is the main one
 

1539
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,869
this piston here this is the main one
that pushes the block

1540
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:32,879

 

1541
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,950

let's see we'll just put that there for

1542
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:34,960
let's see we'll just put that there for
 

1543
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,589
let's see we'll just put that there for
the water

1544
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:37,599

 

1545
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,190

i think we can use glass for this if i

1546
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,200
i think we can use glass for this if i
 

1547
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,510
i think we can use glass for this if i
remember right

1548
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:43,520

 

1549
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,589

just so we can see what's going on um

1550
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:47,599
just so we can see what's going on um
 

1551
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,790
just so we can see what's going on um
water will go there flow down one block

1552
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:52,800
water will go there flow down one block
 

1553
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,270
water will go there flow down one block
so we'll put another one like that

1554
00:34:59,270 --> 00:34:59,280

 

1555
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,190

yeah if it can't keep up this thing is

1556
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
yeah if it can't keep up this thing is
 

1557
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,470
yeah if it can't keep up this thing is
going to jam

1558
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:02,480
going to jam
 

1559
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,030
going to jam
up and stop working so we need a very

1560
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,040
up and stop working so we need a very
 

1561
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,069
up and stop working so we need a very
quick one

1562
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:06,079
quick one
 

1563
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,750
quick one
or else we need to really regulate

1564
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:09,760
or else we need to really regulate
 

1565
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,990
or else we need to really regulate
the rate that silverfish blocks can be

1566
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,000
the rate that silverfish blocks can be
 

1567
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,430
the rate that silverfish blocks can be
created otherwise

1568
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:13,440
created otherwise
 

1569
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,069
created otherwise
it will get ahead of itself

1570
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:18,079

 

1571
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,069

okay be careful the shovel

1572
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:22,079
okay be careful the shovel
 

1573
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,670
okay be careful the shovel
i'm so sad you can't pick up glass

1574
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:23,680
i'm so sad you can't pick up glass
 

1575
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,589
i'm so sad you can't pick up glass
blocks with silk touch anymore that was

1576
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:25,599
blocks with silk touch anymore that was
 

1577
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,230
blocks with silk touch anymore that was
uh they're really nerfing silk touch you

1578
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,240
uh they're really nerfing silk touch you
 

1579
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,750
uh they're really nerfing silk touch you
can't pick up silver silverfish blocks

1580
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:29,760
can't pick up silver silverfish blocks
 

1581
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:29,990
can't pick up silver silverfish blocks
with

1582
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,000
with
 

1583
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,670
with
them ir or ice they need to

1584
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:33,680
them ir or ice they need to
 

1585
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,270
them ir or ice they need to
get that stuff back that's why silk

1586
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,280
get that stuff back that's why silk
 

1587
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,950
get that stuff back that's why silk
touch was so awesome

1588
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:38,960

 

1589
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,390

okay water there water there

1590
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:42,400
okay water there water there
 

1591
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,589
okay water there water there
lava above

1592
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:45,599
lava above
 

1593
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,990
lava above
i think it's safe to put it now

1594
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,000

 

1595
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,310

yep make smooth stone

1596
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:54,320

 

1597
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,670

pistons push it to the middle we will

1598
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:57,680
pistons push it to the middle we will
 

1599
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,150
pistons push it to the middle we will
need

1600
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,160
need
 

1601
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,790
need
to put furnaces on both sides of these

1602
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:00,800
to put furnaces on both sides of these
 

1603
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,670
to put furnaces on both sides of these
two so that

1604
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:01,680
two so that
 

1605
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,349
two so that
uh the pistons can't push each other

1606
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359
uh the pistons can't push each other
 

1607
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,190
uh the pistons can't push each other
one of them will be dominant over the

1608
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,200
one of them will be dominant over the
 

1609
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,349
one of them will be dominant over the
other one

1610
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:09,359
other one
 

1611
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,829
other one
um so

1612
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:15,839

 

1613
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,470

we'll we'll see when it's set up here

1614
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:20,480

 

1615
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,630

okay furnace over here

1616
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:24,640
okay furnace over here
 

1617
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,990
okay furnace over here
not that it really matters we have a

1618
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,000
not that it really matters we have a
 

1619
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,150
not that it really matters we have a
wall behind but if i move that

1620
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,160
wall behind but if i move that
 

1621
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,230
wall behind but if i move that
i want it to work still and one

1622
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
i want it to work still and one
 

1623
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:38,150
i want it to work still and one
over here okay

1624
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,160

 

1625
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,069

it's taking shape

1626
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:42,079

 

1627
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,710

put that there and

1628
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:46,720

 

1629
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,190

i think that's it that's good okay now

1630
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,200
i think that's it that's good okay now
 

1631
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,829
i think that's it that's good okay now
we need to wire it

1632
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:52,839

 

1633
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,150

um

1634
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,160
um
 

1635
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,230
um
i'm refreshing i wonder if i can cover

1636
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,240
i'm refreshing i wonder if i can cover
 

1637
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,150
i'm refreshing i wonder if i can cover
that i think i'm able to

1638
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,160
that i think i'm able to
 

1639
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,349
that i think i'm able to
like i said i'm building this from

1640
00:36:59,349 --> 00:36:59,359
like i said i'm building this from
 

1641
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,630
like i said i'm building this from
memory so i might make a mistake

1642
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:02,640
memory so i might make a mistake
 

1643
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,829
memory so i might make a mistake
uh we can put sandstone over top

1644
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:06,839
uh we can put sandstone over top
 

1645
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,510
uh we can put sandstone over top
here

1646
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:09,520
here
 

1647
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,710
here
so we need to run a wire to that arm we

1648
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:12,720
so we need to run a wire to that arm we
 

1649
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,190
so we need to run a wire to that arm we
probably

1650
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,200
probably
 

1651
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,710
probably
actually need this to be sandstone

1652
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:16,720
actually need this to be sandstone
 

1653
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,230
actually need this to be sandstone
and one over here

1654
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,240

 

1655
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,910

okay so i'll wire this and then i'll be

1656
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:21,920
okay so i'll wire this and then i'll be
 

1657
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,349
okay so i'll wire this and then i'll be
back probably take a few seconds only

1658
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:25,359
back probably take a few seconds only
 

1659
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,910
back probably take a few seconds only
minutes maybe hours i don't know it'll

1660
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:27,920
minutes maybe hours i don't know it'll
 

1661
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,310
minutes maybe hours i don't know it'll
take a little while

1662
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:30,320
take a little while
 

1663
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,150
take a little while
not overly exciting

1664
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,160

 

1665
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,910

there seems to be a real party up there

1666
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:35,920
there seems to be a real party up there
 

1667
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,069
there seems to be a real party up there
now we got two creepers and a skeleton i

1668
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:38,079
now we got two creepers and a skeleton i
 

1669
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,030
now we got two creepers and a skeleton i
don't know how they keep

1670
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,040
don't know how they keep
 

1671
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,550
don't know how they keep
getting there so there they must really

1672
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:42,560
getting there so there they must really
 

1673
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,270
getting there so there they must really
be tracking me

1674
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,280
be tracking me
 

1675
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,790
be tracking me
it's amaze the new ai is pretty amazing

1676
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:48,800
it's amaze the new ai is pretty amazing
 

1677
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,550
it's amaze the new ai is pretty amazing
yeah i think this is all ready to go

1678
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:50,560
yeah i think this is all ready to go
 

1679
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,470
yeah i think this is all ready to go
here so yeah there's going to be a

1680
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:52,480
here so yeah there's going to be a
 

1681
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,109
here so yeah there's going to be a
dominant

1682
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:53,119
dominant
 

1683
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,550
dominant
piston because both these pistons get

1684
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:56,560
piston because both these pistons get
 

1685
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,310
piston because both these pistons get
activated with the same delay

1686
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:58,320
activated with the same delay
 

1687
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,270
activated with the same delay
so the game has to decide which one gets

1688
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:01,280
so the game has to decide which one gets
 

1689
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,790
so the game has to decide which one gets
actually gets pushed because they can't

1690
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:02,800
actually gets pushed because they can't
 

1691
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,670
actually gets pushed because they can't
both

1692
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:03,680
both
 

1693
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,109
both
push to the same block but if this thing

1694
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:07,119
push to the same block but if this thing
 

1695
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,470
push to the same block but if this thing
is running so quick

1696
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:08,480
is running so quick
 

1697
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,310
is running so quick
that one of these doesn't have a block

1698
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,320
that one of these doesn't have a block
 

1699
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,670
that one of these doesn't have a block
anymore

1700
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:11,680
anymore
 

1701
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,910
anymore
the other one will still push it and

1702
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:15,920
the other one will still push it and
 

1703
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,390
the other one will still push it and
in that way we can have two blocks being

1704
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:18,400
in that way we can have two blocks being
 

1705
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,109
in that way we can have two blocks being
created

1706
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:19,119
created
 

1707
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,630
created
at a time up to two and it

1708
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:22,640
at a time up to two and it
 

1709
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,630
at a time up to two and it
it'll create a smooth stone a little bit

1710
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:24,640
it'll create a smooth stone a little bit
 

1711
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,150
it'll create a smooth stone a little bit
quicker than if you were just to have

1712
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,160
quicker than if you were just to have
 

1713
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,550
quicker than if you were just to have
one

1714
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:28,560

 

1715
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,109

and i got a button here the middle one

1716
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:31,119
and i got a button here the middle one
 

1717
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,310
and i got a button here the middle one
is set at a

1718
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,320
is set at a
 

1719
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,270
is set at a
two delay i think that's the way this is

1720
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,280
two delay i think that's the way this is
 

1721
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,349
two delay i think that's the way this is
supposed to be

1722
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:37,359
supposed to be
 

1723
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,750
supposed to be
i hope

1724
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:41,760

 

1725
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,150

okay maybe we'll push it a few more

1726
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,160
okay maybe we'll push it a few more
 

1727
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,870
okay maybe we'll push it a few more
times

1728
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:44,880
times
 

1729
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:53,030
times
heard the sizzle

1730
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,040

 

1731
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,790

so that's what i mean when i say the

1732
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:54,800
so that's what i mean when i say the
 

1733
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,270
so that's what i mean when i say the
lava overtakes the water

1734
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,280
lava overtakes the water
 

1735
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,589
lava overtakes the water
if that happens no smooth stone gets

1736
00:38:59,589 --> 00:38:59,599
if that happens no smooth stone gets
 

1737
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,589
if that happens no smooth stone gets
created

1738
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:01,599
created
 

1739
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,230
created
and if you only had the one that would

1740
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:04,240
and if you only had the one that would
 

1741
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,230
and if you only had the one that would
be it the thing would be jammed up

1742
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,240
be it the thing would be jammed up
 

1743
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,230
be it the thing would be jammed up
but if you have two

1744
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:10,240
but if you have two
 

1745
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,710
but if you have two
it allows the block to still get pushed

1746
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:12,720
it allows the block to still get pushed
 

1747
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,589
it allows the block to still get pushed
by one of them

1748
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:13,599
by one of them
 

1749
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,150
by one of them
and the lava gets cut by the piston arm

1750
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,160
and the lava gets cut by the piston arm
 

1751
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,870
and the lava gets cut by the piston arm
so then it is able to fix itself

1752
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:18,880
so then it is able to fix itself
 

1753
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,390
so then it is able to fix itself
on the on the corrupted one

1754
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:22,400
on the on the corrupted one
 

1755
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,550
on the on the corrupted one
so that's good and we are making smooth

1756
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:24,560
so that's good and we are making smooth
 

1757
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,349
so that's good and we are making smooth
stone nice

1758
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:29,359
stone nice
 

1759
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,109
stone nice
okay so the silverfish will come down

1760
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:31,119
okay so the silverfish will come down
 

1761
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,710
okay so the silverfish will come down
here they can enter from the side of the

1762
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:32,720
here they can enter from the side of the
 

1763
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,349
here they can enter from the side of the
block

1764
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:33,359
block
 

1765
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:38,870
block
so that's that's all good um

1766
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:38,880

 

1767
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,950

next thing we gotta hook up is the bud

1768
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:40,960
next thing we gotta hook up is the bud
 

1769
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,790
next thing we gotta hook up is the bud
switch

1770
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:44,800

 

1771
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,430

yeah so the bud switch goes right on

1772
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:47,440
yeah so the bud switch goes right on
 

1773
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,750
yeah so the bud switch goes right on
this block here this is next to the

1774
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:49,760
this block here this is next to the
 

1775
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,349
this block here this is next to the
silverfish chamber

1776
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,359
silverfish chamber
 

1777
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,630
silverfish chamber
in here so

1778
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:54,640
in here so
 

1779
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,910
in here so
sticky piston put a block on it

1780
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:57,920
sticky piston put a block on it
 

1781
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,630
sticky piston put a block on it
and that will extend to

1782
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:02,640

 

1783
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,670

um let's see

1784
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:07,680

 

1785
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,910

i think that's where we want it be a

1786
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:09,920
i think that's where we want it be a
 

1787
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,829
i think that's where we want it be a
redstone torch

1788
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:11,839
redstone torch
 

1789
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,150
redstone torch
and then we need it to reset

1790
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,160
and then we need it to reset
 

1791
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,270
and then we need it to reset
so um

1792
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:19,280
so um
 

1793
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,190
so um
if there is a repeater

1794
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:23,200

 

1795
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,470

oh dang what did we hit

1796
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:26,480

 

1797
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,990

oh there it is gotta be really careful

1798
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,000
oh there it is gotta be really careful
 

1799
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,069
oh there it is gotta be really careful
these tools they're too good

1800
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:34,079

 

1801
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,550

way too good okay put that there

1802
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:38,560
way too good okay put that there
 

1803
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,710
way too good okay put that there
repeater i think we want the repeater at

1804
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:40,720
repeater i think we want the repeater at
 

1805
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,910
repeater i think we want the repeater at
one

1806
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:41,920
one
 

1807
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,190
one
delay as low as possible

1808
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,200
delay as low as possible
 

1809
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,910
delay as low as possible
um that will go to a block

1810
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:49,920
um that will go to a block
 

1811
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,109
um that will go to a block
and we need to invert the signal

1812
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:53,119
and we need to invert the signal
 

1813
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,710
and we need to invert the signal
so we'll get one more of these

1814
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:56,720

 

1815
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,150

i think over here

1816
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,160

 

1817
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,510

and then

1818
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:03,520

 

1819
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,510

i'm going to run that signal to the

1820
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:05,520
i'm going to run that signal to the
 

1821
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,790
i'm going to run that signal to the
piston

1822
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:08,800

 

1823
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,349

i keep doing that

1824
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:13,359

 

1825
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,670

ah so hard working in this cave

1826
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:17,680
ah so hard working in this cave
 

1827
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,589
ah so hard working in this cave
everything's a mess these my good blocks

1828
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:21,599
everything's a mess these my good blocks
 

1829
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,910
everything's a mess these my good blocks
too

1830
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:25,920

 

1831
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,230

yup okay where's my wire

1832
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,240

 

1833
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,470

so we can grab the power from there and

1834
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:34,480
so we can grab the power from there and
 

1835
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,510
so we can grab the power from there and
run it over

1836
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:35,520
run it over
 

1837
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,430
run it over
to the piston we want it diagonal of the

1838
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:37,440
to the piston we want it diagonal of the
 

1839
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,950
to the piston we want it diagonal of the
piston

1840
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:38,960
piston
 

1841
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,390
piston
so that whenever block gets placed next

1842
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:42,400
so that whenever block gets placed next
 

1843
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,030
so that whenever block gets placed next
to it it updates

1844
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,040
to it it updates
 

1845
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,309
to it it updates
and does that okay so that'll send out a

1846
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:48,319
and does that okay so that'll send out a
 

1847
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,069
and does that okay so that'll send out a
pulse

1848
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:50,079
pulse
 

1849
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,510
pulse
and now we want that pulse to go to here

1850
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520
and now we want that pulse to go to here
 

1851
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,430
and now we want that pulse to go to here
so that it'll activate the cobblestone

1852
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:55,440
so that it'll activate the cobblestone
 

1853
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,790
so that it'll activate the cobblestone
generator

1854
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:56,800
generator
 

1855
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,750
generator
so we're going to start another path

1856
00:41:59,750 --> 00:41:59,760
so we're going to start another path
 

1857
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,710
so we're going to start another path
over here

1858
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:02,720
over here
 

1859
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,309
over here
um

1860
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:06,319

 

1861
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,390

can you place redstone on yeah you can

1862
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:10,400

 

1863
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,589

okay that might be a good idea

1864
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
okay that might be a good idea
 

1865
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,550
okay that might be a good idea
i think we can do it with no or not too

1866
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:16,560
i think we can do it with no or not too
 

1867
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,349
i think we can do it with no or not too
much delay

1868
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:19,359

 

1869
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,309

i think if we do that it'll work so

1870
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:22,319
i think if we do that it'll work so
 

1871
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,829
i think if we do that it'll work so
let's see if it makes a smooth stone

1872
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:23,839
let's see if it makes a smooth stone
 

1873
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,470
let's see if it makes a smooth stone
when we update

1874
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:26,480
when we update
 

1875
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,829
when we update
yeah awesome

1876
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:31,839
yeah awesome
 

1877
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,270
yeah awesome
so that's going to happen every time a

1878
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,280
so that's going to happen every time a
 

1879
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,550
so that's going to happen every time a
silverfish enters a block

1880
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:36,560
silverfish enters a block
 

1881
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,550
silverfish enters a block
so technically i think this is all ready

1882
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:38,560
so technically i think this is all ready
 

1883
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,390
so technically i think this is all ready
to go but it's not going to work at the

1884
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
to go but it's not going to work at the
 

1885
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,510
to go but it's not going to work at the
states

1886
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,520
states
 

1887
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,630
states
for very long and that's the next thing

1888
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:44,640
for very long and that's the next thing
 

1889
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,750
for very long and that's the next thing
we have to deal with

1890
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:47,760

 

1891
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,990

let's see what should we do

1892
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,000
let's see what should we do
 

1893
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,750
let's see what should we do
we should test this to make sure it

1894
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:53,760
we should test this to make sure it
 

1895
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,349
we should test this to make sure it
works

1896
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:57,359

 

1897
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,630

uh when i was playing around with this

1898
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:58,640
uh when i was playing around with this
 

1899
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,470
uh when i was playing around with this
before i was doing in creative mode and

1900
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:00,480
before i was doing in creative mode and
 

1901
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,349
before i was doing in creative mode and
obviously

1902
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:01,359
obviously
 

1903
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,710
obviously
things that are a bit different with

1904
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:02,720
things that are a bit different with
 

1905
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,870
things that are a bit different with
this we'll have to

1906
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:06,880

 

1907
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,030

keep our distance otherwise they'll be

1908
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,040
keep our distance otherwise they'll be
 

1909
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,990
keep our distance otherwise they'll be
aggro at us

1910
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,000
aggro at us
 

1911
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,069
aggro at us
and they won't enter the blocks

1912
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:16,079

 

1913
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,550

unless they're not tracking you now i

1914
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:18,560
unless they're not tracking you now i
 

1915
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:25,109
unless they're not tracking you now i
almost think he's not tracking me now

1916
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:25,119

 

1917
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,750

it's hard to say

1918
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:29,760

 

1919
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,950

let's see uh

1920
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:32,960
let's see uh
 

1921
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,390
let's see uh
and it might take a while before it

1922
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:34,400
and it might take a while before it
 

1923
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,150
and it might take a while before it
really starts going that once the

1924
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:36,160
really starts going that once the
 

1925
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,630
really starts going that once the
concentration of silverfish increases

1926
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:38,640
concentration of silverfish increases
 

1927
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,750
concentration of silverfish increases
they're more likely to

1928
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:41,760
they're more likely to
 

1929
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:50,710
they're more likely to
touch that block there and then enter it

1930
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:50,720

 

1931
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,750

might be tracking me i can't quite tell

1932
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:53,760
might be tracking me i can't quite tell
 

1933
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,589
might be tracking me i can't quite tell
there we go

1934
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:57,599

 

1935
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,030

and there we go so these are silverfish

1936
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,040
and there we go so these are silverfish
 

1937
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:07,030
and there we go so these are silverfish
blocks now

1938
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:07,040

 

1939
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,630

pretty cool huh

1940
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:10,640

 

1941
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,270

but it's not gonna run for very long

1942
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:13,280
but it's not gonna run for very long
 

1943
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,270
but it's not gonna run for very long
like this it has problems

1944
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280

 

1945
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,150

all right so i'm gonna try to

1946
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,160
all right so i'm gonna try to
 

1947
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,750
all right so i'm gonna try to
demonstrate the problem with the way

1948
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:19,760
demonstrate the problem with the way
 

1949
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,510
demonstrate the problem with the way
this is set up right now why it won't

1950
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:21,520
this is set up right now why it won't
 

1951
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,030
this is set up right now why it won't
run

1952
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,040
run
 

1953
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,150
run
for the long term like several minutes

1954
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:26,160
for the long term like several minutes
 

1955
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,069
for the long term like several minutes
or hours

1956
00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:28,079
or hours
 

1957
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,670
or hours
we have about 21

1958
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:31,680
we have about 21
 

1959
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,870
we have about 21
maybe 16 silverfish in here they're not

1960
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:34,880
maybe 16 silverfish in here they're not
 

1961
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,230
maybe 16 silverfish in here they're not
able to enter the block right now

1962
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:36,240
able to enter the block right now
 

1963
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,150
able to enter the block right now
because i'm standing

1964
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,160
because i'm standing
 

1965
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,109
because i'm standing
next to it and they're tracking me this

1966
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:41,119
next to it and they're tracking me this
 

1967
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:41,910
next to it and they're tracking me this
is a

1968
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:41,920
is a
 

1969
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,069
is a
stone block there's no silver fish in it

1970
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:44,079
stone block there's no silver fish in it
 

1971
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,510
stone block there's no silver fish in it
yet

1972
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:45,520
yet
 

1973
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,510
yet
as soon as i back away they'll be still

1974
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520
as soon as i back away they'll be still
 

1975
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,550
as soon as i back away they'll be still
be able to enter

1976
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:50,560
be able to enter
 

1977
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,990
be able to enter
and they'll all enter really quickly

1978
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,000
and they'll all enter really quickly
 

1979
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,630
and they'll all enter really quickly
that's silver fish and that is also

1980
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:56,640
that's silver fish and that is also
 

1981
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,430
that's silver fish and that is also
silver fish

1982
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:57,440
silver fish
 

1983
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,550
silver fish
so they beat the bud switch basically

1984
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:02,560
so they beat the bud switch basically
 

1985
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,710
so they beat the bud switch basically
they're able to enter the new stone

1986
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:04,720
they're able to enter the new stone
 

1987
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,950
they're able to enter the new stone
block before the bud switch

1988
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:06,960
block before the bud switch
 

1989
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,950
block before the bud switch
resets and it is able to detect them

1990
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:10,960
resets and it is able to detect them
 

1991
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,670
resets and it is able to detect them
and there really is no way of dealing

1992
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:13,680
and there really is no way of dealing
 

1993
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,990
and there really is no way of dealing
with that

1994
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:16,000
with that
 

1995
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,670
with that
because the bud switch needs a certain

1996
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:17,680
because the bud switch needs a certain
 

1997
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,829
because the bud switch needs a certain
amount of delay to work

1998
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:19,839
amount of delay to work
 

1999
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,910
amount of delay to work
the signal needs to be inverted and you

2000
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:21,920
the signal needs to be inverted and you
 

2001
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,030
the signal needs to be inverted and you
also need that

2002
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:23,040
also need that
 

2003
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,550
also need that
repeater so two delay

2004
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:26,560
repeater so two delay
 

2005
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,390
repeater so two delay
is the minimum for a bud switch like

2006
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:28,400
is the minimum for a bud switch like
 

2007
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,190
is the minimum for a bud switch like
this i'm pretty sure

2008
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
this i'm pretty sure
 

2009
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,990
this i'm pretty sure
and the silverfish can enter basically

2010
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,000
and the silverfish can enter basically
 

2011
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,030
and the silverfish can enter basically
instantly

2012
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,040
instantly
 

2013
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,109
instantly
so this is a real pain

2014
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:39,119
so this is a real pain
 

2015
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,589
so this is a real pain
to sink and this is where i ran into

2016
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:41,599
to sink and this is where i ran into
 

2017
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:42,390
to sink and this is where i ran into
trouble

2018
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:42,400
trouble
 

2019
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,309
trouble
when i was uh playing around with this

2020
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,319
when i was uh playing around with this
 

2021
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,990
when i was uh playing around with this
before in creative mode

2022
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,000
before in creative mode
 

2023
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,750
before in creative mode
that's about as far as i got with the

2024
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:47,760
that's about as far as i got with the
 

2025
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,430
that's about as far as i got with the
project

2026
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,440
project
 

2027
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,510
project
and this is where it gets interesting

2028
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:51,520
and this is where it gets interesting
 

2029
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,390
and this is where it gets interesting
really interesting

2030
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:54,400

 

2031
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,910

the other thing is we need the

2032
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:55,920
the other thing is we need the
 

2033
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,390
the other thing is we need the
cobblestone generator to

2034
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:58,400
cobblestone generator to
 

2035
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,510
cobblestone generator to
not be activated overly quickly either

2036
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:01,520
not be activated overly quickly either
 

2037
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,510
not be activated overly quickly either
otherwise

2038
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:03,520
otherwise
 

2039
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,109
otherwise
it won't be able to keep up creating

2040
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:05,119
it won't be able to keep up creating
 

2041
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,349
it won't be able to keep up creating
blocks and it will jam up too

2042
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:07,359
blocks and it will jam up too
 

2043
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,510
blocks and it will jam up too
so cobblestone generator needs a

2044
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:11,520
so cobblestone generator needs a
 

2045
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,309
so cobblestone generator needs a
delay bud switch

2046
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:16,319

 

2047
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,150

has to be timed right otherwise uh

2048
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:20,160
has to be timed right otherwise uh
 

2049
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,630
has to be timed right otherwise uh
silverfish will enter the block and if

2050
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:22,640
silverfish will enter the block and if
 

2051
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,190
silverfish will enter the block and if
you delay the cobblestone generator

2052
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:25,200
you delay the cobblestone generator
 

2053
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,190
you delay the cobblestone generator
uh the bud switch will also activate

2054
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,200
uh the bud switch will also activate
 

2055
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,510
uh the bud switch will also activate
when these blocks get pushed

2056
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:29,520
when these blocks get pushed
 

2057
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,550
when these blocks get pushed
so it'll get activated twice

2058
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:32,560
so it'll get activated twice
 

2059
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,030
so it'll get activated twice
so that's another problem i played

2060
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
so that's another problem i played
 

2061
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,910
so that's another problem i played
around with the

2062
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:35,920
around with the
 

2063
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,069
around with the
t flip flop mud switch and uh

2064
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:40,079
t flip flop mud switch and uh
 

2065
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,109
t flip flop mud switch and uh
i basically had same problems

2066
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:43,119
i basically had same problems
 

2067
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,630
i basically had same problems
can't keep up with the silver fish

2068
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:44,640
can't keep up with the silver fish
 

2069
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,470
can't keep up with the silver fish
entering the blocks

2070
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:46,480
entering the blocks
 

2071
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,109
entering the blocks
so we need to add a new third delay here

2072
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:51,119
so we need to add a new third delay here
 

2073
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,870
so we need to add a new third delay here
we're going to have to put a piston

2074
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:52,880
we're going to have to put a piston
 

2075
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,790
we're going to have to put a piston
underneath

2076
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:54,800
underneath
 

2077
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,030
underneath
where all these silver fish are

2078
00:46:59,030 --> 00:46:59,040

 

2079
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,109

and we will have to hook this up to the

2080
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,119
and we will have to hook this up to the
 

2081
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,670
and we will have to hook this up to the
bud switch as well

2082
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:03,680
bud switch as well
 

2083
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,430
bud switch as well
there we go so that

2084
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:07,440
there we go so that
 

2085
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,710
there we go so that
um before the

2086
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:10,720
um before the
 

2087
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,829
um before the
the new stone block

2088
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:13,839
the new stone block
 

2089
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,550
the new stone block
gets pushed over here before that

2090
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:16,560
gets pushed over here before that
 

2091
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,349
gets pushed over here before that
happens

2092
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:17,359
happens
 

2093
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,950
happens
this needs to extend and once the bud

2094
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:20,960
this needs to extend and once the bud
 

2095
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,069
this needs to extend and once the bud
switch is all ready

2096
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:22,079
switch is all ready
 

2097
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,470
switch is all ready
and waiting to detect the silverfish to

2098
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:24,480
and waiting to detect the silverfish to
 

2099
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,790
and waiting to detect the silverfish to
enter then this can retract

2100
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:26,800
enter then this can retract
 

2101
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,109
enter then this can retract
so that they are able to enter it that's

2102
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:29,119
so that they are able to enter it that's
 

2103
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,710
so that they are able to enter it that's
what we need to do

2104
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:30,720
what we need to do
 

2105
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,910
what we need to do
with the redstone yet and

2106
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:33,920
with the redstone yet and
 

2107
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,190
with the redstone yet and
uh i'm guessing

2108
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:37,200
uh i'm guessing
 

2109
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,109
uh i'm guessing
i will probably do that another day

2110
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:39,119
i will probably do that another day
 

2111
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,630
i will probably do that another day
because this episode's getting really

2112
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:40,640
because this episode's getting really
 

2113
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,710
because this episode's getting really
long

2114
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:42,720
long
 

2115
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,309
long
but from this point

2116
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:46,319
but from this point
 

2117
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,230
but from this point
as far as what what we do with these

2118
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:48,240
as far as what what we do with these
 

2119
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,710
as far as what what we do with these
blocks we can

2120
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:50,720
blocks we can
 

2121
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,230
blocks we can
hook up some smart pistons and uh

2122
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:54,240
hook up some smart pistons and uh
 

2123
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,870
hook up some smart pistons and uh
move them to other areas and possibly

2124
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:56,880
move them to other areas and possibly
 

2125
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,549
move them to other areas and possibly
clump them

2126
00:47:58,549 --> 00:47:58,559
clump them
 

2127
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,750
clump them
into several different rooms uh we

2128
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:01,760
into several different rooms uh we
 

2129
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,829
into several different rooms uh we
should be able to control that pretty

2130
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:04,839
should be able to control that pretty
 

2131
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:06,069
should be able to control that pretty
easily

2132
00:48:06,069 --> 00:48:06,079
easily
 

2133
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,589
easily
yeah i'm going to do one more test run

2134
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:09,599
yeah i'm going to do one more test run
 

2135
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:10,710
yeah i'm going to do one more test run
here

2136
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:10,720
here
 

2137
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,190
here
with me standing at a distance from the

2138
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,200
with me standing at a distance from the
 

2139
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,630
with me standing at a distance from the
get-go

2140
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:14,640
get-go
 

2141
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,870
get-go
because when i did it before i had them

2142
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:16,880
because when i did it before i had them
 

2143
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,790
because when i did it before i had them
all concentrated and that's what jams it

2144
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:18,800
all concentrated and that's what jams it
 

2145
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,430
all concentrated and that's what jams it
up

2146
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:19,440
up
 

2147
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,750
up
with this current setup so let's see how

2148
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:21,760
with this current setup so let's see how
 

2149
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,309
with this current setup so let's see how
long it will run on its own

2150
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:24,319
long it will run on its own
 

2151
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,589
long it will run on its own
with the steady spawn rate

2152
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:29,599

 

2153
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,670

okay here we go i replaced this all with

2154
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:31,680
okay here we go i replaced this all with
 

2155
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,349
okay here we go i replaced this all with
glass so we can hopefully see what's

2156
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:33,359
glass so we can hopefully see what's
 

2157
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,910
glass so we can hopefully see what's
going on a little bit better

2158
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:35,920
going on a little bit better
 

2159
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,750
going on a little bit better
i'm curious to see how long it takes to

2160
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:37,760
i'm curious to see how long it takes to
 

2161
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,750
i'm curious to see how long it takes to
actually fall down

2162
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:41,760

 

2163
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,670

and we will have to get far enough away

2164
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:43,680
and we will have to get far enough away
 

2165
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:49,510
and we will have to get far enough away
where they can't see us

2166
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:49,520
where they can't see us
 

2167
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,710
where they can't see us
you can still see me for some reason hmm

2168
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:54,720

 

2169
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,470

hey

2170
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,480

 

2171
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,069

i wonder if they can see farther fused

2172
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:00,079
i wonder if they can see farther fused
 

2173
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,670
i wonder if they can see farther fused
glass

2174
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
glass
 

2175
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,870
glass
now he's doing his own thing

2176
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:04,880

 

2177
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,190

okay problem is i might be too far away

2178
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:07,200
okay problem is i might be too far away
 

2179
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,790
okay problem is i might be too far away
for the spawners to work now

2180
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:10,800

 

2181
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,950

i need to try to get a little bit closer

2182
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:16,960
i need to try to get a little bit closer
 

2183
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,750
i need to try to get a little bit closer
yeah okay it's going so those kind of

2184
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:19,760
yeah okay it's going so those kind of
 

2185
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,150
yeah okay it's going so those kind of
wander back and forth on there

2186
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:22,160
wander back and forth on there
 

2187
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,390
wander back and forth on there
eventually they might fall down uh

2188
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:26,400
eventually they might fall down uh
 

2189
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,990
eventually they might fall down uh
and they do like to fight the water

2190
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,000
and they do like to fight the water
 

2191
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,549
and they do like to fight the water
currents if they're not tracking you

2192
00:49:30,549 --> 00:49:30,559
currents if they're not tracking you
 

2193
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,990
currents if they're not tracking you
it's just what they do and he seems to

2194
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,000
it's just what they do and he seems to
 

2195
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,790
it's just what they do and he seems to
want to go back

2196
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:34,800
want to go back
 

2197
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:43,030
want to go back
up now

2198
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:43,040

 

2199
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,190

okay i skipped ahead here and we still

2200
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:45,200
okay i skipped ahead here and we still
 

2201
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,270
okay i skipped ahead here and we still
haven't had a single one fall down there

2202
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:47,280
haven't had a single one fall down there
 

2203
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:47,910
haven't had a single one fall down there
yet

2204
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:47,920
yet
 

2205
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,710
yet
there's uh about 20 or so

2206
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:52,720

 

2207
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,430

maybe a bit more we should probably use

2208
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:55,440
maybe a bit more we should probably use
 

2209
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,270
maybe a bit more we should probably use
a water stream there then

2210
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,280
a water stream there then
 

2211
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,710
a water stream there then
because they don't want to fall down on

2212
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:58,720
because they don't want to fall down on
 

2213
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,230
because they don't want to fall down on
their own it seems

2214
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:02,240

 

2215
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,390

unless they get pushed so yeah

2216
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:06,400
unless they get pushed so yeah
 

2217
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,470
unless they get pushed so yeah
gonna put a water stream in

2218
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:10,480

 

2219
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,470

here's our next attempt seems to be

2220
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:12,480
here's our next attempt seems to be
 

2221
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,030
here's our next attempt seems to be
working better that's for sure

2222
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:15,040
working better that's for sure
 

2223
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,349
working better that's for sure
we might have to lower that drop

2224
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:19,359
we might have to lower that drop
 

2225
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,950
we might have to lower that drop
i hate to do it but they seem to

2226
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:22,960
i hate to do it but they seem to
 

2227
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,510
i hate to do it but they seem to
try to jump out if they fall down back

2228
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:25,520
try to jump out if they fall down back
 

2229
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,510
try to jump out if they fall down back
into the water stream

2230
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:29,520

 

2231
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:35,270

which would definitely be a problem

2232
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:35,280

 

2233
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,950

or maybe we could try to use a half slab

2234
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:38,960
or maybe we could try to use a half slab
 

2235
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,950
or maybe we could try to use a half slab
there let's see what happens

2236
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:42,960

 

2237
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,549

see he fell down then he jumped back up

2238
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:46,559
see he fell down then he jumped back up
 

2239
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:52,710
see he fell down then he jumped back up
oh oh that was actually pretty good

2240
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:52,720

 

2241
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,870

uh ideally if we can make this work so

2242
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:54,880
uh ideally if we can make this work so
 

2243
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,750
uh ideally if we can make this work so
that

2244
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:55,760
that
 

2245
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,910
that
generally there's only one in there at a

2246
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:57,920
generally there's only one in there at a
 

2247
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,030
generally there's only one in there at a
time in that concentrated chamber

2248
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:01,040
time in that concentrated chamber
 

2249
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,710
time in that concentrated chamber
the better it seems to jam up more so if

2250
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:04,720
the better it seems to jam up more so if
 

2251
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,270
the better it seems to jam up more so if
there's a lot of them

2252
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:07,280
there's a lot of them
 

2253
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,549
there's a lot of them
but it looks like they're stirring a

2254
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:08,559
but it looks like they're stirring a
 

2255
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:14,549
but it looks like they're stirring a
bunch up now

2256
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:14,559

 

2257
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:26,069

hmm there we go

2258
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:26,079

 

2259
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,990

yeah i like the concept of this

2260
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:30,000
yeah i like the concept of this
 

2261
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,710
yeah i like the concept of this
farm i don't know how good it's actually

2262
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:32,720
farm i don't know how good it's actually
 

2263
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,829
farm i don't know how good it's actually
going to be

2264
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:33,839
going to be
 

2265
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,510
going to be
to be honest i just think it's really

2266
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:37,520
to be honest i just think it's really
 

2267
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,670
to be honest i just think it's really
cool

2268
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:39,680
cool
 

2269
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,750
cool
but i it would be really neat if i had

2270
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:43,760
but i it would be really neat if i had
 

2271
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,270
but i it would be really neat if i had
my storage room above this

2272
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:45,280
my storage room above this
 

2273
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,870
my storage room above this
and it was running constantly and

2274
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:48,880
and it was running constantly and
 

2275
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,030
and it was running constantly and
every now and then you would just check

2276
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:51,040
every now and then you would just check
 

2277
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,549
every now and then you would just check
to see how many blocks have gathered

2278
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:52,559
to see how many blocks have gathered
 

2279
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:53,109
to see how many blocks have gathered
together

2280
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:53,119
together
 

2281
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,670
together
and it would be a pretty good xp farm

2282
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,680
and it would be a pretty good xp farm
 

2283
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,589
and it would be a pretty good xp farm
and right next to the end portal that

2284
00:51:59,589 --> 00:51:59,599
and right next to the end portal that
 

2285
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:06,309
and right next to the end portal that
would be cool too

2286
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:06,319

 

2287
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,589

yeah yeah it's working good relatively

2288
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:09,599
yeah yeah it's working good relatively
 

2289
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,150
yeah yeah it's working good relatively
good i

2290
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:10,160
good i
 

2291
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,910
good i
i'm pretty sure after a few minutes if

2292
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:13,920
i'm pretty sure after a few minutes if
 

2293
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,670
i'm pretty sure after a few minutes if
if this could keep running it would

2294
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:15,680
if this could keep running it would
 

2295
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,430
if this could keep running it would
eventually jam up

2296
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:17,440
eventually jam up
 

2297
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,349
eventually jam up
uh i think it does keep up with the rate

2298
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:21,359
uh i think it does keep up with the rate
 

2299
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,750
uh i think it does keep up with the rate
that they spawn which is good

2300
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:23,760
that they spawn which is good
 

2301
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,190
that they spawn which is good
it's very important

2302
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:27,200

 

2303
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,470

whenever we have you know 17 there was

2304
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:30,480
whenever we have you know 17 there was
 

2305
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,510
whenever we have you know 17 there was
there's always going to be a few around

2306
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:35,520

 

2307
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,270

um they're one of those mobs that's hard

2308
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:39,280
um they're one of those mobs that's hard
 

2309
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,069
um they're one of those mobs that's hard
to

2310
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:40,079
to
 

2311
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,109
to
make go where you want they

2312
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:43,119
make go where you want they
 

2313
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:49,349
make go where you want they
they're fighting the currents

2314
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:49,359

 

2315
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,990

but yeah i think i'm going to end this

2316
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,000
but yeah i think i'm going to end this
 

2317
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,230
but yeah i think i'm going to end this
here today and we'll work on

2318
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:54,240
here today and we'll work on
 

2319
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,589
here today and we'll work on
maybe improving it later there's a lot

2320
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:57,599
maybe improving it later there's a lot
 

2321
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,589
maybe improving it later there's a lot
you could do with this yet lots of

2322
00:52:59,589 --> 00:52:59,599
you could do with this yet lots of
 

2323
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:05,510
you could do with this yet lots of
different ways you could set this up too

2324
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:05,520

 

2325
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,349

if we can't get this way to work i might

2326
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:07,359
if we can't get this way to work i might
 

2327
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:08,710
if we can't get this way to work i might
try that other

2328
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:08,720
try that other
 

2329
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,230
try that other
method i talked about with the the rooms

2330
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:12,240
method i talked about with the the rooms
 

2331
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,270
method i talked about with the the rooms
of

2332
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:13,280
of
 

2333
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,430
of
full of hundreds of blocks and we just

2334
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:15,440
full of hundreds of blocks and we just
 

2335
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,109
full of hundreds of blocks and we just
let the silverfish

2336
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:17,119
let the silverfish
 

2337
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:22,630
let the silverfish
run around and do their thing

2338
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:22,640

 

2339
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,390

but i like this way because you know

2340
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:24,400
but i like this way because you know
 

2341
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,470
but i like this way because you know
guaranteed every one of those blocks is

2342
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:26,480
guaranteed every one of those blocks is
 

2343
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,990
guaranteed every one of those blocks is
a silver fish that's what's cool about

2344
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,000
a silver fish that's what's cool about
 

2345
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,430
a silver fish that's what's cool about
this method

2346
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:29,440
this method
 

2347
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,190
this method
it's a lot harder to make it work

2348
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:33,200
it's a lot harder to make it work
 

2349
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,030
it's a lot harder to make it work
i think we've hit pretty close to the

2350
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,040
i think we've hit pretty close to the
 

2351
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:41,030
i think we've hit pretty close to the
end here

2352
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:41,040

 

2353
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,230

is that silverfish yep

2354
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:44,240
is that silverfish yep
 

2355
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,349
is that silverfish yep
so jam

2356
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:49,359

 

2357
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,790

or maybe it might have been too long

2358
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
or maybe it might have been too long
 

2359
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,630
or maybe it might have been too long
there i can't tell anyway

2360
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:52,640
there i can't tell anyway
 

2361
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,870
there i can't tell anyway
i'm gonna say goodbye for today thanks

2362
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:54,880
i'm gonna say goodbye for today thanks
 

2363
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,349
i'm gonna say goodbye for today thanks
for watching everybody

2364
00:53:59,349 --> 00:53:59,359

 

2365
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:08,880

and i'll see you again next time
