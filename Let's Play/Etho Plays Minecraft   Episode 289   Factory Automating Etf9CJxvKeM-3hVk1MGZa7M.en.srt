after last episode i decided to
investigate where we left off with it

20
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,400
investigate where we left off with it
 

21
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,550
investigate where we left off with it
how close we are to making our bomb

factory uh work and
 

25
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,350
factory uh work and
we were actually really close i'm

26
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
we were actually really close i'm
 

27
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,709
we were actually really close i'm
surprised

00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
surprised
 

29
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,870
surprised
i don't know why i didn't uh test it

30
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:36,880
i don't know why i didn't uh test it
 

31
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,709
i don't know why i didn't uh test it
earlier but it looks like it was all

32
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
earlier but it looks like it was all
 

33
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,630
earlier but it looks like it was all
all set up for a testing so we should do

34
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
all set up for a testing so we should do
 

35
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,750
all set up for a testing so we should do
that today all i've added is this little

36
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:43,760
that today all i've added is this little
 

37
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,790
that today all i've added is this little
water catch thing so when a creeper and

38
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
water catch thing so when a creeper and
 

39
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,470
water catch thing so when a creeper and
a skeleton fall into here

40
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:48,480
a skeleton fall into here
 

41
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,869
a skeleton fall into here
if they do they won't blow up the whole

42
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
if they do they won't blow up the whole
 

43
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,069
if they do they won't blow up the whole
machine

44
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
machine
 

45
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,830
machine
just a safe detonation for right now and

46
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
just a safe detonation for right now and
 

47
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,670
just a safe detonation for right now and
then we'll we'll

48
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
then we'll we'll
 

49
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,510
then we'll we'll
remove this and make them move somewhere

50
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
remove this and make them move somewhere
 

51
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,029
remove this and make them move somewhere
else once we confirm it is working

52
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
else once we confirm it is working
 

53
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,789
else once we confirm it is working
but um we're gonna test it out we're

54
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:04,799
but um we're gonna test it out we're
 

55
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,590
but um we're gonna test it out we're
gonna

56
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
gonna
 

57
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,310
gonna
we're gonna operate it manually first of

58
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
we're gonna operate it manually first of
 

59
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,670
we're gonna operate it manually first of
all

60
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
all
 

61
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,190
all
and then if it seems like it's working

62
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
and then if it seems like it's working
 

63
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,870
and then if it seems like it's working
the way it's supposed to we're gonna set

64
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
the way it's supposed to we're gonna set
 

65
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,429
the way it's supposed to we're gonna set
up a redstone

66
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
up a redstone
 

67
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,749
up a redstone
uh system to make it run automatically

68
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
uh system to make it run automatically
 

69
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,350
uh system to make it run automatically
is the plan

70
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
is the plan
 

71
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,550
is the plan
let's see are you guys going the right

72
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
let's see are you guys going the right
 

73
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,429
let's see are you guys going the right
way

74
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439

 

75
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,469

all right where are you going where

76
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
all right where are you going where
 

77
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,590
all right where are you going where
are you going it's really hard to see

78
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
are you going it's really hard to see
 

79
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,510
are you going it's really hard to see
through all the glass what's happening

80
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
through all the glass what's happening
 

81
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,990
through all the glass what's happening
exactly

82
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
exactly
 

83
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,510
exactly
they need to go to the left here i think

84
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
they need to go to the left here i think
 

85
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,429
they need to go to the left here i think
this is wrong

86
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439

 

87
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,710

no maybe not

88
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720

 

89
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,550

can we get some creepers in the house so

90
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
can we get some creepers in the house so
 

91
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,749
can we get some creepers in the house so
we can test this out

92
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
we can test this out
 

93
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,870
we can test this out
uh or a skeleton skeleton

94
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
uh or a skeleton skeleton
 

95
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,469
uh or a skeleton skeleton
okay the skeleton's going the wrong way

96
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
okay the skeleton's going the wrong way
 

97
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,830
okay the skeleton's going the wrong way
let's switches

98
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840

 

99
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,469

creepers are you going which way are you

100
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
creepers are you going which way are you
 

101
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,870
creepers are you going which way are you
going

102
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880

 

103
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,149

i think i need to switch this for the

104
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
i think i need to switch this for the
 

105
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,190
i think i need to switch this for the
creepers too yeah okay there we go

106
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
creepers too yeah okay there we go
 

107
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,990
creepers too yeah okay there we go
so what is going on here

108
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000

 

109
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,309

uh this is some terrible separation we

110
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
uh this is some terrible separation we
 

111
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,229
uh this is some terrible separation we
got mostly creepers in both tubes

112
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
got mostly creepers in both tubes
 

113
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,830
got mostly creepers in both tubes
but uh

114
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
but uh
 

115
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,350
but uh
why did that happen and they're really

116
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
why did that happen and they're really
 

117
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,030
why did that happen and they're really
glitching through the glass

118
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
glitching through the glass
 

119
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,790
glitching through the glass
like what's this guy doing

120
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800

 

121
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,110

all right well we were trying to set

122
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
all right well we were trying to set
 

123
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,309
all right well we were trying to set
this up so even if

124
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
this up so even if
 

125
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,949
this up so even if
the wrong mob gets mixed in it should

126
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
the wrong mob gets mixed in it should
 

127
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,710
the wrong mob gets mixed in it should
still operate so hopefully it'll work

128
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
still operate so hopefully it'll work
 

129
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,830
still operate so hopefully it'll work
okay

130
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840

 

131
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,670

so i think we got to manually operate

132
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
so i think we got to manually operate
 

133
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,670
so i think we got to manually operate
this

134
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
this
 

135
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,030
this
to start off with the idea is we need to

136
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
to start off with the idea is we need to
 

137
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,990
to start off with the idea is we need to
drop a skeleton

138
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
drop a skeleton
 

139
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,710
drop a skeleton
down which should be this tube here but

140
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
down which should be this tube here but
 

141
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,309
down which should be this tube here but
it's mostly creepers for some reason

142
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
it's mostly creepers for some reason
 

143
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,350
it's mostly creepers for some reason
this time

144
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
this time
 

145
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,949
this time
and then we drop a creeper down later

146
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
and then we drop a creeper down later
 

147
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,149
and then we drop a creeper down later
why is the skeleton dying

148
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
why is the skeleton dying
 

149
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,350
why is the skeleton dying
anyway we'll try this out

150
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360

 

151
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,350

okay that should be a skeleton but it's

152
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
okay that should be a skeleton but it's
 

153
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,949
okay that should be a skeleton but it's
not

154
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959

 

155
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,830

and he's just sitting there

156
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840

 

157
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,910

okay let it creeper through

158
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920

 

159
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,710

okay this is not working very well let's

160
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
okay this is not working very well let's
 

161
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,470
okay this is not working very well let's
try this again

162
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480

 

163
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,670

i don't think it's gonna work unless we

164
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
i don't think it's gonna work unless we
 

165
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,350
i don't think it's gonna work unless we
get a skeleton it's the thing so this is

166
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
get a skeleton it's the thing so this is
 

167
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,149
get a skeleton it's the thing so this is
actually

168
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
actually
 

169
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,869
actually
good that the snowman's not shooting

170
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
good that the snowman's not shooting
 

171
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,149
good that the snowman's not shooting
because the snowman won't shoot at a

172
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
because the snowman won't shoot at a
 

173
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,750
because the snowman won't shoot at a
creeper

174
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
creeper
 

175
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,990
creeper
all right this should be a skeleton now

176
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
all right this should be a skeleton now
 

177
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,110
all right this should be a skeleton now
he did nothing why

178
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120

 

179
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,750

why did he do nothing

180
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760

 

181
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,270

and we're out of creepers okay this is a

182
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
and we're out of creepers okay this is a
 

183
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,070
and we're out of creepers okay this is a
terrible test i'll recalibrate

184
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
terrible test i'll recalibrate
 

185
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,910
terrible test i'll recalibrate
here wow okay so it's very

186
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
here wow okay so it's very
 

187
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,229
here wow okay so it's very
subtle i didn't pick up on it when it

188
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
subtle i didn't pick up on it when it
 

189
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,070
subtle i didn't pick up on it when it
first happened i thought an arrow

190
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
first happened i thought an arrow
 

191
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,710
first happened i thought an arrow
fell down uh while we were recording

192
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
fell down uh while we were recording
 

193
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,589
fell down uh while we were recording
that last

194
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
that last
 

195
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,830
that last
segment but after re-watching i think

196
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
segment but after re-watching i think
 

197
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,629
segment but after re-watching i think
that was a piece of string actually

198
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
that was a piece of string actually
 

199
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,909
that was a piece of string actually
from the tripwire down there

200
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
from the tripwire down there
 

201
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,069
from the tripwire down there
must have broke somehow i'm not sure

202
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
must have broke somehow i'm not sure
 

203
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,830
must have broke somehow i'm not sure
let's go inside

204
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840

 

205
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,990

okay let's put this down

206
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
okay let's put this down
 

207
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,950
okay let's put this down
so we don't fall there's a there's one

208
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
so we don't fall there's a there's one
 

209
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,909
so we don't fall there's a there's one
piece here

210
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919

 

211
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,590

yeah and there's one piece missing so a

212
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
yeah and there's one piece missing so a
 

213
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,830
yeah and there's one piece missing so a
tripwire broke right

214
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
tripwire broke right
 

215
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,510
tripwire broke right
here

216
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
here
 

217
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,350
here
from this piston maybe

218
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
from this piston maybe
 

219
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,710
from this piston maybe
does that make sense

220
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720

 

221
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,390

we're doing a little bit of bug fixing

222
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
we're doing a little bit of bug fixing
 

223
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,790
we're doing a little bit of bug fixing
okay maybe that's what happened

224
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
okay maybe that's what happened
 

225
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,189
okay maybe that's what happened
that's connected if we put glass

226
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
that's connected if we put glass
 

227
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,350
that's connected if we put glass
underneath is it still

228
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360

 

229
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,950

that's still working it worked the first

230
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
that's still working it worked the first
 

231
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,350
that's still working it worked the first
time then it broke

232
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
time then it broke
 

233
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,110
time then it broke
because that has to open up these ports

234
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
because that has to open up these ports
 

235
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,270
because that has to open up these ports
here so the snow golem can shoot at the

236
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
here so the snow golem can shoot at the
 

237
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,749
here so the snow golem can shoot at the
skeleton that's here

238
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
skeleton that's here
 

239
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,510
skeleton that's here
it opens up for like just over a second

240
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520

 

241
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,070

not sure why it broke okay i'll get some

242
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
not sure why it broke okay i'll get some
 

243
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,430
not sure why it broke okay i'll get some
mobs lined up and we'll try it again

244
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
mobs lined up and we'll try it again
 

245
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,469
mobs lined up and we'll try it again
okay we got our first mobs coming and

246
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
okay we got our first mobs coming and
 

247
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,110
okay we got our first mobs coming and
i honestly have no no idea why that

248
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
i honestly have no no idea why that
 

249
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,870
i honestly have no no idea why that
tripwire broke

250
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
tripwire broke
 

251
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,469
tripwire broke
which has me worried it's going to

252
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
which has me worried it's going to
 

253
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,230
which has me worried it's going to
happen again

254
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
happen again
 

255
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,189
happen again
okay so when we set this automatically

256
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
okay so when we set this automatically
 

257
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,790
okay so when we set this automatically
set this up automatically we're going to

258
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
set this up automatically we're going to
 

259
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,790
set this up automatically we're going to
test if there's a skeleton there and a

260
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
test if there's a skeleton there and a
 

261
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,150
test if there's a skeleton there and a
creeper there and if there

262
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
creeper there and if there
 

263
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,230
creeper there and if there
is then it's going to run a clock that's

264
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
is then it's going to run a clock that's
 

265
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,189
is then it's going to run a clock that's
going to

266
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
going to
 

267
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,430
going to
make all this stuff happen only if

268
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
make all this stuff happen only if
 

269
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,310
make all this stuff happen only if
there's one in each side

270
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
there's one in each side
 

271
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,310
there's one in each side
because there's no point running this if

272
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
because there's no point running this if
 

273
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,469
because there's no point running this if
there's no skeleton or no creeper in the

274
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
there's no skeleton or no creeper in the
 

275
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,469
there's no skeleton or no creeper in the
equation

276
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
equation
 

277
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,990
equation
now don't break the tripwire

278
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000

 

279
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,150

oh you were too slow too slow bro

280
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
oh you were too slow too slow bro
 

281
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,950
oh you were too slow too slow bro
he uh his snowball hit the glass it

282
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
he uh his snowball hit the glass it
 

283
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,830
he uh his snowball hit the glass it
looked like

284
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
looked like
 

285
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,110
looked like
and so this would still get triggered

286
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
and so this would still get triggered
 

287
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,870
and so this would still get triggered
maybe

288
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
maybe
 

289
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,950
maybe
oh he shot the creeper then the second

290
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
oh he shot the creeper then the second
 

291
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,909
oh he shot the creeper then the second
time

292
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
time
 

293
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,230
time
uh but nothing blew up that's good i

294
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
uh but nothing blew up that's good i
 

295
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,830
uh but nothing blew up that's good i
haven't made a backup in a while maybe i

296
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
haven't made a backup in a while maybe i
 

297
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,430
haven't made a backup in a while maybe i
should make a backup because i have a

298
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
should make a backup because i have a
 

299
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,749
should make a backup because i have a
feeling i'm gonna blow something up here

300
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759

 

301
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,029

the tripwire is not breaking that's good

302
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
the tripwire is not breaking that's good
 

303
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,550
the tripwire is not breaking that's good
he got knocked onto the pressure plate

304
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
he got knocked onto the pressure plate
 

305
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,950
he got knocked onto the pressure plate
push back i don't have it wired where

306
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
push back i don't have it wired where
 

307
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,350
push back i don't have it wired where
the

308
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
the
 

309
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,790
the
redstone will make a creeper come up

310
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
redstone will make a creeper come up
 

311
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,830
redstone will make a creeper come up
it should work this time

312
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840

 

313
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,150

no okay so skeleton didn't shoot the

314
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
no okay so skeleton didn't shoot the
 

315
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,350
no okay so skeleton didn't shoot the
creeper he needed more time

316
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
creeper he needed more time
 

317
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,230
creeper he needed more time
what was that was that an arrow let's

318
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
what was that was that an arrow let's
 

319
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,550
what was that was that an arrow let's
try again

320
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
try again
 

321
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,830
try again
oh i wasn't supposed to release the

322
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840
oh i wasn't supposed to release the
 

323
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,330
oh i wasn't supposed to release the
creeper

324
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:03,340
creeper
 

325
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,350
creeper
[Applause]

326
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360

 

327
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,629

i love working with with mob systems

328
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
i love working with with mob systems
 

329
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,909
i love working with with mob systems
it's so much fun

330
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919

 

331
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,270

okay creeper will work this time no okay

332
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
okay creeper will work this time no okay
 

333
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,790
okay creeper will work this time no okay
there's a skeleton needs more time it

334
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
there's a skeleton needs more time it
 

335
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,909
there's a skeleton needs more time it
looks like

336
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
looks like
 

337
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,510
looks like
that's the flaw right now

338
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520

 

339
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,029

oh man i think it worked i hear a

340
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
oh man i think it worked i hear a
 

341
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,390
oh man i think it worked i hear a
creeper sizzling down there i was

342
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
creeper sizzling down there i was
 

343
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,150
creeper sizzling down there i was
testing it some more

344
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
testing it some more
 

345
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,070
testing it some more
he's mad at one of the skeletons but he

346
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
he's mad at one of the skeletons but he
 

347
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,510
he's mad at one of the skeletons but he
can't reach him

348
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
can't reach him
 

349
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:42,469
can't reach him
and they're bouncing around

350
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479

 

351
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,749

if you could just get close to the

352
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:43,759
if you could just get close to the
 

353
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,670
if you could just get close to the
skeleton long enough it's the one with

354
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
skeleton long enough it's the one with
 

355
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,350
skeleton long enough it's the one with
the chainmail there's a skeleton with

356
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
the chainmail there's a skeleton with
 

357
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,150
the chainmail there's a skeleton with
chainmail on

358
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
chainmail on
 

359
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,990
chainmail on
that he's mad at

360
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000

 

361
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,189

all right that's cool

362
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199

 

363
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:08,950

let's close that up

364
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960

 

365
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,469

oh that was another one

366
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
oh that was another one
 

367
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,469
oh that was another one
yes yes it worked

368
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
yes yes it worked
 

369
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,909
yes yes it worked
that's two in a row that worked i wonder

370
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
that's two in a row that worked i wonder
 

371
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,430
that's two in a row that worked i wonder
why the first few didn't though

372
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440

 

373
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,270

oh you missed bro

374
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
oh you missed bro
 

375
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,350
oh you missed bro
fail all right let's try it again

376
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360

 

377
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,949

nice shot beautiful oh i wasn't supposed

378
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
nice shot beautiful oh i wasn't supposed
 

379
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,469
nice shot beautiful oh i wasn't supposed
to hold that

380
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
to hold that
 

381
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,750
to hold that
we got two creepers in looks like it was

382
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
we got two creepers in looks like it was
 

383
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,829
we got two creepers in looks like it was
a success

384
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
a success
 

385
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,590
a success
nice

386
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600

 

387
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,030

this is gonna be so cool when it's

388
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
this is gonna be so cool when it's
 

389
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,030
this is gonna be so cool when it's
automatic

390
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
automatic
 

391
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,470
automatic
creeper he shot him

392
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480
creeper he shot him
 

393
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,070
creeper he shot him
so it's working now i don't know why i

394
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
so it's working now i don't know why i
 

395
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,790
so it's working now i don't know why i
didn't work the first few times

396
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
didn't work the first few times
 

397
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,430
didn't work the first few times
are you not reaching him

398
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440

 

399
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,430

he's mad at him you can't reach him

400
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
he's mad at him you can't reach him
 

401
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,990
he's mad at him you can't reach him
though

402
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000

 

403
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,710

that was like slow anger his temper just

404
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
that was like slow anger his temper just
 

405
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,269
that was like slow anger his temper just
king

406
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
king
 

407
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,110
king
kept getting worse and worse and then he

408
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
kept getting worse and worse and then he
 

409
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,949
kept getting worse and worse and then he
had enough

410
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959

 

411
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,470

all right well that's good it looks like

412
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
all right well that's good it looks like
 

413
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,190
all right well that's good it looks like
it's working pretty pretty decently

414
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
it's working pretty pretty decently
 

415
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,509
it's working pretty pretty decently
the next step of this is going to be to

416
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
the next step of this is going to be to
 

417
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,389
the next step of this is going to be to
get it to run automatically

418
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
get it to run automatically
 

419
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,389
get it to run automatically
and to do that might be a little more

420
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
and to do that might be a little more
 

421
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,910
and to do that might be a little more
tricky than i thought i'm looking at it

422
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
tricky than i thought i'm looking at it
 

423
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,949
tricky than i thought i'm looking at it
here

424
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
here
 

425
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,870
here
and i thought i was going to be able to

426
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
and i thought i was going to be able to
 

427
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,030
and i thought i was going to be able to
run the tripwires going

428
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
run the tripwires going
 

429
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,470
run the tripwires going
this way like if we had a block here

430
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
this way like if we had a block here
 

431
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,470
this way like if we had a block here
and tripwire on this and on both sides

432
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
and tripwire on this and on both sides
 

433
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,550
and tripwire on this and on both sides
that's not going to work because then

434
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
that's not going to work because then
 

435
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,509
that's not going to work because then
you need like a

436
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
you need like a
 

437
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,750
you need like a
you need the trip hook you need the

438
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
you need the trip hook you need the
 

439
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,509
you need the trip hook you need the
string and then another trip hook so

440
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
string and then another trip hook so
 

441
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,829
string and then another trip hook so
that's three blocks wide

442
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
that's three blocks wide
 

443
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,350
that's three blocks wide
and it's not going to be above the water

444
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
and it's not going to be above the water
 

445
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,269
and it's not going to be above the water
stream here we need to

446
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
stream here we need to
 

447
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,190
stream here we need to
check if they are in front of the trap

448
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
check if they are in front of the trap
 

449
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,110
check if they are in front of the trap
door basically

450
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
door basically
 

451
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,990
door basically
for both the skeleton and the creeper so

452
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
for both the skeleton and the creeper so
 

453
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,550
for both the skeleton and the creeper so
my new idea is to make it run this way

454
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
my new idea is to make it run this way
 

455
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,550
my new idea is to make it run this way
but this also is kind of challenging

456
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
but this also is kind of challenging
 

457
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,630
but this also is kind of challenging
because if the

458
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
because if the
 

459
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,750
because if the
if the trip hook is right above

460
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
if the trip hook is right above
 

461
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,590
if the trip hook is right above
didn't mean to do that it's right above

462
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
didn't mean to do that it's right above
 

463
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,430
didn't mean to do that it's right above
the door like right in that

464
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
the door like right in that
 

465
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,829
the door like right in that
spot there it's gonna power the door

466
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:19,839
spot there it's gonna power the door
 

467
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,670
spot there it's gonna power the door
directly so that doesn't work

468
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
directly so that doesn't work
 

469
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,829
directly so that doesn't work
so i've tried moving it back one uh

470
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
so i've tried moving it back one uh
 

471
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,509
so i've tried moving it back one uh
which seems like it would work okay

472
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
which seems like it would work okay
 

473
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,790
which seems like it would work okay
except

474
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800

 

475
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,030

if we connect this string here

476
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
if we connect this string here
 

477
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,630
if we connect this string here
there's no clicking because it's not

478
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
there's no clicking because it's not
 

479
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,110
there's no clicking because it's not
working because this is a solid block

480
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
working because this is a solid block
 

481
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,389
working because this is a solid block
below

482
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
below
 

483
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,949
below
so if we get rid of that

484
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
so if we get rid of that
 

485
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,190
so if we get rid of that
uh trip door break or the trap door

486
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
uh trip door break or the trap door
 

487
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,790
uh trip door break or the trap door
breaks

488
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
breaks
 

489
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,269
breaks
um and that's no good but i think what

490
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
um and that's no good but i think what
 

491
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,949
um and that's no good but i think what
we can do

492
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959

 

493
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,990

let's get a crafting table going here

494
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
let's get a crafting table going here
 

495
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,990
let's get a crafting table going here
is make stairs or something and i think

496
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
is make stairs or something and i think
 

497
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,990
is make stairs or something and i think
you can put a trapdoor on that

498
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000

 

499
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,670

uh we won't be able to power the block

500
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
uh we won't be able to power the block
 

501
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,910
uh we won't be able to power the block
the trapdoors on

502
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:07,920
the trapdoors on
 

503
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,230
the trapdoors on
but we can power beside it

504
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240

 

505
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,269

all right let's try this now

506
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
all right let's try this now
 

507
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,630
all right let's try this now
and we'll probably have to fix this

508
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
and we'll probably have to fix this
 

509
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,750
and we'll probably have to fix this
actually

510
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760

 

511
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,910

okay can we put this on the stair yes we

512
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
okay can we put this on the stair yes we
 

513
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,949
okay can we put this on the stair yes we
can good

514
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
can good
 

515
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,829
can good
let's go down broke this let's put this

516
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839
let's go down broke this let's put this
 

517
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,470
let's go down broke this let's put this
back

518
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
back
 

519
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,150
back
and now the fun part of trying to get

520
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
and now the fun part of trying to get
 

521
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,870
and now the fun part of trying to get
out of here

522
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880

 

523
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,910

oh bullseye

524
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
oh bullseye
 

525
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,430
oh bullseye
all right

526
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440

 

527
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,110

so is this going to work

528
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120

 

529
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,949

we don't want it to power the trip the

530
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
we don't want it to power the trip the
 

531
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,030
we don't want it to power the trip the
trapdoor oh it's the trip door now

532
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
trapdoor oh it's the trip door now
 

533
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,910
trapdoor oh it's the trip door now
and it's clicking okay so it is powering

534
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
and it's clicking okay so it is powering
 

535
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,750
and it's clicking okay so it is powering
but it's not activating the trapdoor to

536
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
but it's not activating the trapdoor to
 

537
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,069
but it's not activating the trapdoor to
do

538
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
do
 

539
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,990
do
that we're gonna probably have to put a

540
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
that we're gonna probably have to put a
 

541
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,230
that we're gonna probably have to put a
block

542
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
block
 

543
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,110
block
next to it here and then we can power it

544
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
next to it here and then we can power it
 

545
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,590
next to it here and then we can power it
from the outside

546
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
from the outside
 

547
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,110
from the outside
either here or here

548
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
either here or here
 

549
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,269
either here or here
should work out okay

550
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279

 

551
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,949

i just hopped in the water stream here i

552
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
i just hopped in the water stream here i
 

553
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,550
i just hopped in the water stream here i
was going to pretend that was a skeleton

554
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
was going to pretend that was a skeleton
 

555
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,829
was going to pretend that was a skeleton
to see how this worked

556
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
to see how this worked
 

557
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,470
to see how this worked
and i noticed another problem this trap

558
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
and i noticed another problem this trap
 

559
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,110
and i noticed another problem this trap
door is

560
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
door is
 

561
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,629
door is
not opening and closing really quick

562
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
not opening and closing really quick
 

563
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,870
not opening and closing really quick
it's staying open while we're here

564
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
it's staying open while we're here
 

565
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,949
it's staying open while we're here
because i missed this but

566
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
because i missed this but
 

567
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,509
because i missed this but
uh the block the trip hook is connected

568
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
uh the block the trip hook is connected
 

569
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,949
uh the block the trip hook is connected
to is right next to that redstone we

570
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
to is right next to that redstone we
 

571
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,550
to is right next to that redstone we
just laid after the

572
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
just laid after the
 

573
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,030
just laid after the
after the piston so that piston is doing

574
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
after the piston so that piston is doing
 

575
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,750
after the piston so that piston is doing
nothing

576
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
nothing
 

577
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,430
nothing
you gotta fix that

578
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:41,440

 

579
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,829

and that's fixed so what i've done is

580
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
and that's fixed so what i've done is
 

581
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,990
and that's fixed so what i've done is
i've made a branch off over here now

582
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
i've made a branch off over here now
 

583
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,190
i've made a branch off over here now
in the clock that goes back this is a

584
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
in the clock that goes back this is a
 

585
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,790
in the clock that goes back this is a
piston below that's the monostable

586
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
piston below that's the monostable
 

587
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,509
piston below that's the monostable
that goes to this block over here

588
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
that goes to this block over here
 

589
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,829
that goes to this block over here
um so no longer the redstones running

590
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
um so no longer the redstones running
 

591
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,710
um so no longer the redstones running
next to there

592
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
next to there
 

593
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,910
next to there
goes down to that piece of redstone dust

594
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
goes down to that piece of redstone dust
 

595
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,710
goes down to that piece of redstone dust
and we can hop in and test it out

596
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
and we can hop in and test it out
 

597
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,310
and we can hop in and test it out
interestingly

598
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
interestingly
 

599
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,629
interestingly
when we go through this we don't fall

600
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639
when we go through this we don't fall
 

601
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,990
when we go through this we don't fall
through the trapdoor

602
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
through the trapdoor
 

603
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,269
through the trapdoor
we kind of glitch out like this uh

604
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
we kind of glitch out like this uh
 

605
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,430
we kind of glitch out like this uh
when a skeleton goes through though they

606
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440
when a skeleton goes through though they
 

607
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,310
when a skeleton goes through though they
fall down

608
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
fall down
 

609
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,750
fall down
oh we fell down the second time maybe

610
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
oh we fell down the second time maybe
 

611
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,450
oh we fell down the second time maybe
it's too quick

612
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:22,460
it's too quick
 

613
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,870
it's too quick
[Music]

614
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
[Music]
 

615
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,030
[Music]
um we'll find out soon

616
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040

 

617
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,110

well this is it this is going to be our

618
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
well this is it this is going to be our
 

619
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,389
well this is it this is going to be our
first automatic

620
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
first automatic
 

621
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,269
first automatic
test of the system let's hope it works i

622
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
test of the system let's hope it works i
 

623
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,710
test of the system let's hope it works i
have not made the backup

624
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
have not made the backup
 

625
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,829
have not made the backup
so let's hope nothing explodes too we

626
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
so let's hope nothing explodes too we
 

627
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,670
so let's hope nothing explodes too we
want the creepers to explode just in the

628
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
want the creepers to explode just in the
 

629
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,069
want the creepers to explode just in the
right place

630
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
right place
 

631
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,230
right place
uh so let's get over there quickly

632
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
uh so let's get over there quickly
 

633
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,350
uh so let's get over there quickly
quickly quickly

634
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
quickly quickly
 

635
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,310
quickly quickly
things are moving things are happening

636
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
things are moving things are happening
 

637
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,590
things are moving things are happening
uh there might there's

638
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
uh there might there's
 

639
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,269
uh there might there's
most likely going to be some timing

640
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
most likely going to be some timing
 

641
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,030
most likely going to be some timing
issues but let's see just

642
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
issues but let's see just
 

643
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,550
issues but let's see just
what happens here i think this is the

644
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
what happens here i think this is the
 

645
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,350
what happens here i think this is the
spot we want to be

646
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
spot we want to be
 

647
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,069
spot we want to be
we are waiting for

648
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079

 

649
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,629

can i break that yeah skeleton and

650
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
can i break that yeah skeleton and
 

651
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,590
can i break that yeah skeleton and
creepers

652
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
creepers
 

653
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,150
creepers
come on we got the creepers there's a

654
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
come on we got the creepers there's a
 

655
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,710
come on we got the creepers there's a
zombie

656
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
zombie
 

657
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,629
zombie
in the skeleton

658
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
in the skeleton
 

659
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,910
in the skeleton
spots

660
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920

 

661
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,870

that seems to be twitching too quickly

662
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
that seems to be twitching too quickly
 

663
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,150
that seems to be twitching too quickly
after all

664
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
after all
 

665
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,069
after all
we can fix that actually really easily

666
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
we can fix that actually really easily
 

667
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,949
we can fix that actually really easily
if we can get there we cannot get there

668
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
if we can get there we cannot get there
 

669
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,710
if we can get there we cannot get there
oh it's a nightmare working up here

670
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:38,720

 

671
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,829

uh we just need to extend the delay on

672
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839
uh we just need to extend the delay on
 

673
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,550
uh we just need to extend the delay on
that one

674
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
that one
 

675
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,150
that one
mana stable we put in where is it

676
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
mana stable we put in where is it
 

677
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,629
mana stable we put in where is it
we're missing the show this one here

678
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639
we're missing the show this one here
 

679
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,990
we're missing the show this one here
let's make it two ticks

680
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000

 

681
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,629

that should do it let's get that down

682
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639

 

683
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,750

okay we got skeleton uh

684
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
okay we got skeleton uh
 

685
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,310
okay we got skeleton uh
golem tried to shoot him but the glass

686

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,150
there but it wasn't it wasn't very good
for some reason the creeper didn't come

716
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
for some reason the creeper didn't come
 

717
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,430

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,550
yeah the creeper only gets released when
the skeleton's shot that's right

728
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560

 

729
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,990

747
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,590
released i might be
interfering with it we get one more

it actually
there when that piston comes up i think

758
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880
there when that piston comes up i think
 

759
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,269

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,749
catching eyes of me and he changed his
his his desire to explode on me instead

764
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
his his desire to explode on me instead
 

765
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,550
his his desire to explode on me instead

00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
let's move away a different angle i have
 

789
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,990
let's move away a different angle i have
a feeling we might be interfering

790
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
a feeling we might be interfering
 

791
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,430
a feeling we might be interfering
somehow

792
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440

 

793
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,950

because yeah i think that time he got
 

795
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,630
because yeah i think that time he got
hit by the skeleton when we weren't

796

hit by the skeleton when we weren't
 

797
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,510
hit by the skeleton when we weren't
there

i find it's very rare for for it to line
 

823
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,830
i find it's very rare for for it to line
up where there's a skeleton

824
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
up where there's a skeleton
 

825
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,789
up where there's a skeleton
in one and a creep or another

827
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,190

the main line gone my upload speed has
 

937
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,270
the main line gone my upload speed has
been cut into like a third basically

938

so to get pistons and redstone to all of
 

1025
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,909
so to get pistons and redstone to all of
this we're gonna need

1026
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
this we're gonna need
 

1027
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,110
this we're gonna need
1024 pistons which works out to

1028
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120
1024 pistons which works out to
 

1029
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,350
1024 pistons which works out to
needing over 2 000 redstone because

1030
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
needing over 2 000 redstone because
 

1031
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,510
needing over 2 000 redstone because
each spot needs a piece of redstone plus

1032
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
each spot needs a piece of redstone plus
 

1033
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,390
each spot needs a piece of redstone plus
a piston takes

1034
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:06,400
a piston takes
 

1035
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,870
a piston takes
a piece of stone and we will need 1024

1036
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
a piece of stone and we will need 1024
 

1037
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,350
a piece of stone and we will need 1024
pieces of string for all the trip wires

1038
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
pieces of string for all the trip wires
 

1039
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,909
pieces of string for all the trip wires
as well

1040
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:13,919
as well
 

1041
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,950
as well
so got a little bit of resource grinding

1042
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:16,960
so got a little bit of resource grinding
 

1043
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,350
so got a little bit of resource grinding
to

1044
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
to
 

1045
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,430
to
go to this is what it's supposed to

1046
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
go to this is what it's supposed to
 

1047
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,590
go to this is what it's supposed to
look like by the way oh

1048
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:25,600
look like by the way oh
 

1049
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,510
look like by the way oh
i lived uh yeah like that

1050
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
i lived uh yeah like that
 

1051
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,110
i lived uh yeah like that
i did not think i walked that far off um

1052
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
i did not think i walked that far off um
 

1053
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,669
i did not think i walked that far off um
we're gonna we're gonna leave here

1054
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
we're gonna we're gonna leave here
 

1055
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,110
we're gonna we're gonna leave here
before i die again

1056
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
before i die again
 

1057
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,470
before i die again
um so i got

1058
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,480
um so i got
 

1059
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,310
um so i got
maybe a quarter of the redstone needed

1060
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,320
maybe a quarter of the redstone needed
 

1061
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,310
maybe a quarter of the redstone needed
for that a little over half the iron

1062
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
for that a little over half the iron
 

1063
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,269
for that a little over half the iron
needed

1064
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:45,279
needed
 

1065
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,269
needed
and like a quarter of the string so we

1066
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:47,279
and like a quarter of the string so we
 

1067
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,870
and like a quarter of the string so we
got a ways to go

1068
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:48,880
got a ways to go
 

1069
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,110
got a ways to go
before we can do this

1070
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,120
before we can do this
 

1071
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,390
before we can do this
let's head over to the man cave now

1072

just the way this is set up there's no

1116
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
just the way this is set up there's no
 

1117
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,230
just the way this is set up there's no
real angle

1118
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,240
real angle
 

1119
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,909
real angle
like you can see it if you're if you're

1120
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919
like you can see it if you're if you're
 

1121
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,350
like you can see it if you're if you're
on the grass but you're not supposed to

1122
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360
on the grass but you're not supposed to
 

1123
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,950
on the grass but you're not supposed to
ever go on the grass there's railings

1124
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
ever go on the grass there's railings
 

1125
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,870
ever go on the grass there's railings
and stuff to prevent that

1126

and stuff to prevent that
so from up here you can't see it

1128
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,320
so from up here you can't see it
 

1129
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,190
so from up here you can't see it
can't see it from here really you can

1130
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
can't see it from here really you can
 

1131
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,710
can't see it from here really you can
catch a little bit of a glimpse i

1132
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720
catch a little bit of a glimpse i
 

1133
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,630

otherwise from most angles it's not
 

1139
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,990
otherwise from most angles it's not
possible to see it so that's cool

1140
