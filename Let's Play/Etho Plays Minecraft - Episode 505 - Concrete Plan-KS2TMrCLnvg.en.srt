you have no idea originally I made it

10
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,470
you have no idea originally I made it
 

11
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,960
you have no idea originally I made it
where you get this like afk and hold

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:20,970
where you get this like afk and hold
 

13
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,870

right click in there but it would Jam

14
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:22,880
right click in there but it would Jam
 

15
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,660
right click in there but it would Jam
every so often so then I made it swear

16
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:26,670
every so often so then I made it swear
 

17
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,200
every so often so then I made it swear
like gravity would feed it sand and

18
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,210
like gravity would feed it sand and
 

19
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,970
like gravity would feed it sand and
you'd use the timing of the sand falling

20
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:31,980
you'd use the timing of the sand falling
 

21
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,220
you'd use the timing of the sand falling
to kind of control it but even that

22
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:34,230
to kind of control it but even that
 

23
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,110
to kind of control it but even that
would jam every so often the sand was

24
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,120
would jam every so often the sand was
 

25
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,900
would jam every so often the sand was
falling too quickly so now I've made

26
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:38,910
falling too quickly so now I've made
 

27
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,389
falling too quickly so now I've made
like this hopper feeding system that

28
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:41,399
like this hopper feeding system that
 

29
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,910

we're gonna try out and hopefully this

30
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
we're gonna try out and hopefully this
 

31
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,660
we're gonna try out and hopefully this
will finally solve all my problems in

32
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:47,670
will finally solve all my problems in
 

33
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,200
will finally solve all my problems in
life now the thing is how quick can you

34
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,210
life now the thing is how quick can you
 

35
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,279
life now the thing is how quick can you
get this running is the question

36
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:00,289
get this running is the question
 

37
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:06,109
get this running is the question
probably faster than that right faster

38
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:06,119
probably faster than that right faster
 

39
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,390
probably faster than that right faster
oh we're going too quick no this is what

40
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:11,400
oh we're going too quick no this is what
 

41
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,770
oh we're going too quick no this is what
that was afraid okay slow down so it's a

42
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:14,780
that was afraid okay slow down so it's a
 

43
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,530

if you go too quick it'll push the sand

44
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:18,540
if you go too quick it'll push the sand
 

45
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,060
if you go too quick it'll push the sand
before it's it's done falling I think

46
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,070
before it's it's done falling I think
 

47
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,789
before it's it's done falling I think
this is our limit here and then it just

48
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:25,799
this is our limit here and then it just
 

49
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:50,419
this is our limit here and then it just
starts spurting out everywhere

50
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:50,429

 

51
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:53,130

uh-huh what did you think it was going

52
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:53,140
uh-huh what did you think it was going
 

53
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,919
uh-huh what did you think it was going
to say actually it's a probably better

54
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:55,929
to say actually it's a probably better
 

55
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:59,279
to say actually it's a probably better
you don't answer that so this thing is

56
00:01:59,279 --> 00:01:59,289
you don't answer that so this thing is
 

57
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:00,929
you don't answer that so this thing is
it's running good now so we can just

58
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:00,939
it's running good now so we can just
 

59
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:03,840
it's running good now so we can just
leave it do its thing and every every so

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:03,850
leave it do its thing and every every so
 

61
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,279
leave it do its thing and every every so
often I just go to the top there and

62
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:05,289
often I just go to the top there and
 

63
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:08,969
often I just go to the top there and
drop in sand let's head over here I just

64
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:08,979
drop in sand let's head over here I just
 

65
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,190
drop in sand let's head over here I just
saw a tweet apparently they're gonna add

66
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
saw a tweet apparently they're gonna add
 

67
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,890
saw a tweet apparently they're gonna add
a recipe in the in the release for

68
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:13,900
a recipe in the in the release for
 

69
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,930
a recipe in the in the release for
packed ice you know the stuff I make the

70
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:15,940
packed ice you know the stuff I make the
 

71
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,170
packed ice you know the stuff I make the
boat roads out of probably I'm guessing

72
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:19,180
boat roads out of probably I'm guessing
 

73
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,569
boat roads out of probably I'm guessing
it's gonna be 9 ice per packed ice and

74
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:21,579
it's gonna be 9 ice per packed ice and
 

75
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:24,270
it's gonna be 9 ice per packed ice and
then it's 9 packed ice for the new block

76
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,280
then it's 9 packed ice for the new block
 

77
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,640
then it's 9 packed ice for the new block
that's coming out the blue ice so

78
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:26,650
that's coming out the blue ice so
 

79
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,650
that's coming out the blue ice so
there's a good reason to start farming

80
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:28,660
there's a good reason to start farming
 

81
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,430
there's a good reason to start farming
this stuff up and I better I better do

82
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:32,440
this stuff up and I better I better do
 

83
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,069
this stuff up and I better I better do
that actually wait we we should curve us

84
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:35,079
that actually wait we we should curve us
 

85
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,650
that actually wait we we should curve us
from the top top down is the easiest way

86
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:37,660
from the top top down is the easiest way
 

87
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,839
from the top top down is the easiest way
to do it

88
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:38,849
to do it
 

89
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,490
to do it
yeah so this farm is gonna get a lot of

90
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:41,500
yeah so this farm is gonna get a lot of
 

91
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,809
yeah so this farm is gonna get a lot of
useful again

92
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:42,819
useful again
 

93
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,879
useful again
I kind of stopped harvesting it just

94
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:44,889
I kind of stopped harvesting it just
 

95
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:47,490
I kind of stopped harvesting it just
because I had so much stop stop but I'm

96
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:47,500
because I had so much stop stop but I'm
 

97
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:56,360
because I had so much stop stop but I'm
never gonna use it right but

98
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,370

 

99
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,840

this is kind of weird look at that that

100
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:00,850
this is kind of weird look at that that
 

101
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,620
this is kind of weird look at that that
detector rails broken it's stucked on

102
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:03,630
detector rails broken it's stucked on
 

103
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:13,050
detector rails broken it's stucked on
and it stops there what dude we have a

104
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,060
and it stops there what dude we have a
 

105
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,230
and it stops there what dude we have a
defective rail here why is something no

106
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:19,240
defective rail here why is something no
 

107
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,410
defective rail here why is something no
nothing's powering it it's like we have

108
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:22,420
nothing's powering it it's like we have
 

109
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,260
nothing's powering it it's like we have
an invisible entity stuck on the rail or

110
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,270
an invisible entity stuck on the rail or
 

111
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,170
an invisible entity stuck on the rail or
something and that's what's gliding into

112
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,180
something and that's what's gliding into
 

113
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,650
something and that's what's gliding into
right oh I bet you there's an invisible

114
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:31,660
right oh I bet you there's an invisible
 

115
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,170
right oh I bet you there's an invisible
minecart there how do we get rid of it

116
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:37,180
minecart there how do we get rid of it
 

117
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:43,710
minecart there how do we get rid of it
okay I was wondering why this farm keeps

118
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:43,720
okay I was wondering why this farm keeps
 

119
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,690
okay I was wondering why this farm keeps
breaking there's an invisible minecart

120
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:45,700
breaking there's an invisible minecart
 

121
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,120
breaking there's an invisible minecart
here I think if we drop it down

122
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,130
here I think if we drop it down
 

123
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,230
here I think if we drop it down
well let that just get rid of it

124
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:52,240
well let that just get rid of it
 

125
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,110
well let that just get rid of it
hopefully I in place a block there maybe

126
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
hopefully I in place a block there maybe
 

127
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,730
hopefully I in place a block there maybe
not this is something I've never

128
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:02,740
not this is something I've never
 

129
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,560
not this is something I've never
encountered before I didn't know

130
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:04,570
encountered before I didn't know
 

131
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,480
encountered before I didn't know
invisible mine carts were a thing I

132
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:06,490
invisible mine carts were a thing I
 

133
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,950
invisible mine carts were a thing I
think this was from one of those

134
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:07,960
think this was from one of those
 

135
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,460
think this was from one of those
snapshots maybe or one of the updates

136
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:10,470
snapshots maybe or one of the updates
 

137
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,170
snapshots maybe or one of the updates
made all my mine carts like get messed

138
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:13,180
made all my mine carts like get messed
 

139
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:19,710
made all my mine carts like get messed
up there's another like really weird

140
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:19,720
up there's another like really weird
 

141
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,870
up there's another like really weird
thing about this I can put like a

142
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:21,880
thing about this I can put like a
 

143
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,800
thing about this I can put like a
detector rail here right but apparently

144
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:25,810
detector rail here right but apparently
 

145
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,200
detector rail here right but apparently
whatever is in this spot deletes any

146
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,210
whatever is in this spot deletes any
 

147
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:36,240
whatever is in this spot deletes any
blocks I place in it okay not okay I

148
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,250
blocks I place in it okay not okay I
 

149
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,380
blocks I place in it okay not okay I
take that back maybe only certain blocks

150
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:39,390
take that back maybe only certain blocks
 

151
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,280
take that back maybe only certain blocks
yeah look at this so the stone

152
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,290
yeah look at this so the stone
 

153
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,980
yeah look at this so the stone
disappears so we can place the detector

154
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:43,990
disappears so we can place the detector
 

155
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,480
disappears so we can place the detector
rails there we can place torches there

156
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,490
rails there we can place torches there
 

157
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,960
rails there we can place torches there
for some reason I'm a little scared to

158
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:48,970
for some reason I'm a little scared to
 

159
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,810
for some reason I'm a little scared to
put ice because it might wash away the

160
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:51,820
put ice because it might wash away the
 

161
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,690
put ice because it might wash away the
tracks so it has a problem with blocks

162
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:54,700

00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:20,249
redstone to date it's trying to think
 

277
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:22,969
redstone to date it's trying to think
what's what redstone project would be

278
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:22,979
what's what redstone project would be
 

279
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,519
what's what redstone project would be
fun what's something that we have to use

280
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:25,529
fun what's something that we have to use
 

281
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,610
fun what's something that we have to use
our heads on and I was thinking I

282
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:28,620
our heads on and I was thinking I
 

283
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,589
our heads on and I was thinking I
haven't really used a lot of concrete

284
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:30,599
haven't really used a lot of concrete
 

285
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,749
haven't really used a lot of concrete
sort of concrete powder not as much as I

286
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:32,759
sort of concrete powder not as much as I
 

287
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,249
sort of concrete powder not as much as I
would like to it's a new blocked in the

288
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:34,259
would like to it's a new blocked in the
 

289
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,140
would like to it's a new blocked in the
game that has a lot of potential I think

290
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,150
game that has a lot of potential I think
 

291
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,409
game that has a lot of potential I think
I've seen some really good like interior

292
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:39,419
I've seen some really good like interior
 

293
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:43,730
I've seen some really good like interior
design using the concrete's so I was

294
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:43,740
design using the concrete's so I was
 

295
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,790
design using the concrete's so I was
thinking okay let's let's do something

296
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:45,800
thinking okay let's let's do something
 

297
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,580
thinking okay let's let's do something
where we firm concrete right but the

298
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:49,590
where we firm concrete right but the
 

299
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,700
where we firm concrete right but the
thing is it's like you hold right click

300
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:51,710
thing is it's like you hold right click
 

301
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,640
thing is it's like you hold right click
what is it left click ohh I don't not do

302
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:55,650
what is it left click ohh I don't not do
 

303
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,300
what is it left click ohh I don't not do
it oh I got to switch it right yeah like

304
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,310
it oh I got to switch it right yeah like
 

305
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,390
it oh I got to switch it right yeah like
it's so easy to farm this stuff I can't

306
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
it's so easy to farm this stuff I can't
 

307
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,839
it's so easy to farm this stuff I can't
really do anything redstone revolving

308
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:05,849
really do anything redstone revolving
 

309
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:07,730
really do anything redstone revolving
around it's like so perfected already

310
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:07,740
around it's like so perfected already
 

311
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,209
around it's like so perfected already
just the way it is right so here's what

312
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:11,219
just the way it is right so here's what
 

313
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:12,950
just the way it is right so here's what
I want to do since there's not really

314
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
I want to do since there's not really
 

315
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,709
I want to do since there's not really
much to concrete right let's let's take

316
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:15,719
much to concrete right let's let's take
 

317
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:18,290
much to concrete right let's let's take
concrete's and really over-engineer

318
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:18,300
concrete's and really over-engineer
 

319
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,260
concrete's and really over-engineer
something towards it because we actually

320
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,270
something towards it because we actually
 

321
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,469
something towards it because we actually
don't have a spot for it in the Nexus or

322
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
don't have a spot for it in the Nexus or
 

323
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,140
don't have a spot for it in the Nexus or
in the man cave storage room so if we

324
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,150
in the man cave storage room so if we
 

325
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,600
in the man cave storage room so if we
get a bunch of concrete powder or

326
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:29,610
get a bunch of concrete powder or
 

327
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,339
get a bunch of concrete powder or
concrete blocks I have nowhere to store

328
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:31,349
concrete blocks I have nowhere to store
 

329
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:34,250
concrete blocks I have nowhere to store
it right now so let's make this room for

330
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,260
it right now so let's make this room for
 

331
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,560
it right now so let's make this room for
storing it for crafting it's and just

332
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:36,570
storing it for crafting it's and just
 

333
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,829
storing it for crafting it's and just
like we'll make every little tedious

334
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
like we'll make every little tedious
 

335
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,610
like we'll make every little tedious
aspect of making concrete's

336
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:42,620
aspect of making concrete's
 

337
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,500
aspect of making concrete's
over-engineered to the maximum sounds

338
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:45,510
over-engineered to the maximum sounds
 

339
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,240
over-engineered to the maximum sounds
like fun let's do it okay

340
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,250
like fun let's do it okay
 

341
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,310
like fun let's do it okay
by the way another weird thing just

342
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:49,320
by the way another weird thing just
 

343
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,530
by the way another weird thing just
happened here this cat teleported to me

344
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:51,540
happened here this cat teleported to me
 

345
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,170
happened here this cat teleported to me
and it's a broken cat it doesn't move I

346
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:56,180
and it's a broken cat it doesn't move I
 

347
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,460
and it's a broken cat it doesn't move I
think it's from the mob system but I

348
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:58,470
think it's from the mob system but I
 

349
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,960
think it's from the mob system but I
don't know why it would have teleported

350
00:08:59,960 --> 00:08:59,970
don't know why it would have teleported
 

351
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,439
don't know why it would have teleported
here alright everybody so I guess let's

352
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:03,449
here alright everybody so I guess let's
 

353
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:05,720
here alright everybody so I guess let's
get started on figuring things out here

354
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:05,730
get started on figuring things out here
 

355
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,730
get started on figuring things out here
what I want to do is this build the

356
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:07,740
what I want to do is this build the
 

357
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,319
what I want to do is this build the
different redstone components separately

358
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:09,329
different redstone components separately
 

359
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:12,889
different redstone components separately
and try to understand how how to combine

360
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:12,899
and try to understand how how to combine
 

361
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,139
and try to understand how how to combine
them together and then once we get

362
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:15,149
them together and then once we get
 

363
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:16,550
them together and then once we get
everything figured out we'll build a big

364
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
everything figured out we'll build a big
 

365
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,069
everything figured out we'll build a big
fancy concrete and concrete powder room

366
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:19,079
fancy concrete and concrete powder room
 

367
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,160
fancy concrete and concrete powder room
where we we craft and store all the

368
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,170
where we we craft and store all the
 

369
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,920
where we we craft and store all the
different colors and stuff possibly

370
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:24,930
different colors and stuff possibly
 

371
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,720
different colors and stuff possibly
other things to like we might do all the

372
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:26,730
other things to like we might do all the
 

373
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,740
other things to like we might do all the
color

374
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:27,750
color
 

375
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,480
color
walks in the game like wool and clay and

376
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:29,490
walks in the game like wool and clay and
 

377
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,600
walks in the game like wool and clay and
glass in the room as well like a big

378
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:32,610
glass in the room as well like a big
 

379
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,629
glass in the room as well like a big
color room but the first thing we're

380
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:35,639
color room but the first thing we're
 

381
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,879
color room but the first thing we're
gonna work on here is a selection system

382
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:37,889
gonna work on here is a selection system
 

383
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:40,579
gonna work on here is a selection system
I want to use maybe two item frames here

384
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:40,589
I want to use maybe two item frames here
 

385
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:43,309
I want to use maybe two item frames here
for all the 16 different colors in the

386
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:43,319
for all the 16 different colors in the
 

387
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:46,550
for all the 16 different colors in the
game and depending on what we select

388
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
game and depending on what we select
 

389
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,309
game and depending on what we select
like if we go to orange if we're

390
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:49,319
like if we go to orange if we're
 

391
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:51,470
like if we go to orange if we're
crafting concrete's then as we're

392
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:51,480
crafting concrete's then as we're
 

393
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,470
crafting concrete's then as we're
crafting it it's gonna dispense orange

394
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
crafting it it's gonna dispense orange
 

395
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,639
crafting it it's gonna dispense orange
dye at us if we're requesting an item

396
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:58,649
dye at us if we're requesting an item
 

397
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:00,319
dye at us if we're requesting an item
out of storage then it's gonna select

398
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,329
out of storage then it's gonna select
 

399
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:02,240
out of storage then it's gonna select
the orange items and maybe we have a

400
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,250
the orange items and maybe we have a
 

401
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,119
the orange items and maybe we have a
button to select between concrete powder

402
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:05,129
button to select between concrete powder
 

403
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:09,319
button to select between concrete powder
the blocks wool glass and then it's

404
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:09,329
the blocks wool glass and then it's
 

405
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:12,350
the blocks wool glass and then it's
gonna select life we hit the clay button

406
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:12,360
gonna select life we hit the clay button
 

407
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,540
gonna select life we hit the clay button
then this is at orange then we get

408
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:14,550
then this is at orange then we get
 

409
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,179
then this is at orange then we get
orange clay if that makes sense

410
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:17,189
orange clay if that makes sense
 

411
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:20,090
orange clay if that makes sense
anyways let's sleep real quick here so

412
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,100
anyways let's sleep real quick here so
 

413
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,710
anyways let's sleep real quick here so
the challenging part of this is how do

414
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:21,720
the challenging part of this is how do
 

415
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,960
the challenging part of this is how do
we take the signal out of the item frame

416
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:23,970
we take the signal out of the item frame
 

417
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,749
we take the signal out of the item frame
and select like a dropper like we'll

418
00:10:26,749 --> 00:10:26,759
and select like a dropper like we'll
 

419
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,509
and select like a dropper like we'll
probably have a row of droppers with the

420
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
probably have a row of droppers with the
 

421
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,220
probably have a row of droppers with the
different colors of dye in or different

422
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,230
different colors of dye in or different
 

423
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,210
different colors of dye in or different
blocks like orange red pink how do we

424
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,220
blocks like orange red pink how do we
 

425
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,049
blocks like orange red pink how do we
choose or how do we make the signal

426
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:39,059
choose or how do we make the signal
 

427
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:40,670
choose or how do we make the signal
choose which dropper because we can't

428
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:40,680
choose which dropper because we can't
 

429
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,889
choose which dropper because we can't
activate them all at the same time right

430
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:42,899
activate them all at the same time right
 

431
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,740
activate them all at the same time right
we'll get all the colors in so basically

432
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:45,750
we'll get all the colors in so basically
 

433
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,920
we'll get all the colors in so basically
this will go for a distance of 8 and I

434
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:50,930
this will go for a distance of 8 and I
 

435
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,150
this will go for a distance of 8 and I
think the trick with this I've seen this

436
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,160
think the trick with this I've seen this
 

437
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,569
think the trick with this I've seen this
done before you go I think you add an

438
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:56,579
done before you go I think you add an
 

439
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,400
done before you go I think you add an
extra row on top actually we'll wait

440
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,410
extra row on top actually we'll wait
 

441
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,629
extra row on top actually we'll wait
before we do that I think we need

442
00:10:59,629 --> 00:10:59,639
before we do that I think we need
 

443
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,259
before we do that I think we need
repeaters I kind of know how to do this

444
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:03,269
repeaters I kind of know how to do this
 

445
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:06,079
repeaters I kind of know how to do this
already so I think we have a row of

446
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:06,089
already so I think we have a row of
 

447
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:10,100
already so I think we have a row of
repeaters down here and those go into

448
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,110
repeaters down here and those go into
 

449
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,689
repeaters down here and those go into
set of blocks like this and then I think

450
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:14,699
set of blocks like this and then I think
 

451
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:16,369
set of blocks like this and then I think
you have redstone torches on the other

452
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:16,379
you have redstone torches on the other
 

453
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:20,210
you have redstone torches on the other
side oh I hate that if there's grass in

454
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,220
side oh I hate that if there's grass in
 

455
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,549
side oh I hate that if there's grass in
the way it always defaults to on the

456
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:22,559
the way it always defaults to on the
 

457
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,819
the way it always defaults to on the
ground even if you click it the yeah

458
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:25,829
ground even if you click it the yeah
 

459
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:29,210
ground even if you click it the yeah
anyways yeah I think we have a row above

460
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:29,220
anyways yeah I think we have a row above
 

461
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,100
anyways yeah I think we have a row above
then and then we make the Redstone go

462
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,110
then and then we make the Redstone go
 

463
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,129
then and then we make the Redstone go
along the top and then we have another

464
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:37,139
along the top and then we have another
 

465
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,230
along the top and then we have another
row of repeaters here it's kind of a

466
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,240
row of repeaters here it's kind of a
 

467
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,240
row of repeaters here it's kind of a
weird way of doing this

468
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,250
weird way of doing this
 

469
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,980
weird way of doing this
I think it works and we set these two

470
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:42,990
I think it works and we set these two
 

471
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:49,070
I think it works and we set these two
three right we'll just try this out see

472
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:49,080
three right we'll just try this out see
 

473
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,930
three right we'll just try this out see
if it works and then on top of the

474
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:50,940
if it works and then on top of the
 

475
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,400
if it works and then on top of the
torches we have another row of blocks

476
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:52,410
torches we have another row of blocks
 

477
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,970
torches we have another row of blocks
it's not super compact or anything but

478
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:55,980
it's not super compact or anything but
 

479
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,330
it's not super compact or anything but
is a tricky thing to do and I think we

480
00:11:59,330 --> 00:11:59,340
is a tricky thing to do and I think we
 

481
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,100
is a tricky thing to do and I think we
just have torches yeah look at that okay

482
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,110
just have torches yeah look at that okay
 

483
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,920
just have torches yeah look at that okay
so it's selected the fourth one and as

484
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:03,930
so it's selected the fourth one and as
 

485
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,650
so it's selected the fourth one and as
we spin this it should cycle through

486
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:06,660
we spin this it should cycle through
 

487
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:12,800
we spin this it should cycle through
them that's pretty cool all right yeah

488
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:12,810
them that's pretty cool all right yeah
 

489
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,150
them that's pretty cool all right yeah
so the way that works over there it's

490
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
so the way that works over there it's
 

491
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,130
so the way that works over there it's
basically a collection of and dates and

492
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,140
basically a collection of and dates and
 

493
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,950
basically a collection of and dates and
it's looking for the case where this

494
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:18,960
it's looking for the case where this
 

495
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,750
it's looking for the case where this
block the lower block is powered and

496
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:20,760
block the lower block is powered and
 

497
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,840
block the lower block is powered and
this one isn't any other combination

498
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:23,850
this one isn't any other combination
 

499
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,710
this one isn't any other combination
like if we if we go down it goes off

500
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
like if we if we go down it goes off
 

501
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,420
like if we if we go down it goes off
still off still off so it's only when

502
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:29,430
still off still off so it's only when
 

503
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,690
still off still off so it's only when
this is unpowered and this one's powered

504
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:32,700
this is unpowered and this one's powered
 

505
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,930
this is unpowered and this one's powered
that that turns on and that's the only

506
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:35,940
that that turns on and that's the only
 

507
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,770
that that turns on and that's the only
one where the redstone is is on down

508
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:39,780
one where the redstone is is on down
 

509
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,270
one where the redstone is is on down
here and off here all the other ones

510
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:41,280
here and off here all the other ones
 

511
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,300
here and off here all the other ones
it's either on or off off is the way it

512
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:44,310
it's either on or off off is the way it
 

513
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,390
it's either on or off off is the way it
makes that comparison aha so I think

514
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:47,400
makes that comparison aha so I think
 

515
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,690
makes that comparison aha so I think
then what we got to do is probably have

516
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:50,700
then what we got to do is probably have
 

517
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,820
then what we got to do is probably have
some sticky pistons next to this and the

518
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:55,830
some sticky pistons next to this and the
 

519
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,910
some sticky pistons next to this and the
one that's powered will get extended and

520
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:58,920
one that's powered will get extended and
 

521
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,350
one that's powered will get extended and
then we put blocks at the end of this

522
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:00,360
then we put blocks at the end of this
 

523
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,510
then we put blocks at the end of this
and then run some repeaters into them

524
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:02,520
and then run some repeaters into them
 

525
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,760
and then run some repeaters into them
probably mmm it's gonna be a little bit

526
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:04,770
probably mmm it's gonna be a little bit
 

527
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,230
probably mmm it's gonna be a little bit
tricky actually we had to find a

528
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
tricky actually we had to find a
 

529
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,500
tricky actually we had to find a
situation where like the repeaters won't

530
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:09,510
situation where like the repeaters won't
 

531
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,230
situation where like the repeaters won't
bud power the droppers because like this

532
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
bud power the droppers because like this
 

533
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,230
bud power the droppers because like this
they will like if we put something in

534
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,240
they will like if we put something in
 

535
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,410
they will like if we put something in
there it activates it not just the one

536
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:18,420
there it activates it not just the one
 

537
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,230
there it activates it not just the one
where the blocks extended so it'll work

538
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:21,240
where the blocks extended so it'll work
 

539
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,590
where the blocks extended so it'll work
if we have them facing up like this oops

540
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:26,600
if we have them facing up like this oops
 

541
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,880
if we have them facing up like this oops
because then like if we put something in

542
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:28,890
because then like if we put something in
 

543
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,420
because then like if we put something in
here

544
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:29,430
here
 

545
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,350
here
there's no block there can't activate it

546
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:32,360
there's no block there can't activate it
 

547
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,870
there's no block there can't activate it
and the one that has the block extended

548
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:35,880
and the one that has the block extended
 

549
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,640
and the one that has the block extended
over here will work but we want to shoot

550
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:37,650
over here will work but we want to shoot
 

551
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,450
over here will work but we want to shoot
the items into a a water stream right so

552
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:41,460
the items into a a water stream right so
 

553
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,329
the items into a a water stream right so
we would have to then put ice above the

554
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:44,339
we would have to then put ice above the
 

555
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,340
we would have to then put ice above the
droppers here and then the items might

556
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:46,350
droppers here and then the items might
 

557
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,380
droppers here and then the items might
shoot randomly cuz they'll have to

558
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:48,390
shoot randomly cuz they'll have to
 

559
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,570
shoot randomly cuz they'll have to
travel through a block so I don't really

560
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:50,580
travel through a block so I don't really
 

561
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,810
travel through a block so I don't really
like that hmm I just realized like a lot

562
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:53,820
like that hmm I just realized like a lot
 

563
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,079
like that hmm I just realized like a lot
of what we're doing here is

564
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:55,089
of what we're doing here is
 

565
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:57,540
of what we're doing here is
to the Nexus so I was like well I went

566
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:57,550
to the Nexus so I was like well I went
 

567
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,079
to the Nexus so I was like well I went
over there

568
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:58,089
over there
 

569
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,119
over there
how did I do though the water streams

570
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:00,129
how did I do though the water streams
 

571
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:02,040
how did I do though the water streams
there and it was it was like this so we

572
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,050
there and it was it was like this so we
 

573
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,389
there and it was it was like this so we
have the dropper facing into the ice

574
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:05,399
have the dropper facing into the ice
 

575
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,910
have the dropper facing into the ice
like that and I just like as the item

576
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:08,920
like that and I just like as the item
 

577
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,429
like that and I just like as the item
goes into the icer raises up into the

578
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:11,439
goes into the icer raises up into the
 

579
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:13,470
goes into the icer raises up into the
water stream above before it shoots out

580
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:13,480
water stream above before it shoots out
 

581
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,460
water stream above before it shoots out
the other side I think we'll try it out

582
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:17,470
the other side I think we'll try it out
 

583
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,290
the other side I think we'll try it out
here just make sure so if we load that

584
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:19,300
here just make sure so if we load that
 

585
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,129
here just make sure so if we load that
up with items put this on and see if any

586
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:23,139
up with items put this on and see if any
 

587
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:24,960
up with items put this on and see if any
of them shoots where they where they

588
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:24,970
of them shoots where they where they
 

589
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,239
of them shoots where they where they
don't belong

590
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:29,249

 

591
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:32,129

are they shooting out no it's just a

592
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:32,139
are they shooting out no it's just a
 

593
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:36,210
are they shooting out no it's just a
visual glitch as long as every item goes

594
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:36,220
visual glitch as long as every item goes
 

595
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,699
visual glitch as long as every item goes
through the water stream that's fine it

596
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:38,709
through the water stream that's fine it
 

597
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,239
through the water stream that's fine it
looks like it is so that's good and now

598
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:42,249
looks like it is so that's good and now
 

599
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,239
looks like it is so that's good and now
I don't know what to do I kind of got

600
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:45,249
I don't know what to do I kind of got
 

601
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:46,889
I don't know what to do I kind of got
caught there is like wait a bit what am

602
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:46,899
caught there is like wait a bit what am
 

603
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,369
caught there is like wait a bit what am
i doing I've done this before yeah I

604
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:50,379
i doing I've done this before yeah I
 

605
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:51,960
i doing I've done this before yeah I
don't really just want to copy the Nexus

606
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:51,970
don't really just want to copy the Nexus
 

607
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,360
don't really just want to copy the Nexus
again I was excited to use a selector

608
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:54,370
again I was excited to use a selector
 

609
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,999
again I was excited to use a selector
panel because I think it's cool but in

610
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:57,009
panel because I think it's cool but in
 

611
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:58,530
panel because I think it's cool but in
order to use it we pretty much have to

612
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:58,540
order to use it we pretty much have to
 

613
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,069
order to use it we pretty much have to
do like what we did with the Nexus

614
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:01,079
do like what we did with the Nexus
 

615
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,499
do like what we did with the Nexus
so rather than this let's try to do a

616
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:04,509
so rather than this let's try to do a
 

617
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:07,290
so rather than this let's try to do a
different storage system might not be

618
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:07,300
different storage system might not be
 

619
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,660
different storage system might not be
like over-engineered or anything no like

620
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:09,670
like over-engineered or anything no like
 

621
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,350
like over-engineered or anything no like
I was planning messing with my card

622
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
I was planning messing with my card
 

623
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,980
I was planning messing with my card
storage system and I had one idea here

624
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:16,990
storage system and I had one idea here
 

625
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,559
storage system and I had one idea here
where you basically get a hopper mind

626
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:19,569
where you basically get a hopper mind
 

627
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:28,350
where you basically get a hopper mind
curtain like so and then it'll as the

628
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:28,360
curtain like so and then it'll as the
 

629
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,669
curtain like so and then it'll as the
scraps amol here we'll throw it in the

630
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:29,679
scraps amol here we'll throw it in the
 

631
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,009
scraps amol here we'll throw it in the
chest basically you know even fill up

632
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:32,019
chest basically you know even fill up
 

633
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:33,480
chest basically you know even fill up
these chests you don't have to sort the

634
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:33,490
these chests you don't have to sort the
 

635
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,189
these chests you don't have to sort the
items and then like when you want to

636
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
items and then like when you want to
 

637
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,360
items and then like when you want to
grab items out of there you just create

638
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:39,370
grab items out of there you just create
 

639
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,400
grab items out of there you just create
a filter in the minecart like that and

640
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,410
a filter in the minecart like that and
 

641
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,929
a filter in the minecart like that and
then when it passes by it'll pick up a

642
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:45,939
then when it passes by it'll pick up a
 

643
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:47,819
then when it passes by it'll pick up a
few of the items even bounce it back and

644
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:47,829
few of the items even bounce it back and
 

645
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:49,889
few of the items even bounce it back and
forth on the track to get more thinking

646
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:49,899
forth on the track to get more thinking
 

647
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:51,569
forth on the track to get more thinking
about maybe doing something like that

648
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:51,579
about maybe doing something like that
 

649
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:55,829
about maybe doing something like that
but it seemed not so great I think it'd

650
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
but it seemed not so great I think it'd
 

651
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,299
but it seemed not so great I think it'd
be kind of slow and there'd be a lot of

652
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:57,309
be kind of slow and there'd be a lot of
 

653
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:00,389
be kind of slow and there'd be a lot of
complications to it alright everybody so

654
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
complications to it alright everybody so
 

655
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,910
complications to it alright everybody so
not to worry I have finally decided what

656
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:02,920
not to worry I have finally decided what
 

657
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,379
not to worry I have finally decided what
we're gonna do with the storage system

658
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:04,389
we're gonna do with the storage system
 

659
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:07,559
we're gonna do with the storage system
here and rather than going like overly

660
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:07,569
here and rather than going like overly
 

661
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:08,910
here and rather than going like overly
engineered and complex

662
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:08,920
engineered and complex
 

663
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,970
engineered and complex
like a nexus sort of system I decided

664
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:11,980
like a nexus sort of system I decided
 

665
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,519
like a nexus sort of system I decided
let's go the opposite routes super

666
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:14,529
let's go the opposite routes super
 

667
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:17,299
let's go the opposite routes super
simple super effective super compact

668
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:17,309
simple super effective super compact
 

669
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,369
simple super effective super compact
because yeah I just don't want to do the

670
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:20,379
because yeah I just don't want to do the
 

671
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,650
because yeah I just don't want to do the
same thing again that's not really why

672
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:22,660
same thing again that's not really why
 

673
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,299
same thing again that's not really why
you guys watch me right you want you

674
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:24,309
you guys watch me right you want you
 

675
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:26,939
you guys watch me right you want you
want to see a new idea right I think

676
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:26,949
want to see a new idea right I think
 

677
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:28,859
want to see a new idea right I think
that would be a lot more fun so we're

678
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:28,869
that would be a lot more fun so we're
 

679
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:30,659
that would be a lot more fun so we're
gonna do a minecart system kind of like

680
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:30,669
gonna do a minecart system kind of like
 

681
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:32,460
gonna do a minecart system kind of like
I was looking at but a little bit

682
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:32,470
I was looking at but a little bit
 

683
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,439
I was looking at but a little bit
different

684
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:33,449
different
 

685
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:36,329
different
rather than using chess we're gonna use

686
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:36,339
rather than using chess we're gonna use
 

687
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:42,509
rather than using chess we're gonna use
oh I need a hopper minecarts one second

688
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:42,519
oh I need a hopper minecarts one second
 

689
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,419
oh I need a hopper minecarts one second
we're gonna use storage minecarts for

690
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:45,429
we're gonna use storage minecarts for
 

691
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:47,759
we're gonna use storage minecarts for
the storage instead of instead of chests

692
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:47,769
the storage instead of instead of chests
 

693
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:49,379
the storage instead of instead of chests
here so here I'm just gonna break one of

694
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:49,389
here so here I'm just gonna break one of
 

695
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:52,799
here so here I'm just gonna break one of
these snag a hopper so we use this

696
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:52,809
these snag a hopper so we use this
 

697
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:57,720
these snag a hopper so we use this
hopper minecarts to filter the items to

698
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:57,730
hopper minecarts to filter the items to
 

699
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,129
hopper minecarts to filter the items to
retrieve what we want out of the system

700
00:16:59,129 --> 00:16:59,139
retrieve what we want out of the system
 

701
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:01,919
retrieve what we want out of the system
we just put it above the slab there and

702
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:01,929
we just put it above the slab there and
 

703
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:05,579
we just put it above the slab there and
then we're gonna build this so quick

704
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:05,589
then we're gonna build this so quick
 

705
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:08,699
then we're gonna build this so quick
it's it's so simple I think that this

706
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:08,709
it's it's so simple I think that this
 

707
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:11,939
it's it's so simple I think that this
level here is where we want it and then

708
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:11,949
level here is where we want it and then
 

709
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:18,090
level here is where we want it and then
we put some rails above this and I don't

710
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:18,100
we put some rails above this and I don't
 

711
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,350
we put some rails above this and I don't
like the rail facing that way I kind of

712
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
like the rail facing that way I kind of
 

713
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,079
like the rail facing that way I kind of
want it this way if I break that yeah

714
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,089
want it this way if I break that yeah
 

715
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,610
want it this way if I break that yeah
I'll still they'll still go that way

716
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:23,620
I'll still they'll still go that way
 

717
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,829
I'll still they'll still go that way
good good you know what I just realized

718
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
good good you know what I just realized
 

719
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,750
good good you know what I just realized
these aren't cold storage minecarts

720
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
these aren't cold storage minecarts
 

721
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,810
these aren't cold storage minecarts
they're called mine carts with chests

722
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:29,820
they're called mine carts with chests
 

723
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,879
they're called mine carts with chests
who named it that's a terrible name

724
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:32,889
who named it that's a terrible name
 

725
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:35,190
who named it that's a terrible name
we've always called them storage bankers

726
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
we've always called them storage bankers
 

727
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,539
we've always called them storage bankers
like why didn't they get that name I

728
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:36,549
like why didn't they get that name I
 

729
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:37,879
like why didn't they get that name I
don't get it

730
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:37,889
don't get it
 

731
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,350
don't get it
all right anyway so we put a bunch of

732
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:40,360
all right anyway so we put a bunch of
 

733
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,200
all right anyway so we put a bunch of
storage mine carts up above here and the

734
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,210
storage mine carts up above here and the
 

735
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,759
storage mine carts up above here and the
more we have the more storage the

736
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:44,769
more we have the more storage the
 

737
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:47,940
more we have the more storage the
system's gonna have but we got to be

738
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:47,950
system's gonna have but we got to be
 

739
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,419
system's gonna have but we got to be
careful with this the more we add the

740
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:51,429
careful with this the more we add the
 

741
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:53,820
careful with this the more we add the
slower it's gonna be at finding the

742
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:53,830
slower it's gonna be at finding the
 

743
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,669
slower it's gonna be at finding the
items we want so I think I'm only gonna

744
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:56,679
items we want so I think I'm only gonna
 

745
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:00,960
items we want so I think I'm only gonna
put maybe 16 in there as our limit

746
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:00,970
put maybe 16 in there as our limit
 

747
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,529
put maybe 16 in there as our limit
oh is that three four five six I

748
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:04,539
oh is that three four five six I
 

749
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:07,320
oh is that three four five six I
probably missed counted let's just do

750
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:07,330
probably missed counted let's just do
 

751
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,480
probably missed counted let's just do
eight to begin with to test this all

752
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:09,490
eight to begin with to test this all
 

753
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,899
eight to begin with to test this all
right we can put items into those mine

754
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:12,909
right we can put items into those mine
 

755
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:14,700
right we can put items into those mine
carts just by putting a hopper facing

756
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:14,710
carts just by putting a hopper facing
 

757
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:20,720
carts just by putting a hopper facing
sideways like that and then above that

758
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:20,730
sideways like that and then above that
 

759
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,120
sideways like that and then above that
we will put a chest so any items we

760
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,130
we will put a chest so any items we
 

761
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,360
we will put a chest so any items we
throw in here will go into storage in

762
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,370
throw in here will go into storage in
 

763
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,650
throw in here will go into storage in
these mine carts right let's see here

764
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:31,660
these mine carts right let's see here
 

765
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,570
these mine carts right let's see here
let's drop down the ender chest will

766
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:33,580
let's drop down the ender chest will
 

767
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,950
let's drop down the ender chest will
actually start putting our concrete in

768
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960
actually start putting our concrete in
 

769
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:43,530
actually start putting our concrete in
here if I put it in here there it is

770
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:43,540
here if I put it in here there it is
 

771
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,810
here if I put it in here there it is
found it alright so basically as we

772
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:48,820
found it alright so basically as we
 

773
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,180
found it alright so basically as we
craft the the concrete or as we want to

774
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,190
craft the the concrete or as we want to
 

775
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,770
craft the the concrete or as we want to
drop it off we just throw it in here

776
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:52,780
drop it off we just throw it in here
 

777
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,830
drop it off we just throw it in here
nice and simple we don't have to assign

778
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
nice and simple we don't have to assign
 

779
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,720
nice and simple we don't have to assign
a specific chest to the items they look

780
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:57,730
a specific chest to the items they look
 

781
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,430
a specific chest to the items they look
let's go into the storage minecarts

782
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
let's go into the storage minecarts
 

783
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,120
let's go into the storage minecarts
according to where they can fit and the

784
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,130
according to where they can fit and the
 

785
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,790
according to where they can fit and the
other thing we want to do is kind of

786
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:05,800
other thing we want to do is kind of
 

787
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,120
other thing we want to do is kind of
like what the Nexus we're gonna have a

788
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,130
like what the Nexus we're gonna have a
 

789
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,950
like what the Nexus we're gonna have a
menu system so back here we can have

790
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
menu system so back here we can have
 

791
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,310
menu system so back here we can have
some chests with items in and so let's

792
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
some chests with items in and so let's
 

793
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,400
some chests with items in and so let's
say let's get this going in first we

794
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:20,410
say let's get this going in first we
 

795
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,590
say let's get this going in first we
just have a few stacks items here and

796
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:22,600
just have a few stacks items here and
 

797
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,140
just have a few stacks items here and
then whenever we want to find an item we

798
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,150
then whenever we want to find an item we
 

799
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,820
then whenever we want to find an item we
just look in here and it's like okay

800
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:26,830
just look in here and it's like okay
 

801
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,590
just look in here and it's like okay
throw that's press Q goes into here and

802
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:30,600
throw that's press Q goes into here and
 

803
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,100
throw that's press Q goes into here and
then when we raise that up probably have

804
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,110
then when we raise that up probably have
 

805
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,840
then when we raise that up probably have
some garbage items in here too like

806
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:36,850
some garbage items in here too like
 

807
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,150
some garbage items in here too like
stone for the four of the slots what

808
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,160
stone for the four of the slots what
 

809
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,740
stone for the four of the slots what
we'll do is do I have any ice we should

810
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:46,750
we'll do is do I have any ice we should
 

811
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,100
we'll do is do I have any ice we should
have after all we harvested today is it

812
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,110
have after all we harvested today is it
 

813
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,270
have after all we harvested today is it
under odd blocks I got an ami okay that

814
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:54,280
under odd blocks I got an ami okay that
 

815
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,630
under odd blocks I got an ami okay that
works out basically one thing I'm gonna

816
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:57,640
works out basically one thing I'm gonna
 

817
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,350
works out basically one thing I'm gonna
do here is add I think at that level

818
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:01,360
do here is add I think at that level
 

819
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,180
do here is add I think at that level
yeah add a little bit of redstone down

820
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,190
yeah add a little bit of redstone down
 

821
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,590
yeah add a little bit of redstone down
there so we can flick it up with a

822
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:04,600
there so we can flick it up with a
 

823
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,190
there so we can flick it up with a
pressure plate and we'll have ice so

824
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:08,200
pressure plate and we'll have ice so
 

825
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,440
pressure plate and we'll have ice so
that the items slide on there easy and

826
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:10,450
that the items slide on there easy and
 

827
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,640
that the items slide on there easy and
then just put a pressure plate on the

828
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:11,650
then just put a pressure plate on the
 

829
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,390
then just put a pressure plate on the
top now when we step on this it'll raise

830
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:15,400
top now when we step on this it'll raise
 

831
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,430
top now when we step on this it'll raise
the minecart up underneath the slab here

832
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,440
the minecart up underneath the slab here
 

833
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,130
the minecart up underneath the slab here
and then any black concrete in the

834
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:20,140
and then any black concrete in the
 

835
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,610
and then any black concrete in the
minecarts and get picked up and pretty

836
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:23,620
minecarts and get picked up and pretty
 

837
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,160
minecarts and get picked up and pretty
quickly but again the more of these you

838
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,170
quickly but again the more of these you
 

839
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,810
quickly but again the more of these you
have the slower it's gonna take for it

840
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:27,820
have the slower it's gonna take for it
 

841
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,770
have the slower it's gonna take for it
to find the items mm-hmm so I tried to

842
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:31,780
to find the items mm-hmm so I tried to
 

843
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,109
to find the items mm-hmm so I tried to
give this a bit more of a finished look

844
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:34,119
give this a bit more of a finished look
 

845
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,779
give this a bit more of a finished look
but I'm not super confident about my

846
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:36,789
but I'm not super confident about my
 

847
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:38,789
but I'm not super confident about my
building here in Slab City just yet

848
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:38,799
building here in Slab City just yet
 

849
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,099
building here in Slab City just yet
maybe a little keep it like this I'm

850
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:41,109
maybe a little keep it like this I'm
 

851
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,349
maybe a little keep it like this I'm
hoping as we we build more here things

852
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:43,359
hoping as we we build more here things
 

853
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,969
hoping as we we build more here things
are gonna start tying together better

854
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:44,979
are gonna start tying together better
 

855
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:48,499
are gonna start tying together better
and feeling more polished but anyways

856
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:48,509
and feeling more polished but anyways
 

857
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:50,999
and feeling more polished but anyways
let's this focus on the system for right

858
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:51,009
let's this focus on the system for right
 

859
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:53,549
let's this focus on the system for right
now here so yeah if you didn't get how

860
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:53,559
now here so yeah if you didn't get how
 

861
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,829
now here so yeah if you didn't get how
that this works basically what we do is

862
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:55,839
that this works basically what we do is
 

863
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,719
that this works basically what we do is
we create a menu system here with our

864
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:57,729
we create a menu system here with our
 

865
00:20:57,729 --> 00:20:59,999
we create a menu system here with our
different items we plan on storing in

866
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:00,009
different items we plan on storing in
 

867
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,789
different items we plan on storing in
the system Aftab have to add the

868
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:02,799
the system Aftab have to add the
 

869
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,499
the system Aftab have to add the
concrete blocks here yet but for the

870
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:04,509
concrete blocks here yet but for the
 

871
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:06,239
concrete blocks here yet but for the
powder for example let's say I want to

872
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:06,249
powder for example let's say I want to
 

873
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:11,069
powder for example let's say I want to
get orange concrete powder you do is you

874
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:11,079
get orange concrete powder you do is you
 

875
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,439
get orange concrete powder you do is you
just slide it there and press Q ends up

876
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:13,449
just slide it there and press Q ends up
 

877
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:15,389
just slide it there and press Q ends up
going into the minecart here and then

878
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:15,399
going into the minecart here and then
 

879
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,359
going into the minecart here and then
when we step on this any orange concrete

880
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:18,369
when we step on this any orange concrete
 

881
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:21,059
when we step on this any orange concrete
powder in the storage of minecarts will

882
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:21,069
powder in the storage of minecarts will
 

883
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:23,429
powder in the storage of minecarts will
get picked up here if we want to pick up

884
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:23,439
get picked up here if we want to pick up
 

885
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,959
get picked up here if we want to pick up
more orange you can just right click

886
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:24,969
more orange you can just right click
 

887
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:28,499
more orange you can just right click
here and it'll keep grabbing more but

888
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:28,509
here and it'll keep grabbing more but
 

889
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:29,849
here and it'll keep grabbing more but
otherwise if that's all you want you

890
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:29,859
otherwise if that's all you want you
 

891
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:31,499
otherwise if that's all you want you
just hop off here grab it

892
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:31,509
just hop off here grab it
 

893
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:35,909
just hop off here grab it
and then move on you drop stuff off here

894
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:35,919
and then move on you drop stuff off here
 

895
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,519
and then move on you drop stuff off here
and it'll go into storage nice and

896
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:38,529
and it'll go into storage nice and
 

897
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,589
and it'll go into storage nice and
simple then you want the next time and

898
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:40,599
simple then you want the next time and
 

899
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:45,059
simple then you want the next time and
let's say we want blue that's not too

900
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:45,069
let's say we want blue that's not too
 

901
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:48,059
let's say we want blue that's not too
bad right it's quick it's easy decent

902
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:48,069
bad right it's quick it's easy decent
 

903
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:49,109
bad right it's quick it's easy decent
amount of storage I think it works

904
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:49,119
amount of storage I think it works
 

905
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,329
amount of storage I think it works
really good for this case where we just

906
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:51,339
really good for this case where we just
 

907
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:53,189
really good for this case where we just
have like 32 different items we want to

908
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:53,199
have like 32 different items we want to
 

909
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:56,579
have like 32 different items we want to
store and it's like a few stacks of each

910
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:56,589
store and it's like a few stacks of each
 

911
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:59,249
store and it's like a few stacks of each
of them I think that's good ok so then

912
00:21:59,249 --> 00:21:59,259
of them I think that's good ok so then
 

913
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:01,439
of them I think that's good ok so then
the next thing we're gonna do here is

914
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:01,449
the next thing we're gonna do here is
 

915
00:22:01,449 --> 00:22:06,809
the next thing we're gonna do here is
add our farming area on top so I don't

916
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:06,819
add our farming area on top so I don't
 

917
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:10,289
add our farming area on top so I don't
know where's the middle here I think yes

918
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:10,299
know where's the middle here I think yes
 

919
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:12,389
know where's the middle here I think yes
all we got to do now is hook up some

920
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:12,399
all we got to do now is hook up some
 

921
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:17,699
all we got to do now is hook up some
hoppers to this to our chests here so do

922
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:17,709
hoppers to this to our chests here so do
 

923
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:18,509
hoppers to this to our chests here so do
I have them yes I do

924
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:18,519
I have them yes I do
 

925
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:23,279
I have them yes I do
awesome so just hook up hoppers here one

926
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:23,289
awesome so just hook up hoppers here one
 

927
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:26,429
awesome so just hook up hoppers here one
more and then go on top perfect ender

928
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:26,439
more and then go on top perfect ender
 

929
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:30,719
more and then go on top perfect ender
pearl throw yes ok oh I can't I place it

930
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:30,729
pearl throw yes ok oh I can't I place it
 

931
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:36,329
pearl throw yes ok oh I can't I place it
oh you know what if you if you're in the

932
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:36,339
oh you know what if you if you're in the
 

933
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:37,439
oh you know what if you if you're in the
middle there you can't jump high enough

934
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:37,449
middle there you can't jump high enough
 

935
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:42,569
middle there you can't jump high enough
to place the next one interesting and

936
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:42,579
to place the next one interesting and
 

937
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:44,639
to place the next one interesting and
yeah so then we just need some water up

938
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:44,649
yeah so then we just need some water up
 

939
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:46,979
yeah so then we just need some water up
here next to the hopper and let's give

940
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:46,989
here next to the hopper and let's give
 

941
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:47,760
here next to the hopper and let's give
this a

942
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:47,770
this a
 

943
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,520
this a
try so let's go grab some concrete out

944
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:50,530
try so let's go grab some concrete out
 

945
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,990
try so let's go grab some concrete out
of the storage here some of the powder

946
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,000
of the storage here some of the powder
 

947
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,880
of the storage here some of the powder
let's go for let's get some more blue I

let's go for let's get some more blue I
 

949
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,080
let's go for let's get some more blue I
don't think we have too many different

950
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,090
don't think we have too many different
 

951
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,480
don't think we have too many different
colors in there right now I know we have

952
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:00,490
colors in there right now I know we have
 

953
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,070
colors in there right now I know we have
oranges we have blue so I'll just grab a

954
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080
oranges we have blue so I'll just grab a
 

955
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,590
oranges we have blue so I'll just grab a
stack of blue out of there I would like

956
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:04,600
stack of blue out of there I would like
 

957
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,930
stack of blue out of there I would like
to make a bit of an elevator or a slime

958
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:06,940
to make a bit of an elevator or a slime
 

959
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,910
to make a bit of an elevator or a slime
block launcher to get up here maybe on

960
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:08,920
block launcher to get up here maybe on
 

961
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,420
block launcher to get up here maybe on
another side here anyways we get this

962
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:12,430
another side here anyways we get this
 

963
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:16,340
another side here anyways we get this
press F to put it in our offhand and

964
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:16,350
press F to put it in our offhand and
 

965
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,870
press F to put it in our offhand and
since it's gonna be placed right above

966
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:18,880
since it's gonna be placed right above
 

967
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,120
since it's gonna be placed right above
the hopper here and broken the hopper

968
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,130
the hopper here and broken the hopper
 

969
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,250
the hopper here and broken the hopper
should always pick it up but let's give

970
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:23,260
should always pick it up but let's give
 

971
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,280
should always pick it up but let's give
it a try I guess the crafting table

972
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:26,290
it a try I guess the crafting table
 

973
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,530
it a try I guess the crafting table
doesn't work does it maybe if I hold the

974
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:28,540
doesn't work does it maybe if I hold the
 

975
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:36,930
doesn't work does it maybe if I hold the
shift oh okay that was a mess alright

976
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:36,940
shift oh okay that was a mess alright
 

977
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,370
shift oh okay that was a mess alright
that's working right I think we we have

978
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:41,380
that's working right I think we we have
 

979
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,850
that's working right I think we we have
a winner here so probably a FG here with

980
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:46,860
a winner here so probably a FG here with
 

981
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,730
a winner here so probably a FG here with
with the powder and stuff I guess we

982
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:50,740
with the powder and stuff I guess we
 

983
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,500
with the powder and stuff I guess we
want some way of dispensing it as we're

984
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:52,510
want some way of dispensing it as we're
 

985
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,210
want some way of dispensing it as we're
doing that so we don't run out cuz

986
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:54,220
doing that so we don't run out cuz
 

987
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,280
doing that so we don't run out cuz
otherwise once the stack runs out here

988
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,290
otherwise once the stack runs out here
 

989
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,990
otherwise once the stack runs out here
we're gonna stop so I want to set this

990
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,000
we're gonna stop so I want to set this
 

991
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,880
we're gonna stop so I want to set this
up so we just hold right click and afk

992
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:02,890
up so we just hold right click and afk
 

993
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:09,080
up so we just hold right click and afk
oh and then we break the hopper too

994
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,090
oh and then we break the hopper too
 

995
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,850
oh and then we break the hopper too
anyways so up above here is gonna be a

996
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:11,860
anyways so up above here is gonna be a
 

997
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,800
anyways so up above here is gonna be a
crafting station I want to set up a big

998
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:13,810
crafting station I want to set up a big
 

999
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,220
crafting station I want to set up a big
bulk storage for sand and gravel and

1000
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:16,230
bulk storage for sand and gravel and
 

1001
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,540
bulk storage for sand and gravel and
probably a bunch of the dyes will be up

1002
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:18,550
probably a bunch of the dyes will be up
 

1003
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,960
probably a bunch of the dyes will be up
here so we can craft that the powder up

1004
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:21,970
here so we can craft that the powder up
 

1005
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,150
here so we can craft that the powder up
here and then convert it over and then I

1006
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,160
here and then convert it over and then I
 

1007
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,460
here and then convert it over and then I
guess a dispenser system for shooting

1008
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:26,470
guess a dispenser system for shooting
 

1009
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,790
guess a dispenser system for shooting
more powder at us so we don't run out

1010
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:28,800
more powder at us so we don't run out
 

1011
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,070
more powder at us so we don't run out
and that'll be pretty much it I think

1012
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,080
and that'll be pretty much it I think
 

1013
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,290
and that'll be pretty much it I think
now how do I get that hopper I guess I

1014
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:34,300
now how do I get that hopper I guess I
 

1015
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,010
now how do I get that hopper I guess I
got to throw a hopper there we go we got

1016
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:38,020
got to throw a hopper there we go we got
 

1017
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,610
got to throw a hopper there we go we got
it oops if you don't put a filter there

1018
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:41,620
it oops if you don't put a filter there
 

1019
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,080
it oops if you don't put a filter there
it'll just grab whatever's first in the

1020
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,090
it'll just grab whatever's first in the
 

1021
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,460
it'll just grab whatever's first in the
system uh-huh

1022
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:46,470
system uh-huh
 

1023
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,660
system uh-huh
actually let's just try something here

1024
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:48,670
actually let's just try something here
 

1025
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,670
actually let's just try something here
with the dispensing system probably

1026
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:50,680
with the dispensing system probably
 

1027
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,230
with the dispensing system probably
don't need to do anything complicated

1028
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,240
don't need to do anything complicated
 

1029
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,030
don't need to do anything complicated
all right we just let's put that there

1030
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:54,040
all right we just let's put that there
 

1031
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,760
all right we just let's put that there
for right now have the observer

1032
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:56,770
for right now have the observer
 

1033
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,360
for right now have the observer
detecting when the block breaks and then

1034
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:00,370
detecting when the block breaks and then
 

1035
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,360
detecting when the block breaks and then
just a dropper right

1036
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,370
just a dropper right
 

1037
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,650
just a dropper right
let's let's put the dropper here for now

1038
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:04,660
let's let's put the dropper here for now
 

1039
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,590
let's let's put the dropper here for now
face us into a block maybe some redstone

1040
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:07,600
face us into a block maybe some redstone
 

1041
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,240
face us into a block maybe some redstone
it'd be nice if we could do it without

1042
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,250
it'd be nice if we could do it without
 

1043
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:14,820
it'd be nice if we could do it without
redstone showing actually strawberry

1044
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:14,830
redstone showing actually strawberry
 

1045
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,670
redstone showing actually strawberry
here so then we can have like some extra

1046
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:17,680
here so then we can have like some extra
 

1047
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,220
here so then we can have like some extra
powder in there if we want and that you

1048
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,230
powder in there if we want and that you
 

1049
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,900
powder in there if we want and that you
can probably make this nicer so that we

1050
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:21,910
can probably make this nicer so that we
 

1051
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,360
can probably make this nicer so that we
don't accidentally misplace the concrete

1052
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,370
don't accidentally misplace the concrete
 

1053
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,290
don't accidentally misplace the concrete
powder and put some string above let's

1054
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:28,300
powder and put some string above let's
 

1055
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,690
powder and put some string above let's
just try that right now maybe you want a

1056
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:30,700
just try that right now maybe you want a
 

1057
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,660
just try that right now maybe you want a
different block besides string switch

1058
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:33,670
different block besides string switch
 

1059
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:41,330
different block besides string switch
this pretty simple seems like it'll work

1060
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:41,340
this pretty simple seems like it'll work
 

1061
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,220
this pretty simple seems like it'll work
uh-huh well cool I think that turned out

1062
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,230
uh-huh well cool I think that turned out
 

1063
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,080
uh-huh well cool I think that turned out
pretty good I'm happy with that we'll

1064
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,090
pretty good I'm happy with that we'll
 

1065
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,580
pretty good I'm happy with that we'll
probably add more on to it in another

1066
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:47,590
probably add more on to it in another
 

1067
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,430
probably add more on to it in another
episode but for today guys it is time to

1068
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:50,440
episode but for today guys it is time to
 

1069
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,310
episode but for today guys it is time to
wrap up here's the book let's check out

1070
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:53,320
wrap up here's the book let's check out
 

1071

I was wondering if you ever considered a
 

1075
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,700
I was wondering if you ever considered a
different way to make nether connections

1076
00:25:59,700 --> 00:25:59,710
different way to make nether connections
 

1077
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,560
different way to make nether connections
now that the light sure has been out for

1078
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:01,570
now that the light sure has been out for
 

1079
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,750
now that the light sure has been out for
so long

anyways the problem with straight

1094
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:21,640
anyways the problem with straight
 

1095
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,370
anyways the problem with straight
tunnels is the distance as going

1096
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:23,380
tunnels is the distance as going
 

1097
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,170
tunnels is the distance as going
straight for 400 blocks and then left

1098
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:25,180
straight for 400 blocks and then left
 

1099
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,630
straight for 400 blocks and then left
for another 300 could be cut out with

1100
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:27,640
for another 300 could be cut out with
 

1101
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,180
for another 300 could be cut out with
just a straight 500 so go diagonal

1102
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,190
just a straight 500 so go diagonal
 

1103
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,370
just a straight 500 so go diagonal
instead of like one way and another way

1104
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:32,380
instead of like one way and another way
 

1105
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,890
instead of like one way and another way
what I do is blast holes through the

1106
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:34,900
what I do is blast holes through the
 

1107
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,660
what I do is blast holes through the
landscape with TNT and just fly around

1108
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:36,670
landscape with TNT and just fly around
 

1109
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,850
landscape with TNT and just fly around
through them you move faster with the

1110
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:38,860
through them you move faster with the
 

1111
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,950
through them you move faster with the
light ray it's a more direct route and

1112
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:40,960
light ray it's a more direct route and
 

1113
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,440
light ray it's a more direct route and
you can have some fun I make different

1114
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:43,450
you can have some fun I make different
 

1115
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,840
you can have some fun I make different
rings to try to fly through on my way as

1116
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:45,850
rings to try to fly through on my way as
 

1117
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,030
rings to try to fly through on my way as
it keeps me entertained the only issue

1118
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,040
it keeps me entertained the only issue
 

1119
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,250
it keeps me entertained the only issue
that I could see is the possibility to

1120
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:50,260
that I could see is the possibility to
 

1121
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,490
that I could see is the possibility to
lose places yeah you know what I think

1122
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:53,500
lose places yeah you know what I think
 

1123
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,560
lose places yeah you know what I think
if you're going like somewhere far in

1124
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:55,570
if you're going like somewhere far in
 

1125
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,350
if you're going like somewhere far in
the nether it's not a big deal just to

1126
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:58,360
the nether it's not a big deal just to
 

1127
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
the nether it's not a big deal just to
fly through the nether with the lighter

1128
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:00,370
fly through the nether with the lighter
 

1129
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,790
fly through the nether with the lighter
wings like usually it's not that

1130
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:02,800
wings like usually it's not that
 

1131
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,570
wings like usually it's not that
dangerous and you rarely run into

1132
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:06,580
dangerous and you rarely run into
 

1133
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,890
dangerous and you rarely run into
anything in the nether it's pretty open

1134
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:07,900
anything in the nether it's pretty open
 

1135
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,290
anything in the nether it's pretty open
most the time but I do like having

1136
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:10,300
most the time but I do like having
 

1137
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,880
most the time but I do like having
tunnels I think they're always gonna be

1138
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:11,890
tunnels I think they're always gonna be
 

1139
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,240
tunnels I think they're always gonna be
good to have and I recommend you go into

1140
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,250
good to have and I recommend you go into
 

1141
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:15,539
good to have and I recommend you go into
the

1142
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:15,549
the
 

1143
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:18,239
the
they're sealing and just make like a

1144
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:18,249
they're sealing and just make like a
 

1145
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:21,239
they're sealing and just make like a
three-high tunnel or something like with

1146
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:21,249
three-high tunnel or something like with
 

1147
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:25,889
three-high tunnel or something like with
all the rockets here you're you don't

1148
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:25,899
all the rockets here you're you don't
 

1149
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:26,909
all the rockets here you're you don't
have any trouble flying through

1150
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:26,919
have any trouble flying through
 

1151
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:28,320
have any trouble flying through
something like this so you can even make

1152
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,330
something like this so you can even make
 

1153
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,080
something like this so you can even make
them diagonal if you want as well as

1154
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,090
them diagonal if you want as well as
 

1155
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:34,529
them diagonal if you want as well as
long as your roof is flat like you if

1156
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:34,539
long as your roof is flat like you if
 

1157
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:36,180
long as your roof is flat like you if
it's flat you can glide along the top

1158
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,190
it's flat you can glide along the top
 

1159
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,159
it's flat you can glide along the top
here and you'll never hit it or gets hit

1160
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:38,169
here and you'll never hit it or gets hit
 

1161
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:40,440
here and you'll never hit it or gets hit
your head on something you know if

1162
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:40,450
your head on something you know if
 

1163
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,590
your head on something you know if
you're not flying perfectly straight

1164
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:42,600
you're not flying perfectly straight
 

1165
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,450
you're not flying perfectly straight
well it's not hard to like move around

1166
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:45,460
well it's not hard to like move around
 

1167
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,960
well it's not hard to like move around
in a tunnel like this I do think so as

1168
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:48,970
in a tunnel like this I do think so as
 

1169
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,729
in a tunnel like this I do think so as
great as the light ray is for getting

1170
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:50,739
great as the light ray is for getting
 

1171
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:54,239
great as the light ray is for getting
around and stuff I still prefer I think

1172
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:54,249
around and stuff I still prefer I think
 

1173
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:56,180
around and stuff I still prefer I think
boat roads are still the way to go for

1174
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,190
boat roads are still the way to go for
 

1175
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:01,919
boat roads are still the way to go for
any like long-term passage in the nether

1176
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:01,929
any like long-term passage in the nether
 

1177
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:05,249
any like long-term passage in the nether
here like I think they're quicker it

1178
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:05,259
here like I think they're quicker it
 

1179
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:06,720
here like I think they're quicker it
could be wrong but I think it's faster

1180
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:06,730
could be wrong but I think it's faster
 

1181
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,099
could be wrong but I think it's faster
and the blue ice that's coming I was

1182
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:08,109
and the blue ice that's coming I was
 

1183
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:11,759
and the blue ice that's coming I was
gonna be even quicker I think there's a

1184
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:11,769
gonna be even quicker I think there's a
 

1185
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:13,470
gonna be even quicker I think there's a
bit slower to start out but then once

1186
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:13,480
bit slower to start out but then once
 

1187
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,379
bit slower to start out but then once
you're going it's it's quick and it's

1188
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:16,389
you're going it's it's quick and it's
 

1189
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:20,659
you're going it's it's quick and it's
easy to take a turn like BAM no problem

1190
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:20,669
easy to take a turn like BAM no problem
 

1191
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:24,169
easy to take a turn like BAM no problem
and it's I don't know I think it's cool

1192
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:24,179
and it's I don't know I think it's cool
 

1193
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,369
and it's I don't know I think it's cool
so I recommend boat roads still I

1194
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:26,379
so I recommend boat roads still I
 

1195
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:28,789
so I recommend boat roads still I
wouldn't really do a light for tunnels

1196
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:28,799
wouldn't really do a light for tunnels
 

1197
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,310
wouldn't really do a light for tunnels
uh-huh anyways I think that's gonna be

1198
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,320
uh-huh anyways I think that's gonna be
 

1199
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,509
uh-huh anyways I think that's gonna be
it for today guys so hopefully you
