we're going to check out this new

28
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:49,350
we're going to check out this new
 

29
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,250
we're going to check out this new
enchanting and repair system I guess

30
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:52,260
enchanting and repair system I guess
 

31
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,430
enchanting and repair system I guess
just a repair system I want to try make

32
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
just a repair system I want to try make
 

33
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,590
just a repair system I want to try make
a super duper overpowered pickier

34
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
a super duper overpowered pickier
 

35
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,330
a super duper overpowered pickier
because repair costs have gotten really

36
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:02,340
because repair costs have gotten really
 

37
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,399
because repair costs have gotten really
cheap in the game so to make an

38
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:04,409
cheap in the game so to make an
 

39
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,690

efficiency 5 fortune 3 unbreaking 3
 

41
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,899
efficiency 5 fortune 3 unbreaking 3
definitely possible costs 5 levels all

42
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:11,909
definitely possible costs 5 levels all
 

43
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,429
definitely possible costs 5 levels all
right and then we can name it hopefully

44
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
right and then we can name it hopefully
 

45
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,520
right and then we can name it hopefully

yeah
 

51
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,170
yeah
I'll probably be making a bunch of those

52
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:24,180
I'll probably be making a bunch of those
 

53
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,359
I'll probably be making a bunch of those
because what I've been using up to this

54
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:26,369
because what I've been using up to this
 

55
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,850
because what I've been using up to this
point is these ones which are just

56
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:28,860
point is these ones which are just
 

57
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,649
point is these ones which are just
efficiency 5 unbreaking 3 they don't

58
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:30,659
efficiency 5 unbreaking 3 they don't
 

59
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,140

on them so I'm gonna go do some speed

62
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
on them so I'm gonna go do some speed
 

63
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,480
on them so I'm gonna go do some speed
mining and then we'll see if we can

64
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:38,490
mining and then we'll see if we can
 

65
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:45,510
mining and then we'll see if we can
repair this

66
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520

 

67
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,969

that we have this locked difficulty if I
 

133
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,880
that we have this locked difficulty if I
do find one I can probably keep them I

134
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:08,890
do find one I can probably keep them I
 

135
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,250

the speed mining it is so much nicer

152
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:30,640
the speed mining it is so much nicer
 

153

before I would carry two picks with me
 

157
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,960

come across redstone I would have to
 

163
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,980
come across redstone I would have to
switch between the pick I was using and

it's still doing it I'm looking at like
the netherrack on the sides it's kind of

312
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,250
the netherrack on the sides it's kind of
 

313
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,059
the netherrack on the sides it's kind of
like when wheels on a car start spinning

in a certain speed ups like they start
 

317
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:23,550
in a certain speed ups like they start
going backwards that will make you go

going backwards that will make you go
 

319
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,980
going backwards that will make you go
crazy if you look too long so yeah this

320
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:25,990
crazy if you look too long so yeah this
 

321
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,800
crazy if you look too long so yeah this
is where we end up obviously it's not

322
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:28,810
is where we end up obviously it's not
 

323
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,150
is where we end up obviously it's not
too fancy at the moment there's no

324
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
too fancy at the moment there's no
 

325
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,389
too fancy at the moment there's no
proper starting or exiting or what would

326
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
proper starting or exiting or what would
 

327
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,710
proper starting or exiting or what would
you call it starting and departure

328
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:37,720
you call it starting and departure
 

329
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,210
you call it starting and departure
stations sort of thing there is the farm

330
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,220
stations sort of thing there is the farm
 

331
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,420
stations sort of thing there is the farm
over there which I'm very scared of at

332
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:45,430
over there which I'm very scared of at
 

333
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,449
over there which I'm very scared of at
the moment because I don't have armor on

334
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:47,459
the moment because I don't have armor on
 

335
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,590
the moment because I don't have armor on
that's pretty cool I'm gonna head back

336
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
that's pretty cool I'm gonna head back
 

337
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,900
that's pretty cool I'm gonna head back
I'll show you the Mesa track oh and I'll

338
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:51,910
I'll show you the Mesa track oh and I'll
 

339
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,500
I'll show you the Mesa track oh and I'll
show you the turn I did here - gate here

340
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:55,510
show you the turn I did here - gate here
 

341
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,850
show you the turn I did here - gate here
comes the turn this is how I did it oh

342
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:58,860
comes the turn this is how I did it oh
 

343
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,199
comes the turn this is how I did it oh
it was a little bit laggy hopefully you

344
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:01,209
it was a little bit laggy hopefully you
 

345
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,730
it was a little bit laggy hopefully you
saw that but it's pretty smooth it was

346
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:05,740
saw that but it's pretty smooth it was
 

347
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,470
saw that but it's pretty smooth it was
laggy but it's smooth yeah that makes

348
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:07,480
laggy but it's smooth yeah that makes
 

349
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:07,910
laggy but it's smooth yeah that makes
sense

350
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
sense
 

351
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,900
sense
normally if it's not like you it's a

352
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:09,910
normally if it's not like you it's a
 

353
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,259
normally if it's not like you it's a
smooth turn but I did a loop 'ti loop

354
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:13,269
smooth turn but I did a loop 'ti loop
 

355
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:16,259
smooth turn but I did a loop 'ti loop
sort of thing so if it hits a slanted

356
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:16,269
sort of thing so if it hits a slanted
 

357
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:20,309
sort of thing so if it hits a slanted
track it doesn't derail so every time it

358
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:20,319
track it doesn't derail so every time it
 

359
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,429
track it doesn't derail so every time it
does it turn here it's a slanted track

360
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:22,439
does it turn here it's a slanted track
 

361
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:24,980
does it turn here it's a slanted track
minecarts when they hit a track like

362
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:24,990
minecarts when they hit a track like
 

363
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,590
minecarts when they hit a track like
like this a straight track they always

364
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:28,600
like this a straight track they always
 

365
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,949
like this a straight track they always
go towards a positive direction so

366
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
go towards a positive direction so
 

367
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,970
go towards a positive direction so
positive would be this way so that's why

368
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:35,980
positive would be this way so that's why
 

369
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,769
positive would be this way so that's why
I can get away with with doing this

370
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:37,779
I can get away with with doing this
 

371
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:40,019
I can get away with with doing this
because when the minecart hits this it

372
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:40,029
because when the minecart hits this it
 

373
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:44,129
because when the minecart hits this it
goes this way this direction those the

374
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:44,139
goes this way this direction those the
 

375
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:45,390
goes this way this direction those the
negative

376
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:45,400
negative
 

377
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,390
negative
so I do a loop-de-loop it's downward

378
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,400
so I do a loop-de-loop it's downward
 

379
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,520
so I do a loop-de-loop it's downward
slant and it goes that way so it's

380
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:51,530
slant and it goes that way so it's
 

381
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,030
slant and it goes that way so it's
pretty cool

382
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,040
pretty cool
 

383
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,560
pretty cool
let's just let's try go around this one

384
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:53,570
let's just let's try go around this one
 

385
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,080
let's just let's try go around this one
more time hopefully it won't be as light

386
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,090
more time hopefully it won't be as light
 

387
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:03,760
more time hopefully it won't be as light
you this time oh I should have jumped

388
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:03,770
you this time oh I should have jumped
 

389
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,400
you this time oh I should have jumped
out darn it now I got a walk but yeah

390
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:06,410
out darn it now I got a walk but yeah
 

391
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,420
out darn it now I got a walk but yeah
that's let's turn there ah I don't have

392
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:10,430
that's let's turn there ah I don't have
 

393
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,680
that's let's turn there ah I don't have
anymore yes oh that track is gonna see

394
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:14,690
anymore yes oh that track is gonna see
 

395
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,870
anymore yes oh that track is gonna see
me a ton of time that is a terrible walk

396
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:16,880
me a ton of time that is a terrible walk
 

397
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,010
me a ton of time that is a terrible walk
as I just experienced off this way is

398
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,020
as I just experienced off this way is
 

399
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,380
as I just experienced off this way is
the new Mesa biome track let's go for

400
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:23,390
the new Mesa biome track let's go for
 

401
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,550
the new Mesa biome track let's go for
ride

402
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560

 

403
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,500

pretty good acceleration when you got

404
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:30,510
pretty good acceleration when you got
 

405
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:37,650
pretty good acceleration when you got
solid power rails

406
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:37,660

 

407
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,490

this one's a lot shorter though I did

408
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:41,500
this one's a lot shorter though I did
 

409
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,889
this one's a lot shorter though I did
that thing again where the illusion

410
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:43,899
that thing again where the illusion
 

411
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:44,670
that thing again where the illusion
where it looked like he was going

412
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:44,680
where it looked like he was going
 

413
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,150
where it looked like he was going
backwards at least to me anyway

414
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
backwards at least to me anyway
 

415
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,269
backwards at least to me anyway
so yeah the Mesa biome is just off to

416
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
so yeah the Mesa biome is just off to
 

417
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,699
so yeah the Mesa biome is just off to
the side here and I've never shown where

418
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:53,709
the side here and I've never shown where
 

419
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:55,530
the side here and I've never shown where
I get my clay or how I get my place and

420
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:55,540
I get my clay or how I get my place and
 

421
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,939
I get my clay or how I get my place and
maybe we'll just check that out too real

422
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:56,949
maybe we'll just check that out too real
 

423
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:02,540
maybe we'll just check that out too real
quick then I'm gonna mine up a bunch

424
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:02,550

 

425
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,129

right so here is the Mesa biome and

426
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:07,139
right so here is the Mesa biome and
 

427
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:09,870
right so here is the Mesa biome and
honestly I do not remember remember

428
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:09,880
honestly I do not remember remember
 

429
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,559
honestly I do not remember remember
where I get the clay from it was

430
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:13,569
where I get the clay from it was
 

431
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:16,230
where I get the clay from it was
somewhere around here though let's see

432
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
somewhere around here though let's see
 

433
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,579
somewhere around here though let's see
if we can find it they think it was

434
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:19,589
if we can find it they think it was
 

435
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:24,629
if we can find it they think it was
that's the creeper yeah I'm looking for

436
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
that's the creeper yeah I'm looking for
 

437
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,699
that's the creeper yeah I'm looking for
a beacon there's a beacon around here

438
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:26,709
a beacon there's a beacon around here
 

439
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:34,820
a beacon there's a beacon around here
somewhere

440
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:34,830

 

441
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,889

all right the beacon is right over there

442
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:36,899
all right the beacon is right over there
 

443
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,509
all right the beacon is right over there
right by the portal so let's go check it

444
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:38,519
right by the portal so let's go check it
 

445
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,590
right by the portal so let's go check it
out

446
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600

 

447
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,780

don't remember I had a path to it

448
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:44,790
don't remember I had a path to it
 

449
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:50,990
don't remember I had a path to it
somewhere maybe not and instead of strip

450
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,000
somewhere maybe not and instead of strip
 

451
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,079
somewhere maybe not and instead of strip
mining the top layer I decided to go go

452
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:54,089
mining the top layer I decided to go go
 

453
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:57,050
mining the top layer I decided to go go
down and dig it out that way that way we

454
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:57,060
down and dig it out that way that way we
 

455
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,389
down and dig it out that way that way we
don't wreck the terrain here

456
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
don't wreck the terrain here
 

457
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,740
don't wreck the terrain here
not that I'm really using it but maybe

458
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:00,750
not that I'm really using it but maybe
 

459
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,290
not that I'm really using it but maybe
eventually whoa okay cool

460
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:05,300
eventually whoa okay cool
 

461
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,910
eventually whoa okay cool
so here's one of the rooms I mined out

462
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920
so here's one of the rooms I mined out
 

463
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,769
so here's one of the rooms I mined out
oh and I have a bunch of your colored

464
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:09,779
oh and I have a bunch of your colored
 

465
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,079
oh and I have a bunch of your colored
stuff you're already did I go down

466
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:12,089
stuff you're already did I go down
 

467
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:14,990
stuff you're already did I go down
further no that's just for the beacon

468
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,000
further no that's just for the beacon
 

469
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,250
further no that's just for the beacon
this is a haste - oh it's just haste one

470
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:19,260
this is a haste - oh it's just haste one
 

471
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,259
this is a haste - oh it's just haste one
that's right you don't need a haste -

472
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:23,269

 

473
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,829

for clay

474
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:24,839
for clay
 

475
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,440
for clay
you just need haste one and efficiency

476
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:27,450
you just need haste one and efficiency
 

477
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,579
you just need haste one and efficiency
five to mine it oh man I'm a little

478

I think they need somewhere to run to I

694
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,010
I think they need somewhere to run to I
 

695
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,090
I think they need somewhere to run to I
think that's the problem yeah let's open

696
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,100
think that's the problem yeah let's open
 

697
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,380
think that's the problem yeah let's open
this up otherwise they will like if they

698
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:48,390
this up otherwise they will like if they
 

699
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,000
this up otherwise they will like if they
feel trapped the skeletons they will

700
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,010
feel trapped the skeletons they will
 

701
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,630
feel trapped the skeletons they will
fight the wolf let's try this one more

702
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:53,640
fight the wolf let's try this one more
 

703
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,540
fight the wolf let's try this one more
time yeah see they run away if they can

704
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:58,550
time yeah see they run away if they can
 

705
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:03,400
time yeah see they run away if they can
as long as they have somewhere to run to

706
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,410
as long as they have somewhere to run to
 

707
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,560
as long as they have somewhere to run to
they won't fight the wolf that's

708
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:06,570
they won't fight the wolf that's
 

709
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:13,280
they won't fight the wolf that's
interesting where did he go Maddie

710
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:13,290
interesting where did he go Maddie
 

711
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,190
interesting where did he go Maddie
outmaneuvered you they're supposed to be

712
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:16,200
outmaneuvered you they're supposed to be
 

713
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:23,720
outmaneuvered you they're supposed to be
fast okay I came up with one idea that

714
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:23,730
fast okay I came up with one idea that
 

715
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,490
fast okay I came up with one idea that
we could try here I don't know how

716
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:25,500
we could try here I don't know how
 

717
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,270
we could try here I don't know how
successful it will be but let's make a

718
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
successful it will be but let's make a
 

719
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,400
successful it will be but let's make a
glass floor for this thing so that we

720
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:31,410
glass floor for this thing so that we
 

721
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,210
glass floor for this thing so that we
can see the skeletons from from like

722
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:35,220
can see the skeletons from from like
 

723
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,270
can see the skeletons from from like
over here we'll be able to see upwards

724
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,280
over here we'll be able to see upwards
 

725
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,300
over here we'll be able to see upwards
have a wolf in in this corner and then

726
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,310
have a wolf in in this corner and then
 

727
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,220
have a wolf in in this corner and then
hopefully try to get the skeletons to

728
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,230
hopefully try to get the skeletons to
 

729
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,750
hopefully try to get the skeletons to
run to this corner drop down then we'll

730
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:47,760
run to this corner drop down then we'll
 

731
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,690
run to this corner drop down then we'll
have another wolf over here which will

732
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:50,700
have another wolf over here which will
 

733
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,450
have another wolf over here which will
hopefully I'm asking for a lot here I

734
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:53,460
hopefully I'm asking for a lot here I
 

735
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,780
hopefully I'm asking for a lot here I
don't know if this will happen try get

736
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:56,790
don't know if this will happen try get
 

737
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,590
don't know if this will happen try get
this wolf to chase them through a zigzag

738
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
this wolf to chase them through a zigzag
 

739
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:06,170
this wolf to chase them through a zigzag
pattern thing left right I don't know

740
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:06,180
pattern thing left right I don't know
 

741
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,360
pattern thing left right I don't know
how far they'll run but left right left

742
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:08,370
how far they'll run but left right left
 

743
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,080
how far they'll run but left right left
right

744
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,090
right
 

745
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,000
right
far as we can and then at the very end

746
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,010
far as we can and then at the very end
 

747
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,600
far as we can and then at the very end
of that maybe drop them into lava or or

748
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:14,610
of that maybe drop them into lava or or
 

749
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,760
of that maybe drop them into lava or or
kill them with a wolf or I don't know

750
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:16,770
kill them with a wolf or I don't know
 

751
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,360
kill them with a wolf or I don't know
something something along those lines so

752
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:19,370
something something along those lines so
 

753
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,650
something something along those lines so
don't know how successful it'll be I

754
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:21,660
don't know how successful it'll be I
 

755
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,220
don't know how successful it'll be I
will try it out and if that doesn't work

756
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,230
will try it out and if that doesn't work
 

757
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:31,130
will try it out and if that doesn't work
we will try come up with another idea so

758
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:31,140
we will try come up with another idea so
 

759
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,680
we will try come up with another idea so
we are going to try this out the first

760
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:33,690
we are going to try this out the first
 

761
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,500
we are going to try this out the first
step to the whole thing I got the glass

762
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:36,510
step to the whole thing I got the glass
 

763
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,930
step to the whole thing I got the glass
floor down I got our wolf buddy in the

764
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:38,940
floor down I got our wolf buddy in the
 

765
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,320
floor down I got our wolf buddy in the
corner here Haggai and our goal is to

766
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,330
corner here Haggai and our goal is to
 

767
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,600
corner here Haggai and our goal is to
get the skeleton school to go down this

768
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:44,610
get the skeleton school to go down this
 

769
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,420
get the skeleton school to go down this
hole here to do that we will do the

770
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:47,430
hole here to do that we will do the
 

771
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:52,220
hole here to do that we will do the
trapdoor trick and with them right here

772
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:52,230
trapdoor trick and with them right here
 

773
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,670
trapdoor trick and with them right here
there should be no way of the skeletons

774
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:54,680
there should be no way of the skeletons
 

775
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,520
there should be no way of the skeletons
getting across this gap over to here I

776
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:00,530
getting across this gap over to here I
 

777
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,190
getting across this gap over to here I
also hollowed out a bit of space here so

778
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:04,200
also hollowed out a bit of space here so
 

779
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,470
also hollowed out a bit of space here so
that they can try to paths find this

780
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
that they can try to paths find this
 

781
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,600
that they can try to paths find this
direction if they don't have anywhere to

782
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,610
direction if they don't have anywhere to
 

783
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,540
direction if they don't have anywhere to
run to they won't run it so we need some

784
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:11,550
run to they won't run it so we need some
 

785
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,790
run to they won't run it so we need some
space back there even though it's not

786
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:13,800
space back there even though it's not
 

787
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,190
space back there even though it's not
being used um okay I think that's that's

788
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
being used um okay I think that's that's
 

789
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,400
being used um okay I think that's that's
good enough let's give it a try oh oh oh

790
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,410

 

791
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,970

yeah right off the bat that is very

792
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:28,980
