00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:16,890
been getting stuff done I've been
 

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,230
been getting stuff done I've been
working on the mob system a little bit

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
working on the mob system a little bit
 

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,410
working on the mob system a little bit
we're up to two layers now doo doo doo

10
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:21,420
we're up to two layers now doo doo doo
 

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,060
we're up to two layers now doo doo doo

I found a way to incorporate lighting

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,090
I found a way to incorporate lighting
 

15
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,460
I found a way to incorporate lighting
into it so I'll be able to turn it on

16
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:28,470
into it so I'll be able to turn it on
 

17
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,549
into it so I'll be able to turn it on
and off just curious how accurate these

18
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
and off just curious how accurate these
 

19
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,470
and off just curious how accurate these
guys are miss to mrs. O third time's a

20
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:39,480
guys are miss to mrs. O third time's a
 

21
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,810
guys are miss to mrs. O third time's a
charm

22
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:40,820
charm
 

23
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,650
charm
miss this is it like it's max range

24
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:44,660
miss this is it like it's max range
 

25
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:51,170
miss this is it like it's max range
another miss another miss oh right in

26
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:51,180
another miss another miss oh right in
 

27
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,330
another miss another miss oh right in
the face miss so if you're a long ways

28
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:56,340
the face miss so if you're a long ways
 

29
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,020
the face miss so if you're a long ways
away from them they do miss quite often

30
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,030
away from them they do miss quite often
 

31
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:05,359
away from them they do miss quite often
like even if you're standing still when

32
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:05,369
like even if you're standing still when
 

33
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:17,300
like even if you're standing still when
you shoot a net boy okay ah that's one

34
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,310
you shoot a net boy okay ah that's one
 

35
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,280
you shoot a net boy okay ah that's one
way of doing it I yes yeah so you can

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,290
way of doing it I yes yeah so you can
 

37
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,230
way of doing it I yes yeah so you can
I'm going to have lighting with this I

38
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:21,240
I'm going to have lighting with this I
 

39
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,350
I'm going to have lighting with this I
found a way to squeeze some wiring in

40
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
found a way to squeeze some wiring in
 

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,020
found a way to squeeze some wiring in
we're going to use the lamps okay get up

42
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,030
we're going to use the lamps okay get up
 

43
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,010
we're going to use the lamps okay get up
get off that view eat lamps per layer is

44
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:31,020
get off that view eat lamps per layer is
 

45
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,170
get off that view eat lamps per layer is
what it's going to be we'll go inside

46
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:33,180
what it's going to be we'll go inside
 

47
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,149
what it's going to be we'll go inside
here still haven't put the water in or

48
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:35,159
here still haven't put the water in or
 

49
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,990
here still haven't put the water in or
anything but this is what it looks like

50
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
anything but this is what it looks like
 

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,030
anything but this is what it looks like
- of course the day lighting which is

52
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
- of course the day lighting which is
 

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,300
- of course the day lighting which is
making it extremely bright in here

54
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,310
making it extremely bright in here
 

55
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,920
making it extremely bright in here
we'll just cover that for now so you can

56
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:45,930
we'll just cover that for now so you can
 

57
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,800
we'll just cover that for now so you can
get an idea of what the natural lighting

58
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:48,810
get an idea of what the natural lighting
 

59
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,679
get an idea of what the natural lighting
looks like although torches aren't

60
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:51,689
looks like although torches aren't
 

61
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:52,630
looks like although torches aren't
helping either

62
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
helping either
 

63
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,389
helping either
right anyway so those are light level 15

64
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
right anyway so those are light level 15
 

65
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,130
right anyway so those are light level 15
here one one down is 1413 right below it

66
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,140
here one one down is 1413 right below it
 

67
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,380
here one one down is 1413 right below it
which is two from the wall so right here

68
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,390
which is two from the wall so right here
 

69
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:12,290
which is two from the wall so right here
it's light level 13 there 12

70
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:12,300

 

71
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,720

what comes before twelve eleven ten nine

72
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:15,730
what comes before twelve eleven ten nine
 

73
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,990
what comes before twelve eleven ten nine
eight so right in the very corner this

74
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,000
eight so right in the very corner this
 

75
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,720
eight so right in the very corner this
is like level 8 so mops on spawn at that

76
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:21,730
is like level 8 so mops on spawn at that
 

77
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,710
is like level 8 so mops on spawn at that
and go on the other way it was 13 here

78
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:25,720
and go on the other way it was 13 here
 

79
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,500
and go on the other way it was 13 here
12 11 10 9 8 so everything is lit up

80
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:31,510
12 11 10 9 8 so everything is lit up
 

81
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,330
12 11 10 9 8 so everything is lit up
with these 8 lights so it will work out

82
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:33,340
with these 8 lights so it will work out
 

83
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,200
with these 8 lights so it will work out
really well

84
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,210
really well
 

85
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,930
really well
we'll be able to turn it on and off

86
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:35,940
we'll be able to turn it on and off
 

87
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,800
we'll be able to turn it on and off
here's another layer over here using a

88
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:40,810
here's another layer over here using a
 

89
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,660
here's another layer over here using a
lot of snow I can't believe how many

90
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:42,670
lot of snow I can't believe how many
 

91
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,160
lot of snow I can't believe how many
blocks it takes I should have figured

92
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,170
blocks it takes I should have figured
 

93
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,590
blocks it takes I should have figured
that out before but let's find it's

94
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:49,600
that out before but let's find it's
 

95
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,900
that out before but let's find it's
going good I just put that one there

96
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:51,910
going good I just put that one there
 

97
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,330
going good I just put that one there
because I it's a little hard to do the

98
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:54,340
because I it's a little hard to do the
 

99
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,160
because I it's a little hard to do the
wiring for this because it's an odd

100
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,170
wiring for this because it's an odd
 

101
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,310
wiring for this because it's an odd
number like oops each layer is an odd

102
00:02:59,310 --> 00:02:59,320
number like oops each layer is an odd
 

103
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,740
number like oops each layer is an odd
number so it's 5 blocks between each

104
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:01,750
number so it's 5 blocks between each
 

105
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,090
number so it's 5 blocks between each
layer and get in the torches position

106
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:06,100
layer and get in the torches position
 

107
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,370
layer and get in the torches position
right because the repeating pattern is

108
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:08,380
right because the repeating pattern is
 

109
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,210
right because the repeating pattern is
every 4 blocks with two torches right so

110
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:12,220
every 4 blocks with two torches right so
 

111
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,470
every 4 blocks with two torches right so
I'll have to adjust it each layer and

112
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
I'll have to adjust it each layer and
 

113
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,360
I'll have to adjust it each layer and
have the wiring the same each layer so

114
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,370
have the wiring the same each layer so
 

115
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,880
have the wiring the same each layer so
what I'm trying to say so like for some

116
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:22,890
what I'm trying to say so like for some
 

117
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,320
what I'm trying to say so like for some
the wiring might be down a block like

118
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,330
the wiring might be down a block like
 

119
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,570
the wiring might be down a block like
that other other layers it might be even

120
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:27,580
that other other layers it might be even
 

121
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,910
that other other layers it might be even
some layers I have to add extra redstone

122
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
some layers I have to add extra redstone
 

123
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,850
some layers I have to add extra redstone
torches on the side here to invert it

124
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:32,860
torches on the side here to invert it
 

125
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,980
torches on the side here to invert it
but all is good I could run a glow stone

126
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:36,990
but all is good I could run a glow stone
 

127
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,210
but all is good I could run a glow stone
like a glowstone ladder all the way up

128
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:39,220
like a glowstone ladder all the way up
 

129
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,310
like a glowstone ladder all the way up
to is another option but I actually want

130
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:41,320
to is another option but I actually want
 

131
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,370
to is another option but I actually want
the delay from the torches so that it

132
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:44,380
the delay from the torches so that it
 

133
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,250
the delay from the torches so that it
will hopefully reduce the lag of all the

134
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:47,260
will hopefully reduce the lag of all the
 

135
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,530
will hopefully reduce the lag of all the
lamps coming on because it gives the

136
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:49,540
lamps coming on because it gives the
 

137
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:55,170
lamps coming on because it gives the
game opportunity to turn them on over

138
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,180
game opportunity to turn them on over
 

139
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,390
game opportunity to turn them on over
time instead of all at once if you have

140
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:57,400
time instead of all at once if you have
 

141
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,900
time instead of all at once if you have
a little bit of delay between each layer

142
00:03:59,900 --> 00:03:59,910
a little bit of delay between each layer
 

143
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,430
a little bit of delay between each layer
umm yeah so that's what's going on so

144
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:05,440
umm yeah so that's what's going on so
 

145
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,600
umm yeah so that's what's going on so
far maybe we will work on the layers

146
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:09,610
far maybe we will work on the layers
 

147
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,190
far maybe we will work on the layers
here finish it up these levers here for

148
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:14,200
here finish it up these levers here for
 

149
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,930
here finish it up these levers here for
the redstone torch columns are just

150
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:15,940
the redstone torch columns are just
 

151
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,970
the redstone torch columns are just
temporary - when this is all done I'll

152
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:17,980
temporary - when this is all done I'll
 

153
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,310
temporary - when this is all done I'll
I'll hook all eight columns together

154
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
I'll hook all eight columns together
 

155
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,790
I'll hook all eight columns together
into a single wire so it's easy to

156
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:23,800
into a single wire so it's easy to
 

157
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,510
into a single wire so it's easy to
control

158
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:24,520
control
 

159
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,120
control
and this is the way I've been covering

160
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,130
and this is the way I've been covering
 

161
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,930
and this is the way I've been covering
over the lamps and the and the wire for

162
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:30,940
over the lamps and the and the wire for
 

163
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,189
over the lamps and the and the wire for
the next layer basically wall outline is

164
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
the next layer basically wall outline is
 

165
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,020
the next layer basically wall outline is
here and the next pad like for the next

166
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,030
here and the next pad like for the next
 

167
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,430
here and the next pad like for the next
layer would you'll like this and like

168
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:44,440
layer would you'll like this and like
 

169
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,680
layer would you'll like this and like
that so the wire

170
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:46,690
that so the wire
 

171
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,240
that so the wire
I'll get sitting away and next pad would

172
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,250
I'll get sitting away and next pad would
 

173
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:59,339
I'll get sitting away and next pad would
be over here like that so doesn't get

174
00:04:59,339 --> 00:04:59,349
be over here like that so doesn't get
 

175
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:00,839
be over here like that so doesn't get
washed away there would be a water

176
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:00,849
washed away there would be a water
 

177
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:08,939
washed away there would be a water
source here and it's all protected now

178
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:08,949
source here and it's all protected now
 

179
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:10,740
source here and it's all protected now
but for these ones where I have the

180
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:10,750
but for these ones where I have the
 

181
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,990
but for these ones where I have the
block lowered a bit I'm going to stick a

182
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,000
block lowered a bit I'm going to stick a
 

183
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,749
block lowered a bit I'm going to stick a
half slab in there just so we don't get

184
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
half slab in there just so we don't get
 

185
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,080
half slab in there just so we don't get
any mobs spawning in our wiring that's

186
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,090
any mobs spawning in our wiring that's
 

187
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,600
any mobs spawning in our wiring that's
not a good idea to have a too high space

188
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:21,610
not a good idea to have a too high space
 

189
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,999
not a good idea to have a too high space
like that oh I thought the whoo for a

190
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:27,009
like that oh I thought the whoo for a
 

191
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,320
like that oh I thought the whoo for a
second there I thought that redstone

192
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,330
second there I thought that redstone
 

193
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,120
second there I thought that redstone
wire got cut from the half slab but it's

194
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,130
wire got cut from the half slab but it's
 

195
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,700
wire got cut from the half slab but it's
just dark it's like black but you can

196
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:32,710
just dark it's like black but you can
 

197
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,680
just dark it's like black but you can
see the particle effects still on it so

198
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:34,690
see the particle effects still on it so
 

199
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,850
see the particle effects still on it so
it's still being powered all is good and

200
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:38,860
it's still being powered all is good and
 

201
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,909
it's still being powered all is good and
I'm going to use these stone half slabs

202
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
I'm going to use these stone half slabs
 

203
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,330
I'm going to use these stone half slabs
I think for the middles because they're

204
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:45,340
I think for the middles because they're
 

205
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,839
I think for the middles because they're
the closest we got to whites out of fir

206
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:47,849
the closest we got to whites out of fir
 

207
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:53,370
the closest we got to whites out of fir
five or six choices I think we have wood

208
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:53,380
five or six choices I think we have wood
 

209
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:59,159
five or six choices I think we have wood
brick sandstone you know I was thinking

210
00:05:59,159 --> 00:05:59,169
brick sandstone you know I was thinking
 

211
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:03,089
brick sandstone you know I was thinking
of having glass columns going from all

212
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:03,099
of having glass columns going from all
 

213
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:07,830
of having glass columns going from all
the way through this thing like all the

214
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
the way through this thing like all the
 

215
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,120
the way through this thing like all the
way up to the top you know and let

216
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,130
way up to the top you know and let
 

217
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,200
way up to the top you know and let
sunlight in that way optionally I tried

218
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,210
sunlight in that way optionally I tried
 

219
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,730
sunlight in that way optionally I tried
it it looked really cool but I'm worried

220
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:14,740
it it looked really cool but I'm worried
 

221
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,140
it it looked really cool but I'm worried
it's not going to stop spiders from

222
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,150
it's not going to stop spiders from
 

223
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,820
it's not going to stop spiders from
spawning that's what that's the point of

224
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:17,830
spawning that's what that's the point of
 

225
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,370
spawning that's what that's the point of
these half slabs to prevent spiders from

226
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:20,380
these half slabs to prevent spiders from
 

227
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:26,040
these half slabs to prevent spiders from
spawning because they need a 3x3 area to

228
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,050
spawning because they need a 3x3 area to
 

229
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,950
spawning because they need a 3x3 area to
spawn and so if if one chooses to spawn

230
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
spawn and so if if one chooses to spawn
 

231
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,810
spawn and so if if one chooses to spawn
at this block checks a 3x3 around so oh

232
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:32,820
at this block checks a 3x3 around so oh
 

233
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,070
at this block checks a 3x3 around so oh
we got a block on the way so it can't

234
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,080
we got a block on the way so it can't
 

235
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,100
we got a block on the way so it can't
spawn type thing

236
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,110

 

237
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:47,760

all right and now we will do our water I

238
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:47,770

 

239
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,170

think I've shown how to do this before

240
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:50,180
think I've shown how to do this before
 

241
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,969
think I've shown how to do this before
so I'm not going to waste a whole lot of

242
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:51,979
so I'm not going to waste a whole lot of
 

243
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:56,860
so I'm not going to waste a whole lot of
time on this I'm actually going to make

244
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:56,870
time on this I'm actually going to make
 

245
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:02,290
time on this I'm actually going to make
an infinite spring here who is that up

246
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:02,300
an infinite spring here who is that up
 

247
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,749
an infinite spring here who is that up
oh I did it yet it's hard to work in

248
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:04,759
oh I did it yet it's hard to work in
 

249
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,610
oh I did it yet it's hard to work in
this cramped area so basically one water

250
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:09,620
this cramped area so basically one water
 

251
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,890
this cramped area so basically one water
goes in those corners and one in these

252
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:13,900
goes in those corners and one in these
 

253
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:22,600
goes in those corners and one in these
sides like that for all these so that's

254
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:22,610
sides like that for all these so that's
 

255
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,200
sides like that for all these so that's
all there is to it it ends just short of

256
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,210
all there is to it it ends just short of
 

257
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,329
all there is to it it ends just short of
the hole here and I can safely do this

258
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:31,339
the hole here and I can safely do this
 

259
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:33,010
the hole here and I can safely do this
because I got the lamps in here I can

260
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,020
because I got the lamps in here I can
 

261
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,110
because I got the lamps in here I can
easily turn the spotting on or off so

262
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
easily turn the spotting on or off so
 

263
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,939
easily turn the spotting on or off so
this is really handy for when I'm

264
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:36,949
this is really handy for when I'm
 

265
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:39,939
this is really handy for when I'm
building this if I have to add more

266
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:39,949
building this if I have to add more
 

267
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:41,740
building this if I have to add more
layers or whatever it'll be really easy

268
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:41,750
layers or whatever it'll be really easy
 

269
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:49,420
layers or whatever it'll be really easy
to without blowing up my mob system all

270
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:49,430
to without blowing up my mob system all
 

271
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,850
to without blowing up my mob system all
right all right so we're taking a little

272
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:54,860
right all right so we're taking a little
 

273
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,219
right all right so we're taking a little
bit of a nether trip here I need more

274
00:07:57,219 --> 00:07:57,229
bit of a nether trip here I need more
 

275
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:01,269
bit of a nether trip here I need more
glowstone for lamps for the mop system

276
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:01,279
glowstone for lamps for the mop system
 

277
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,670
glowstone for lamps for the mop system
and other projects too getting a little

278
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:03,680
and other projects too getting a little
 

279
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,089
and other projects too getting a little
bit low on supply and I found a couple

280
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:06,099
bit low on supply and I found a couple
 

281
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:09,879
bit low on supply and I found a couple
really nice veins here and try out our

282
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:09,889
really nice veins here and try out our
 

283
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,079
really nice veins here and try out our
silk touch efficiency for pick on it is

284
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:13,089
silk touch efficiency for pick on it is
 

285
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:15,820
silk touch efficiency for pick on it is
weird like I said this before but I

286
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:15,830
weird like I said this before but I
 

287
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,010
weird like I said this before but I
couldn't get silk touch couldn't get it

288
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:18,020
couldn't get silk touch couldn't get it
 

289
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,529
couldn't get silk touch couldn't get it
and then all of a sudden I got like four

290
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:20,539
and then all of a sudden I got like four
 

291
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,379
and then all of a sudden I got like four
in a row it's crazy I got a couple new

292
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:23,389
in a row it's crazy I got a couple new
 

293
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,260
in a row it's crazy I got a couple new
items too I got a good axe again which

294
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,270
items too I got a good axe again which
 

295
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,040
items too I got a good axe again which
is awesome I've made a few shovels been

296
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,050
is awesome I've made a few shovels been
 

297
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,069
is awesome I've made a few shovels been
going through them quickly and I got one

298
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:33,079
going through them quickly and I got one
 

299
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,540
going through them quickly and I got one
of these and I got another pick exactly

300
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:34,550
of these and I got another pick exactly
 

301
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:38,040
of these and I got another pick exactly
like this two in a chest somewhere so

302
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,050
like this two in a chest somewhere so
 

303
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:48,290
like this two in a chest somewhere so
good for picks for a while very good

304
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:48,300

 

305
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,240

doesn't shoot through it like I thought

306
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,250
doesn't shoot through it like I thought
 

307
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,600
doesn't shoot through it like I thought
it would

308
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:51,610
it would
 

309
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:57,000
it would
I wonder why I just was closed on you

310
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,010
I wonder why I just was closed on you
 

311
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,180
I wonder why I just was closed on you
gotta click to get it I find that I

312
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,190
gotta click to get it I find that I
 

313
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,490
gotta click to get it I find that I
definitely prefer using so fetch to get

314
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:02,500
definitely prefer using so fetch to get
 

315
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,180
definitely prefer using so fetch to get
it instead of fortune three guys I think

316
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,190
it instead of fortune three guys I think
 

317
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,060
it instead of fortune three guys I think
with fortune 3 there's a few times like

318
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,070
with fortune 3 there's a few times like
 

319
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,590
with fortune 3 there's a few times like
it still has a chance of only dropping

320
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:10,600
it still has a chance of only dropping
 

321
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,250
it still has a chance of only dropping
three dust instead of four so I think

322
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:14,260
three dust instead of four so I think
 

323
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,560
three dust instead of four so I think
silk that is still a little bit more

324
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:16,570
silk that is still a little bit more
 

325
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,590
silk that is still a little bit more
efficient but I could be wrong about

326
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
efficient but I could be wrong about
 

327
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:27,570
efficient but I could be wrong about
that all right very good how much was

328
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:27,580
that all right very good how much was
 

329
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,220
that all right very good how much was
that from 162 that's pretty good so we

330
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,230
that from 162 that's pretty good so we
 

331
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,960
that from 162 that's pretty good so we
got one there there's a big one over

332
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:33,970
got one there there's a big one over
 

333
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,150
got one there there's a big one over
there I don't know if I'll get that and

334
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
there I don't know if I'll get that and
 

335
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,370
there I don't know if I'll get that and
I think there might be more over here

336
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:40,380
I think there might be more over here
 

337

continuing on from that people have told
 

401
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,920
continuing on from that people have told

through walls issue was so I've done it

404
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
through walls issue was so I've done it
 

405
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,030
through walls issue was so I've done it
again I can walk through walls

406
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
again I can walk through walls
 

407
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,030
again I can walk through walls
I can run into them and take damage that

408
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
I can run into them and take damage that
 

409
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,300

apparently is caused from sleeping in a

410
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:04,310
apparently is caused from sleeping in a
 

411
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,490
apparently is caused from sleeping in a
bed and breaking it while you're while

412
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:06,500
bed and breaking it while you're while
 

413
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,250
bed and breaking it while you're while
you're in the bed and you can reproduce

414
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:09,260
you're in the bed and you can reproduce
 

415
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,250
you're in the bed and you can reproduce
it every single time

416
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:11,260
it every single time
 

417
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,550
it every single time
so that's interesting I never heard of

418
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:15,560
so that's interesting I never heard of
 

419
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,360
so that's interesting I never heard of
that glitch before but apparently I

420
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,370
that glitch before but apparently I
 

421
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,090
that glitch before but apparently I
should did this before I'll get good

422
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,100
should did this before I'll get good
 

423
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,840
should did this before I'll get good
we'll just I hate to be out of order

424
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:28,850
we'll just I hate to be out of order
 

425
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,250
we'll just I hate to be out of order
here but I'm just going to toss it in

426
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:30,260
here but I'm just going to toss it in
 

427
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,450
here but I'm just going to toss it in
this chest for now and we'll come back

428
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:33,460
this chest for now and we'll come back
 

429
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,000
this chest for now and we'll come back
put that there to for now just in case I

430
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,010
put that there to for now just in case I
 

431
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:37,680
put that there to for now just in case I
die

432
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:37,690
die
 

433
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:43,780
die
so apparently out once you do that trick

434
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:43,790
so apparently out once you do that trick
 

435
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,840
so apparently out once you do that trick
you can walk through water like nothing

647
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:39,790
potions though I don't know what to do
about him but yeah this area behind is

648
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:39,800
about him but yeah this area behind is
 

649
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,860
about him but yeah this area behind is
pretty much solid so it will be a lot of

650
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:42,870
pretty much solid so it will be a lot of
 

651
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,260
pretty much solid so it will be a lot of
blocks I have to clear out I'm waiting

652
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,270
blocks I have to clear out I'm waiting
 

653
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,360
blocks I have to clear out I'm waiting
for tea and tea before I start this

654
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,370
for tea and tea before I start this
 

655
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,600
for tea and tea before I start this
project or progress it any further so I

656
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:50,610
project or progress it any further so I
 

657
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,210
project or progress it any further so I
can clear out that land a lot quicker

658
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:52,220
can clear out that land a lot quicker
 

659
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,570
can clear out that land a lot quicker
which is what the mob system will

660
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:55,580
which is what the mob system will
 

661
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:01,420
which is what the mob system will
probably be able to get me pretty soon

662
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:01,430

 

663
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,190

okay so we're back at the stronghold the

664
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,200
okay so we're back at the stronghold the
 

665
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,310
okay so we're back at the stronghold the
mob system area once again and last

666
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:07,320
mob system area once again and last
 

667
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,520

episode I laid out where I wanted the

668
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:10,530
episode I laid out where I wanted the
 

669
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,760
episode I laid out where I wanted the
EMP units but I also said I wanted them

670
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:13,770
EMP units but I also said I wanted them
 

671
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,410
EMP units but I also said I wanted them
to be raised a little bit and I think

672
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:15,420
to be raised a little bit and I think
 

673
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,220
to be raised a little bit and I think
I'm going to raise it three blocks yet

674
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,230
I'm going to raise it three blocks yet
 

675
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,640
I'm going to raise it three blocks yet
so at this level here fortunately this

676
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:22,650
so at this level here fortunately this
 

677
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,710
so at this level here fortunately this
room is hollowed out already so I'm

678
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
room is hollowed out already so I'm
 

679
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,280
room is hollowed out already so I'm
going to have

680
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,290
going to have
 

681
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,970
going to have
put a layer to build on over at this

682
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:28,980
put a layer to build on over at this
 

683
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:35,390
put a layer to build on over at this
height and then hollow out above well I

684
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:35,400
height and then hollow out above well I
 

685
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,260
height and then hollow out above well I
did that I got the floor here after real

686
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,270
did that I got the floor here after real
 

687
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,940
did that I got the floor here after real
looking at this so I think I need to

688
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:40,950
looking at this so I think I need to
 

689
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,570
looking at this so I think I need to
lower it one more block because it's

690
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:43,580
lower it one more block because it's
 

691
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,440
lower it one more block because it's
impro qing or encroaching what's the

692
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:48,450
impro qing or encroaching what's the
 

693
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:54,500
impro qing or encroaching what's the
word getting close to my 24 block drop

694
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:54,510
word getting close to my 24 block drop
 

695
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,330
word getting close to my 24 block drop
before I need for the mob so I can just

696
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:56,340
before I need for the mob so I can just
 

697
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,600
before I need for the mob so I can just
drop them and kill them I don't know if

698
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,610
drop them and kill them I don't know if
 

699
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,160
drop them and kill them I don't know if
that's going to be possible at this

700
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,170
that's going to be possible at this
 

701
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,140
that's going to be possible at this
height so I'm going to lower it one more

702
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,150
height so I'm going to lower it one more
 

703
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,170
height so I'm going to lower it one more
block and hopefully it'll work otherwise

704
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:06,180
block and hopefully it'll work otherwise
 

705
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,270
block and hopefully it'll work otherwise
I'll have to remove the bottom layer of

706
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:08,280
I'll have to remove the bottom layer of
 

707
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,390
I'll have to remove the bottom layer of
the mob system to gain an extra five

708
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:11,400
the mob system to gain an extra five
 

709
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,230
the mob system to gain an extra five
blocks or something

710
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,240

and while I talk about it we are going
to start to laying out the face plates

724
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
to start to laying out the face plates
 

725
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,340
to start to laying out the face plates
for the EMP units to get the positions

726
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:38,350
for the EMP units to get the positions
 

727
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,560
for the EMP units to get the positions
in mind and the shape of the whole thing

728
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:40,570
in mind and the shape of the whole thing
 

729
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,220
in mind and the shape of the whole thing
the size figured out I'm gonna do it

730
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,230
the size figured out I'm gonna do it
 

731
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,770
the size figured out I'm gonna do it
with snow just to start out with it'll

732
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:46,780
with snow just to start out with it'll
 

733
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,800
with snow just to start out with it'll
probably be temporary and later we might

734
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:49,810
probably be temporary and later we might
 

735
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,820
probably be temporary and later we might
switch it to iron blocks or wood or

736
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:52,830
switch it to iron blocks or wood or
 

737
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,730
switch it to iron blocks or wood or
sandstone or something but just for now

738
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:56,740
sandstone or something but just for now
 

739
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,990
sandstone or something but just for now
we're going to set it out in snow so the

740
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,000
we're going to set it out in snow so the
 

741
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,790

00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,170
them pretty good I enjoy reading them a
 

751
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,910
them pretty good I enjoy reading them a
lot and one of the problems with

752
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:26,920
lot and one of the problems with
 

753
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,770
lot and one of the problems with
becoming a bigger channel is the quality

754
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:31,780
becoming a bigger channel is the quality
 

755
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,640
becoming a bigger channel is the quality
of the comments tends to go down and you

756
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:35,650

wrong but I think people kind of get in

760
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:41,590
wrong but I think people kind of get in
 

761
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,110
wrong but I think people kind of get in
their minds that I'm not going to read

762
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120
their minds that I'm not going to read
 

763
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,910
their minds that I'm not going to read
them because there's just so many of

them because there's just so many of
 

765
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,160
them because there's just so many of
them so that they may not even leave a

because at the moment there's quite a

916
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
because at the moment there's quite a
 

917
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,779
because at the moment there's quite a
few and they post in every video

918
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:25,789
few and they post in every video
 

919
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:28,870
few and they post in every video
basically so I need to try get rid of

920
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880
basically so I need to try get rid of
 

921
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,789
basically so I need to try get rid of
some yeah so this is kind of what I'm

922
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:33,799
some yeah so this is kind of what I'm
 

923
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,350
some yeah so this is kind of what I'm
thinking as the centerpiece of

924
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,360
thinking as the centerpiece of
 

925
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,549
thinking as the centerpiece of
everything here for E and P units and

926
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:39,559
everything here for E and P units and
 

927
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,850
everything here for E and P units and
connected together diagonally maybe

928
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:41,860
connected together diagonally maybe
 

929
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,350
connected together diagonally maybe
we'll create like an octagon shape

930
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:46,360
we'll create like an octagon shape
 

931
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,149
we'll create like an octagon shape
they're fairly big but that's not

932
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:49,159
they're fairly big but that's not
 

933
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,620
they're fairly big but that's not
necessarily bad the space behind here is

934
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:53,630
necessarily bad the space behind here is
 

935
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,690
necessarily bad the space behind here is
for the wiring and it'll all be hidden

936
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:55,700
for the wiring and it'll all be hidden
 

937
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:01,779
for the wiring and it'll all be hidden
when this is done and I'm planning on

938
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:01,789
when this is done and I'm planning on
 

939
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:04,899
when this is done and I'm planning on
running the tubes like in each of these

940
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:04,909
running the tubes like in each of these
 

941
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:07,629
running the tubes like in each of these
there's going to be a tube so for

942
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:07,639
there's going to be a tube so for
 

943
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:12,940
there's going to be a tube so for
example right above here this is the

944
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:12,950
example right above here this is the
 

945
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,590
example right above here this is the
center of the mob system there's going

946
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:14,600
center of the mob system there's going
 

947
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,690
center of the mob system there's going
to be glass tube running all the way up

948
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:16,700
to be glass tube running all the way up
 

949
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,139
to be glass tube running all the way up
to that and all this land here needs to

950
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:20,149
to that and all this land here needs to
 

951
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:23,379
to that and all this land here needs to
be removed so that we can see it's going

952
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:23,389
be removed so that we can see it's going
 

953
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:26,879
be removed so that we can see it's going
up kinda because I think that look cool

954
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:26,889
up kinda because I think that look cool
