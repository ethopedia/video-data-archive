in redstone we typically think of it as

112
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:29,220
in redstone we typically think of it as
 

113
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,160
in redstone we typically think of it as
being on or off right powered or

114
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,170
being on or off right powered or
 

115
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,280
being on or off right powered or
unpowered but in reality there's

116
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,290
unpowered but in reality there's
 

117
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,890

powers any adjacent blocks to it like

136
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:04,680
powers any adjacent blocks to it like
 

137
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,370
powers any adjacent blocks to it like
this lamp here and it also powers blocks

138
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:07,380
this lamp here and it also powers blocks
 

139
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,620
this lamp here and it also powers blocks
diagonally like this one here but it's

140

diagonally like this one here but it's
 

141
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,870
diagonally like this one here but it's
off right now we refer to this as a

lamps are on this one is not being
 

151
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,970
lamps are on this one is not being
powered we call this weak power alright

152
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:25,980
powered we call this weak power alright
 

153
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,270

and then the diagonals one here as bud

154
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
and then the diagonals one here as bud
 

155
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,620
and then the diagonals one here as bud
power so lamps are not affected by bud

156
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:33,630
power so lamps are not affected by bud
 

157
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,560
power so lamps are not affected by bud
power even if we update it but things

158
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:36,570
power even if we update it but things
 

159
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,310

I know of in the game affected by Bud

164
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,160
I know of in the game affected by Bud
 

165
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,259
I know of in the game affected by Bud
power all right and bud power works kind

166
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:48,269
power all right and bud power works kind
 

167
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,090
power all right and bud power works kind
of like this so if we have a redstone

168
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,100
of like this so if we have a redstone
 

169
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,750
of like this so if we have a redstone
block here the redstone block is like

170
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
block here the redstone block is like
 

171
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,750
block here the redstone block is like
the strong power the redstone lamps here

172
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:56,760
the strong power the redstone lamps here
 

173
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,780
the strong power the redstone lamps here
are the weak power so if we try to pull

174
00:03:59,780 --> 00:03:59,790
are the weak power so if we try to pull
 

175
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,430
are the weak power so if we try to pull
a signal out we can't repeat it in turn

176
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:04,440
a signal out we can't repeat it in turn
 

177
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,009
a signal out we can't repeat it in turn
on and then these blocks that I'm

178
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:07,019
on and then these blocks that I'm
 

179
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,059
on and then these blocks that I'm
placing here are what are bud powered

180
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:10,069
placing here are what are bud powered
 

181
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:14,000
placing here are what are bud powered
all right so if we place a lamp in any

182
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,010
all right so if we place a lamp in any
 

183
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,250
all right so if we place a lamp in any
of those it won't turn on but if we

184
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:16,260
of those it won't turn on but if we
 

185
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,909
of those it won't turn on but if we
place a piston or a dropper dispenser it

186
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
place a piston or a dropper dispenser it
 

187
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,029
place a piston or a dropper dispenser it
does get activated okay so here's how I

188
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:23,039
does get activated okay so here's how I
 

189
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:25,070
does get activated okay so here's how I
did the puzzle basically put down two

190
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,080
did the puzzle basically put down two
 

191
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,090
did the puzzle basically put down two
redstone blocks rights

192
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:27,100
redstone blocks rights
 

193
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,620
redstone blocks rights
it's being powered right now it shot out

194
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:28,630
it's being powered right now it shot out
 

195
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,580
it's being powered right now it shot out
the item if we tried to power it again

196
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:31,590
the item if we tried to power it again
 

197
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,910
the item if we tried to power it again
since it's being blood powered right now

198
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:34,920
since it's being blood powered right now
 

199
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,440
since it's being blood powered right now
still thinks it's powered okay put a

200
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:37,450
still thinks it's powered okay put a
 

201
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,030
still thinks it's powered okay put a
block next to it doesn't shoot the item

202
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
block next to it doesn't shoot the item
 

203
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,420
block next to it doesn't shoot the item
then when we remove it it's no longer

204
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:42,430
then when we remove it it's no longer
 

205
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,030
then when we remove it it's no longer
powered but because it was being

206
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
powered but because it was being
 

207
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,430
powered but because it was being
diagonally powered we didn't remove any

208
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
diagonally powered we didn't remove any
 

209
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,620
diagonally powered we didn't remove any
blocks next to this dropper so doesn't

210
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:49,630
blocks next to this dropper so doesn't
 

211
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,210
blocks next to this dropper so doesn't
know it's unpowered right now didn't get

212
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:51,220
know it's unpowered right now didn't get
 

213
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,850
know it's unpowered right now didn't get
updated so right now thanks it's powered

214
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:53,860
updated so right now thanks it's powered
 

215
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,920
updated so right now thanks it's powered
if you place a redstone block next to

216
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:55,930
if you place a redstone block next to
 

217
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,590
if you place a redstone block next to
its since they thought it was powered

218
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:58,600
its since they thought it was powered
 

219
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,350
its since they thought it was powered
and you powered it again nothing happens

220
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
and you powered it again nothing happens
 

221
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,380
and you powered it again nothing happens
remove it it updates realizes it's

222
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:04,390
remove it it updates realizes it's
 

223
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,990
remove it it updates realizes it's
unpowered now do it again and it gets

224
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,000
unpowered now do it again and it gets
 

225
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,210
unpowered now do it again and it gets
powered alright so that's how I did the

226
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:09,220
powered alright so that's how I did the
 

227
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,220
powered alright so that's how I did the
right one this left one is the tricky

228
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,230
right one this left one is the tricky
 

229
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:16,350
right one this left one is the tricky
one though so it was unpowered and then

230
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:16,360
one though so it was unpowered and then
 

231
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,270
one though so it was unpowered and then
realized it was powered and I did that

232
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,280
realized it was powered and I did that
 

233
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,550
realized it was powered and I did that
by putting a redstone block underneath

234
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
by putting a redstone block underneath
 

235
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,860
by putting a redstone block underneath
it when you place certain items in the

236
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:22,870
it when you place certain items in the
 

237
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,310
it when you place certain items in the
game like a dropper by default it's

238
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
game like a dropper by default it's
 

239
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,490
game like a dropper by default it's
unpowered it doesn't realize it's being

240
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:29,500
unpowered it doesn't realize it's being
 

241
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,340
unpowered it doesn't realize it's being
powered right now so when you update

242
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,350
powered right now so when you update
 

243
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,400
powered right now so when you update
next to it then it sees oh there's a

244
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,410
next to it then it sees oh there's a
 

245
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,230
next to it then it sees oh there's a
redstone block below me okay I'm being

246
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,240
redstone block below me okay I'm being
 

247
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,430
redstone block below me okay I'm being
powered remove it's still powered okay

248
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
powered remove it's still powered okay
 

249
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,370
powered remove it's still powered okay
so if we place a net another one still

250
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:44,380
so if we place a net another one still
 

251
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,770
so if we place a net another one still
powered you cannot do this more than

252
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:46,780
powered you cannot do this more than
 

253
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,280
powered you cannot do this more than
once

254
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,290
once
 

255
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,280
once
only after you first place it is the

256
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:50,290
only after you first place it is the
 

257
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,950
only after you first place it is the
trick most items in the game don't do

258
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
trick most items in the game don't do
 

259
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,900
trick most items in the game don't do
this though like Pistons and stuff it's

260
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:54,910
this though like Pistons and stuff it's
 

261
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,230
this though like Pistons and stuff it's
only droppers dispensers doors I think

262
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
only droppers dispensers doors I think
 

263
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,620
only droppers dispensers doors I think
maybe fence states if I remember right I

264
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:00,630
maybe fence states if I remember right I
 

265
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,250
maybe fence states if I remember right I
think it's an oversight in the coding

266
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:04,260
think it's an oversight in the coding
 

267
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,240
think it's an oversight in the coding
because when you place it it should

268
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,250
because when you place it it should
 

269
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,960
because when you place it it should
update but it doesn't ah anyways that's

270
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:09,970
update but it doesn't ah anyways that's
 

271
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,530
update but it doesn't ah anyways that's
the trick

272
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:10,540
the trick
 

273
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,810
the trick
hope you enjoyed it sorry for rambling

274
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:12,820
hope you enjoyed it sorry for rambling
 

275
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:27,790
hope you enjoyed it sorry for rambling
let's carry on

276
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:27,800

 

277
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,559

whoa all right everybody so with that we

278
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:33,569
whoa all right everybody so with that we
 

279
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,779
whoa all right everybody so with that we
have the tunnel to the library complete

280
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:35,789
have the tunnel to the library complete
 

281
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:42,020
have the tunnel to the library complete
now let's go check it out here hmm I'm

282
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,030
now let's go check it out here hmm I'm
 

283
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,100
now let's go check it out here hmm I'm
getting better at this

284
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,110
getting better at this
 

285
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,960
getting better at this
it's so much fun flowing through here I

286
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:44,970
it's so much fun flowing through here I
 

287
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,760
it's so much fun flowing through here I
love it

288
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:46,770
love it
 

289
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,320
love it
we got to try pretty it up though it

290
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,330
we got to try pretty it up though it
 

291
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,140
we got to try pretty it up though it
looks not the best rate now usually I

292
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,150
looks not the best rate now usually I
 

293
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,469
looks not the best rate now usually I
can make it up to this pillar and yeah

294
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
can make it up to this pillar and yeah
 

295
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,240
can make it up to this pillar and yeah
again did it so it's pretty consistent

296
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,250
again did it so it's pretty consistent
 

297
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,730
again did it so it's pretty consistent
from what I can tell long as I don't hit

298
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:58,740
from what I can tell long as I don't hit
 

299
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,600
from what I can tell long as I don't hit
a wall or something on the way so goes

300
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:02,610
a wall or something on the way so goes
 

301
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,969
a wall or something on the way so goes
down here takes a right turn and then up

302
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:07,979
down here takes a right turn and then up
 

303
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,219
down here takes a right turn and then up
over here is the library right where

304
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:10,229
over here is the library right where
 

305
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,279
over here is the library right where
this cobble is so we got to go up there

306
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:13,289
this cobble is so we got to go up there
 

307
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:15,140
this cobble is so we got to go up there
that's that's the goal right up at the

308
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,150
that's that's the goal right up at the
 

309
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,680
that's that's the goal right up at the
top there which is I think about why 90

310
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:18,690
top there which is I think about why 90
 

311
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,439
top there which is I think about why 90
or so so we we need an elevator to get

312
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:21,449
or so so we we need an elevator to get
 

313
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,290
or so so we we need an elevator to get
up there of some sort and that's kind of

314
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:24,300
up there of some sort and that's kind of
 

315
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,540
up there of some sort and that's kind of
where the piston trick came from so I'm

316
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:26,550
where the piston trick came from so I'm
 

317
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,580
where the piston trick came from so I'm
going to show you this I was trying to

318
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:28,590
going to show you this I was trying to
 

319
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,909
going to show you this I was trying to
build or design an elevator in creative

320
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
build or design an elevator in creative
 

321
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,490
build or design an elevator in creative
to to get up to the top there trying to

322
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:34,500
to to get up to the top there trying to
 

323
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,350
to to get up to the top there trying to
figure out something something cool to

324
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:36,360
figure out something something cool to
 

325
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,249
figure out something something cool to
do right and while doing that I was

326
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:40,259
do right and while doing that I was
 

327
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,219
do right and while doing that I was
trying to make an elevator that works by

328
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:42,229
trying to make an elevator that works by
 

329
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,540
trying to make an elevator that works by
retracting Pistons instead of extending

330
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:44,550
retracting Pistons instead of extending
 

331
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,870
retracting Pistons instead of extending
them because when Pistons retract it is

332
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:47,880
them because when Pistons retract it is
 

333
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,810
them because when Pistons retract it is
quicker than when they extend so I

334
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:50,820
quicker than when they extend so I
 

335
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,399
quicker than when they extend so I
figured I'd be able to make an elevator

336
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:52,409
figured I'd be able to make an elevator
 

337
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:55,520
figured I'd be able to make an elevator
faster like if I had sticky pistons with

338
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:55,530
faster like if I had sticky pistons with
 

339
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,140
faster like if I had sticky pistons with
glass blocks that pulled me up or

340
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,150
glass blocks that pulled me up or
 

341
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,140
glass blocks that pulled me up or
something and that didn't work out too

342
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,150
something and that didn't work out too
 

343
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,290
something and that didn't work out too
well but while doing that I did notice

344
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:03,300
well but while doing that I did notice
 

345
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,219
well but while doing that I did notice
something that has changed in the 1.9

346
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:06,229
something that has changed in the 1.9
 

347
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:09,320
something that has changed in the 1.9
updates I believe so check this out we

348
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,330
updates I believe so check this out we
 

349
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,649
updates I believe so check this out we
have a piston here normally Pistons can

350
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:12,659
have a piston here normally Pistons can
 

351
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,570
have a piston here normally Pistons can
push and pull blocks like like if it's a

352
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:14,580
push and pull blocks like like if it's a
 

353
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,939
push and pull blocks like like if it's a
sticky piston regular Pistons can push

354
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:16,949
sticky piston regular Pistons can push
 

355
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,640
sticky piston regular Pistons can push
stuff then push entities they cannot

356
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:19,650
stuff then push entities they cannot
 

357
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,760
stuff then push entities they cannot
pull entities though right well now they

358
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:22,770
pull entities though right well now they
 

359
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:28,579
pull entities though right well now they
can check it out ah isn't that cool so

360
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:28,589
can check it out ah isn't that cool so
 

361
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:30,529
can check it out ah isn't that cool so
it actually pulls you to the back of the

362
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:30,539
it actually pulls you to the back of the
 

363
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,670
it actually pulls you to the back of the
piston

364
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
piston
 

365
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,200
piston
and I don't think too many people know

366
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,210
and I don't think too many people know
 

367
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,120
and I don't think too many people know
about this like I tried to keep up with

368
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,130
about this like I tried to keep up with
 

369
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,890
about this like I tried to keep up with
the updates whenever they happen I read

370
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:36,900
the updates whenever they happen I read
 

371
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,510
the updates whenever they happen I read
the patch notes and all that stuff I

372
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:38,520
the patch notes and all that stuff I
 

373
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,540
the patch notes and all that stuff I
didn't see this myself

374
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:40,550
didn't see this myself
 

375
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,339
didn't see this myself
so I wanted to let you guys know about

376
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:43,349
so I wanted to let you guys know about
 

377
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,290
so I wanted to let you guys know about
it today if you didn't know about it as

378
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:45,300
it today if you didn't know about it as
 

379
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,829
it today if you didn't know about it as
well it also works like this actually I

380
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:48,839
well it also works like this actually I
 

381
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,780
well it also works like this actually I
brought some armorstands so we can see

382
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:50,790
brought some armorstands so we can see
 

383
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,670
brought some armorstands so we can see
it a little bit better and I guess let's

384
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:52,680
it a little bit better and I guess let's
 

385
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,670
it a little bit better and I guess let's
make a button or something all right if

386
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
make a button or something all right if
 

387
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:04,100
make a button or something all right if
we do this check this out ha ha getting

388
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,110
we do this check this out ha ha getting
 

389
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,560
we do this check this out ha ha getting
ideas just that we're gonna build an

390
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:06,570
ideas just that we're gonna build an
 

391
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,990
ideas just that we're gonna build an
elevator all right and I think this is a

392
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
elevator all right and I think this is a
 

393
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,190
elevator all right and I think this is a
pretty big game-changer

394
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
pretty big game-changer
 

395
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,260
pretty big game-changer
I hope it's like intended or if it's not

396
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:15,270
I hope it's like intended or if it's not
 

397
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,730
I hope it's like intended or if it's not
intended I hope they keep this feature

398
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:16,740
intended I hope they keep this feature
 

399
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,070
intended I hope they keep this feature
because I think it's going to like add a

400
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,080
because I think it's going to like add a
 

401
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,790
because I think it's going to like add a
lot of a lot to the game it's another

402
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
lot of a lot to the game it's another
 

403
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
lot of a lot to the game it's another
future Pistons you can do it doesn't

404
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,330
future Pistons you can do it doesn't
 

405
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,380
future Pistons you can do it doesn't
really take anything away so I hope they

406
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:27,390
really take anything away so I hope they
 

407
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,840
really take anything away so I hope they
leave it what I want to do with it first

408
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:29,850
leave it what I want to do with it first
 

409
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,090
leave it what I want to do with it first
off here is to build like a conveyor

410
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,100
off here is to build like a conveyor
 

411
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,900
off here is to build like a conveyor
belts it's really easy to do this too

412
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:35,910
belts it's really easy to do this too
 

413
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,820
belts it's really easy to do this too
which is a nice thing doesn't take a lot

414
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:37,830
which is a nice thing doesn't take a lot
 

415
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,510
which is a nice thing doesn't take a lot
of setup maybe let's go one block up

416
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:41,520
of setup maybe let's go one block up
 

417
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,050
of setup maybe let's go one block up
here let's start here or no my goal is

418
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:45,060
here let's start here or no my goal is
 

419
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,300
here let's start here or no my goal is
to end up on this cobblestone so since

420
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,310
to end up on this cobblestone so since
 

421
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,110
to end up on this cobblestone so since
it pulls you to the back of the piston

422
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,120
it pulls you to the back of the piston
 

423
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,199
it pulls you to the back of the piston
we'll do that all right and all I got to

424
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:54,209
we'll do that all right and all I got to
 

425
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:57,650
we'll do that all right and all I got to
do is every second block here place a

426
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:57,660
do is every second block here place a
 

427
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:05,120
do is every second block here place a
piston right and then every every piston

428
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,130
piston right and then every every piston
 

429
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,370
piston right and then every every piston
put a block like here here here and here

430
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:07,380
put a block like here here here and here
 

431
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,900
put a block like here here here and here
and then all we need to do is redstone

432
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:11,910
and then all we need to do is redstone
 

433
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,570
and then all we need to do is redstone
repeater I'll change this out to stone

434
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:14,580
repeater I'll change this out to stone
 

435
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,360
repeater I'll change this out to stone
brick once I stop recording one tick

436
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,370
brick once I stop recording one tick
 

437
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,160
brick once I stop recording one tick
between each one and that's all there is

438
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,170
between each one and that's all there is
 

439
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,120
between each one and that's all there is
to to doing this let me get let me set

440
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,130
to to doing this let me get let me set
 

441
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,230
to to doing this let me get let me set
this up off-camera and I'll show you

442
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
this up off-camera and I'll show you
 

443
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,340
this up off-camera and I'll show you
it's really cool okay so let's go check

444
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,350
it's really cool okay so let's go check
 

445
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,100
it's really cool okay so let's go check
this out basically last episode I wasn't

446
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,110
this out basically last episode I wasn't
 

447
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,920
this out basically last episode I wasn't
really sure what to do here with this

448
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:33,930
really sure what to do here with this
 

449
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,690
really sure what to do here with this
tunnel because we can't fly all the way

450
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:35,700
tunnel because we can't fly all the way
 

451
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,949
tunnel because we can't fly all the way
we hit the bedrock right so I wasn't

452
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:39,959
we hit the bedrock right so I wasn't
 

453
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,180
we hit the bedrock right so I wasn't
sure what to do about it but this

454
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,190
sure what to do about it but this
 

455
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,100
sure what to do about it but this
conveyor system works out perfect so

456
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,110
conveyor system works out perfect so
 

457
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,449
conveyor system works out perfect so
we're going to set up so that we can fly

458
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:44,459
we're going to set up so that we can fly
 

459
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:45,540
we're going to set up so that we can fly
right into it looks

460
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,550
right into it looks
 

461
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,139
right into it looks
it's a little bit short Oh what happened

462
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:49,149
it's a little bit short Oh what happened
 

463
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:57,980
it's a little bit short Oh what happened
oh maybe maybe I got something wrong I

464
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:57,990

 

465
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,180

bet you it's because I'm recording now

466
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,190
bet you it's because I'm recording now
 

467
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:06,870
bet you it's because I'm recording now
something something has changed oh snap

468
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
something something has changed oh snap
 

469
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:14,550
something something has changed oh snap
okay I didn't realize this ah now we're

470
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
okay I didn't realize this ah now we're
 

471
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,930
okay I didn't realize this ah now we're
making it all the way for some reason

472
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:15,940
making it all the way for some reason
 

473
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,470
making it all the way for some reason
okay I might need to just make the

474
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:19,480
okay I might need to just make the
 

475
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,470
okay I might need to just make the
timing longer on these then because it's

476
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
timing longer on these then because it's
 

477
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,360
timing longer on these then because it's
only one tick between each piston which

478
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,370
only one tick between each piston which
 

479
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,259
only one tick between each piston which
is really pushing it we are one redstone

480
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:28,269
is really pushing it we are one redstone
 

481
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:30,870
is really pushing it we are one redstone
tape between each piston let's try it

482
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
tape between each piston let's try it
 

483
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,569
tape between each piston let's try it
again

484
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:32,579
again
 

485
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:36,060
again
yeah hmm this works when I'm not

486
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,070
yeah hmm this works when I'm not
 

487
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,050
yeah hmm this works when I'm not
recording

488
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:37,060
recording
 

489
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,170
recording
I think cuz I'm lagging a little bit's

490
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:39,180
I think cuz I'm lagging a little bit's
 

491
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:46,949
I think cuz I'm lagging a little bit's
it's not working now oh all right well

492
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
it's not working now oh all right well
 

493
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,600
it's not working now oh all right well
let's try to change these the two tix

494
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:48,610
let's try to change these the two tix
 

495
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,130
let's try to change these the two tix
then this should definitely work for

496
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,140
then this should definitely work for
 

497
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,819
then this should definitely work for
sure that's just look twice as slow is

498
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:53,829
sure that's just look twice as slow is
 

499
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:56,460
sure that's just look twice as slow is
the problem if it's it set at one tick

500
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:56,470
the problem if it's it set at one tick
 

501
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,949
the problem if it's it set at one tick
it's actually 20 blocks per second which

502
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
it's actually 20 blocks per second which
 

503
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,180
it's actually 20 blocks per second which
is faster than then horses and minecarts

504
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,190
is faster than then horses and minecarts
 

505
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,340
is faster than then horses and minecarts
and all that stuff you can even have

506
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,350
and all that stuff you can even have
 

507
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,800
and all that stuff you can even have
another space between these pistons if

508
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:07,810
another space between these pistons if
 

509
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,069
another space between these pistons if
you if you use a horse or a boat instead

510
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:11,079
you if you use a horse or a boat instead
 

511
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:14,130
you if you use a horse or a boat instead
so it's like 30 bucks a second but it

512
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:14,140
so it's like 30 bucks a second but it
 

513
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,199
so it's like 30 bucks a second but it
turns out there might be some issues if

514
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:16,209
turns out there might be some issues if
 

515
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,079
turns out there might be some issues if
we are recording or if your computer is

516
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:19,089
we are recording or if your computer is
 

517
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,930
we are recording or if your computer is
lagging ok let's try this now

518
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:21,940
lagging ok let's try this now
 

519
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,930
lagging ok let's try this now
oh snap and I was all excited I thought

520
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:27,940
oh snap and I was all excited I thought
 

521
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,910
oh snap and I was all excited I thought
it was going to be super fast I would

522
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
it was going to be super fast I would
 

523
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,800
it was going to be super fast I would
rather it be consistent though then then

524
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:31,810
rather it be consistent though then then
 

525
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,470
rather it be consistent though then then
quick

526
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:35,480

 

527
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:42,280

what what okay - for sixty six point

528
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,290
what what okay - for sixty six point
 

529
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,620
what what okay - for sixty six point
three and sixty six point three remember

530
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:44,630
three and sixty six point three remember
 

531
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,930
three and sixty six point three remember
that failed all rights again exact same

532
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:49,940
that failed all rights again exact same
 

533
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,380
that failed all rights again exact same
position all right

534
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:53,390
position all right
 

535
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:59,590
position all right
or in square in spots failed okay we

536
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
or in square in spots failed okay we
 

537
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,950
or in square in spots failed okay we
expected that failed in a different spot

538
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:05,960
expected that failed in a different spot
 

539
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:17,380
expected that failed in a different spot
this time and out ah alright this is a

540
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:17,390
this time and out ah alright this is a
 

541
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,360
this time and out ah alright this is a
little bit iffy right now I think we'll

542
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,370
little bit iffy right now I think we'll
 

543
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,880
little bit iffy right now I think we'll
move on to the elevator we're definitely

544
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:21,890
move on to the elevator we're definitely
 

545
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,000
move on to the elevator we're definitely
doing an elevator and hopefully we're

546
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,010
doing an elevator and hopefully we're
 

547
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,880
doing an elevator and hopefully we're
not having issues with it now for some

548
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:27,890
not having issues with it now for some
 

549
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,260
not having issues with it now for some
reason okay guys so this is our goal our

550
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,270
reason okay guys so this is our goal our
 

551
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,910
reason okay guys so this is our goal our
targets we want to go up the elevator

552
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
targets we want to go up the elevator
 

553
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,550
targets we want to go up the elevator
and end up right here on the library so

554
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
and end up right here on the library so
 

555
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,430
and end up right here on the library so
we're facing the enchanting table so I

556
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
we're facing the enchanting table so I
 

557
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,330
we're facing the enchanting table so I
filled this up with stone again ooh

558
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:42,340
filled this up with stone again ooh
 

559
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,400
filled this up with stone again ooh
maybe you let's do this go down a bit

560
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:45,410
maybe you let's do this go down a bit
 

561
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,550
maybe you let's do this go down a bit
more rather than like mining this all

562
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:48,560
more rather than like mining this all
 

563
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,350
more rather than like mining this all
out with my pick I think I'm gonna do

564
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:50,360
out with my pick I think I'm gonna do
 

565
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,140
out with my pick I think I'm gonna do
TNT it's so much faster

566
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,150
TNT it's so much faster
 

567
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,480
TNT it's so much faster
is it safe though I think it should be

568
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:58,490
is it safe though I think it should be
 

569
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,240
is it safe though I think it should be
okay alright

570
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,250
okay alright
 

571
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,640
okay alright
that way I'll have some space do the

572
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:03,650
that way I'll have some space do the
 

573
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,880
that way I'll have some space do the
redstone stuff too as we go down and I

574
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:06,890
redstone stuff too as we go down and I
 

575
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,530
redstone stuff too as we go down and I
brought a dispenser so hopefully put it

576
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:11,540
brought a dispenser so hopefully put it
 

577
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,250
brought a dispenser so hopefully put it
over here I knew I wasn't going to get

578
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:15,260
over here I knew I wasn't going to get
 

579
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:20,440
over here I knew I wasn't going to get
it so hard to place this sideways almost

580
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:20,450
it so hard to place this sideways almost
 

581
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,610
it so hard to place this sideways almost
at it nope this is like a game can you

582
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:24,620
at it nope this is like a game can you
 

583
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,380
at it nope this is like a game can you
jump and place it sideways at the same

584
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:26,390
jump and place it sideways at the same
 

585
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:32,890
jump and place it sideways at the same
time I'll tell you what let's just do

586
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:32,900
time I'll tell you what let's just do
 

587
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,940
time I'll tell you what let's just do
this I've given up okay yes fill this up

588
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:36,950
this I've given up okay yes fill this up
 

589
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,800
this I've given up okay yes fill this up
with TNT and we'll make a button and I

590
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:41,810
with TNT and we'll make a button and I
 

591
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,330
with TNT and we'll make a button and I
am just keep spamming the button and

592
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:43,340
am just keep spamming the button and
 

593
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,070
am just keep spamming the button and
hopefully it digs us a nice little hole

594
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:45,080
hopefully it digs us a nice little hole
 

595
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,769
hopefully it digs us a nice little hole
here

596
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:47,779

 

597
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:51,340

all the way down Oh careful careful

598
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:51,350
all the way down Oh careful careful
 

599
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:58,030
all the way down Oh careful careful
Oh oh yeah I got it ease up on these

600
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,040
Oh oh yeah I got it ease up on these
 

601
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Oh oh yeah I got it ease up on these
button presses that almost flip the

602
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,050
button presses that almost flip the
 

603
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,800
button presses that almost flip the
library that would have been so sad it

604
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:02,810
library that would have been so sad it
 

605
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,110
library that would have been so sad it
like shot up there then fell back down

606
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120

 

607
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:19,139

alright I think that's doing a good job

608
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:19,149

so check it out guys we have a pretty
 

613
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,150
so check it out guys we have a pretty
good area here to work now to put in our

614
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,160
good area here to work now to put in our
 

615
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,059
good area here to work now to put in our
elevator a lot of space I think we mined

616
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:28,069
elevator a lot of space I think we mined
 

617
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:30,280
elevator a lot of space I think we mined
out like 5,000 blocks in five minutes

618
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,290
out like 5,000 blocks in five minutes
 

619
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,600
out like 5,000 blocks in five minutes
there I like TNT TNT is awesome alright

620
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:34,610
there I like TNT TNT is awesome alright
 

621
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,949

so I'm going to show you how to build

622
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:35,959
so I'm going to show you how to build
 

623
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,590
so I'm going to show you how to build
the elevator now

624
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
the elevator now
 

625
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,689
the elevator now
so like the conveyor belt here we need a

626
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:40,699
so like the conveyor belt here we need a
 

627
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:44,199
so like the conveyor belt here we need a
one tick pulse going through it we

628
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:44,209
one tick pulse going through it we
 

629
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,239
one tick pulse going through it we
cannot set any repeaters to do when I

630
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:46,249
cannot set any repeaters to do when I
 

631
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:47,710
cannot set any repeaters to do when I
did that before that was a mistake

632
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:47,720
did that before that was a mistake
 

633
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,559
did that before that was a mistake
I should I knew that didn't work but I

634
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:50,569
I should I knew that didn't work but I
 

635
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:54,340
I should I knew that didn't work but I
did it anyway because I forgot you

636
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:54,350
did it anyway because I forgot you
 

637

cannot like if you said that the - it
 

639
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,259
cannot like if you said that the - it
makes the redstone pulse two ticks if

640
00:15:59,259 --> 00:15:59,269
makes the redstone pulse two ticks if
 

641
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:01,600
makes the redstone pulse two ticks if
you said to three it's three four you

642
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:01,610
you said to three it's three four you
 

643
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,249
you said to three it's three four you
have to keep it at one so if you want a

644
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:03,259
have to keep it at one so if you want a
 

645
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:06,699
have to keep it at one so if you want a
to tick redstone pulse you have to just

646
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:06,709
to tick redstone pulse you have to just
 

647
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:10,059
to tick redstone pulse you have to just
use two repeaters set at one each all

648
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:10,069
use two repeaters set at one each all
 

649
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,769
use two repeaters set at one each all
right that's what we're going to do for

650
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:11,779
right that's what we're going to do for
 

651
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:13,960
right that's what we're going to do for
the elevator here we need two ticks two

652
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:13,970
the elevator here we need two ticks two
 

653
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,549
the elevator here we need two ticks two
redstone ticks between each of the

654
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:15,559
redstone ticks between each of the
 

655
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,030
redstone ticks between each of the
Pistons all right so you can set this up

656
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040
Pistons all right so you can set this up
 

657
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,579
Pistons all right so you can set this up
pretty nicely actually like you can have

658
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:21,589
pretty nicely actually like you can have
 

659
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:25,269
pretty nicely actually like you can have
it so you just step on a pressure plate

660
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
it so you just step on a pressure plate
 

661
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,610
it so you just step on a pressure plate
and then you go up sort of thing and

662
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:27,620
and then you go up sort of thing and
 

663
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,220
and then you go up sort of thing and
I'll just show you maybe how you could

664
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:30,230
I'll just show you maybe how you could
 

665
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,460
I'll just show you maybe how you could
set it up here give it give yourself a

666
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:33,470
set it up here give it give yourself a
 

667
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,549
set it up here give it give yourself a
little bit of a delay maybe whatever you

668
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:36,559
little bit of a delay maybe whatever you
 

669
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:36,939
little bit of a delay maybe whatever you
want

670
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:36,949
want
 

671
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:41,499
want
before this triggers and then come on a

672
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:41,509
before this triggers and then come on a
 

673
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,340
before this triggers and then come on a
stable circuit to make a short pulse all

674
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:45,350
stable circuit to make a short pulse all
 

675
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,340
stable circuit to make a short pulse all
right pull the power through one tick

676
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:48,350
right pull the power through one tick
 

677
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,439
right pull the power through one tick
and then just make it go up to two here

678
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:53,449
and then just make it go up to two here
 

679
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:55,419
and then just make it go up to two here
oh I missed let's go around like this

680
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:55,429
oh I missed let's go around like this
 

681
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:59,379
oh I missed let's go around like this
just to show you I'm probably going to

682
00:16:59,379 --> 00:16:59,389
just to show you I'm probably going to
 

683
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:00,850
just to show you I'm probably going to
hook my elevator up to the conveyor belt

684
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:00,860
hook my elevator up to the conveyor belt
 

685
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,630
hook my elevator up to the conveyor belt
though so

686
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:01,640
though so
 

687
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,910
though so
I don't have to activate the elevator

688
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:03,920
I don't have to activate the elevator
 

689
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,949
I don't have to activate the elevator
separately and just go through the

690
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:05,959
separately and just go through the
 

691
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,260
separately and just go through the
conveyor belt and then up all in one

692
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,270
conveyor belt and then up all in one
 

693
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,240
conveyor belt and then up all in one
motion is kind of cool all right

694
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,250
motion is kind of cool all right
 

695
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,880
motion is kind of cool all right
yeah that's working good move this up

696
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:15,890
yeah that's working good move this up
 

697
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,730
yeah that's working good move this up
what happened what's going on

698
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:18,740
what happened what's going on
 

699
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,860
what happened what's going on
oh yeah I got I got a hooked up to two

700
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:20,870
oh yeah I got I got a hooked up to two
 

701
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,560
oh yeah I got I got a hooked up to two
right now let's take it up to the second

702
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:23,570
right now let's take it up to the second
 

703
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,319
right now let's take it up to the second
piston that's good so I'll show you the

704
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:26,329
piston that's good so I'll show you the
 

705
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,970
piston that's good so I'll show you the
pattern in the back here it's pretty

706
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:27,980
pattern in the back here it's pretty
 

707
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,800
pattern in the back here it's pretty
simple so one repeater goes to here and

708
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:32,810
simple so one repeater goes to here and
 

709
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,350
simple so one repeater goes to here and
the Pistons right there right we're

710
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360
the Pistons right there right we're
 

711
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,180
the Pistons right there right we're
building it out a poopy Brown because

712
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,190
building it out a poopy Brown because
 

713
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,980
building it out a poopy Brown because
we're we're trying to make this nature

714
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:38,990
we're we're trying to make this nature
 

715
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,480
we're we're trying to make this nature
theme down here when it's all said and

716
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:40,490
theme down here when it's all said and
 

717
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,020
theme down here when it's all said and
done and poopy Browns a nice neutral

718
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,030
done and poopy Browns a nice neutral
 

719
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,050
done and poopy Browns a nice neutral
color and everybody loves poopy brown

720
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:46,060
color and everybody loves poopy brown
 

721
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,670
color and everybody loves poopy brown
okay then on the other side we have the

722
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:48,680
okay then on the other side we have the
 

723
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,610
okay then on the other side we have the
second repeater goes up repeater

724
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:51,620
second repeater goes up repeater
 

725
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,450
second repeater goes up repeater
repeater again piston over here

726
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:54,460
repeater again piston over here
 

727
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,170
repeater again piston over here
pretty simple pattern I'm still trying

728
00:17:59,170 --> 00:17:59,180
pretty simple pattern I'm still trying
 

729
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,530
pretty simple pattern I'm still trying
to get into the flow of building it here

730
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:01,540
to get into the flow of building it here
 

731
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,910
to get into the flow of building it here
okay so then we would go block and then

732
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:06,920
okay so then we would go block and then
 

733
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,800
okay so then we would go block and then
upside down slab upside down slab and

734
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:11,810
upside down slab upside down slab and
 

735
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:16,780
upside down slab upside down slab and
then yes I think over here yeah Pistons

736
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:16,790
then yes I think over here yeah Pistons
 

737
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,400
then yes I think over here yeah Pistons
right there so the next block here and

738
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,410
right there so the next block here and
 

739
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,430
right there so the next block here and
here and again let's put some redstone

740
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
here and again let's put some redstone
 

741
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,080
here and again let's put some redstone
dust on these and you kind of just do a

742
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,090
dust on these and you kind of just do a
 

743
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,070
dust on these and you kind of just do a
wavy thing all the way up and repeater

744
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,080
wavy thing all the way up and repeater
 

745
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,270
wavy thing all the way up and repeater
repeater good oh so I think that should

746
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:34,280
repeater good oh so I think that should
 

747
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,950
repeater good oh so I think that should
take us to the very top here now all

748
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:35,960
take us to the very top here now all
 

749
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,260
take us to the very top here now all
right or no there's two more up there

750
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,270
right or no there's two more up there
 

751
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,840
right or no there's two more up there
yet pick us up to the third one now

752
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:41,850
yet pick us up to the third one now
 

753
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,090
yet pick us up to the third one now
good one-two-three

754
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,100
good one-two-three
 

755
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,039
good one-two-three
oh so it's pretty simple I have to go

756
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:50,049
oh so it's pretty simple I have to go
 

757
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:52,560
oh so it's pretty simple I have to go
all the way up here which is going to

758
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:52,570
all the way up here which is going to
 

759
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,120
all the way up here which is going to
take a bit of time I'll try to do it

760
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,130
take a bit of time I'll try to do it
 

761
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:58,470
take a bit of time I'll try to do it
today but we'll see I was building this

762
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
today but we'll see I was building this
 

763
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,380
today but we'll see I was building this
and I ran out of poopy brown part way

764
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:01,390
and I ran out of poopy brown part way
 

765
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,029
and I ran out of poopy brown part way
through near the top there so I have to

766
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039
through near the top there so I have to
 

767
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,610
through near the top there so I have to
get down go get more materials now now

768
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:05,620
get down go get more materials now now
 

769
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,680
get down go get more materials now now
I've come back the way I'm putting these

770
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:07,690
I've come back the way I'm putting these
 

771
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,430
I've come back the way I'm putting these
pistons in now is a little funny I'm

772
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:10,440
pistons in now is a little funny I'm
 

773
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,110
pistons in now is a little funny I'm
basically just placing two at a time

774
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,120
basically just placing two at a time
 

775
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,090
basically just placing two at a time
floating down very gracefully flip like

776
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,100
floating down very gracefully flip like
 

777
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,810
floating down very gracefully flip like
a feather

778
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:18,820
a feather
 

779
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,139
a feather
ouch and then go back up and it takes us

780
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:22,149
ouch and then go back up and it takes us
 

781
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:25,560
ouch and then go back up and it takes us
to the top of the distance new place all

782
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:25,570
to the top of the distance new place all
 

783
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,769
to the top of the distance new place all
right then I place two more probably

784
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:28,779
right then I place two more probably
 

785
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:30,240
right then I place two more probably
could do this a little bit better but it

786
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,250
could do this a little bit better but it
 

787
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,380
could do this a little bit better but it
works oh I was not so graceful that was

788
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:34,390
works oh I was not so graceful that was
 

789
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,320
works oh I was not so graceful that was
more like a cannonball falling all right

790
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:37,330
more like a cannonball falling all right
 

791
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:43,320
more like a cannonball falling all right
thankfully we heal super fast in 1.9

792
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,330

 

793
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,120

I don't think that's a good change for

794
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,130
I don't think that's a good change for
 

795
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,340
I don't think that's a good change for
combat honestly but I do like it for

796
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:47,350

took damage I just got to eat something
and it's back up and it heals quickly as

804
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:56,800
and it's back up and it heals quickly as
 

805
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,460
and it's back up and it heals quickly as
long as you have saturation once the

806
00:19:59,460 --> 00:19:59,470
long as you have saturation once the
 

807
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,260
long as you have saturation once the
saturation is gone you heal like you

808
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:01,270
saturation is gone you heal like you
 

809

Pistons alright there and there I should

812
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:11,380
Pistons alright there and there I should
 

813
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,780
Pistons alright there and there I should
take me to the very top and I didn't

814
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:12,790
take me to the very top and I didn't
 

815
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,530
take me to the very top and I didn't
work on the wiring again oh come on

816
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:15,540
work on the wiring again oh come on
 

817
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,780
work on the wiring again oh come on
careful careful careful all right

818
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:18,790
careful careful careful all right
 

819
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:24,120
careful careful careful all right
very good working good though having

820
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,130
very good working good though having
 

821
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,100
very good working good though having
those two ticks between the pistons

822
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,110
those two ticks between the pistons
 

823
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,070
those two ticks between the pistons
works great with the horizontal thing I

824
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,080
works great with the horizontal thing I
 

825
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,290
works great with the horizontal thing I
think that's the problem but with the

826
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:31,300
think that's the problem but with the
 

827
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,730
think that's the problem but with the
way it's laid out it's kind of hard to

828
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:32,740
way it's laid out it's kind of hard to
 

829
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,950
way it's laid out it's kind of hard to
fit to two repeaters in here we go again

830
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:37,960
fit to two repeaters in here we go again
 

831
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,190
fit to two repeaters in here we go again
so got the elevator pretty much all done

832
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,200
so got the elevator pretty much all done
 

833
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,560
so got the elevator pretty much all done
now I did run out of poopy Brown again

834
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:43,570
now I did run out of poopy Brown again
 

835
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,250
now I did run out of poopy Brown again
though I'm totally out of hardened clay

836
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:47,260
though I'm totally out of hardened clay
 

837
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,560
though I'm totally out of hardened clay
so I'll have to go dig up some more at

838
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:49,570
so I'll have to go dig up some more at
 

839
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,010
so I'll have to go dig up some more at
the Mesa biome but yeah check it out

840
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:53,020
the Mesa biome but yeah check it out
 

841
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,500
the Mesa biome but yeah check it out
guys I put I put carpet here I thought

842
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:55,510
guys I put I put carpet here I thought
 

843
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,460
guys I put I put carpet here I thought
maybe maybe we were getting pushed over

844
00:20:59,460 --> 00:20:59,470
maybe maybe we were getting pushed over
 

845
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,020
maybe maybe we were getting pushed over
to where the repeater was and getting

846
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,030
to where the repeater was and getting
 

847
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,660
to where the repeater was and getting
stuck on that or something it was

848
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:03,670
stuck on that or something it was
 

849
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,150
stuck on that or something it was
working good once I put the carpet down

850
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:06,160
working good once I put the carpet down
 

851
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,070
working good once I put the carpet down
but now it's failing again so I don't

852
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,080
but now it's failing again so I don't
 

853
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,240
but now it's failing again so I don't
know darn it

854
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,250
know darn it
 

855
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,680
know darn it
it's hoping at least for the video it

856
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:13,690
it's hoping at least for the video it
 

857
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,350
it's hoping at least for the video it
would work

858
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,360
would work
 

859
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,550
would work
hey ah come on come on just do it just

860
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:20,560
hey ah come on come on just do it just
 

861
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:32,400
hey ah come on come on just do it just
do it and no no no no all right I think

862
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:32,410
do it and no no no no all right I think
 

863
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:37,420
do it and no no no no all right I think
I might tear this out I'm not sure

864
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,430
I might tear this out I'm not sure
 

865
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,680
I might tear this out I'm not sure
alright you know what I probably end up

866
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:39,690
alright you know what I probably end up
 

867
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,450
alright you know what I probably end up
doing I might just make it work with a

868
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:41,460
doing I might just make it work with a
 

869
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,250
doing I might just make it work with a
horse or a boat or something that way I

870
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:43,260
horse or a boat or something that way I
 

871
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,610
horse or a boat or something that way I
can have one extra airspace here and if

872
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:46,620
can have one extra airspace here and if
 

873
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,860
can have one extra airspace here and if
I have one extra airspace I can fit in

874
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:48,870
I have one extra airspace I can fit in
 

875
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,280
I have one extra airspace I can fit in
an extra repeater pretty easily and then

876
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,290
an extra repeater pretty easily and then
 

877
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,710
an extra repeater pretty easily and then
it'll work for sure I'm I'm almost

878
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
it'll work for sure I'm I'm almost
 

879
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,800
it'll work for sure I'm I'm almost
certain oh come on it's like what I

880
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:00,810
certain oh come on it's like what I
 

881
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,460
certain oh come on it's like what I
start recording that it just fails like

882
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:04,470
start recording that it just fails like
 

883
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,860
start recording that it just fails like
if I if I start recording like halfway

884
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:06,870
if I if I start recording like halfway
 

885
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,310
if I if I start recording like halfway
through the conveyor belts then it stops

886
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
through the conveyor belts then it stops
 

887
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,080
through the conveyor belts then it stops
so it's definitely being affected by leg

888
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,090
so it's definitely being affected by leg
 

889
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,560
so it's definitely being affected by leg
because recording takes is a big

890
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:15,570
because recording takes is a big
 

891
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:21,200
because recording takes is a big
performance it on my computer right yeah

892
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,210
performance it on my computer right yeah
 

893
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,420
performance it on my computer right yeah
we need two tix it's this way at two on

894
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:23,430
we need two tix it's this way at two on
 

895
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:30,140
we need two tix it's this way at two on
unreliable at one tick okay so I'll just

896
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,150
unreliable at one tick okay so I'll just
 

897
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,090
unreliable at one tick okay so I'll just
show you the elevator now as well that

898
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:32,100
show you the elevator now as well that
 

899
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,520
show you the elevator now as well that
now that's almost done ah so I put the

900
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:34,530
now that's almost done ah so I put the
 

901
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,200
now that's almost done ah so I put the
pressure plate back in here kind of

902
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,210
pressure plate back in here kind of
 

903
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,940
pressure plate back in here kind of
ripped out the conveyor belt here cuz it

904
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:37,950
ripped out the conveyor belt here cuz it
 

905
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,590
ripped out the conveyor belt here cuz it
was really really annoying me today so

906
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:42,600
was really really annoying me today so
 

907
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,790
was really really annoying me today so
you're supposed to enter it from the

908
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:43,800
you're supposed to enter it from the
 

909
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:51,570
you're supposed to enter it from the
side like this go up

910
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:51,580

 

911
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,100

see if it does it I didn't do it now

912
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:53,110
see if it does it I didn't do it now
 

913
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,529
see if it does it I didn't do it now
that I'm recording that's weird for some

914
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:55,539
that I'm recording that's weird for some
 

915
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:56,940
that I'm recording that's weird for some
reason I was slowing down towards the

916
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:56,950
reason I was slowing down towards the
 

917
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,440
reason I was slowing down towards the
end when I wasn't recording now it's

918
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:58,450
end when I wasn't recording now it's
 

919
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,450
end when I wasn't recording now it's
like pretty consistent for some reason

920
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:00,460
like pretty consistent for some reason
 

921
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,700
like pretty consistent for some reason
but yeah you you come up and you're

922
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:02,710
but yeah you you come up and you're
 

923
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,190
but yeah you you come up and you're
facing the enchanting table here of

924
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,200
facing the enchanting table here of
 

925
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,710
facing the enchanting table here of
course we have the buttons to get the

926
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:07,720
course we have the buttons to get the
 

927
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,570
course we have the buttons to get the
books over here so everything is kind of

928
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:09,580
books over here so everything is kind of
 

929
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,810
books over here so everything is kind of
nice and compact together at the library

930
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:12,820
nice and compact together at the library
 

931
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,539
nice and compact together at the library
it'll be pretty nice and then I had some

932
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:15,549
it'll be pretty nice and then I had some
 

933

it'll be pretty nice and then I had some
people wondering how I'm going to get

934
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:16,899
people wondering how I'm going to get
 

935
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:19,830
people wondering how I'm going to get

tunnel look better let's see I want a
really easy way of doing it though is

954
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:49,239
really easy way of doing it though is
 

955
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:51,359
really easy way of doing it though is
the problem let's see if we have any

956
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:51,369
the problem let's see if we have any
 

957
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:53,340
the problem let's see if we have any
birch leaves over here so this might be

958
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:53,350
birch leaves over here so this might be
 

959
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,249
birch leaves over here so this might be
a better choice as hoping we could just

960
00:23:56,249 --> 00:23:56,259
a better choice as hoping we could just
 

961
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:59,879
a better choice as hoping we could just
maybe line that edges with leaves and

962
00:23:59,879 --> 00:23:59,889
maybe line that edges with leaves and
 

963
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:01,649
maybe line that edges with leaves and
just go through it really quick because

964
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:01,659
just go through it really quick because
 

965
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:03,389
just go through it really quick because
we I don't really want to spend a whole

966
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:03,399
we I don't really want to spend a whole
 

967
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:08,789
we I don't really want to spend a whole
lot of time doing this and every level

968
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:08,799
lot of time doing this and every level
 

969
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,710
lot of time doing this and every level
of detail we add to is going to make it

970
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,720
of detail we add to is going to make it
 

971
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,330
of detail we add to is going to make it
take way way longer because it's a

972
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:12,340
take way way longer because it's a
 

973
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,879
take way way longer because it's a
really long tunnel if we could just get

974
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:14,889
really long tunnel if we could just get
 

975
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:17,930
really long tunnel if we could just get
away with leaves it would be awesome

976
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:17,940
away with leaves it would be awesome
 

977
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:24,629
away with leaves it would be awesome
flying okay so let's just try it out

978
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:24,639
flying okay so let's just try it out
 

979
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:28,999
flying okay so let's just try it out
maybe over here see what happens if we

980
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:29,009
maybe over here see what happens if we
 

981
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:33,869
maybe over here see what happens if we
span leaves a little bit originally I

982
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:33,879
span leaves a little bit originally I
 

983
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:35,999

was gonna gonna just grow trees in here

984
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:36,009
was gonna gonna just grow trees in here
 

985
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:39,499
was gonna gonna just grow trees in here
and and hope hopefully this chisel out a

986
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:39,509
and and hope hopefully this chisel out a
 

987
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:41,849
and and hope hopefully this chisel out a
path through the middle but I don't

988
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:41,859
path through the middle but I don't
 

989
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:44,070
path through the middle but I don't
think that's gonna work actually because

990
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,080
think that's gonna work actually because
 

991
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,680
think that's gonna work actually because

997
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:00,040
