big plans for today's episode we're

00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,799
big plans for today's episode we're

big plans for today's episode we're
going to try and build

our passive mob spawning pads for

12
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
our passive mob spawning pads for
 

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,230
our passive mob spawning pads for
the ice base here so that's what our

14
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
the ice base here so that's what our
 

15
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,950
the ice base here so that's what our
goal is

16
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
goal is
 

17
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,790
goal is
hopefully we can get as much done as

18
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
hopefully we can get as much done as
 

19
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,310
hopefully we can get as much done as
possible

20
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
possible
 

21
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,470
possible
but before we begin that we need to put

22
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
but before we begin that we need to put
 

23
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,790
but before we begin that we need to put
the floor in here

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:32,800
the floor in here
 

25
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,150
the floor in here
and it seems like the black and blue

26
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,160
and it seems like the black and blue
 

27
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,590
and it seems like the black and blue
wool

wool
 

29
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,510

sandstone too much so

00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
sandstone too much so
 

33
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,430
sandstone too much so
i think we're gonna go with black and

34
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
i think we're gonna go with black and
 

35
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,700
i think we're gonna go with black and

so

40
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
so
 

41
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,310
so
yeah we're just gonna do a straight line

42
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
yeah we're just gonna do a straight line
 

43
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,229
yeah we're just gonna do a straight line

45
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,390

a few people suggest that you try to

46
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400

 

47
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,710

like a pattern

48
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
like a pattern
 

49
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,789
like a pattern
like a fancy pattern on the ground but i

50
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
like a fancy pattern on the ground but i
 

51
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,630

this is supposed to be a lab i think we

00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
this is supposed to be a lab i think we
 

55
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,840
this is supposed to be a lab i think we
want a clean look

61
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,310

if we don't like it we can always change

if we don't like it we can always change

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,950
if we don't like it we can always change
it

65
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,270

yeah we got blue and black i probably

66
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
yeah we got blue and black i probably

don't have enough wool to finish

don't have enough wool to finish

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,600
don't have enough wool to finish
the whole thing

but it definitely uh contrasts with the
 

75
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:07,270
but it definitely uh contrasts with the
snow pretty good

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,270

79
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,070

gonna get rid of all this soil

uh maybe i'll try to talk about the

84
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
uh maybe i'll try to talk about the
 

85
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,630
uh maybe i'll try to talk about the

passive mob stuff as

i do this uh so i've decided on a

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,270
i do this uh so i've decided on a

00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
pattern
 

91
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,470
pattern
for the passive mob system it's a

92
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
for the passive mob system it's a
 

93
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,070
for the passive mob system it's a
different than anything i've done

94
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
different than anything i've done
 

95
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,670
different than anything i've done
yet uh it's only going to be

96
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
yet uh it's only going to be
 

97
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,150
yet uh it's only going to be
100 blocks of spawning space my old one

98
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
100 blocks of spawning space my old one
 

99
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,030
100 blocks of spawning space my old one
on chocolate island has about 500 blocks

100
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
on chocolate island has about 500 blocks
 

101
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,190
on chocolate island has about 500 blocks
of spawning space

102
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,200
of spawning space
 

103
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,390
of spawning space
so the new one's going to be

104
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
so the new one's going to be
 

105
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,470
so the new one's going to be
significantly smaller

106
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
significantly smaller
 

107
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,790
significantly smaller
which isn't a bad thing really

108
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800

 

109
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,630

we don't really need it as big because

110
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
we don't really need it as big because

here we have all the grass cleared i

here we have all the grass cleared i

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
think
 

115
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,670
think
pretty sure but on chocolate island we

116
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
pretty sure but on chocolate island we
 

117
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,550

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
never
 

119
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,350
never
cleared all the grass around the area so

120
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
cleared all the grass around the area so
 

121
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,750
cleared all the grass around the area so
in order to

122
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
in order to
 

123
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,790
in order to
keep the mob spawning

124
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
keep the mob spawning
 

125
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,910
keep the mob spawning
efficient there we needed larger

126
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
efficient there we needed larger
 

127
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,789
efficient there we needed larger
amount of space for them to spawn on

128
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799

 

129
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,589

and another thing about passive mobs

130
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
and another thing about passive mobs
 

131
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,229
and another thing about passive mobs
their cap is a lot lower than it is for

132
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
their cap is a lot lower than it is for
 

133
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,430
their cap is a lot lower than it is for
hostile mobs

134
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
hostile mobs
 

135
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,270

like i believe hostile mobs

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,630

is 70 i could be wrong i think passive

138
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
is 70 i could be wrong i think passive
 

139
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,190
is 70 i could be wrong i think passive
mobs

140
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
mobs
 

141
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,350

is about 25 i'm probably wrong about

142
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
is about 25 i'm probably wrong about
 

143
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,509
is about 25 i'm probably wrong about
that too though

144
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
that too though
 

145
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,390
that too though
so roughly let's say roughly about three

146
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
so roughly let's say roughly about three
 

147
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,830
so roughly let's say roughly about three
times less

148
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
times less
 

149
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,789
times less
is the cap so we really only need a

150
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
is the cap so we really only need a
 

151
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,830
is the cap so we really only need a
spawning system that's three times

152
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840

 

153
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,149

smaller

154
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
smaller
 

155
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,350
smaller
uh we're not going to reach

156
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
uh we're not going to reach
 

157
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,910
uh we're not going to reach
the cap nearly as likely

158
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920

 

159
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,670

so that's kind of why i'm making this

160
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
so that's kind of why i'm making this
 

161
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,550
so that's kind of why i'm making this
smaller

162
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560

 

163
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,670

and also uh like dot dm has one i think

164
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
and also uh like dot dm has one i think
 

165
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,670
and also uh like dot dm has one i think
it's a hundred and forty four blocks and

166
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
it's a hundred and forty four blocks and
 

167
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,830
it's a hundred and forty four blocks and
it seems to keep up no problem

168
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840

 

169
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:29,189

he only has four six by six pads

170
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
he only has four six by six pads
 

171
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,550
he only has four six by six pads
so i think this will work pretty good

172
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
so i think this will work pretty good
 

173
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,749
so i think this will work pretty good
and i have decided to do a diamond

174
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
and i have decided to do a diamond
 

175
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,030
and i have decided to do a diamond
uh pattern for the spawning pads instead

176
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
uh pattern for the spawning pads instead
 

177
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,230
uh pattern for the spawning pads instead
of square

178
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
of square
 

179
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,710
of square
so that we can uh flood the pads

180
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
so that we can uh flood the pads
 

181
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,629
so that we can uh flood the pads
some people were worried that flooding

182
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
some people were worried that flooding
 

183
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,909
some people were worried that flooding
them with water is going to kill the

184
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
them with water is going to kill the
 

185
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,830
them with water is going to kill the
grass

186
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
grass
 

187
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,990
grass
it's not an issue because i will have

188
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
it's not an issue because i will have
 

189
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,870
it's not an issue because i will have
enough lighting

190
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
enough lighting
 

191
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,430
enough lighting
so that the grass doesn't die even if

192
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
so that the grass doesn't die even if
 

193
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:04,340
so that the grass doesn't die even if
it's underwater

194
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:04,350

 

195
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,749

[Music]

196
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759

 

197
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,270

yeah that really stands out

198
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280

 

199
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,430

i wonder if it needs to be three wide

200
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
i wonder if it needs to be three wide
 

201
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,870
i wonder if it needs to be three wide
maybe too wide would have been good

202
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
maybe too wide would have been good
 

203
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,310
maybe too wide would have been good
enough

204
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320

 

205
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,590

okay well i'm going to finish this up

206
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
okay well i'm going to finish this up
 

207
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,590
okay well i'm going to finish this up
off camera so that we can actually start

208
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
off camera so that we can actually start
 

209
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,469
off camera so that we can actually start
our spawning pads this episode and then

210
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
our spawning pads this episode and then
 

211
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,830
our spawning pads this episode and then
i will be back

212
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840

 

213
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,430

yeah even this spiral grass structure i

214
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
yeah even this spiral grass structure i
 

215
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,270
yeah even this spiral grass structure i
have here keeps up with the

216
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
have here keeps up with the
 

217
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,150
have here keeps up with the
spawning passive mobs pretty good and

218
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
spawning passive mobs pretty good and
 

219
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,029
spawning passive mobs pretty good and
it's only about

220
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
it's only about
 

221
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,790
it's only about
50 spawnable places so my

222
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
50 spawnable places so my
 

223
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,710
50 spawnable places so my
pads are going to be twice that size and

224
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
pads are going to be twice that size and
 

225
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,070
pads are going to be twice that size and
also

226
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
also
 

227
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,350
also
this structure here is only in one chunk

228
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
this structure here is only in one chunk
 

229
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,390
this structure here is only in one chunk
and my pads will be in four different

230
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
and my pads will be in four different
 

231
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,590
and my pads will be in four different
chunks so every time the game tries to

232
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
chunks so every time the game tries to
 

233
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,110
chunks so every time the game tries to
place mobs

234
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
place mobs
 

235
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,950
place mobs
this structure here it only tries to

236
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
this structure here it only tries to
 

237
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,150
this structure here it only tries to
place them once

238
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
place them once
 

239
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,029
place them once
in my pads it'll try to place it four

240
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
in my pads it'll try to place it four
 

241
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,469
in my pads it'll try to place it four
times so

242
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
times so
 

243
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,710
times so
i should get way more mobs than i'm

244
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
i should get way more mobs than i'm
 

245
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,390
i should get way more mobs than i'm
getting over here

246
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
getting over here
 

247
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,189
getting over here
and over here is pretty good as it is so

248
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
and over here is pretty good as it is so
 

249
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,390
and over here is pretty good as it is so
my pads should be

250
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
my pads should be
 

251
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,469
my pads should be
really good even though they're pretty

252
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
really good even though they're pretty
 

253
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,950
really good even though they're pretty
small

254
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960

 

255
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,029

i ran out of wool but this is what we

256
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
i ran out of wool but this is what we
 

257
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,790
i ran out of wool but this is what we
got so far

258
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
got so far
 

259
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,150
got so far
don't know if i'll keep the snow in the

260
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
don't know if i'll keep the snow in the
 

261
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,629
don't know if i'll keep the snow in the
middle and this will

262
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
middle and this will
 

263
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,710
middle and this will
probably end up looping like connecting

264
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
probably end up looping like connecting
 

265
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,749
probably end up looping like connecting
to over here will be stairs either

266
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
to over here will be stairs either
 

267
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,110
to over here will be stairs either
up or down here and same with on this

268
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
up or down here and same with on this
 

269
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,350
up or down here and same with on this
side

270
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
side
 

271
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,270
side
i'm thinking i might have like my

272
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
i'm thinking i might have like my
 

273
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,909
i'm thinking i might have like my
controls for the spawning pads over here

274
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
controls for the spawning pads over here
 

275
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,350
controls for the spawning pads over here
i have a wall here with uh

276
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
i have a wall here with uh
 

277
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,390
i have a wall here with uh
the ability to turn

278
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400

 

279
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,710

like my passive mob farm on or off

280
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
like my passive mob farm on or off
 

281
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,110
like my passive mob farm on or off
hostile mob farms on or off lighting on

282
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
hostile mob farms on or off lighting on
 

283
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,870
hostile mob farms on or off lighting on
or off that type of thing

284
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
or off that type of thing
 

285
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,950
or off that type of thing
uh but yeah we're ready to start

286
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
uh but yeah we're ready to start
 

287
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,510
uh but yeah we're ready to start
building our pads i believe

288
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
building our pads i believe
 

289
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,270
building our pads i believe
this is where you don't want to make any

290
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
this is where you don't want to make any
 

291
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,110
this is where you don't want to make any
mistakes because this is a

292
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120

 

293
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,110

this is a pretty definite thing once you

294
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
this is a pretty definite thing once you
 

295
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,029
this is a pretty definite thing once you
start building it i do have a world back

296
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
start building it i do have a world back
 

297
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,189
start building it i do have a world back
up in case i need to

298
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
up in case i need to
 

299
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,870
up in case i need to
in case i change my mind about something

300
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
in case i change my mind about something
 

301
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,629
in case i change my mind about something
major

302
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639

 

303
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,670

okay so passive mobs are going to go on

304
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
okay so passive mobs are going to go on
 

305
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,309
okay so passive mobs are going to go on
this side

306
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
this side
 

307
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,350
this side
this is our center here these four soil

308
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
this is our center here these four soil
 

309
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,029
this is our center here these four soil
blocks i've marked

310
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039

 

311
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:36,230

i think i want to start here

312
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240

 

313
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,070

yeah okay so this is where

314
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
yeah okay so this is where
 

315
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,670
yeah okay so this is where
our center for the passive mob farm is

316
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
our center for the passive mob farm is
 

317
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,469
our center for the passive mob farm is
going to be

318
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
going to be
 

319
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,629
going to be
that's going to be based on an odd

320
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
that's going to be based on an odd
 

321
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,309
that's going to be based on an odd
number

322
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
number
 

323
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,070
number
instead of an even number so that's why

324
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
instead of an even number so that's why
 

325
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,589
instead of an even number so that's why
we're only choosing one

326
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
we're only choosing one
 

327
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,510
we're only choosing one
of these blocks instead of all four of

328
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
of these blocks instead of all four of
 

329
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,110
of these blocks instead of all four of
these

330
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
these
 

331
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,589
these
so this is our center for our past mop

332
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
so this is our center for our past mop
 

333
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,830
so this is our center for our past mop
firm

334
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
firm
 

335
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,350
firm
and we need to go up minimum

336
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
and we need to go up minimum
 

337
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,790
and we need to go up minimum
24 blocks so i'm going to write down our

338
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
24 blocks so i'm going to write down our
 

339
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,070
24 blocks so i'm going to write down our
y-coordinate 71

340
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
y-coordinate 71
 

341
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,350
y-coordinate 71
oh actually you know what the sun's

342
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
oh actually you know what the sun's
 

343
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,510
oh actually you know what the sun's
going down i'm going to skip

344
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
going down i'm going to skip
 

345
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,909
going down i'm going to skip
a day so that'll be light when we're

346
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
a day so that'll be light when we're
 

347
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,070
a day so that'll be light when we're
doing this

348
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080

 

349
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,950

okay here we go new day let's start

350
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
okay here we go new day let's start
 

351
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,309
okay here we go new day let's start
building

352
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
building
 

353
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,550
building
this is our center we're at 71 we're

354
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
this is our center we're at 71 we're
 

355
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,350
this is our center we're at 71 we're
going to go up

356
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
going to go up
 

357
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:39,430
going to go up
to 90.

358
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440

 

359
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,550

and two more okay at 90.

360
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
and two more okay at 90.
 

361
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,150
and two more okay at 90.
so our 20th block will be our ceiling

362
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160

 

363
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,509

probably make the ceiling out of snow

364
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
probably make the ceiling out of snow
 

365
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,150
probably make the ceiling out of snow
had a little bit of lag there

366
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160

 

367
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,070

make a little platform here kind of like

368
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080

 

369
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,829

oh i'm really lazy

370
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839

 

371
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,150

okay and

372
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160

 

373
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:27,670

i think i'll place water

374
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680

 

375
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,829

here we go

376
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:34,839

 

377
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,190

okay i hope that didn't wreck any

378
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
okay i hope that didn't wreck any
 

379
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:44,630
okay i hope that didn't wreck any
wiring oh crap it might have

380
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640

 

381
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,150

no because that snow is still intact

382
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
no because that snow is still intact
 

383
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,150
no because that snow is still intact
it's fine

384
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
it's fine
 

385
00:09:48,160 --> 00:10:00,550
it's fine
okay so we have a wave king up and down

386
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560

 

387
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,389

that is pretty high we need it to be at

388
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
that is pretty high we need it to be at
 

389
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,710
that is pretty high we need it to be at
least our spawning pads at least 24

390
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
least our spawning pads at least 24
 

391
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,269
least our spawning pads at least 24
blocks up

392
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
blocks up
 

393
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,389
blocks up
so this is going to be a huge room if if

394
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
so this is going to be a huge room if if
 

395
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:19,190
so this is going to be a huge room if if
that's the ceiling for it

396
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
that's the ceiling for it
 

397
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,350
that's the ceiling for it
should be pretty cool

398
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360

 

399
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,230

okay so we have our platform here on

400
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
okay so we have our platform here on
 

401
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,350
okay so we have our platform here on
this level here we'll be doing

402
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
this level here we'll be doing
 

403
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,910
this level here we'll be doing
kind of the mob sorting and stuff out of

404
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
kind of the mob sorting and stuff out of
 

405
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,870
kind of the mob sorting and stuff out of
sight

406
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880

 

407
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,150

so like the pigs the chickens the cows

408
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
so like the pigs the chickens the cows
 

409
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,870
so like the pigs the chickens the cows
the sheep will fall

410
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
the sheep will fall
 

411
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,030
the sheep will fall
down here and then they'll go through

412
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
down here and then they'll go through
 

413
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,269
down here and then they'll go through
some pipes which will sort them into

414
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
some pipes which will sort them into
 

415
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,110
some pipes which will sort them into
their individual

416
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
their individual
 

417
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,630
their individual
chambers there it's a plan the actual

418
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
chambers there it's a plan the actual
 

419
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,829
chambers there it's a plan the actual
spawning pads will be a little bit

420
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839

 

421
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,069

higher

422
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
higher
 

423
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,190
higher
this is our center uh we're gonna make

424
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
this is our center uh we're gonna make
 

425
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,750
this is our center uh we're gonna make
this

426
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
this
 

427
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,030
this
sorting room i think five blocks

428
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
sorting room i think five blocks
 

429
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,310
sorting room i think five blocks
then the sixth block will be our

430
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
then the sixth block will be our
 

431
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,750
then the sixth block will be our
start of our spawning pad

432
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:13,760
start of our spawning pad
 

433
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,470
start of our spawning pad
system and we'll probably build it out

434
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
system and we'll probably build it out
 

435
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,790
system and we'll probably build it out
of cobblestone just because it's cheap

436
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800

 

437
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,829

and we will go to

438
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839

 

439
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:36,389

three

440
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399

 

441
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,870

okay so this is our center don't want to

442
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
okay so this is our center don't want to
 

443
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:48,310
okay so this is our center don't want to
lose sight of our center

444
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320

 

445
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,550

wow

446
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560

 

447
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,990

okay uh we're gonna make our opening

448
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
okay uh we're gonna make our opening
 

449
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,069
okay uh we're gonna make our opening
three long like this so that mobs don't

450
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
three long like this so that mobs don't
 

451
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,069
three long like this so that mobs don't
get stuck

452
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
get stuck
 

453
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,310
get stuck
going down the hole this is a hole for

454
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
going down the hole this is a hole for
 

455
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,269
going down the hole this is a hole for
them to fall down

456
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279

 

457
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,750

and we will extend this

458
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
and we will extend this
 

459
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,230
and we will extend this
a fair bit

460
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240

 

461
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,990

i think we need to make each of the

462
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
i think we need to make each of the
 

463
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,829
i think we need to make each of the
sides about seven

464
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839
sides about seven
 

465
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,110
sides about seven
long

466
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120

 

467
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,710

or so

468
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720

 

469
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,230

i don't know exactly how i'm doing this

470
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
i don't know exactly how i'm doing this
 

471
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,230
i don't know exactly how i'm doing this
i just have a pretty

472
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
i just have a pretty
 

473
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,550
i just have a pretty
pretty decent idea in my head

474
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
pretty decent idea in my head
 

475
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,870
pretty decent idea in my head
okay so i think we're above the blue

476
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
okay so i think we're above the blue
 

477
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,069
okay so i think we're above the blue
wool right now

478
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
wool right now
 

479
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:50,829
wool right now
so let's go that far on the other side

480
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839

 

481
00:12:50,839 --> 00:13:00,550

here

482
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560

 

483
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,230

okay and then we will

484
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
okay and then we will
 

485
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,990
okay and then we will
line this

486
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000

 

487
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,509

brought lots of cobblestone with me

488
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
brought lots of cobblestone with me
 

489
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,509
brought lots of cobblestone with me
because i figured we would be using a

490
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
because i figured we would be using a
 

491
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,590
because i figured we would be using a
lot on this

492
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
lot on this
 

493
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,110
lot on this
okay good

494
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120

 

495
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,470

um one

496
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
um one
 

497
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,389
um one
two three four five six

498
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
two three four five six
 

499
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,269
two three four five six
we probably want this eight long

500
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279

 

501
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:39,670

seven

502
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
seven
 

503
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,829
seven

507
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,750

and there'll be a water stream here

508
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
and there'll be a water stream here
 

509
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,110
and there'll be a water stream here
flowing right to the end and same with

510
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
flowing right to the end and same with
 

511
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,470
flowing right to the end and same with
on the other side

512
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
on the other side
 

513
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,389
on the other side
one two three four five six

521
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,829

eights and

522
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
eights and
 

523
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,750
eights and
that should do it

524
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:21,760

 

525
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,629

okay so we'll have a water stream there

526
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:24,639
okay so we'll have a water stream there
 

527
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,550
okay so we'll have a water stream there
we're gonna get rid of this for now

528
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
we're gonna get rid of this for now
 

529
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,750
we're gonna get rid of this for now
and now i just need to make a huge

530
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760
and now i just need to make a huge
 

531
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,030
and now i just need to make a huge
flat ground section here that'll go

532
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
flat ground section here that'll go
 

533
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,790
flat ground section here that'll go
see one two

534
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
see one two
 

535
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,150
see one two
three four five six

536
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
three four five six
 

537
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,430
three four five six
seven eight nine

538
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440

 

539
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,829

i thought i saw a sheep on our

540
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:55,839
i thought i saw a sheep on our
 

541
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:14,550
i thought i saw a sheep on our
cobblestone here but he's on the spiral

542
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560

 

543
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,910

so we're going to connect this to the

544
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
so we're going to connect this to the
 

545
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,910
so we're going to connect this to the
other side and we're going to have water

546
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:17,920
other side and we're going to have water
 

547
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,949
other side and we're going to have water
streams

548
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
streams
 

549
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,990
streams
on this

550
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000

 

551
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,230

we don't want to use my other style with

552
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,240
we don't want to use my other style with
 

553
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,590
we don't want to use my other style with
this

554
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
this
 

555
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,990
this
the no dead zone trick using the stairs

556
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
the no dead zone trick using the stairs
 

557
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,949
the no dead zone trick using the stairs
because uh chickens get stuck in stairs

558
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
because uh chickens get stuck in stairs
 

559
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,269
because uh chickens get stuck in stairs
so we have to do something else with

560
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
so we have to do something else with
 

561
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,110
so we have to do something else with
this system

562
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
this system
 

563
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,629
this system
so i'm going to fill this in and i'm

564
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
so i'm going to fill this in and i'm
 

565
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,470
so i'm going to fill this in and i'm
going to make an exact copy on the other

566
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
going to make an exact copy on the other
 

567
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,949
going to make an exact copy on the other
side and then we will be back

568
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959

 

569
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,590

so i did that i filled it all in

570
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600

 

571
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,910

so now we've got a big flat surface here

572
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:53,920
so now we've got a big flat surface here
 

573
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,269
so now we've got a big flat surface here
to work with and we're going to put a

574
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
to work with and we're going to put a
 

575
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,629
to work with and we're going to put a
border all around this

576
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639

 

577
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,629

this is to hold water in place

578
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
this is to hold water in place
 

579
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:16,629
this is to hold water in place
that we're going to place soon

580
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639

 

581
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,389

it's pretty simple with this new system

582
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:20,399
it's pretty simple with this new system
 

583
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,269
it's pretty simple with this new system
there's going to be almost no signs used

584
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
there's going to be almost no signs used
 

585
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,470
there's going to be almost no signs used
for uh

586
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
for uh
 

587
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,189
for uh
controlling the water which is good in

588
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
controlling the water which is good in
 

589
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,030
controlling the water which is good in
case that notch ever

590
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
case that notch ever
 

591
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,069
case that notch ever
changes that favor makes it so signs

592
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,079
changes that favor makes it so signs
 

593
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,829
changes that favor makes it so signs
can't hold water back

594
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:33,839
can't hold water back
 

595
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,389
can't hold water back
this thing should still work okay

596
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399

 

597
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,790

not that i'm too worried about that

598
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800

 

599
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,870

okay i'm gonna make a water pool here

600
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880

 

601
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,110

yeah so we'll have water here

602
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120

 

603
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,310

it ends over there right at the edge

604
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:56,320
it ends over there right at the edge
 

605
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,749
it ends over there right at the edge
because it only flows eight blocks

606
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
because it only flows eight blocks
 

607
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,550
because it only flows eight blocks
maximum

608
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560

 

609
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,429

one two three four five six seven eight

610
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
one two three four five six seven eight
 

611
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:11,029
one two three four five six seven eight
okay and then for uh

612
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039

 

613
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,590

these side things we made they'll be

614
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
these side things we made they'll be
 

615
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,510
these side things we made they'll be
water placed all along this

616
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
water placed all along this
 

617
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:24,789
water placed all along this
back wall here

618
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799

 

619
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,909

all the way down and that ends

620
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
all the way down and that ends
 

621
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,669
all the way down and that ends
right at the edge as well so the mobs

622
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
right at the edge as well so the mobs
 

623
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,870
right at the edge as well so the mobs
will flow

624
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
will flow
 

625
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,230
will flow
straight down they'll fall into this

626
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
straight down they'll fall into this
 

627
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,789
straight down they'll fall into this
stream they'll flow this way

628
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
stream they'll flow this way
 

629
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,630
stream they'll flow this way
and they'll fall down this three wide

630
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
and they'll fall down this three wide
 

631
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,029
and they'll fall down this three wide
hole here it's three wide so that they

632
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,039
hole here it's three wide so that they
 

633
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,390
hole here it's three wide so that they
don't

634
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
don't
 

635
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,150
don't
clump up and prevent each other from

636
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
clump up and prevent each other from
 

637
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,190
clump up and prevent each other from
falling down

638
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200

 

639
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,029

uh but we're gonna wait on doing that

640
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,039
uh but we're gonna wait on doing that
 

641
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,830
uh but we're gonna wait on doing that
just a little bit oh yeah i gotta

642
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
just a little bit oh yeah i gotta
 

643
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,870
just a little bit oh yeah i gotta
remember to cover this

644
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
remember to cover this
 

645
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,230
remember to cover this
otherwise it's gonna freeze too oh

646
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
otherwise it's gonna freeze too oh
 

647
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,950
otherwise it's gonna freeze too oh
like

648
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960

 

649
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,990

okay uh

650
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,000

 

651
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,270

so i suppose the next thing we're gonna

652
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
so i suppose the next thing we're gonna
 

653
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,710
so i suppose the next thing we're gonna
do is build our spawning pads we're

654
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
do is build our spawning pads we're
 

655
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,950
do is build our spawning pads we're
gonna have four

656
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
gonna have four
 

657
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,830
gonna have four
um four spawning pads are gonna be

658
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
um four spawning pads are gonna be
 

659
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,750
um four spawning pads are gonna be
diamond shaped

660
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760
diamond shaped
 

661
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,750
diamond shaped
with a base of seven

662
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:21,760

 

663
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,549

so wow this game is really lightning bad

664
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
so wow this game is really lightning bad
 

665
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,310
so wow this game is really lightning bad
two three would be seven

666
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
two three would be seven
 

667
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,590
two three would be seven
here would be

668
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600

 

669
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,110

the start i believe so

670
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
the start i believe so
 

671
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,470
the start i believe so
diagonally from this corner is one two

672
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
diagonally from this corner is one two
 

673
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,750
diagonally from this corner is one two
three four blocks it's the fifth block

674
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
three four blocks it's the fifth block
 

675
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,070
three four blocks it's the fifth block
and we want it three off the ground

676
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
and we want it three off the ground
 

677
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,110
and we want it three off the ground
that's the center of one of our diamonds

678
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120

 

679
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,789

and it'll come out uh one two

680
00:18:58,789 --> 00:18:58,799
and it'll come out uh one two
 

681
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,070
and it'll come out uh one two
three

682
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080

 

683
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,470

two three

684
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480

 

685
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,669

each of these pads has 25

686
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
each of these pads has 25
 

687
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,470
each of these pads has 25
spawnable blocks on

688
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,480

 

689
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,830

and since there's four we'll have a

690
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
and since there's four we'll have a
 

691
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,750
and since there's four we'll have a
hundred total

692
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:23,760

 

693
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,630

because 1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 7 plus 5

694
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
because 1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 7 plus 5
 

695
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,909
because 1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 7 plus 5
plus 3 plus 1

696
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:27,919
plus 3 plus 1
 

697
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,190
plus 3 plus 1
is 25 the total

698
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
is 25 the total
 

699
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,150
is 25 the total
and we can shut it off by dropping water

700
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
and we can shut it off by dropping water
 

701
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:41,029
and we can shut it off by dropping water
right here

702
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039

 

703
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,710

okay so i'm gonna build three more of

704
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720
okay so i'm gonna build three more of
 

705
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,350
okay so i'm gonna build three more of
these and then i will see you

706
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,360
these and then i will see you
 

707
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,110
these and then i will see you
after that's done

708
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,120

 

709
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,029

the spawning pads are done they did not

710
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
the spawning pads are done they did not
 

711
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,789
the spawning pads are done they did not
take long to build

712
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
take long to build
 

713
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,750
take long to build
they're very simple but now before we

714
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
they're very simple but now before we
 

715
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,110
they're very simple but now before we
look at them we want to

716
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
look at them we want to
 

717
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,150
look at them we want to
get a grass block to them so we're on

718
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,160
get a grass block to them so we're on
 

719
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,870
get a grass block to them so we're on
our spiral tower here

720
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:02,880
our spiral tower here
 

721
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,950
our spiral tower here
and as many people suggested i can just

722
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:04,960
and as many people suggested i can just
 

723
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,990
and as many people suggested i can just
use pistons to

724
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
use pistons to
 

725
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,350
use pistons to
move the grass

726
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360

 

727
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,870

hopefully

728
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880

 

729
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,990

there we go

730
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000

 

731
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:26,870

so we're going to move this upward first

732
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880

 

733
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:34,070

and we will fill in with more soil

734
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,080
and we will fill in with more soil
 

735
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:43,190
and we will fill in with more soil
get the height we want about

736
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200

 

737
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,110

um yeah it's good i think

738
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
um yeah it's good i think
 

739
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:55,830
um yeah it's good i think
and now we want to move it sideways

740
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:55,840

 

741
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,149

and we'll steal our lever back

742
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:00,159

 

743
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,870

now one thing about the spawning pads

744
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
now one thing about the spawning pads
 

745
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,029
now one thing about the spawning pads
minor diamond shape that's just because

746
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:05,039
minor diamond shape that's just because
 

747
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,909
minor diamond shape that's just because
i want to be able to

748
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
i want to be able to
 

749
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,990
i want to be able to
oops wrong level

750
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000

 

751
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,470

that's just so i want i'll be able to

752
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,480
that's just so i want i'll be able to
 

753
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,630
that's just so i want i'll be able to
easily turn

754
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,640
easily turn
 

755
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,830
easily turn
passive mob spawning on or off really

756
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
passive mob spawning on or off really
 

757
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,870
passive mob spawning on or off really
though

758
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
though
 

759
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,909
though
you probably don't need that feature

760
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919
you probably don't need that feature
 

761
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,669
you probably don't need that feature
i don't even really need it i just want

762
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679
i don't even really need it i just want
 

763
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,510
i don't even really need it i just want
it as a just in case

764
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520

 

765
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,390

and if i ever need to do testing i want

766
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
and if i ever need to do testing i want
 

767
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,710
and if i ever need to do testing i want
to have that feature

768
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
to have that feature
 

769
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,870
to have that feature
like if if notch decides he wants to put

770
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
like if if notch decides he wants to put
 

771
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,149
like if if notch decides he wants to put
all the hostile mobs and passive mobs

772
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
all the hostile mobs and passive mobs
 

773
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,830
all the hostile mobs and passive mobs
if he wants them all to share the same

774
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:43,840
if he wants them all to share the same
 

775
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,750
if he wants them all to share the same
spawning cap then

776
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:45,760
spawning cap then
 

777
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,909
spawning cap then
i may want to be able to turn passive

778
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
i may want to be able to turn passive
 

779
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,110
i may want to be able to turn passive
mob spawning off

780
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120

 

781
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,789

but at the moment there's really no

782
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:52,799
but at the moment there's really no
 

783
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,590
but at the moment there's really no
point to it

784
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,600

 

785
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,310

so yeah you probably don't need to make

786
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
so yeah you probably don't need to make
 

787
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,750
so yeah you probably don't need to make
yours diamond shaped if you're going to

788
00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
yours diamond shaped if you're going to
 

789
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,710
yours diamond shaped if you're going to
copy me you could

790
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
copy me you could
 

791
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,950
copy me you could
probably just do a square

792
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960

 

793
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,870

it would be more space efficient if you

794
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:06,880
it would be more space efficient if you
 

795
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:16,470
it would be more space efficient if you
do a square

796
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480

 

797
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,990

not that it matters much because i'm

798
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
not that it matters much because i'm
 

799
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,830
not that it matters much because i'm
pretty sure a hundred uh

800
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:21,840

 

801
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,390

100 spawning spots is going to be plenty

802
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
100 spawning spots is going to be plenty
 

803
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,669
100 spawning spots is going to be plenty
and

804
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679
and
 

805
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,950
and
that's the limit and there's plenty of

806
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:28,960
that's the limit and there's plenty of
 

807
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,230
that's the limit and there's plenty of
space in minecraft for you to build

808
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,240
space in minecraft for you to build
 

809
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,110
space in minecraft for you to build
for you to waste space with the diamond

810
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,120
for you to waste space with the diamond
 

811
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:46,230
for you to waste space with the diamond
shape stuff

812
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,240

 

813
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,350

oops yeah go here put another one down

814
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,360
oops yeah go here put another one down
 

815
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,110
oops yeah go here put another one down
ah darn it there i didn't give it to me

816
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,120
ah darn it there i didn't give it to me
 

817
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:02,230
ah darn it there i didn't give it to me
either

818
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240

 

819
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:20,870

last one

820
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880

 

821
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,710

and we're about there i'd say

822
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:26,720

 

823
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,470

uh we want to move it two more blocks i

824
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
uh we want to move it two more blocks i
 

825
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,830
uh we want to move it two more blocks i
suppose

826
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:34,840

 

827
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,510

good
 

829
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,430
good
okay uh maybe we'll just let it spread

830
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:39,440
okay uh maybe we'll just let it spread
 

831
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,870
okay uh maybe we'll just let it spread
the rest of the way

832
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880

 

833
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:49,750

i'll go out of the soil

834
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,760

 

835
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,430

i have our water set up on the sides

836
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
i have our water set up on the sides
 

837
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,940
i have our water set up on the sides
here and ice form

838
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:52,950
here and ice form
 

839
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:59,110
here and ice form
[Applause]

840
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,120

 

841
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:08,630

and we will disconnect this

842
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640

 

843
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,990

good okay so that grass will spread to

844
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
good okay so that grass will spread to
 

845
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,350
good okay so that grass will spread to
our diamonds here

846
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
our diamonds here
 

847
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,990
our diamonds here
uh when this is all done i'm gonna cut

848
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
uh when this is all done i'm gonna cut
 

849
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,789
uh when this is all done i'm gonna cut
out this

850
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
out this
 

851
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,190
out this
connecting piece to all of them

852
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,200

 

853
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,029

and the mother should spawn on these and

854
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,039
and the mother should spawn on these and
 

855
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,789
and the mother should spawn on these and
they'll fall off and

856
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:24,799
they'll fall off and
 

857
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,350
they'll fall off and
to our water here and since it's only a

858
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360
to our water here and since it's only a
 

859
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,789
to our water here and since it's only a
one

860
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:28,799
one
 

861
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,510
one
two three block drop they'll freely walk

862
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
two three block drop they'll freely walk
 

863
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,710
two three block drop they'll freely walk
off

864
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:32,720
off
 

865
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,870
off
mobs will freely walk off any spawning

866
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:34,880
mobs will freely walk off any spawning
 

867
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,269
mobs will freely walk off any spawning
pad that's within

868
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:37,279
pad that's within
 

869
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,149
pad that's within
three and a half blocks drop this one's

870
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:40,159
three and a half blocks drop this one's
 

871
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,830
three and a half blocks drop this one's
a three

872
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:44,840

 

873
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,269

yeah so that should be good the only

874
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:47,279
yeah so that should be good the only
 

875
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,190
yeah so that should be good the only
place they won't walk off is if they try

876
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,200
place they won't walk off is if they try
 

877
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,870
place they won't walk off is if they try
to fall down

878
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:50,880
to fall down
 

879
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,950
to fall down
if they were going to walk off into this

880
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
if they were going to walk off into this
 

881
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,110
if they were going to walk off into this
lower part here in the center

882
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
lower part here in the center
 

883
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,350
lower part here in the center
it's too far down for them to fall

884
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,360
it's too far down for them to fall
 

885
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,950
it's too far down for them to fall
all right so i'm going to clean up a

886
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:02,960
all right so i'm going to clean up a
 

887
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,789
all right so i'm going to clean up a
little bit here and i'll see you

888
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
little bit here and i'll see you
 

889
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,390
little bit here and i'll see you
in a little bit

890
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400

 

891
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,350

i went to remove that spiral grass tower

892
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,360
i went to remove that spiral grass tower
 

893
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,830
i went to remove that spiral grass tower
and when i was down on the ground

894
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:13,840
and when i was down on the ground
 

895
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,230
and when i was down on the ground
this one little grass block spawned the

896
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
this one little grass block spawned the
 

897
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,830
this one little grass block spawned the
sheep

898
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:17,840
sheep
 

899
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,909
sheep
so it's working

900
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919

 

901
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,669

oh yeah and i fell down and died that

902
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
oh yeah and i fell down and died that
 

903
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,070
oh yeah and i fell down and died that
kind of sucked

904
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,080
kind of sucked
 

905
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,590
kind of sucked
i'm glad you missed that uh

906
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:31,600
i'm glad you missed that uh
 

907
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,350
i'm glad you missed that uh
so we are just waiting for the giraffes

908
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
so we are just waiting for the giraffes
 

909
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,430
so we are just waiting for the giraffes
to spread now

910
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:37,440

 

911
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,029

uh we need to set up

912
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:41,039
uh we need to set up
 

913
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,029
uh we need to set up
our water shut offs above

914
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039
our water shut offs above
 

915
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,350
our water shut offs above
the center point on each of these

916
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,360
the center point on each of these
 

917
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,070
the center point on each of these
spawning pads i may

918
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
spawning pads i may
 

919
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,549
spawning pads i may
make the ceiling in here only too high

920
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
make the ceiling in here only too high
 

921
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,230
make the ceiling in here only too high
above the pads

922
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:56,240
above the pads
 

923
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,950
above the pads
uh underneath these pads there's a too

924
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:58,960
uh underneath these pads there's a too
 

925
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,950
uh underneath these pads there's a too
high clearance so

926
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:00,960
high clearance so
 

927
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,230
high clearance so
even if a mob falls off let's say

928
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,240
even if a mob falls off let's say
 

929
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,149
even if a mob falls off let's say
over here the water will push him under

930
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:08,159
over here the water will push him under
 

931
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,549
over here the water will push him under
and he can swim underneath the pads here

932
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
and he can swim underneath the pads here
 

933
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,470
and he can swim underneath the pads here
to this point

934
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:12,480
to this point
 

935
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,149
to this point
and then he'll go this way so

936
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
and then he'll go this way so
 

937
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,950
and then he'll go this way so
very simple water setup i may play

938
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960
very simple water setup i may play
 

939
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,789
very simple water setup i may play
around with the water stream to try make

940
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:20,799
around with the water stream to try make
 

941
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,350
around with the water stream to try make
a

942
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:21,360
a
 

943
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,590
a
diagonal flow so it pushes more towards

944
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600
diagonal flow so it pushes more towards
 

945
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,029
diagonal flow so it pushes more towards
the center instead of

946
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
the center instead of
 

947
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,630
the center instead of
straight here i don't know why my game

948
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:28,640
straight here i don't know why my game
 

949
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,190
straight here i don't know why my game
is so lady today

950
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,200
is so lady today
 

951
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,630
is so lady today
i probably need to do a computer reboot

952
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
i probably need to do a computer reboot
 

953
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,750
i probably need to do a computer reboot
um yeah maybe we'll

954
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:41,760
um yeah maybe we'll
 

955
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,070
um yeah maybe we'll
end it here episodes long

956
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,080

 

957
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,549

ah come on

958
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:50,559

 

959
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,070

so i'll expand this floor out

960
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,080
so i'll expand this floor out
 

961
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,029
so i'll expand this floor out
and it will come down

962
00:26:59,029 --> 00:26:59,039

 

963
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,310

and there'll be walls behind my emp

964
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,320
and there'll be walls behind my emp
 

965
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,590
and there'll be walls behind my emp
units probably

966
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:03,600
units probably
 

967
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,909
units probably
that go all the way up to that snow

968
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:05,919
that go all the way up to that snow
 

969
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,350
that go all the way up to that snow
there

970
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360

 

971
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,430

and now it's dark underneath here so we

972
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
and now it's dark underneath here so we
 

973
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,669
and now it's dark underneath here so we
need lighting of course

974
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
need lighting of course
 

975
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,950
need lighting of course
and uh i may

976
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:16,960
and uh i may
 

977
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,029
and uh i may
have a blue stripe running around

978
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:21,039
have a blue stripe running around
 

979
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,590
have a blue stripe running around
somewhere like at this level here like

980
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:23,600
somewhere like at this level here like
 

981
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,669
somewhere like at this level here like
where the glass block is

982
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:25,679
where the glass block is
 

983
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,669
where the glass block is
a blue or green stripe running around

984
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:27,679
a blue or green stripe running around
 

985
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,230
a blue or green stripe running around
these emp units as well

986
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240
these emp units as well
 

987
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,669
these emp units as well
just to bounce out the look

988
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:33,679
just to bounce out the look
 

989
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,430
just to bounce out the look
and we should make sure these things are

990
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:35,440
and we should make sure these things are
 

991
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,430
and we should make sure these things are
working

992
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:41,440

 

993
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:48,470

what was that oh

994
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:48,480
what was that oh
 

995
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,990
what was that oh
oh you know how i should wire these

996
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,000
oh you know how i should wire these
 

997
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,669
oh you know how i should wire these
actually

998
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679

 

999
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,870

yeah i just thought of something here

1000
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:58,880
yeah i just thought of something here
 

1001
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,909
yeah i just thought of something here
if this bottom glass block is up this

1002
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:01,919
if this bottom glass block is up this
 

1003
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,110
if this bottom glass block is up this
shouldn't open

1004
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,120
shouldn't open
 

1005
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,830
shouldn't open
if the water is on because the water is

1006
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:05,840
if the water is on because the water is
 

1007
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,269
if the water is on because the water is
not flowing here anyway

1008
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:09,279

 

1009
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,430

so i may look into changing that yet

1010
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,440

 

1011
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,950

oh one of my levers is gone

1012
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960
oh one of my levers is gone
 

1013
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,269
oh one of my levers is gone
i wonder how that happened it's probably

1014
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:19,279
i wonder how that happened it's probably
 

1015
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,789
i wonder how that happened it's probably
when water flowed

1016
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:20,799
when water flowed
 

1017
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:29,190
when water flowed
when i let that water go down here

1018
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:29,200

 

1019
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:38,070

yep seems to be working okay

1020
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,080

 

1021
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,870

all right well i think that's it for

1022
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:40,880
all right well i think that's it for
 

1023
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,950
all right well i think that's it for
today next episode we'll probably work

1024
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:42,960
today next episode we'll probably work
 

1025
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,990
today next episode we'll probably work
on the passive mob sorting

1026
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,000
on the passive mob sorting
 

1027
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,350
on the passive mob sorting
on that snow level there and by that

1028
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,360
on that snow level there and by that
 

1029
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,950
on that snow level there and by that
time the grass i'll probably all the

1030
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:50,960
time the grass i'll probably all the
 

1031
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,470
time the grass i'll probably all the
grass spread

1032
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,480
grass spread
 

1033
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,110
grass spread
and i might work on setting up the water

1034
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,120
and i might work on setting up the water
 

1035
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,549
and i might work on setting up the water
shutoffs

1036
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:56,559
shutoffs
 

1037
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,110
shutoffs
we'll see that's it for today thanks for

1038
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,120
we'll see that's it for today thanks for
 

1039
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,669
we'll see that's it for today thanks for
watching

1040
00:28:59,669 --> 00:28:59,679
watching
 

1041
