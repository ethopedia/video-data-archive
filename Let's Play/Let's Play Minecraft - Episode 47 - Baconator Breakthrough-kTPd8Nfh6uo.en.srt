00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:53,789
you is not complete still making lots of
 

29
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,700
you is not complete still making lots of
tweaks to it and there's still a few

30
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:58,710
tweaks to it and there's still a few
 

31
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:07,850
tweaks to it and there's still a few
flaws but the mob system is just about

32
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:07,860
flaws but the mob system is just about
 

33
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:17,580
flaws but the mob system is just about
complete here

34
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:17,590

 

35
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,020

all right so I should probably explain

36
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,030
all right so I should probably explain
 

37
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,999
all right so I should probably explain
how this is all working because they

38
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:25,009
how this is all working because they
 

39
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:27,520
how this is all working because they
kind of got ahead of you guys quite a

40

kind of got ahead of you guys quite a
 

41
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,480
kind of got ahead of you guys quite a
bit here but I was having trouble

42
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:31,490
bit here but I was having trouble
 

43
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,419
bit here but I was having trouble
building this so when I have been very

44
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:34,429
building this so when I have been very
 

45
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:41,710
building this so when I have been very
interesting to watch okay so what I'm

gonna do
you'll notice there's no real numbers

50
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:45,259
you'll notice there's no real numbers
 

51
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,199
you'll notice there's no real numbers
above us and the spawning pads there's

52
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:47,209
above us and the spawning pads there's
 

53
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:55,919
above us and the spawning pads there's
not a whole lot of mobs I back away

54
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:55,929

 

55
00:01:55,929 --> 00:02:05,820

instantly we got like ten mobs up there

56
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:05,830

 

57
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,289

and we're gonna get into that a little

58
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:08,299
and we're gonna get into that a little
 

59
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:16,740
and we're gonna get into that a little
bit later oh darn it

pig separator working like perfect now I

66
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:33,859
pig separator working like perfect now I
 

67
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:40,420
pig separator working like perfect now I
don't think it'd be made much better I'm

68
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,430
don't think it'd be made much better I'm
 

69
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,920
don't think it'd be made much better I'm
calling it the bacon eater

70
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:46,930

 

71
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,670

Lucas died here

72
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:48,680
Lucas died here
 

73
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,869
Lucas died here
bacon drops goes down the stream goes it

74
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
bacon drops goes down the stream goes it
 

75
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:01,809
bacon drops goes down the stream goes it
goes over one of these doors you open

76
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:01,819
goes over one of these doors you open
 

77
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:04,240
goes over one of these doors you open
the door the bacon falls down that's how

78
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,250
the door the bacon falls down that's how
 

79
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,699
the door the bacon falls down that's how
you control whether it enters the system

80
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:06,709
you control whether it enters the system
 

81
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:13,089
you control whether it enters the system
or not the collection point so what's

82
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:13,099
or not the collection point so what's
 

83
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:22,179
or not the collection point so what's
the trick how did I get the story might

84
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:22,189
the trick how did I get the story might
 

85
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:27,940
the trick how did I get the story might
be a little bit hard to see so we're

86
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:27,950
be a little bit hard to see so we're
 

87
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:39,159
be a little bit hard to see so we're
actually gonna go inside out so the

88
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:39,169
actually gonna go inside out so the
 

89
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:44,530
actually gonna go inside out so the
trick is last episode you'll you'll know

90
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:44,540
trick is last episode you'll you'll know
 

91
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,869
trick is last episode you'll you'll know
you might remember I had the stream on

92
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
you might remember I had the stream on
 

93
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,039
you might remember I had the stream on
the ground and I realized that the trick

94
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,049
the ground and I realized that the trick
 

95
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:54,899
the ground and I realized that the trick
is just to have the diagonal stream

96
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:54,909
is just to have the diagonal stream
 

97
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:58,360
is just to have the diagonal stream
above the ground one block above I have

98
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,370
above the ground one block above I have
 

99
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:04,809
above the ground one block above I have
it set on top of these half blocks and I

100
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:04,819
it set on top of these half blocks and I
 

101
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,369
it set on top of these half blocks and I
can't really go in there because they're

102
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:06,379
can't really go in there because they're
 

103
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,649
can't really go in there because they're
in the way but the stream pushes them to

104
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:08,659
in the way but the stream pushes them to
 

105
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:10,539
in the way but the stream pushes them to
the left there's a one block high

106
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:10,549
the left there's a one block high
 

107
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:21,480
the left there's a one block high
opening here

108
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,490

 

109
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,140

and so they jump up they swim to the top

110
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,150
and so they jump up they swim to the top
 

111
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,170
and so they jump up they swim to the top
diagonal screen pushes them and they get

112
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:29,180
diagonal screen pushes them and they get
 

113
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,210
diagonal screen pushes them and they get
pushed into here and then there's like a

114
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,220
pushed into here and then there's like a
 

115
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,040
pushed into here and then there's like a
staircase thing that brings them up

116
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,050
staircase thing that brings them up
 

117
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:42,700
staircase thing that brings them up
higher and then I have kind of similar

118
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:42,710
higher and then I have kind of similar
 

119
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:50,780
higher and then I have kind of similar
to a lava bleed

120
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:50,790

 

121
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,930

and any non Pig thing keeps going and it

122
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:56,940
and any non Pig thing keeps going and it
 

123
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:04,760
and any non Pig thing keeps going and it
falls okay so we go down here the sheep

124
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:04,770
falls okay so we go down here the sheep
 

125
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,870
falls okay so we go down here the sheep
and the cows they fall down here they

126
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
and the cows they fall down here they
 

127
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,090
and the cows they fall down here they
get sucked up to here there's a little

128
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,100
get sucked up to here there's a little
 

129
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,290
get sucked up to here there's a little
bit of an indent here which with a

130
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:18,300
bit of an indent here which with a
 

131
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,700
bit of an indent here which with a
stream that pushes them against this

132
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:19,710
stream that pushes them against this
 

133
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,050
stream that pushes them against this
wall they swim up into here and we come

134
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,060
wall they swim up into here and we come
 

135
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,270
wall they swim up into here and we come
across a special door junction I

136
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,280
across a special door junction I
 

137
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,910
across a special door junction I
invented the door is open they fall down

138
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:31,920
invented the door is open they fall down
 

139
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,880
invented the door is open they fall down
if it's closed they go across the stream

140
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:34,890
if it's closed they go across the stream
 

141
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:43,400
if it's closed they go across the stream
I mean now and there's a ladder on the

142
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,410
I mean now and there's a ladder on the
 

143
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,790
I mean now and there's a ladder on the
other side of this I basically realized

144
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
other side of this I basically realized
 

145
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:57,680
other side of this I basically realized
that cows sheep and pigs cannot fit you

146
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:57,690
that cows sheep and pigs cannot fit you
 

147
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,590
that cows sheep and pigs cannot fit you
got a block here a ladder another block

148
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:00,600
got a block here a ladder another block
 

149
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,900
got a block here a ladder another block
they won't be able to fit into the space

150
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:02,910
they won't be able to fit into the space
 

151
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,710
they won't be able to fit into the space
here they're too fat same if you have a

152
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
here they're too fat same if you have a
 

153
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,930
here they're too fat same if you have a
door over here they won't be able to fit

154
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:08,940
door over here they won't be able to fit
 

155
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,600
door over here they won't be able to fit
so I wasn't able to do the mob junctions

156
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:14,610
so I wasn't able to do the mob junctions
 

157
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,850
so I wasn't able to do the mob junctions
like I've been doing with the tall

158
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:16,860
like I've been doing with the tall
 

159
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,030
like I've been doing with the tall
hostile mobs so I had to invent this

160
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,040
hostile mobs so I had to invent this
 

161
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,269
hostile mobs so I had to invent this
other type of Junction

162
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:26,279
other type of Junction
 

163
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:34,219
other type of Junction
I had chickens what did I do with the

164
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:34,229
I had chickens what did I do with the
 

165
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:36,039
I had chickens what did I do with the
chickens

166
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:36,049
chickens
 

167
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:38,449
chickens
well they had separated by this water

168
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:38,459
well they had separated by this water
 

169
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:42,019
well they had separated by this water
here diagonal screen pushes on to that

170
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:42,029
here diagonal screen pushes on to that
 

171
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:46,189
here diagonal screen pushes on to that
area and I got a bunch of lava waiting

172
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:46,199
area and I got a bunch of lava waiting
 

173
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:53,329
area and I got a bunch of lava waiting
for them and the door you'll notice is

174
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:53,339
for them and the door you'll notice is
 

175
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:59,239
for them and the door you'll notice is
kind of sometimes it's stuck which isn't

176
00:06:59,239 --> 00:06:59,249
kind of sometimes it's stuck which isn't
 

177
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:01,159
kind of sometimes it's stuck which isn't
good there's sort of a dead zone there

178
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:01,169
good there's sort of a dead zone there
 

179
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:03,699
good there's sort of a dead zone there
but usually they'll start moving around

180
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:03,709
but usually they'll start moving around
 

181
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:16,530
but usually they'll start moving around
and and die

182
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:16,540

 

183
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:22,800

I don't think get in there anymore not

184
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:22,810
I don't think get in there anymore not
 

185
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,120
I don't think get in there anymore not
maybe I can't so if the door is closed

186
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,130
maybe I can't so if the door is closed
 

187
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,800
maybe I can't so if the door is closed
they get stuck here and they collect in

188
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:31,810
they get stuck here and they collect in
 

189
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,200
they get stuck here and they collect in
this little chamber here they lay eggs

190
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,210
this little chamber here they lay eggs
 

191
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,050
this little chamber here they lay eggs
every five minutes and then the eggs

192
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,060
every five minutes and then the eggs
 

193
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,220
every five minutes and then the eggs
they fall down this little hole here has

194
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,230
they fall down this little hole here has
 

195
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,350
they fall down this little hole here has
a stream and goes to collection point

196
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:46,360
a stream and goes to collection point
 

197
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,590
a stream and goes to collection point
here I still have to remove this block

198
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:49,600
here I still have to remove this block
 

199
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,450
here I still have to remove this block
and then it everything will fall down

200
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:51,460
and then it everything will fall down
 

201
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:58,470
and then it everything will fall down
the pipe and yeah I don't really need

202
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:58,480
the pipe and yeah I don't really need
 

203
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,850
the pipe and yeah I don't really need
the feathers but at the same time I need

204
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:02,860
the feathers but at the same time I need
 

205
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,950
the feathers but at the same time I need
a way to kill the chickens otherwise the

206
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
a way to kill the chickens otherwise the
 

207
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,060
a way to kill the chickens otherwise the
chickens are just going to keep

208
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,070
chickens are just going to keep
 

209
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,060
chickens are just going to keep
accumulating and it'll get to the point

210
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,070
accumulating and it'll get to the point
 

211
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,360
accumulating and it'll get to the point
where no pigs cows or sheep will spawn

212
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,370
where no pigs cows or sheep will spawn
 

213
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,880
where no pigs cows or sheep will spawn
because it's all chickens so that's the

214
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:17,890
because it's all chickens so that's the
 

215
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,630
because it's all chickens so that's the
whole point of the door if I want to

216
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:21,640
whole point of the door if I want to
 

217
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,890
whole point of the door if I want to
collect their eggs I don't want the

218
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:22,900
collect their eggs I don't want the
 

219
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,370
collect their eggs I don't want the
chickens to die if I don't want the eggs

220
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:26,380
chickens to die if I don't want the eggs
 

221
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:33,630
chickens to die if I don't want the eggs
I want the chickens to die and I did

222
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:33,640
I want the chickens to die and I did
 

223
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,910
I want the chickens to die and I did
kind of cheat because I was supposed to

224
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:35,920
kind of cheat because I was supposed to
 

225
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,210
kind of cheat because I was supposed to
set up a way to collect the feathers but

226
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:41,220

 

227
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,620

yeah I've discovered this is a lot

228
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:43,630
yeah I've discovered this is a lot
 

229
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,450
yeah I've discovered this is a lot
harder to do than I initially realized

230
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:47,460
harder to do than I initially realized
 

231
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,010
harder to do than I initially realized
handling these passive moms is a lot

232
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:50,020
handling these passive moms is a lot
 

233
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,250
handling these passive moms is a lot
harder than handling the tall hostile

234
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:53,260
harder than handling the tall hostile
 

235
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,700
harder than handling the tall hostile
mobs there's chickens for example they

236
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:56,710
mobs there's chickens for example they
 

237
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,220
mobs there's chickens for example they
fit they're less than half a block tall

238
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,230
fit they're less than half a block tall
 

239
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,920
fit they're less than half a block tall
in less than half a block wide so

240
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:04,930
in less than half a block wide so
 

241
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,070
in less than half a block wide so
they're really hard to control pigs they

242
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
they're really hard to control pigs they
 

243
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,710
they're really hard to control pigs they
can fit in a one by one space that makes

244
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
can fit in a one by one space that makes
 

245
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,310
can fit in a one by one space that makes
them hard to to move around and same

246
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
them hard to to move around and same
 

247
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,250
them hard to to move around and same
with sheep and cows they're shorter than

248
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:17,260
with sheep and cows they're shorter than
 

249
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:23,100
with sheep and cows they're shorter than
tall mops and also fatter so that makes

250
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,110
tall mops and also fatter so that makes
 

251
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,939
tall mops and also fatter so that makes
things tricky too

252
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:24,949
things tricky too
 

253
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:27,309
things tricky too
and a hard time finding out ways to kill

254
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:27,319
and a hard time finding out ways to kill
 

255
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:33,519
and a hard time finding out ways to kill
the mobs but these this method here

256
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:33,529
the mobs but these this method here
 

257
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:41,229
the mobs but these this method here
works pretty good and so you might have

258
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:41,239
works pretty good and so you might have
 

259
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:42,999
works pretty good and so you might have
realized this already but I did not do

260
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:43,009
realized this already but I did not do
 

261
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:47,109
realized this already but I did not do
my skeleton idea I had for sharing wool

262
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:47,119
my skeleton idea I had for sharing wool
 

263
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:55,769
my skeleton idea I had for sharing wool
off sheep I still might do it I haven't

264
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:55,779
off sheep I still might do it I haven't
 

265
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:00,189
off sheep I still might do it I haven't
given up on that idea but you know just

266
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:00,199
given up on that idea but you know just
 

267
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,900
given up on that idea but you know just
for now I wanted to get the same all

268
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:01,910
for now I wanted to get the same all
 

269
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,859
for now I wanted to get the same all
setups so that could mean working order

270
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:05,869
setups so that could mean working order
 

271
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:09,400
setups so that could mean working order
and then I could maybe later add the

272
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:09,410
and then I could maybe later add the
 

273
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,889
and then I could maybe later add the
skeleton idea because I kind of left

274
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:11,899
skeleton idea because I kind of left
 

275
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:16,509
skeleton idea because I kind of left
from that I would just have to remove a

276
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:16,519
from that I would just have to remove a
 

277
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,460
from that I would just have to remove a
pipe and then attach it somewhere and

278
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:20,470
pipe and then attach it somewhere and
 

279
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,659
pipe and then attach it somewhere and
same with the chicken thing if I ever

280
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:22,669
same with the chicken thing if I ever
 

281
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:26,379
same with the chicken thing if I ever
want to collect feathers I got plenty of

282
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:26,389
want to collect feathers I got plenty of
 

283
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:28,389
want to collect feathers I got plenty of
room on the side still where I could set

284
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
room on the side still where I could set
 

285
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:36,309
room on the side still where I could set
something up so I'll still looked into

286
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:36,319
something up so I'll still looked into
 

287
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:38,619
something up so I'll still looked into
that idea because I think it would be

288
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:38,629
that idea because I think it would be
 

289
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:44,930
that idea because I think it would be
good

290
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:44,940

 

291
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,139

so what this pipe here is doing this

292
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:49,149
so what this pipe here is doing this
 

293
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,740
so what this pipe here is doing this
other Junction this is going to bring

294
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:51,750
other Junction this is going to bring
 

295
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,699
other Junction this is going to bring
cows and sheep and possibly wolves I

296
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:55,709
cows and sheep and possibly wolves I
 

297
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:59,009
cows and sheep and possibly wolves I
don't know what the dimensions of wolves

298
00:10:59,009 --> 00:10:59,019
don't know what the dimensions of wolves
 

299
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:00,389
don't know what the dimensions of wolves
are gonna be but I think they'll be

300
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
are gonna be but I think they'll be
 

301
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,960
are gonna be but I think they'll be
similar to cows and sheep and if they

302
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:03,970
similar to cows and sheep and if they
 

303
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,340
similar to cows and sheep and if they
are it'll bring wolves also I mean I

304
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:08,350
are it'll bring wolves also I mean I
 

305
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,819
are it'll bring wolves also I mean I
decided I'm gonna send a pipe that's

306
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:11,829
decided I'm gonna send a pipe that's
 

307
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:14,400
decided I'm gonna send a pipe that's
gonna land somewhere down there in the

308
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,410
gonna land somewhere down there in the
 

309
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,480
gonna land somewhere down there in the
front of my house

310
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:15,490
front of my house
 

311
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,079
front of my house
I'm gonna set up a little pasture

312
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:19,089
I'm gonna set up a little pasture
 

313
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:24,710
I'm gonna set up a little pasture
probably with the astro turf fake grass

314
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
probably with the astro turf fake grass
 

315
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,749
probably with the astro turf fake grass
and I'm gonna drop the cows and sheep a

316
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:30,759
and I'm gonna drop the cows and sheep a
 

317
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,019
and I'm gonna drop the cows and sheep a
long distance just so that they're

318
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:33,029
long distance just so that they're
 

319
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:37,740
long distance just so that they're
basically one hit to John and then in

320
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:37,750
basically one hit to John and then in
 

321
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,819
basically one hit to John and then in
front of my house it'll be somewhere

322
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:41,829
front of my house it'll be somewhere
 

323
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:44,400
front of my house it'll be somewhere
probably around here it's gonna be right

324
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:44,410
probably around here it's gonna be right
 

325
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:50,759
probably around here it's gonna be right
next to all my dies so say I had a blue

326
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:50,769
next to all my dies so say I had a blue
 

327
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:54,629
next to all my dies so say I had a blue
die I would just go here pick it up go

328
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
die I would just go here pick it up go
 

329
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,879
die I would just go here pick it up go
outside oh look here's 20 sheep out here

330
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:56,889
outside oh look here's 20 sheep out here
 

331
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:00,420
outside oh look here's 20 sheep out here
and then go nuts you know die alder will

332
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:00,430
and then go nuts you know die alder will
 

333
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,910
and then go nuts you know die alder will
collect the wool and also I'll have the

334
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
collect the wool and also I'll have the
 

335
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,889
collect the wool and also I'll have the
cows will fall here too and if I can

336
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:07,899
cows will fall here too and if I can
 

337
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:11,220
cows will fall here too and if I can
collect milk from them and they will be

338
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,230
collect milk from them and they will be
 

339
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,939
collect milk from them and they will be
one hit so if I see a sheep if I left

340
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:14,949
one hit so if I see a sheep if I left
 

341
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:17,009
one hit so if I see a sheep if I left
click on it the wool will fall off and

342
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:17,019
click on it the wool will fall off and
 

343
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,090
click on it the wool will fall off and
they will die

344
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,100
they will die
 

345
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,410
they will die
it's a plan and it'll be fenced off so

346
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:22,420
it's a plan and it'll be fenced off so
 

347
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,960
it's a plan and it'll be fenced off so
that they're stuck in a little area so I

348
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:27,970
that they're stuck in a little area so I
 

349
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,980
that they're stuck in a little area so I
got to finish setting that up still got

350
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:31,990
got to finish setting that up still got
 

351
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:36,240
got to finish setting that up still got
quite a bit to do on that mob system and

352
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,250
quite a bit to do on that mob system and
 

353
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,920
quite a bit to do on that mob system and
I will release my world again not this

354
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:40,930
I will release my world again not this
 

355
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,990
I will release my world again not this
episode because I just released it at

356
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,000
episode because I just released it at
 

357
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,449
episode because I just released it at
the last episode but sometime soon and

358
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:45,459
the last episode but sometime soon and
 

359
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:47,350
the last episode but sometime soon and
then he gets and

360
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
then he gets and
 

361
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,410
then he gets and
I checked this out for yourselves how I

362
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:50,420
I checked this out for yourselves how I
 

363
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,009
I checked this out for yourselves how I
got everything set up in more detail

364
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:53,019
got everything set up in more detail
 

365
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:55,420
got everything set up in more detail
because I know it's kind of hard to see

366
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:55,430
because I know it's kind of hard to see
 

367
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,440
because I know it's kind of hard to see
in just the video especially with me

368
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:58,450
in just the video especially with me
 

369
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:07,210

moving around all over the place and

370
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:07,220
moving around all over the place and
 

371
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,300
moving around all over the place and
then you can dissect the system and take

372
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,310
then you can dissect the system and take
 

373
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:18,430
then you can dissect the system and take
a better look actually quite quite a lot

374
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:18,440
a better look actually quite quite a lot
 

375
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,509
a better look actually quite quite a lot
of detail to it I even here you'll

376
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:22,519
of detail to it I even here you'll

00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,360
of detail to it I even here you'll
notice the calves that she'd get pushed

378
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,370
notice the calves that she'd get pushed
 

379
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,530
notice the calves that she'd get pushed
over and I got a sign over there so that

380
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:29,540
over and I got a sign over there so that
 

381
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,449

I don't know drops land on a block so

382
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:34,459
I don't know drops land on a block so
 

383
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:37,949
I don't know drops land on a block so
all the drops are 100% collection there

384
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:37,959
all the drops are 100% collection there
 

385
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:42,699
all the drops are 100% collection there
same with the pigs the eggs it's all

386
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:42,709
same with the pigs the eggs it's all
 

387
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:48,819
same with the pigs the eggs it's all
100% perfect the labid is in story lava

388

00:13:59,889 --> 00:13:59,899
of the items I mean so that's good I'm
 

393
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:01,509

gonna point out some of the flaws in the

394
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519
gonna point out some of the flaws in the
 

395
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:08,620
gonna point out some of the flaws in the
system sometimes if two animals fall

396
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:08,630
system sometimes if two animals fall
 

397
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,880
system sometimes if two animals fall
down here they can sometimes Jam and

398
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:11,890
down here they can sometimes Jam and
 

399
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:17,069
down here they can sometimes Jam and
prevent each other from flowing in here

400
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:17,079

 

401
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:19,509

usually they free themselves though by

402
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
usually they free themselves though by
 

403
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,490
usually they free themselves though by
jumping around or if another mouth mob

404
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:21,500
jumping around or if another mouth mob
 

405
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,139
jumping around or if another mouth mob
comes along so that's one fly I got

406
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:26,149
comes along so that's one fly I got
 

407
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:29,710
comes along so that's one fly I got
right now I've discovered there's a

408
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:29,720
right now I've discovered there's a
 

409
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,240
right now I've discovered there's a
slight flaw in the spawning pads

410
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,250
slight flaw in the spawning pads
 

411
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,970
slight flaw in the spawning pads
apparently you know I have the stairs

412
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:36,980
apparently you know I have the stairs
 

413
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,480
apparently you know I have the stairs
here apparently chickens can get stuck

414
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:40,490
here apparently chickens can get stuck
 

415
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,660
here apparently chickens can get stuck
in the stairs in that quarter block

416
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:43,670
in the stairs in that quarter block
 

417
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,590
in the stairs in that quarter block
space I think chickens can actually fit

418
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
space I think chickens can actually fit
 

419
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,810
space I think chickens can actually fit
and then eighth of a block so if you

420
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:49,820
and then eighth of a block so if you
 

421
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,860
and then eighth of a block so if you
divide one block into eight pieces

422
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:52,870
divide one block into eight pieces
 

423
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,810
divide one block into eight pieces
that chicken could fit inside one of

424
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:54,820
that chicken could fit inside one of
 

425
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,360
that chicken could fit inside one of
those so sometimes chicken stuck in the

426
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,370
those so sometimes chicken stuck in the
 

427
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:02,040
those so sometimes chicken stuck in the
stairs but if another mob comes along

428
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,050
stairs but if another mob comes along
 

429
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,460
stairs but if another mob comes along
I'll push that you can outs so that's

430
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:05,470
I'll push that you can outs so that's
 

431
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,640
I'll push that you can outs so that's
another flaw not a major one I think it

432
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:11,650
another flaw not a major one I think it
 

433
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,370
another flaw not a major one I think it
may be possible for a pig to get into

434
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:14,380
may be possible for a pig to get into
 

435
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,200
may be possible for a pig to get into
the chicken area but I haven't seen it

436
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,210
the chicken area but I haven't seen it
 

437
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,019
the chicken area but I haven't seen it
happen yet it would be pretty rare if it

438
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:19,029
happen yet it would be pretty rare if it
 

439
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:22,170
happen yet it would be pretty rare if it
ever does happen but since that is one

440
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:22,180
ever does happen but since that is one
 

441
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,230
ever does happen but since that is one
block high it probably is possible

442
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,240
block high it probably is possible
 

443
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:34,310
block high it probably is possible
somehow so that might be another flaw

444
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320

 

445
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:44,150

this stream is pretty long 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

446
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
this stream is pretty long 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
 

447
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,040
this stream is pretty long 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
it can probably handle 10 pigs if you

448
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,050
it can probably handle 10 pigs if you
 

449
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,590
it can probably handle 10 pigs if you
have more than 10 pigs then the pigs

450
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
have more than 10 pigs then the pigs
 

451
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,390
have more than 10 pigs then the pigs
might take the sheep and cows pass just

452
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:54,400
might take the sheep and cows pass just
 

453
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,320
might take the sheep and cows pass just
because the buffer is only good for 10

454
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,330
because the buffer is only good for 10
 

455
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:03,240
because the buffer is only good for 10
10 pigs or so and same with the sheep

456
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,250
10 pigs or so and same with the sheep
 

457
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,640
10 pigs or so and same with the sheep
and cows I only have but buffer for

458
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:07,650
and cows I only have but buffer for
 

459
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:14,040
and cows I only have but buffer for
maybe yea probably around 10 and if I

460
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,050
maybe yea probably around 10 and if I
 

461
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,490
maybe yea probably around 10 and if I
get more than 10 in the killing line

462
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:16,500
get more than 10 in the killing line
 

463
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,770
get more than 10 in the killing line
then they might take the other path

464
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:19,780
then they might take the other path
 

465
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:27,180
then they might take the other path
there even if the door is open so the

466
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,190
there even if the door is open so the
 

467
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,740
there even if the door is open so the
buffers are a limited size that's

468
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:28,750
buffers are a limited size that's
 

469
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:35,460
buffers are a limited size that's
another flaw there is a dead zone in

00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:35,470
another flaw there is a dead zone in
 

471
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,410
another flaw there is a dead zone in
that Junction I invented which kind of

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:40,420
that Junction I invented which kind of
 

473
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,610
that Junction I invented which kind of
sucks

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:43,620

 

475
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:53,759

if the door is closed at our sheep we'll

476
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:53,769
if the door is closed at our sheep we'll
 

477
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:55,829
if the door is closed at our sheep we'll
go over top it and then they'll get

478
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
go over top it and then they'll get
 

479
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,309
go over top it and then they'll get
stuck and it'll require another sheep or

480
00:16:59,309 --> 00:16:59,319
stuck and it'll require another sheep or
 

481
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,369
stuck and it'll require another sheep or
cattle come along and push that previous

482
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:02,379
cattle come along and push that previous
 

483
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:06,809
cattle come along and push that previous
one through so there's usually always

484
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:06,819
one through so there's usually always
 

485
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:12,960
one through so there's usually always
one mob that gets stuck here but that's

486
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:12,970
one mob that gets stuck here but that's
 

487
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,019
one mob that gets stuck here but that's
not a big deal either just a small dead

488
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:16,029
not a big deal either just a small dead
 

489
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:23,309
not a big deal either just a small dead
zone and that's I think that's the only

490
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:23,319
zone and that's I think that's the only
 

491
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:33,049
zone and that's I think that's the only
flaws and so I'm going to be hooking up

492
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:33,059
flaws and so I'm going to be hooking up
 

493
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,120
flaws and so I'm going to be hooking up
this is where all the drops come I'm

494
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,130
this is where all the drops come I'm
 

495
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,149
this is where all the drops come I'm
gonna hook up the item gates here

496
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:39,159
gonna hook up the item gates here
 

497
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:43,440
gonna hook up the item gates here
probably so that I can control if I want

498
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:43,450
probably so that I can control if I want
 

499
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:56,090
probably so that I can control if I want
passive mob drops using this lever here

500
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:56,100

 

501
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:03,779

but so I'm going to show you how you can

502
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:03,789
but so I'm going to show you how you can
 

503
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:08,310
but so I'm going to show you how you can
make your own passive mob system in any

504
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
make your own passive mob system in any
 

505
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,500
make your own passive mob system in any
world you can do it in a brand new world

506
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:10,510
world you can do it in a brand new world
 

507
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,630
world you can do it in a brand new world
and make your own that works pretty good

508
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
and make your own that works pretty good
 

509
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,880
and make your own that works pretty good
probably in five minutes or less I have

510
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:17,890
probably in five minutes or less I have
 

511
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,680
probably in five minutes or less I have
a theory I want to test out so we're

512
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:19,690
a theory I want to test out so we're
 

513
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,070
a theory I want to test out so we're
gonna go in adventuring

514
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
gonna go in adventuring
 

515
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,260
gonna go in adventuring
to see if it's gonna work or not so I'm

516
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,270
to see if it's gonna work or not so I'm
 

517
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,850
to see if it's gonna work or not so I'm
gonna get my supplies ready and then

518
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:29,860
gonna get my supplies ready and then
 

519
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:35,600
gonna get my supplies ready and then
we're doing it on a small adventure

520
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:35,610

 

521
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:41,010

woohoo adventure finally we get to go on

522
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,020
woohoo adventure finally we get to go on
 

523
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,880
woohoo adventure finally we get to go on
an adventure I've been craving this for

524
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:44,890
an adventure I've been craving this for
 

525
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:50,100
an adventure I've been craving this for
quite a while now what's wrong with her

526
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,110
quite a while now what's wrong with her
 

527

oops accidentally stopped the video yeah

538
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:09,220
oops accidentally stopped the video yeah
 

539
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,380
oops accidentally stopped the video yeah
we're gonna have some fun here stuff I

540
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:13,390
we're gonna have some fun here stuff I
 

541
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:19,650
we're gonna have some fun here stuff I
brought and let's go so what we're just

542
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:19,660
brought and let's go so what we're just
 

543
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,200
brought and let's go so what we're just
doing here is we're going away from our

544
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,210
doing here is we're going away from our
 

545
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,760
doing here is we're going away from our
base so that it doesn't interfere with

546
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:26,770
base so that it doesn't interfere with
 

547
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:32,630
base so that it doesn't interfere with
our tests we're about to do and what I'm

548
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640
our tests we're about to do and what I'm
 

549
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,220
our tests we're about to do and what I'm
about to show you guys I think might

550
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,230
about to show you guys I think might
 

551
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,830
about to show you guys I think might
actually change people the way people

552
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
actually change people the way people
 

553
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,100
actually change people the way people
play Minecraft like the way they start

554
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,110
play Minecraft like the way they start
 

555
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:46,950
play Minecraft like the way they start
out a new world because I think you can

556
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:46,960
out a new world because I think you can
 

557
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,430
out a new world because I think you can
make a very effective passive mob system

558
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:50,440
make a very effective passive mob system
 

559
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,330
make a very effective passive mob system
in under five minutes using basic

560
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:54,340
in under five minutes using basic
 

561
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,100
in under five minutes using basic
materials nothing complicated just by

562
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,110
materials nothing complicated just by
 

563
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:05,180
materials nothing complicated just by
exploiting the way mob spawning works

564
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,190

 

565
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:11,130

because it's actually quite simple so

566
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:11,140
because it's actually quite simple so
 

567
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,430
because it's actually quite simple so
you remember that thing I showed you

568
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
you remember that thing I showed you
 

569
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,540
you remember that thing I showed you
when I walked away from the spawning

570
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:15,550
when I walked away from the spawning
 

571
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,880
when I walked away from the spawning
pads like instantly a bunch of mob

572
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:17,890
pads like instantly a bunch of mob
 

573
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,980
pads like instantly a bunch of mob
spawns

574
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:18,990
spawns
 

575
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,990
spawns
that's because it's nighttime it was

576
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,000
that's because it's nighttime it was
 

577
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
that's because it's nighttime it was
nighttime when I did that normally

578
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,010
nighttime when I did that normally
 

579
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,390
nighttime when I did that normally
during the day if I do that cool

580
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:27,400
during the day if I do that cool
 

581
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,560
during the day if I do that cool
pumpkins normally during the day that

582
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:31,570
pumpkins normally during the day that
 

583
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:36,419
pumpkins normally during the day that
doesn't happen I might get the odd mob

584
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:36,429
doesn't happen I might get the odd mob
 

585
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:42,030
doesn't happen I might get the odd mob
spawning after a minute or two but at

586
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,040
spawning after a minute or two but at
 

587
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,549
spawning after a minute or two but at
night it's almost instant and lots of

588
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
night it's almost instant and lots of
 

589
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,640
night it's almost instant and lots of
mobs

590
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:50,650

 

591
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,510

so we're looking for a flat grass area

592
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:54,520
so we're looking for a flat grass area
 

593
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:02,330
so we're looking for a flat grass area
and we're gonna build our spawning area

594
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:02,340

 

595
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,710

hopefully quickly because this video is

596
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
hopefully quickly because this video is
 

597
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:16,470
hopefully quickly because this video is
getting along so yeah it's really simple

598
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
getting along so yeah it's really simple
 

599
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,010
getting along so yeah it's really simple
all mobs the passive mobs need is grass

600
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,020
all mobs the passive mobs need is grass
 

601
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:28,770
all mobs the passive mobs need is grass
and light has to be a light level 9 or

602
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:28,780
and light has to be a light level 9 or
 

603
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,090
and light has to be a light level 9 or
greater according to the Wikipedia I do

604
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:33,100
greater according to the Wikipedia I do
 

605
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,860
greater according to the Wikipedia I do
kind of trust the Wikipedia

606
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:34,870
kind of trust the Wikipedia
 

607
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:57,529
kind of trust the Wikipedia
I think it's right

608
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:57,539

 

609
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,730

all right I'm just gonna do it here I

610
00:21:59,730 --> 00:21:59,740
all right I'm just gonna do it here I
 

611
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,989
all right I'm just gonna do it here I
think I'm gonna clear some trees real

612
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:03,999
think I'm gonna clear some trees real
 

613
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:06,320
think I'm gonna clear some trees real
quick and then I'll be back

614
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:06,330
quick and then I'll be back
 

615
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,509
quick and then I'll be back
actually you know what I'm not going to

616
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:09,519
actually you know what I'm not going to
 

617
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:11,430
actually you know what I'm not going to
do this off camera because I said five

618
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
do this off camera because I said five
 

619
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,720
do this off camera because I said five
minutes or less and they'll probably

620
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:15,730
minutes or less and they'll probably
 

621
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,700
minutes or less and they'll probably
actually take me longer but it is

622
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,710
actually take me longer but it is
 

623
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:22,529
actually take me longer but it is
possibly to five minutes or less I have

624
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:22,539
possibly to five minutes or less I have
 

625
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:31,680
possibly to five minutes or less I have
cleared one tree and place some soil

626
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:31,690
cleared one tree and place some soil
 

627
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,619
cleared one tree and place some soil
here that's all you need to do

628
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:34,629
here that's all you need to do
 

629
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:40,259
here that's all you need to do
I brought some fences with me and if you

630
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:40,269
I brought some fences with me and if you
 

631
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:44,009
I brought some fences with me and if you
have a nice level spots I just fence out

632
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:44,019
have a nice level spots I just fence out
 

633
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:45,480
have a nice level spots I just fence out
the area you want with your mobs to

634
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,490
the area you want with your mobs to
 

635
00:22:45,490 --> 00:23:05,730
the area you want with your mobs to
spawn it however big you want and in

636
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:05,740
spawn it however big you want and in
 

637
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:22,109
spawn it however big you want and in
whatever shape you want and it doesn't

638
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:22,119
whatever shape you want and it doesn't
 

639
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:29,279
whatever shape you want and it doesn't
even need to be that big actually there

640
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:29,289
even need to be that big actually there
 

641
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:39,440
even need to be that big actually there
that's probably fine

642
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,450

 

643
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:50,700

and you fence out your area then all you

644
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:50,710
and you fence out your area then all you
 

645
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:57,810
and you fence out your area then all you
have to do is place torches don't need a

646
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:57,820
have to do is place torches don't need a
 

647
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:08,990
have to do is place torches don't need a
whole lot and you're done that's it so

648
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,000
whole lot and you're done that's it so
 

649
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,170
whole lot and you're done that's it so
let me explain you need grass and light

650
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:13,180
let me explain you need grass and light
 

651
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:18,890
let me explain you need grass and light
level 9 or more to spawn passive machs

652
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:18,900
level 9 or more to spawn passive machs
 

653
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,170
level 9 or more to spawn passive machs
during the day they're gonna spawn

654
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:22,180
during the day they're gonna spawn
 

655
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:29,210
during the day they're gonna spawn
anywhere around you within 128 blocks

656
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:29,220

 

657
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,700

because there's grass thousands and

658
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:32,710
because there's grass thousands and
 

659
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,010
because there's grass thousands and
thousands of grass blocks all around me

660
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:35,020
thousands of grass blocks all around me
 

661
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:41,130
thousands of grass blocks all around me
that they can spawn it but at night that

662
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:41,140
that they can spawn it but at night that
 

663
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,960
that they can spawn it but at night that
changes they can't spawn in the grass

664
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:45,970
changes they can't spawn in the grass
 

665
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,260
changes they can't spawn in the grass
blocks because it's too dark

666
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:49,270
blocks because it's too dark
 

667
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,419
blocks because it's too dark
so the only place they can spawn at

668
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:52,429
so the only place they can spawn at
 

669
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:56,950
so the only place they can spawn at
night is in this little enclosure I made

670
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:56,960
night is in this little enclosure I made
 

671
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:04,380
night is in this little enclosure I made
because I have torches and grass okay

672
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:04,390

 

673
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,880

they won't spawn if I'm close to the

674
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:06,890
they won't spawn if I'm close to the
 

675
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,549
they won't spawn if I'm close to the
silk they'll only spawn if I'm 24 blocks

676
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:09,559
silk they'll only spawn if I'm 24 blocks
 

677
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:16,120
silk they'll only spawn if I'm 24 blocks
or more away ah I don't know if you've

678
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,130
or more away ah I don't know if you've
 

679
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,159
or more away ah I don't know if you've
ever seen like a lava pool if you

680
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:18,169
ever seen like a lava pool if you
 

681
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:20,470
ever seen like a lava pool if you
approach a lava pool in the middle of

682
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,480
approach a lava pool in the middle of
 

683
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,960
approach a lava pool in the middle of
the night there'll be tons of mobs

684
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:22,970
the night there'll be tons of mobs
 

685
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,450
the night there'll be tons of mobs
around it because it's a natural source

686
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:25,460
around it because it's a natural source
 

687
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,840
around it because it's a natural source
of light and there's usually grass near

688
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:28,850
of light and there's usually grass near
 

689
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,980
of light and there's usually grass near
lava pools and that's why you often see

690
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:32,990
lava pools and that's why you often see
 

691
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,930
lava pools and that's why you often see
a lot of mobs around lab of pools so

692
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:37,940
a lot of mobs around lab of pools so
 

693
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,159
a lot of mobs around lab of pools so
that's basically what I've done here

694
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:39,169
that's basically what I've done here
 

695
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:43,840
that's basically what I've done here
I've made an artificial light source for

696
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:43,850
I've made an artificial light source for
 

697
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,830
I've made an artificial light source for
them to spawn it passive mobs are not

698
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:47,840
them to spawn it passive mobs are not
 

699
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,250
them to spawn it passive mobs are not
attractive to the torches they like a

700
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:51,260
attractive to the torches they like a
 

701
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,010
attractive to the torches they like a
lot of people think they're it's just

702
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,020
lot of people think they're it's just
 

703
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,919
lot of people think they're it's just
where they spawn and so they're usually

704
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:56,929
where they spawn and so they're usually
 

705
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:04,090
where they spawn and so they're usually
near torches and you know what I'm gonna

706
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:04,100
near torches and you know what I'm gonna
 

707
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,510
near torches and you know what I'm gonna
set up a little quick killing machine

708
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,520
set up a little quick killing machine
 

709
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:31,390
set up a little quick killing machine
very simple dig down to go up three go

710
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:31,400
very simple dig down to go up three go
 

711
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,080
very simple dig down to go up three go
all the way around

712
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,090

 

713
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:47,089

take out the corners if you want

714
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:47,099

 

715
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:50,819

we're gonna place a door here I forgot

716
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:50,829
we're gonna place a door here I forgot
 

717
00:26:50,829 --> 00:27:08,359
we're gonna place a door here I forgot
to bring that door okay we need a door

718
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:08,369

 

719
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:22,739

and what else did we need oh yeah and

720
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:22,749
and what else did we need oh yeah and
 

721
00:27:22,749 --> 00:27:26,119
and what else did we need oh yeah and
we're just gonna place water inside here

722
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:26,129
we're just gonna place water inside here
 

723
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:31,229
we're just gonna place water inside here
in all four blocks this is similar to

724
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:31,239
in all four blocks this is similar to
 

725
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:33,719
in all four blocks this is similar to
that water wall thing I made it my base

726
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:33,729
that water wall thing I made it my base
 

727
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:39,659
that water wall thing I made it my base
I think this will work any mob that

728
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:39,669
I think this will work any mob that
 

729
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:41,789
I think this will work any mob that
wanders into here they'll fall down and

730
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:41,799
wanders into here they'll fall down and
 

731
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:44,069
wanders into here they'll fall down and
drown and then you can collect their

732
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:44,079
drown and then you can collect their
 

733
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:56,279
drown and then you can collect their
loot and for the sake of this experiment

734
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:56,289
loot and for the sake of this experiment
 

735
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:57,869
loot and for the sake of this experiment
I'm going to kill all the mobs around

736
00:27:57,869 --> 00:27:57,879
I'm going to kill all the mobs around
 

737
00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:02,939
I'm going to kill all the mobs around
this area within 24 blocks of here so

738
00:28:02,939 --> 00:28:02,949
this area within 24 blocks of here so
 

739
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:12,810
this area within 24 blocks of here so
that will be no mobs

740
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:12,820

 

741
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,600

and then you can see there's a sheep

742
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:16,610
and then you can see there's a sheep
 

743
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,009
and then you can see there's a sheep
kind of far away from there I'm gonna

744
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:18,019
kind of far away from there I'm gonna
 

745
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:23,350
kind of far away from there I'm gonna
wait a while and they'll be spawn and

746
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,360
wait a while and they'll be spawn and
 

747
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,080
wait a while and they'll be spawn and
then I'll zoom recording and I'll show

748
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,090
then I'll zoom recording and I'll show
 

749
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,909
then I'll zoom recording and I'll show
you guys something that I think will

750
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:27,919
you guys something that I think will
 

751
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:34,060
you guys something that I think will
work now you guys were back that's about

752
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,070
work now you guys were back that's about
 

753
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,379
work now you guys were back that's about
the middle of the night now it's been

754
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:35,389
the middle of the night now it's been
 

755
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:38,470
the middle of the night now it's been
about five minutes I'm a little bit

756
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:38,480
about five minutes I'm a little bit
 

757
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,210
about five minutes I'm a little bit
surprised the Sheep didn't wander into

758
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:40,220
surprised the Sheep didn't wander into
 

759
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,629
surprised the Sheep didn't wander into
the water on its own this is kind of a

760
00:28:43,629 --> 00:28:43,639
the water on its own this is kind of a
 

761
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:47,320
the water on its own this is kind of a
random trap played yeah only works if

762
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,330
random trap played yeah only works if
 

763
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,639
random trap played yeah only works if
they randomly walk into it but it's one

764
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:51,649
they randomly walk into it but it's one
 

765
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:57,070
they randomly walk into it but it's one
you can set up really easy without

766
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,080
you can set up really easy without
 

767
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,930
you can set up really easy without
having any water canals or anything

768
00:28:58,930 --> 00:28:58,940
having any water canals or anything
 

769
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,279
having any water canals or anything
complicated like that oh oh he's come

770
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:03,289
complicated like that oh oh he's come
 

771
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:13,200
complicated like that oh oh he's come
off it close but we're gonna kill so

772
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,210
off it close but we're gonna kill so
 

773
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:17,909
off it close but we're gonna kill so
haven't tested this yet but my theory is

774
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:17,919
haven't tested this yet but my theory is
 

775
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,470
haven't tested this yet but my theory is
most of the passive mobs should have

776
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,480
most of the passive mobs should have
 

777
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:32,649
most of the passive mobs should have
gone by now I was shocking and since

778
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:32,659
gone by now I was shocking and since
 

779
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:34,539
gone by now I was shocking and since
it's too dark for them to spawn on the

780
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:34,549
it's too dark for them to spawn on the
 

781
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:37,000
it's too dark for them to spawn on the
grass around me the only place they can

782
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,010
grass around me the only place they can
 

783
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:43,120
grass around me the only place they can
spawn is on is inside my trap here the

784
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,130
spawn is on is inside my trap here the
 

785
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,100
spawn is on is inside my trap here the
bigger you make this trap the better it

786
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,110
bigger you make this trap the better it
 

787
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,340
bigger you make this trap the better it
will probably work

788
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:47,350
will probably work
 

789
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,840
will probably work
you know I'm just gonna switch it easy

790
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:49,850
you know I'm just gonna switch it easy
 

791
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:53,110
you know I'm just gonna switch it easy
very peaceful just because I don't want

792
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,120
very peaceful just because I don't want
 

793
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,260
very peaceful just because I don't want
them annoying me so pretty much as soon

794
00:29:59,260 --> 00:29:59,270
them annoying me so pretty much as soon
 

795
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,710
them annoying me so pretty much as soon
as I walk 24 blocks away from here

796
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:01,720
as I walk 24 blocks away from here
 

797
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,330
as I walk 24 blocks away from here
this is the only place they should be

798
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:04,340
this is the only place they should be
 

799
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:12,340
this is the only place they should be
able to spawn in and it should be pretty

800
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:12,350
