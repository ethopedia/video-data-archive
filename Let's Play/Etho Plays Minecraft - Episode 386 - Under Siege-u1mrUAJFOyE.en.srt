interestingly they only happen when

58
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:57,930
interestingly they only happen when
 

59
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,709
interestingly they only happen when
you're by the village apparently so it

60
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
you're by the village apparently so it
 

61
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,469
you're by the village apparently so it
says it you have to be at the village

62
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:03,479
says it you have to be at the village
 

63
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,810
says it you have to be at the village
centre which i think is around here or

64
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:05,820
centre which i think is around here or
 

65
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,199
centre which i think is around here or
something or maybe down here even so I

66
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,209
something or maybe down here even so I
 

67
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,199
something or maybe down here even so I
was working up here on this minecart

68
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:12,209
was working up here on this minecart
 

69
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,430
was working up here on this minecart
thing right

70
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
thing right
 

71
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,590
thing right
and then I look over and just tons of

72
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:15,600
and then I look over and just tons of
 

73
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,870
and then I look over and just tons of
zombies and it it says you have to or

74
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:20,880
zombies and it it says you have to or
 

75
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,190
zombies and it it says you have to or
it'll spawn them if you are within the

76
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
it'll spawn them if you are within the
 

77
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,520
it'll spawn them if you are within the
center of the village plus the size of

78
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,530
center of the village plus the size of
 

79
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,810
center of the village plus the size of
the village so I think it means how many

80
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:29,820
the village so I think it means how many
 

81
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,370
the village so I think it means how many
villagers are in it and plus one on that

82
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:34,380
villagers are in it and plus one on that
 

83
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,930
villagers are in it and plus one on that
as well so you also need 20 villagers

84
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:38,940
as well so you also need 20 villagers
 

85
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,300
as well so you also need 20 villagers
and ten doors check this one out yeah I

86
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:44,310
and ten doors check this one out yeah I
 

87
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,140
and ten doors check this one out yeah I
think we killed them all all right so I

88
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,150
think we killed them all all right so I
 

89
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,340
think we killed them all all right so I
guess though all those conditions were

90
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,350
guess though all those conditions were
 

91
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,160
guess though all those conditions were
met and that was a zombie siege I've

92
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,170
met and that was a zombie siege I've
 

93
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,580
met and that was a zombie siege I've
never seen one before very scary so if

rate that the hopper should be able to
keep up right but what's going on is

474
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:03,490
keep up right but what's going on is
 

475
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,380
keep up right but what's going on is
they travel to unloaded chunks and then

476
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:07,390
they travel to unloaded chunks and then
 

477
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,430
they travel to unloaded chunks and then
when I get there

478
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:08,440
when I get there
 

479
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,950
when I get there
- those unloaded chunks all the ender

480
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:10,960
- those unloaded chunks all the ender
 

481
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,740
- those unloaded chunks all the ender
pearls are probably stacking up and then

482
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:13,750
pearls are probably stacking up and then
 

483
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,680
pearls are probably stacking up and then
when they go through the end portal -

484
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:16,690
when they go through the end portal -
 

485
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,100
when they go through the end portal -
those those other hoppers we just saw um

486
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,110
those those other hoppers we just saw um
 

487
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,990
those those other hoppers we just saw um
they just bounce off the hoppers because

488
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,000
they just bounce off the hoppers because
 

489
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
they just bounce off the hoppers because
it's a stack of them and it can't it

490
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,010
it's a stack of them and it can't it
 

491
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,890
it's a stack of them and it can't it
can't absorb them right so it just

492
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:25,900
can't absorb them right so it just
 

493
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,590
can't absorb them right so it just
bounces off so what we got to do is add

494
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:28,600
bounces off so what we got to do is add
 

495
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,250
bounces off so what we got to do is add
a second one of those right before they

496
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:32,260
a second one of those right before they
 

497
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,750
a second one of those right before they
go through the portal alright so that is

498
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:36,760
go through the portal alright so that is
 

499
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,890
go through the portal alright so that is
exactly what

500
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:37,900
exactly what
 

501
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,930
exactly what
I did here I set up another dispenser

502
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:39,940
I did here I set up another dispenser
 

503
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,350
I did here I set up another dispenser
thing at the portal right at the portal

504
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
thing at the portal right at the portal
 

505
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,350
thing at the portal right at the portal
like it's right over there let me show

506
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:46,360
like it's right over there let me show
 

507
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,510
like it's right over there let me show
you real quick how to build one of these

508
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:48,520
you real quick how to build one of these
 

509
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,530
you real quick how to build one of these
in case you don't know they're actually

510
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:49,540
in case you don't know they're actually
 

511
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,650
in case you don't know they're actually
kind of useful if you ever need to

512
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:52,660
kind of useful if you ever need to
 

513
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,760
kind of useful if you ever need to
dispense items at a certain rates what

514
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:56,770
dispense items at a certain rates what
 

515
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,360
dispense items at a certain rates what
you do get your dropper or dispenser and

516
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,370
you do get your dropper or dispenser and
 

517
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,200
you do get your dropper or dispenser and
then comparator next to it make that go

518
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,210
then comparator next to it make that go
 

519
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,490
then comparator next to it make that go
to a block redstone block repeater

520
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:07,500
to a block redstone block repeater
 

521
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,920
to a block redstone block repeater
redstone so that makes a clock and then

522
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:10,930
redstone so that makes a clock and then
 

523
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,170
redstone so that makes a clock and then
make it go up one and that way it'll

524
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:13,180
make it go up one and that way it'll
 

525
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,760
make it go up one and that way it'll
power the dropper so now if there's

526
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:14,770
power the dropper so now if there's
 

527
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:21,900
power the dropper so now if there's
items in here tada pretty simple and I

528
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:21,910
items in here tada pretty simple and I
 

529
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,530
items in here tada pretty simple and I
believe if it's set at one

530
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:24,540
believe if it's set at one
 

531
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,180
believe if it's set at one
it'll dispense it at a rate that hoppers

532
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:27,190
it'll dispense it at a rate that hoppers
 

533
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,650
it'll dispense it at a rate that hoppers
will pick it up we could even test that

534
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:28,660
will pick it up we could even test that
 

535
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,730
will pick it up we could even test that
if we wanted here let's try that real

536
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:32,740
if we wanted here let's try that real
 

537
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,550
if we wanted here let's try that real
quick just to make sure so if we put a

538
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:37,560
quick just to make sure so if we put a
 

539
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,620
quick just to make sure so if we put a
hopper here they shouldn't be able to

540
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:40,630
hopper here they shouldn't be able to
 

541
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:48,990
hopper here they shouldn't be able to
pile up oh that's looking good no items

542
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,000
pile up oh that's looking good no items
 

543
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,660
pile up oh that's looking good no items
are getting stuck or stacking on top the

544
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:51,670
are getting stuck or stacking on top the
 

545
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,960
are getting stuck or stacking on top the
hopper so it's at a good rates cool so

546
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:54,970
hopper so it's at a good rates cool so
 

547
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,370
hopper so it's at a good rates cool so
let's head down here we'll try it out

548
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:56,380
let's head down here we'll try it out
 

549
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,060
let's head down here we'll try it out
for real whoa

550
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,070

 

551
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,070

we'll send up a stack of grass I don't

552
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:02,080
we'll send up a stack of grass I don't
 

553
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,140
we'll send up a stack of grass I don't
think I've let any grass blocks flow

554
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,150
think I've let any grass blocks flow
 

555
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,750
think I've let any grass blocks flow
through here while I've been testing so

556
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:06,760
through here while I've been testing so
 

557
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,480
through here while I've been testing so
throw it right against here a whole

558
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:09,490
throw it right against here a whole
 

559
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:15,150
throw it right against here a whole
stack of it at once good should go up

560
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,160
stack of it at once good should go up
 

561
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,060
stack of it at once good should go up
and there was 63 there let's just make

562
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,070
and there was 63 there let's just make
 

563
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,820
and there was 63 there let's just make
sure we get 63 - I have a feeling some

564
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:20,830
sure we get 63 - I have a feeling some
 

565
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,700
sure we get 63 - I have a feeling some
are disappearing somehow which is

566
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:23,710
are disappearing somehow which is
 

567
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,230
are disappearing somehow which is
another issue I don't know if it's the

568
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:25,240
another issue I don't know if it's the
 

569
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,269
another issue I don't know if it's the
same issue like if it's related or what

570
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:30,279

 

571
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,429

but yeah also another thing like a whole

572
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:35,439
but yeah also another thing like a whole
 

573
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,530
but yeah also another thing like a whole
bunch of items are going to approach us

574
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:37,540
bunch of items are going to approach us
 

575
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,090
bunch of items are going to approach us
at the exact same time because they're

576
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:39,100
at the exact same time because they're
 

577
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,119
at the exact same time because they're
unloaded and they all pile up there's

578
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:42,129
unloaded and they all pile up there's
 

579
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:46,110
unloaded and they all pile up there's
not really any point to putting a chest

580
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:46,120
not really any point to putting a chest
 

581
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,819
not really any point to putting a chest
here I don't think this like store

582
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:47,829
here I don't think this like store
 

583
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:50,759
here I don't think this like store
though the big amount of items that have

584
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:50,769
though the big amount of items that have
 

585
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:53,189
though the big amount of items that have
come all at once I just have them or

586
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:53,199
come all at once I just have them or
 

587
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,009
come all at once I just have them or
they'll fly up Oh No darn it David this

588
00:16:59,009 --> 00:16:59,019
they'll fly up Oh No darn it David this
 

589
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,420
they'll fly up Oh No darn it David this
doesn't work I thought redstone would

590
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,430
doesn't work I thought redstone would
 

591
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,230
doesn't work I thought redstone would
count as a block I just not this was the

592
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
count as a block I just not this was the
 

593
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,199
count as a block I just not this was the
easiest place for the item to go right

594
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:07,209
easiest place for the item to go right
 

595
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:14,939
easiest place for the item to go right
here hmm what to do what to do I can

596
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:14,949
here hmm what to do what to do I can
 

597
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,169
here hmm what to do what to do I can
move this all over one block I think

598
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:18,179
move this all over one block I think
 

599
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,399
move this all over one block I think
there's a trick you can do if you ever

600
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:20,409
there's a trick you can do if you ever
 

601
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:22,949
there's a trick you can do if you ever
need your comparator power like the

602
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
need your comparator power like the
 

603
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,069
need your comparator power like the
analog single signal to go further you

604
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
analog single signal to go further you
 

605
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,289
analog single signal to go further you
just add another comparator on to it so

606
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:28,299
just add another comparator on to it so
 

607
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:30,120
just add another comparator on to it so
we just shift everything over one block

608
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,130
we just shift everything over one block
 

609
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,830
we just shift everything over one block
if we want and then we can keep this

610
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
if we want and then we can keep this
 

611
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,120
if we want and then we can keep this
solid so that doesn't happen

612
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,130
solid so that doesn't happen
 

613
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,340
solid so that doesn't happen
ah-ha so the droppers getting powered

614
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,350
ah-ha so the droppers getting powered
 

615
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,529
ah-ha so the droppers getting powered
here but it must be staying powered

616
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:40,539
here but it must be staying powered
 

617
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:45,630
here but it must be staying powered
somehow so this isn't working you could

618
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:45,640
somehow so this isn't working you could
 

619
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,090
somehow so this isn't working you could
also just get rid of one comparator and

620
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:48,100
also just get rid of one comparator and
 

621
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,460
also just get rid of one comparator and
put a block there but again it thinks

622
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:53,470
put a block there but again it thinks
 

623
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,889
put a block there but again it thinks
it's powered for some reason let's run

624
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:55,899
it's powered for some reason let's run
 

625
00:17:55,899 --> 00:18:00,299
it's powered for some reason let's run
it over this way I wonder why that made

626
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:00,309
it over this way I wonder why that made
 

627
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:05,430
it over this way I wonder why that made
a difference okay anyway it works so

628
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:05,440
a difference okay anyway it works so
 

629
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,810
a difference okay anyway it works so
we're gonna try to out one more time

630
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:06,820
we're gonna try to out one more time

no really okay how many bounced off five
 

643
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:37,020
no really okay how many bounced off five
why did five bounce off let's check how

644
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,030
why did five bounce off let's check how
 

645
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:42,340
why did five bounce off let's check how
many are in here so there should be 58

646
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:42,350
many are in here so there should be 58
 

647
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,539
many are in here so there should be 58
there's 58 that's good I don't know why

648
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:46,549
there's 58 that's good I don't know why
 

649
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:51,100
there's 58 that's good I don't know why
five would have bounced off well I guess

650
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,110
five would have bounced off well I guess
 

651
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,139
five would have bounced off well I guess
if it continues to be an issue I might

652
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:53,149
if it continues to be an issue I might
 

653
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:54,820
if it continues to be an issue I might
be able to just like put a border around

654
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:54,830
be able to just like put a border around
 

655

00:18:58,539 --> 00:18:58,549
the hoppers let they can't jump jump out
 

657
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:00,940
the hoppers let they can't jump jump out
of there you know items stay put might

658
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:00,950
of there you know items stay put might
 

659
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,850

plan with this thing so you can see I've

662
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:05,929
plan with this thing so you can see I've
 

663

added a bunch of chests might want to

664
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:07,700
added a bunch of chests might want to
 

665
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,080
added a bunch of chests might want to
add more I'm not sure yet and basically

666
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,090
add more I'm not sure yet and basically
 

667
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,090
add more I'm not sure yet and basically
all the ender pearls will siphon down to

668
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:13,100
all the ender pearls will siphon down to
 

669
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,149
all the ender pearls will siphon down to
the bottom so we have ender pearl

670
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:16,159
the bottom so we have ender pearl
 

671
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,220
the bottom so we have ender pearl
transport from the Enderman farm right

672
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,230
transport from the Enderman farm right
 

673
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,779
transport from the Enderman farm right
to here through the portal and

674
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:19,789
to here through the portal and
 

675
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:22,330
to here through the portal and
everything which is pretty cool the next

676
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:22,340
everything which is pretty cool the next
 

677
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,129
everything which is pretty cool the next
step if I was to add on to this I would

678
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:24,139
step if I was to add on to this I would
 

679
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:28,299
step if I was to add on to this I would
like to set up ender pearl Oh for my

680
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:28,309
like to set up ender pearl Oh for my
 

681
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:31,779
like to set up ender pearl Oh for my
ender pearls let's drop them off ender

682
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:31,789
ender pearls let's drop them off ender
 

683
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:34,749
ender pearls let's drop them off ender
pearl dispensing stations around the

684
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:34,759
pearl dispensing stations around the
 

685
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,690
pearl dispensing stations around the
world so I use ender pearls quite a bit

686
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:37,700
world so I use ender pearls quite a bit
 

687
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,990
world so I use ender pearls quite a bit
but I do hold back because I only have

688
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,000
but I do hold back because I only have
 

689
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,789
but I do hold back because I only have
them stored in one spot in the man cave

690
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
them stored in one spot in the man cave
 

691
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,210
them stored in one spot in the man cave
I got that one ender pearl dispenser so

692
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:46,220
I got that one ender pearl dispenser so
 

693
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,070
I got that one ender pearl dispenser so
like if I'm walking around here usually

694
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,080
like if I'm walking around here usually
 

695
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,080
like if I'm walking around here usually
I don't ender pearl around too much

696
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,090
I don't ender pearl around too much
 

697
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,580
I don't ender pearl around too much
because then they don't last I'll have

698
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:51,590
because then they don't last I'll have
 

699
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,460
because then they don't last I'll have
to go back and refill but if I had

700
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:54,470
to go back and refill but if I had
 

701
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,669
to go back and refill but if I had
dispensing stations like every few

702
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
dispensing stations like every few
 

703
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,879
dispensing stations like every few
hundred blocks of Parts I would probably

704
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:00,889
hundred blocks of Parts I would probably
 

705
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:02,440
hundred blocks of Parts I would probably
use them quite a bit and they would be

706
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:02,450
use them quite a bit and they would be
 

707
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,919
use them quite a bit and they would be
very handy so what we'll do is we'll set

708
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:05,929
very handy so what we'll do is we'll set
 

709
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:07,720
very handy so what we'll do is we'll set
up a minecart like a storage minecart

710
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:07,730
up a minecart like a storage minecart
 

711
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,879
up a minecart like a storage minecart
loading station over there and then

712
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:09,889
loading station over there and then
 

713
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:13,450
loading station over there and then
it'll make its rounds and drop off ender

714
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:13,460
it'll make its rounds and drop off ender
 

715
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,240
it'll make its rounds and drop off ender
pearls that all the refill stations that

716
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,250
pearls that all the refill stations that
 

717
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,210
pearls that all the refill stations that
we set up and do a loop and then go back

718
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:19,220
we set up and do a loop and then go back
 

719
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,299
we set up and do a loop and then go back
and refill again now the thing with that

720
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:22,309
and refill again now the thing with that
 

721
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:24,580
and refill again now the thing with that
though is if the cart travels to an

722
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:24,590
though is if the cart travels to an
 

723
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,159
though is if the cart travels to an
unloaded chunk it's not going to make it

724
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:27,169
unloaded chunk it's not going to make it
 

725
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:29,980
unloaded chunk it's not going to make it
very far right so we have to put it only

726
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:29,990
very far right so we have to put it only
 

727
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,340
very far right so we have to put it only
in areas that we frequent like I

728
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:33,350
in areas that we frequent like I
 

729
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,749
in areas that we frequent like I
wouldn't like run it all the way to

730
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:34,759
wouldn't like run it all the way to
 

731
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:38,860
wouldn't like run it all the way to
amplified bass or something because you

732
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:38,870
amplified bass or something because you
 

733
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,509
amplified bass or something because you
know I go there and then amplified bass

734
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:40,519
know I go there and then amplified bass
 

735
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,100
know I go there and then amplified bass
and there's no way for the cart to

736
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,110
and there's no way for the cart to
 

737
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,379
and there's no way for the cart to
return in the in-between land because I

738
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:44,389
return in the in-between land because I
 

739
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:47,049
return in the in-between land because I
don't go to those areas so it would

740
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:47,059
don't go to those areas so it would
 

741
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,730
don't go to those areas so it would
probably just be round so like the man

742
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:48,740
probably just be round so like the man
 

743
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,269
probably just be round so like the man
cave maybe the windmill here the next is

744
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:52,279
cave maybe the windmill here the next is
 

745
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:55,730
cave maybe the windmill here the next is
the village that kind of area and

746
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:55,740
the village that kind of area and
 

747
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,780
the village that kind of area and
pretty cool but that is a future project

748
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:58,790
pretty cool but that is a future project
 

749
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,100
pretty cool but that is a future project
there is one other thing I was going to

750
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,110

thought he was broken some people have

758
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,070
thought he was broken some people have
 

759
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,760
thought he was broken some people have
suggested I cut down these trees which I

760
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:16,770
suggested I cut down these trees which I
 

761
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,990
suggested I cut down these trees which I
might be doing but the other thing this

762
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,000
might be doing but the other thing this
 

763
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,500
might be doing but the other thing this
over here what was I thinking guys why

764
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:24,510
over here what was I thinking guys why
 

765
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,960
over here what was I thinking guys why
didn't anyone stop me I don't think I

766
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:26,970
didn't anyone stop me I don't think I
 

767
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,470
didn't anyone stop me I don't think I
gave you a chance but yeah this uh this

768
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,480
gave you a chance but yeah this uh this
 

769
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,030
gave you a chance but yeah this uh this
thing's not really working too well is

770
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,040
thing's not really working too well is
 

771
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,190
thing's not really working too well is
it the giant snow thing I never finished

772
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:34,200
it the giant snow thing I never finished
 

773
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,610
it the giant snow thing I never finished
it and I either have to finish it or

774
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:37,620
it and I either have to finish it or
 

775
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,110
it and I either have to finish it or
change it and I think we should change

776
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,120
change it and I think we should change
 

777
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,580
change it and I think we should change
it because it really does not suit the

778
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:43,590
it because it really does not suit the
 

779
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,780
it because it really does not suit the
desert at all right so what I should

780
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:47,790
desert at all right so what I should
 

781
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,600
desert at all right so what I should
have done instead is probably just build

782
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:50,610
have done instead is probably just build
 

783
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,870
have done instead is probably just build
like a pyramid because the whole point

784
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:53,880
like a pyramid because the whole point
 

785
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,500
like a pyramid because the whole point
of this was to hide the mob system over

786
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:57,510

make sense or should we make it just go
straight down

832
