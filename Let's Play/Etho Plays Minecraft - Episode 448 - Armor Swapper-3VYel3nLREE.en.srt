so how's it going everybody this is Ito
and welcome back I checked out the

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:14,730
and welcome back I checked out the
 

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,210
and welcome back I checked out the
comments on last episode I made two

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:17,220
comments on last episode I made two
 

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,820
comments on last episode I made two
mistakes with this build we did last

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:19,830
mistakes with this build we did last
 

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,390
mistakes with this build we did last
time and if we're lucky we're not too

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:23,400
time and if we're lucky we're not too
 

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,340
time and if we're lucky we're not too
late

12
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:24,350
late
 

13
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,279
late
let's find out first mistake I put wood

14
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:28,289
let's find out first mistake I put wood
 

15
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,609
let's find out first mistake I put wood
by lava so there is a chance things I've

16
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:31,619
by lava so there is a chance things I've
 

17
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,979
by lava so there is a chance things I've
burnt down or started to burn down yep

18
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:33,989
burnt down or started to burn down yep
 

19
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,930
burnt down or started to burn down yep
so we had some wood overtop these

20
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:35,940
so we had some wood overtop these
 

21
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,229
so we had some wood overtop these
hoppers and that's a big no-no I don't

22
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:39,239
hoppers and that's a big no-no I don't
 

23
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,889
hoppers and that's a big no-no I don't
know why I did that all right

24
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:42,899
know why I did that all right
 

25
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,840
know why I did that all right
ah the other thing a lot of you guys

26
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:44,850
ah the other thing a lot of you guys
 

27
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,490
ah the other thing a lot of you guys
keep telling me is putting blocks over

28
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:46,500
keep telling me is putting blocks over
 

29
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,049
keep telling me is putting blocks over
top of hoppers doesn't actually do

30
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:48,059
top of hoppers doesn't actually do
 

31
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,810
top of hoppers doesn't actually do
anything like it doesn't stop the

32
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:50,820
anything like it doesn't stop the
 

33
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,080
anything like it doesn't stop the
hoppers from checking if there's any

34
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,090
hoppers from checking if there's any
 

35
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,139
hoppers from checking if there's any
items to pick up so I've mostly been

36
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:57,149
items to pick up so I've mostly been
 

37
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:58,670
items to pick up so I've mostly been
doing it just to cheap items from

38
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:58,680
doing it just to cheap items from
 

39
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,119
doing it just to cheap items from
dropping into the hoppers but just the

40
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:02,129
dropping into the hoppers but just the
 

41
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,979
dropping into the hoppers but just the
common thing to do is to put furnaces

42
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:03,989
common thing to do is to put furnaces
 

43
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,600
common thing to do is to put furnaces
above the hoppers to help prevent leg

44
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:07,610
above the hoppers to help prevent leg
 

45
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,969
above the hoppers to help prevent leg
now this is kind of a I don't know

46
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:10,979
now this is kind of a I don't know
 

47
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,560
now this is kind of a I don't know
people have actually tested this I'm

48
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:12,570
people have actually tested this I'm
 

49
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,300
people have actually tested this I'm
very curious because by doing this we're

50
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,310
very curious because by doing this we're
 

51
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,980
very curious because by doing this we're
making it so the hoppers don't have to

52
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:18,990
making it so the hoppers don't have to
 

53
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,660
making it so the hoppers don't have to
check if there's items so that should

54
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:20,670
check if there's items so that should
 

55
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,520
check if there's items so that should
reduce lag but we're also adding another

56
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:22,530
reduce lag but we're also adding another
 

57
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,120
reduce lag but we're also adding another
tile entity the the furnace here which

58
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,130
tile entity the the furnace here which
 

59
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,999
tile entity the the furnace here which
causes a little bit of lag so is it

60
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:29,009
causes a little bit of lag so is it
 

61
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,950
causes a little bit of lag so is it
actually reducing the leg overall I have

62
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
actually reducing the leg overall I have
 

63
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,260
actually reducing the leg overall I have
no idea but I'm gonna do it all right

64
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:35,270
no idea but I'm gonna do it all right
 

65
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,819
no idea but I'm gonna do it all right
where did that would end up I just would

66
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:37,829
where did that would end up I just would
 

67
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:39,950
where did that would end up I just would
win it would have went into the garbage

68
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:39,960
win it would have went into the garbage
 

69
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,950
win it would have went into the garbage
so it should be gone

70
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
so it should be gone
 

71
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,690
so it should be gone
the other mistake I made though is I

72
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:44,700
the other mistake I made though is I
 

73
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,130
the other mistake I made though is I
never put in the filler block so this is

74
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,140
never put in the filler block so this is
 

75
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,889
never put in the filler block so this is
what I did I just put like one not one

76
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:51,899
what I did I just put like one not one
 

77
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,139
what I did I just put like one not one
item in these last four slots and the

78
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:54,149
item in these last four slots and the
 

79
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,740
item in these last four slots and the
item filters no no no no no you're

80
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:57,750
item filters no no no no no you're
 

81
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,580
item filters no no no no no you're
supposed to put some other type of block

82
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:01,590
supposed to put some other type of block
 

83
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,899
supposed to put some other type of block
something other than what you're trying

84
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:02,909
something other than what you're trying
 

85
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:04,280
something other than what you're trying
to filter out and a couple of you guys

86
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,290
to filter out and a couple of you guys
 

87
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,800
to filter out and a couple of you guys
got caught that so thank you it's going

88
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:06,810
got caught that so thank you it's going
 

89
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,999
got caught that so thank you it's going
to fix that here at whoops

90
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:08,009
to fix that here at whoops
 

91
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,969
to fix that here at whoops
because otherwise if the hopper totally

92
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:10,979
because otherwise if the hopper totally
 

93
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,350
because otherwise if the hopper totally
fills that like with raw fish here

94
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
fills that like with raw fish here
 

95
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,250
fills that like with raw fish here
it's gonna mess it all up all right you

96
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,260
it's gonna mess it all up all right you
 

97
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,960
it's gonna mess it all up all right you
know what guys I don't want to just keep

98
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:18,970
know what guys I don't want to just keep
 

99
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,340
know what guys I don't want to just keep
wandering I want to figure this out for

100
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,350
wandering I want to figure this out for
 

101
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,770
wandering I want to figure this out for
myself no the true answer here so I

102

that won't influence it either so it

gonna do is go to the corner here oh and

156
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:32,910
gonna do is go to the corner here oh and
 

157
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,820
gonna do is go to the corner here oh and
we're gonna put put furnaces over top

158
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:35,830
we're gonna put put furnaces over top
 

159
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,620
we're gonna put put furnaces over top
all these hoppers and see if that raises

160
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:37,630
all these hoppers and see if that raises
 

161
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,110
all these hoppers and see if that raises
or decreases our tick rate it should

162
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,120
or decreases our tick rate it should
 

163
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,420
or decreases our tick rate it should
have some effect though for sure all

164
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:42,430
have some effect though for sure all
 

165
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,910
have some effect though for sure all
right so what we got to do 'is do a fill

166
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:44,920
right so what we got to do 'is do a fill
 

167
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,320
right so what we got to do 'is do a fill
command at our current position and 150

168
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,330
command at our current position and 150
 

169
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,090
command at our current position and 150
and 150 out from here

170
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:53,100
and 150 out from here
 

171
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,729
and 150 out from here
minecraft furnace good it's going to be

172
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:56,739
minecraft furnace good it's going to be
 

173
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,199
minecraft furnace good it's going to be
a giant leg spike while it does this

174
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:00,209
a giant leg spike while it does this
 

175
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,000
a giant leg spike while it does this
awesome yeah I did that right good so we

176
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,010
awesome yeah I did that right good so we
 

177
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,620
awesome yeah I did that right good so we
got a furnace over top every single

178
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:04,630
got a furnace over top every single
 

179
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,540
got a furnace over top every single
hopper and I'm actually going to reload

180
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:06,550
hopper and I'm actually going to reload
 

181
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,850
hopper and I'm actually going to reload
the world i reloaded it after replacing

182
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:08,860
the world i reloaded it after replacing
 

183
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,740
the world i reloaded it after replacing
the hoppers too just so we have a

184
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:10,750
the hoppers too just so we have a
 

185
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,330
the hoppers too just so we have a
consistent result here okay it's just

186
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:15,340
consistent result here okay it's just
 

187
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,130
consistent result here okay it's just
about got the whole world loaded here

188
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:17,140
about got the whole world loaded here
 

189
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,409
about got the whole world loaded here
you'll notice like the the chunks with

190
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:19,419
you'll notice like the the chunks with
 

191
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,080
you'll notice like the the chunks with
the hoppers and the furnaces in they

192
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,090
the hoppers and the furnaces in they
 

193
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,940
the hoppers and the furnaces in they
loaded a lot slower than those sandstone

194
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:23,950
loaded a lot slower than those sandstone
 

195
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,590
loaded a lot slower than those sandstone
ones out there so there

196
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:26,600
ones out there so there
 

197
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,200
ones out there so there
wait a bit more intensive but yeah we

198
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,210
wait a bit more intensive but yeah we
 

199
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,270
wait a bit more intensive but yeah we
got the world loaded all around us same

200
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
got the world loaded all around us same
 

201
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,100
got the world loaded all around us same
thing nothing's really changed here

202
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,110
thing nothing's really changed here
 

203
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,920
thing nothing's really changed here
we're going to look at the sky and just

204
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:35,930
we're going to look at the sky and just
 

205
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,690
we're going to look at the sky and just
see the difference in the tick rate as

206
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:37,700
see the difference in the tick rate as
 

207
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,420
see the difference in the tick rate as
it looks right now it seems quite a bit

208
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:40,430
it looks right now it seems quite a bit
 

209
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,500
it looks right now it seems quite a bit
higher doesn't it

210
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:41,510
higher doesn't it
 

211
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:47,890
higher doesn't it
we're at 38 39 % and it's pretty much

212
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:47,900
we're at 38 39 % and it's pretty much
 

213
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,050
we're at 38 39 % and it's pretty much
evened out it's not changing really

214
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,060
evened out it's not changing really
 

215
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,210
evened out it's not changing really
right now so 39% from 20.5% so putting

216
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:55,220
right now so 39% from 20.5% so putting
 

217
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,340
right now so 39% from 20.5% so putting
furnaces over top of opera seems like a

218
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,350
furnaces over top of opera seems like a
 

219
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,010
furnaces over top of opera seems like a
bad idea to me it seems to have made it

220
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,020
bad idea to me it seems to have made it
 

221
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,380
bad idea to me it seems to have made it
almost twice as worse tick rate on the

222
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:02,390
almost twice as worse tick rate on the
 

223
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,890
almost twice as worse tick rate on the
server so yeah don't do it

224
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:05,900
server so yeah don't do it
 

225
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,850
server so yeah don't do it
I don't think and now we know better

226
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:11,860

 

227
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,440

alright guys so let's get to it here we

228
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:14,450
alright guys so let's get to it here we
 

229
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,800
alright guys so let's get to it here we
started this armory project last episode

230
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:17,810
started this armory project last episode
 

231
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,600
started this armory project last episode
what we're trying to do first off is to

232
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:19,610
what we're trying to do first off is to
 

233
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,090
what we're trying to do first off is to
make an armor stand switching machine

234
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:22,100
make an armor stand switching machine
 

235
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,290
make an armor stand switching machine
sort of thing here

236
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:23,300
sort of thing here
 

237
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,480
sort of thing here
so basically armor stands are going to

238
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:25,490
so basically armor stands are going to
 

239
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,000
so basically armor stands are going to
fall down land over here and then we can

240
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,010
fall down land over here and then we can
 

241
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,510
fall down land over here and then we can
switch between them by pushing a button

242
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
switch between them by pushing a button
 

243
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,790
switch between them by pushing a button
or something is is the plant for this

244
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:33,800
or something is is the plant for this
 

245
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,840
or something is is the plant for this
thing um so let's go back up get out of

246
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:37,850
thing um so let's go back up get out of
 

247
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,920
thing um so let's go back up get out of
the way go back up okay

248
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:41,930
the way go back up okay
 

249
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,690
the way go back up okay
very first thing we got to do here is

250
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:43,700
very first thing we got to do here is
 

251
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,090
very first thing we got to do here is
set up like a PEZ dispenser minecart

252
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:46,100
set up like a PEZ dispenser minecart
 

253
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,210
set up like a PEZ dispenser minecart
thing and check this out I found a spot

254
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:49,220
thing and check this out I found a spot
 

255
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,490
thing and check this out I found a spot
in the man cave here one of the most

256
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:51,500
in the man cave here one of the most
 

257
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,950
in the man cave here one of the most
difficult things is finding space for

258
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:53,960
difficult things is finding space for
 

259
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,260
difficult things is finding space for
stuff but behind this little garden

260
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:56,270
stuff but behind this little garden
 

261
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,870
stuff but behind this little garden
thing I dug down and it seems like we

262
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
thing I dug down and it seems like we
 

263
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,420
thing I dug down and it seems like we
could maybe have a bit of vertical space

264
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:01,430
could maybe have a bit of vertical space
 

265
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,060
could maybe have a bit of vertical space
here we go just a couple more blocks

266
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,070
here we go just a couple more blocks
 

267
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,920
here we go just a couple more blocks
forward though we're gonna run into

268
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:05,930
forward though we're gonna run into
 

269
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,490
forward though we're gonna run into
Wilson Wilson is very close he's just

270
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:09,500
Wilson Wilson is very close he's just
 

271
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,010
Wilson Wilson is very close he's just
over there so there's maybe I don't even

272
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,020
over there so there's maybe I don't even
 

273
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,300
over there so there's maybe I don't even
know how thick this wall is it's

274
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,310
know how thick this wall is it's
 

275
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,950
know how thick this wall is it's
probably only two or three blocks thick

276
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:17,960
probably only two or three blocks thick
 

277
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,610
probably only two or three blocks thick
then right let's just mine this to

278
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:21,620
then right let's just mine this to
 

279
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,500
then right let's just mine this to
figure it out because I'd like to know

280
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:23,510
figure it out because I'd like to know
 

281
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,000
figure it out because I'd like to know
how much space we got free yeah he's

282
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,010
how much space we got free yeah he's
 

283
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,240
how much space we got free yeah he's
right over there and oh and this is

284
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,250
right over there and oh and this is
 

285
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,510
right over there and oh and this is
going to be chopped away - oh that's

286
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
going to be chopped away - oh that's
 

287
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,850
going to be chopped away - oh that's
overhang right there yeah we don't have

288
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:33,860
overhang right there yeah we don't have
 

289
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,240
overhang right there yeah we don't have
a lot of free space that is for sure but

290
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,250
a lot of free space that is for sure but
 

291
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,130
a lot of free space that is for sure but
we'll try to sneak in a minecart thing

292
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:39,140
we'll try to sneak in a minecart thing
 

293
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,220
we'll try to sneak in a minecart thing
right over here maybe

294
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,230
right over here maybe
 

295
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,350
right over here maybe
alright so the plan is let's go this way

296
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:44,360
alright so the plan is let's go this way
 

297
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,910
alright so the plan is let's go this way
a little bit more and maybe right in

298
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:48,920
a little bit more and maybe right in
 

299
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,160
a little bit more and maybe right in
this spot we'll put down our sticky

300
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,170
this spot we'll put down our sticky
 

301
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,320
this spot we'll put down our sticky
piston and our slab so the minecarts are

302
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,330
piston and our slab so the minecarts are
 

303
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,090
piston and our slab so the minecarts are
going to stack up on top of here

304
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:55,100
going to stack up on top of here
 

305
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:06,550
going to stack up on top of here
I don't like activator rails how did

306
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
I don't like activator rails how did
 

307
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,480
I don't like activator rails how did
that not push it down there I took I

308
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:13,490
that not push it down there I took I
 

309
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,510
that not push it down there I took I
don't know make no sense man a date that

310
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:16,520
don't know make no sense man a date that
 

311
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,190
don't know make no sense man a date that
date no make no sense okay I think I got

312
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:21,200
date no make no sense okay I think I got
 

313
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,630
date no make no sense okay I think I got
to figure it out here I just have to add

314
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:22,640
to figure it out here I just have to add
 

315
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,600
to figure it out here I just have to add
an extra rail between the curves section

316
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:25,610
an extra rail between the curves section
 

317
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,190
an extra rail between the curves section
here and activate a rail because there's

318
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:27,200
here and activate a rail because there's
 

319
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,890
here and activate a rail because there's
this issue in the game it's kind of

320
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:29,900
this issue in the game it's kind of
 

321
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,470
this issue in the game it's kind of
annoying whenever you like go around a

322
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:32,480
annoying whenever you like go around a
 

323
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,870
annoying whenever you like go around a
corner with a minecart

324
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880
corner with a minecart
 

325
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,750
corner with a minecart
like it when it's on the curved section

326
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:37,760
like it when it's on the curved section
 

327
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,400
like it when it's on the curved section
of the track it also activates the one

328
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:39,410
of the track it also activates the one
 

329
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,770
of the track it also activates the one
in front of it so activated rails and

330
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:41,780
in front of it so activated rails and
 

331
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,410
in front of it so activated rails and
detector rails get triggered a little

332
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:44,420
detector rails get triggered a little
 

333
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,800
detector rails get triggered a little
sooner than you want a lot of the times

334
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:46,810
sooner than you want a lot of the times
 

335
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,550
sooner than you want a lot of the times
so ya just need an extra spacing so yeah

336
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:51,560
so ya just need an extra spacing so yeah
 

337
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,740
so ya just need an extra spacing so yeah

00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:56,780
thing here track to bring the minecarts
 

341
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,250
thing here track to bring the minecarts
up to the top of the PEZ dispenser

342
00:07:59,250 --> 00:07:59,260
up to the top of the PEZ dispenser
 

343
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,870
up to the top of the PEZ dispenser
it goes up and then they fall down on

344
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:01,880
it goes up and then they fall down on
 

345
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,370
it goes up and then they fall down on
top of the stack it's just a little 2x4

346
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:05,380
top of the stack it's just a little 2x4
 

347
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,040
top of the stack it's just a little 2x4
windy rail thing here so far and then

348
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,050
windy rail thing here so far and then
 

349
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,310
windy rail thing here so far and then
they drop down there alright and when we

350
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:12,320
they drop down there alright and when we
 

351
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,880
they drop down there alright and when we
press the button here better work this

352
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:15,890
press the button here better work this
 

353
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,800
press the button here better work this
time good I think we can get rid of

354
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:17,810
time good I think we can get rid of
 

355
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,120
time good I think we can get rid of
these two now ah and armorstand falls

356
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,130
these two now ah and armorstand falls
 

357
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,880
these two now ah and armorstand falls
down there minecart falls down here

358
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:24,890
down there minecart falls down here
 

359
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:30,850
down there minecart falls down here
okay let's fall down here so basically

360
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:30,860
okay let's fall down here so basically
 

361
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,800
okay let's fall down here so basically
our armored stand oh it's not really

362
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:32,810
our armored stand oh it's not really
 

363
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,450
our armored stand oh it's not really
going to face the right way though now

364
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:34,460
going to face the right way though now
 

365
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,260
going to face the right way though now
is it

366
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,270
is it
 

367
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,880
is it
I never been thought of that it's like

368
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:36,890
I never been thought of that it's like
 

369
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,850
I never been thought of that it's like
facing sideways we want it facing us

370
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:41,860
facing sideways we want it facing us
 

371
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,860
facing sideways we want it facing us
hello never even considered that okay

372
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:46,870
hello never even considered that okay
 

373
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,260
hello never even considered that okay
that's gonna be a pain to fix but

374
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,270
that's gonna be a pain to fix but
 

375
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,760
that's gonna be a pain to fix but
basically when we go to switches

376
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:51,770
basically when we go to switches
 

377
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,130
basically when we go to switches
armorstand with the next one

378
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:54,140
armorstand with the next one
 

379
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,900
armorstand with the next one
what we got to do is then bring this

380
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:55,910
what we got to do is then bring this
 

381
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,150
what we got to do is then bring this
empty minecart by to pick it up picks it

382
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,160
empty minecart by to pick it up picks it
 

383
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,410
empty minecart by to pick it up picks it
up and then it's got to bring it to the

384
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:02,420
up and then it's got to bring it to the
 

385
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,510
up and then it's got to bring it to the
top of the PEZ dispenser stack and

386
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:04,520
top of the PEZ dispenser stack and
 

387
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,980
top of the PEZ dispenser stack and
that's our complete cycle so I got to

388
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:05,990
that's our complete cycle so I got to
 

389
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,400
that's our complete cycle so I got to
connect this to that open-ended track we

390
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:09,410
connect this to that open-ended track we
 

391
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,700
connect this to that open-ended track we
have up there all right check it out

392
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:12,710
have up there all right check it out
 

393
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,600
have up there all right check it out
guys so we got our armor stand here and

394
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,610
guys so we got our armor stand here and
 

395
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,710
guys so we got our armor stand here and
we're going to address it I'll put a

396
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:17,720
we're going to address it I'll put a
 

397
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,210
we're going to address it I'll put a
helmet on this one press the button down

398
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:22,220
helmet on this one press the button down
 

399
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,730
helmet on this one press the button down
comes next one and you might have saw

400
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:24,740
comes next one and you might have saw
 

401
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,470
comes next one and you might have saw
that minecart on the right there falling

402
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
that minecart on the right there falling
 

403
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,810
that minecart on the right there falling
down so it gets into position we give

404
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:28,820
down so it gets into position we give
 

405
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,270
down so it gets into position we give
our pants to this one and I really like

406
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:34,280
our pants to this one and I really like
 

407
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,220
our pants to this one and I really like
the effect like this is the best part of

408
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:36,230
the effect like this is the best part of
 

409
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,100
the effect like this is the best part of
any redstone thing like when you have an

410
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,110
any redstone thing like when you have an
 

411
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,760
any redstone thing like when you have an
idea a lot of times there's a lot of

412
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:42,770
idea a lot of times there's a lot of
 

413
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,770
idea a lot of times there's a lot of
details I can get in the way of your

414
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:44,780
details I can get in the way of your
 

415
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,420
details I can get in the way of your
idea actually coming out the way you

416
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:46,430
idea actually coming out the way you
 

417
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,850
idea actually coming out the way you
want it to but this is exactly what I

418
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:48,860
want it to but this is exactly what I
 

419
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,560
want it to but this is exactly what I
had in mind you know I was able to pull

420
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:50,570
had in mind you know I was able to pull
 

421
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,750
had in mind you know I was able to pull
it off so I'm very very happy with this

422
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:52,760
it off so I'm very very happy with this
 

423
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,000
it off so I'm very very happy with this
build this is exactly what I wanted and

424
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,010
build this is exactly what I wanted and
 

425
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,700
build this is exactly what I wanted and
it works and we can see it working now

426
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:00,710
it works and we can see it working now
 

427
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,850
it works and we can see it working now
it's great so yeah we can cycle through

428
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:03,860
it's great so yeah we can cycle through
 

429
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,620
it's great so yeah we can cycle through
our different armor collections or

430
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:05,630
our different armor collections or
 

431
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,690
our different armor collections or
whatever kind of a cool effect I liked

432
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:07,700
whatever kind of a cool effect I liked
 

433
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,900
whatever kind of a cool effect I liked
it one thing I got to watch for is I

434
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:10,910
it one thing I got to watch for is I
 

435
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,110
it one thing I got to watch for is I
can't press the button before the

436
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,120
can't press the button before the
 

437
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,240
can't press the button before the
minecart actually lands there if I press

438
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,250
minecart actually lands there if I press
 

439
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,900
minecart actually lands there if I press
it as quick as possible I could

440
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:19,910
it as quick as possible I could
 

441
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,030
it as quick as possible I could
potentially mess it up you see how it

442
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,040
potentially mess it up you see how it
 

443
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
potentially mess it up you see how it
takes micro a little bit of time to fall

444
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,050
takes micro a little bit of time to fall
 

445
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,200
takes micro a little bit of time to fall
down the reason for that is just because

446
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,210
down the reason for that is just because
 

447
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,600
down the reason for that is just because
we got a little bit of a jumble with our

448
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:28,610
we got a little bit of a jumble with our
 

449
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,430
we got a little bit of a jumble with our
track here I need to shorten this track

450
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:30,440
track here I need to shorten this track
 

451
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,640
track here I need to shorten this track
if possible but ideally I want this PEZ

452
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:33,650
if possible but ideally I want this PEZ
 

453
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,290
if possible but ideally I want this PEZ
dispenser set up like over here we can't

454
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:38,300
dispenser set up like over here we can't
 

455
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,340
dispenser set up like over here we can't
do that because of the our man cave

456
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,350
do that because of the our man cave
 

457
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,380
do that because of the our man cave
getting in the way so I had to put it

458
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:44,390
getting in the way so I had to put it
 

459
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,540
getting in the way so I had to put it
over here made the track longer which

460
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:46,550
over here made the track longer which
 

461
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,550
over here made the track longer which
makes it a little longer to reset than I

462
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
makes it a little longer to reset than I
 

463
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,350
makes it a little longer to reset than I
would like but other than that it's

464
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:50,360
would like but other than that it's
 

465
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,920
would like but other than that it's
pretty much perfect I could add some

466
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:52,930
pretty much perfect I could add some
 

467
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,170
pretty much perfect I could add some
safety mechanism but I can just try to

468
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:56,180
safety mechanism but I can just try to
 

469
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,710
safety mechanism but I can just try to
remember not to press it to play for too

470
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
remember not to press it to play for too
 

471
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,400
remember not to press it to play for too
oh yeah and I'll just show you guys how

472
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,410
oh yeah and I'll just show you guys how
 

473
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,930
oh yeah and I'll just show you guys how
I finish this up as well in case you

474
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:03,940
I finish this up as well in case you
 

475
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,400
I finish this up as well in case you
want to build something similar to this

476
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,410
want to build something similar to this
 

477
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,950
want to build something similar to this
yourself I was worried about the

478
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:07,960
yourself I was worried about the
 

479
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,500
yourself I was worried about the
armorstand rotation which way it was

480
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:10,510
armorstand rotation which way it was
 

481
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,870
armorstand rotation which way it was
facing turns out it all depends on which

482
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
facing turns out it all depends on which
 

483
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,580
facing turns out it all depends on which
way you place it at the start so if I

484
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:14,590
way you place it at the start so if I
 

485
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,930
way you place it at the start so if I
place it that way it's going to be

486
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:15,940
place it that way it's going to be
 

487
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,350
place it that way it's going to be
facing us if I place it this way it's

488
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
facing us if I place it this way it's
 

489
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,540
facing us if I place it this way it's
going to be always beside ways getting

490
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:21,550
going to be always beside ways getting
 

491
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,280
going to be always beside ways getting
ejected from the minecart doesn't

492
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,290
ejected from the minecart doesn't
 

493
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,720
ejected from the minecart doesn't
actually rotate it like I thought was

494
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:24,730
actually rotate it like I thought was
 

495
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,030
actually rotate it like I thought was
happening so that's good that was a

496
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
happening so that's good that was a
 

497
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,290
happening so that's good that was a
simple fix yeah so got the button here

498
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:31,300
simple fix yeah so got the button here
 

499
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,050
simple fix yeah so got the button here
basically that just goes down to this

500
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:34,060
basically that just goes down to this
 

501
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,880
basically that just goes down to this
block right this block has a torch on it

502
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:38,890
block right this block has a torch on it
 

503
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,730
block right this block has a torch on it
so this is these Pistons are extended by

504
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:41,740
so this is these Pistons are extended by
 

505
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,080
so this is these Pistons are extended by
defaults it also goes off to our power

506
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,090
defaults it also goes off to our power
 

507
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,650
defaults it also goes off to our power
rail here which is currently unpowered

508
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:48,660
rail here which is currently unpowered
 

509
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,120
rail here which is currently unpowered
so when we press the button makes

510
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,130
so when we press the button makes
 

511
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,270
so when we press the button makes
minecart move goes underneath the

512
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,280
minecart move goes underneath the
 

513
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,160
minecart move goes underneath the
armorstand or gets dropped here and goes

514
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,170
armorstand or gets dropped here and goes
 

515
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,140
armorstand or gets dropped here and goes
up to our Pez dispensers so I added this

516
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,150
up to our Pez dispensers so I added this
 

517
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,090
up to our Pez dispensers so I added this
line in here this goes up and kind of

518
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:03,100
line in here this goes up and kind of
 

519
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,850
line in here this goes up and kind of
connects that thing we built earlier we

520
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:05,860
connects that thing we built earlier we
 

521
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,130
connects that thing we built earlier we
do have room for a lot more minecarts

522
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,140
do have room for a lot more minecarts
 

523
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,280
do have room for a lot more minecarts
here too if we want to add more and

524
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,290
here too if we want to add more and
 

525
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,610
here too if we want to add more and
let's see I added in a wire here to

526
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:14,620
let's see I added in a wire here to
 

527
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,920
let's see I added in a wire here to
connect to this piston from the button

528
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:16,930
connect to this piston from the button
 

529
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:23,730
connect to this piston from the button
down below that is just over yeah so

530
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:23,740
down below that is just over yeah so
 

531
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,830
down below that is just over yeah so
from from this wire here goes through

532
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:25,840
from from this wire here goes through
 

533
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,770
from from this wire here goes through
this block over here and then up up to

534
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:28,780
this block over here and then up up to
 

535
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,560
this block over here and then up up to
that that piston there and that's pretty

536
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:31,570
that that piston there and that's pretty
 

537
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,700
that that piston there and that's pretty
much all there is to it

538
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:32,710
much all there is to it
 

539
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:38,130
much all there is to it
so we can fill this in nicely all the

540
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,140
so we can fill this in nicely all the
 

541
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,100
so we can fill this in nicely all the
way pretty sure

going to do we have these six chests
 

573
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,030
going to do we have these six chests
probably do some item frame things we

574
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,040
probably do some item frame things we
 

575
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,130
probably do some item frame things we
got our tools here so we do like sword

here what do you guys think of this do
 

613
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,680
here what do you guys think of this do
you like it - do you not like it

yes no maybe I'm on the maybe fence with

616
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:24,260
yes no maybe I'm on the maybe fence with
 

617
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,320
yes no maybe I'm on the maybe fence with
this bill that it's like it's okay it's

618
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,330
this bill that it's like it's okay it's
 

619
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:34,870
this bill that it's like it's okay it's
passable I fall down again uh uh I'm not

620
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
passable I fall down again uh uh I'm not
 

621
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,920
passable I fall down again uh uh I'm not
in love with it you know there's

622
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:35,930
in love with it you know there's
 

623
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,690
in love with it you know there's
something about it it's not it's not

624
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:37,700
something about it it's not it's not
 

625
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,130
something about it it's not it's not
there it looks very convoluted like

626
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,140
there it looks very convoluted like
 

627
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,020
there it looks very convoluted like
there's too much stuff going on on this

628
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,030
there's too much stuff going on on this
 

629
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,230
there's too much stuff going on on this
clean clay surface I think that's a

630
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:47,240
clean clay surface I think that's a
 

631
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,810

here where we put spruce stairs over top
 

667
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,590
here where we put spruce stairs over top
problem is we can't do it over there

668

problem is we can't do it over there
 

669
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,059
problem is we can't do it over there
because we got the rails in the back so

670
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:40,069
because we got the rails in the back so
 

671
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:42,540
because we got the rails in the back so
I think maybe that was a mistake so

672

675
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,309
we're gonna switch it back I think and
also it makes it look a little bit more

676
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:48,319
also it makes it look a little bit more
 

677
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:50,499
also it makes it look a little bit more

749
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,500
here nobody's ever liked it right but I
didn't know what to do with it so

750
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:28,510
didn't know what to do with it so
 

751
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,360
didn't know what to do with it so
recently I had the idea of using maybe

752
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,370
recently I had the idea of using maybe
 

753
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,900

glass here and just see what that looks
 

757
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,190
glass here and just see what that looks
like I think it'll fit a little bit

758
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,200
like I think it'll fit a little bit
 

759
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,350
like I think it'll fit a little bit
better than the packed ice and maybe

760
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
better than the packed ice and maybe
 

761
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,330
better than the packed ice and maybe
above it we'll try put see lanterns or

762

above it we'll try put see lanterns or
 

763
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,030
above it we'll try put see lanterns or
some some type of lighting if we can

764
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,040
some some type of lighting if we can
 

765
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,880
some some type of lighting if we can
make that work might mix in some purple

766

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:34,260
putting sea lanterns throughout the
 

843
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,930
putting sea lanterns throughout the
whole thing like behind the glass there

whole thing like behind the glass there
 

845
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,450
whole thing like behind the glass there
but it didn't look very good I think

846
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:38,460
but it didn't look very good I think
 

847
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,090
but it didn't look very good I think
because uh sea lanterns have those lines

848
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:41,100
because uh sea lanterns have those lines
 

849
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,280
because uh sea lanterns have those lines
on the edges and it just makes like a

850
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,290
on the edges and it just makes like a
 

851
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,820
on the edges and it just makes like a

now it's not as good but when I play

1058
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,010
now it's not as good but when I play
 

1059

in mind it's not just for me
 

1063
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,200
in mind it's not just for me
if it was just for me I'd probably use a

1064
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,210
if it was just for me I'd probably use a
 

1065
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,540
if it was just for me I'd probably use a
texture pack or try it out at least but

1066
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:02,550
texture pack or try it out at least but
 

1067
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,210
texture pack or try it out at least but
it's also for you guys and the more

1068
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:05,220
it's also for you guys and the more
 

1069
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,790
it's also for you guys and the more
things I change the more difficult it is

1070
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:07,800
things I change the more difficult it is
 

1071
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,720
things I change the more difficult it is
to light understand what's happening and

1072
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:11,730
to light understand what's happening and
 

1073
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,780
to light understand what's happening and
also it removes a lot of the challenge

1074
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:14,790
also it removes a lot of the challenge
 

1075
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,390
also it removes a lot of the challenge
oh man that activated again removes a

1076
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:17,400
oh man that activated again removes a
 

1077
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,920
oh man that activated again removes a
lot of the challenge out of the game too

1078
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:18,930
lot of the challenge out of the game too
 

1079
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,900
lot of the challenge out of the game too
I kind of look as a challenge trying to

1080
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:20,910
I kind of look as a challenge trying to
 

1081
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,060
I kind of look as a challenge trying to
make things look good with the manila

1082
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,070
make things look good with the manila
 

1083
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,650
make things look good with the manila
textures can be a bit tricky because

1084
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:26,660
textures can be a bit tricky because
 

1085
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,000
textures can be a bit tricky because
like they've been released over the

1086
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,010
like they've been released over the
 

1087
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,120
like they've been released over the
years and they don't always synergize

1088
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,130
years and they don't always synergize
 

1089
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:36,500
years and they don't always synergize
well with each other you know and some

1090
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:36,510
well with each other you know and some
 

1091
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,420
well with each other you know and some
of the some of the blocks really need to

1092
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:38,430
of the some of the blocks really need to
 

1093
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,240
of the some of the blocks really need to
redo like diorite granites

1094
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,250
redo like diorite granites
 

1095
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,370
redo like diorite granites
andesite I think look terrible if the

1096
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:43,380
andesite I think look terrible if the
 

1097
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,780
andesite I think look terrible if the
texture was changed found them it would

1098
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:44,790
texture was changed found them it would
 

1099
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,960
texture was changed found them it would
be a huge improvement but in certain

1100
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:47,970
be a huge improvement but in certain
 

1101
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,630
be a huge improvement but in certain
cases you can make it look good so it's

1102
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,640
cases you can make it look good so it's
 

1103
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,760
