there you place the next block and

712
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880
there you place the next block and
 

713
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,590
there you place the next block and
another block

714
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
another block

me
 

723
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,470

um there's a better way of placing the

724
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
um there's a better way of placing the
 

725
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,189
um there's a better way of placing the
sugar cane in the water at first i

726
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
sugar cane in the water at first i
 

727
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,629
sugar cane in the water at first i
thought it was the same thing as i did

728
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
thought it was the same thing as i did
 

729
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,350
thought it was the same thing as i did
but

730
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
but
 

731
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,990
but
i plotted it down on paper and is better

732
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
i plotted it down on paper and is better
 

733
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,629
i plotted it down on paper and is better
so thank you for that suggestion and

734
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
so thank you for that suggestion and
 

735
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,710
so thank you for that suggestion and
i may try to modify what i got already

736
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
i may try to modify what i got already
 

737
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,310
i may try to modify what i got already
to be that pattern

738
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
to be that pattern
 

739
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,670
to be that pattern
or i'll

740
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680

 

741
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,949

anything future i put in i'll

742
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
anything future i put in i'll
 

743
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,150
anything future i put in i'll
use use this pattern here so thank you

744
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
use use this pattern here so thank you
 

745
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,750

everybody
 

749
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,949
everybody
so that's an idea of how it would work

750
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
so that's an idea of how it would work
 

751
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,310
so that's an idea of how it would work
although i

752
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
although i
 

753
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,430
although i
gotta shorten it that was too long and

754
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,440
gotta shorten it that was too long and
 

755
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,269
gotta shorten it that was too long and
then the idea is

756
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
then the idea is
 

757
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,030
then the idea is
after i read the comments i would put

758
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
after i read the comments i would put
 

759
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,030
after i read the comments i would put
them in a chest

760
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
them in a chest
 

761
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,829
them in a chest
i was planning to build like a library

762
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:31,839
i was planning to build like a library
 

763
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,069
i was planning to build like a library
or something to hold the chests

764
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
or something to hold the chests
 

765
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,150
or something to hold the chests
and each chest would have an episode

766
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
and each chest would have an episode
 

767
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,310
and each chest would have an episode
number for it

768
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
number for it
 

769
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,790
number for it
put them in and they would that would

770
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
put them in and they would that would
 

771
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,790
put them in and they would that would
serve like is the archive for the book

772
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,800
serve like is the archive for the book
 

773
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,710
serve like is the archive for the book
so i don't throw them away

774
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
so i don't throw them away
 

775
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,509
so i don't throw them away
keep them there and build like a library

776
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
keep them there and build like a library
 

777
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,910
keep them there and build like a library
or some kind of building to hold

778
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
or some kind of building to hold
 

779
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,670
or some kind of building to hold
the chest which could be a fun project

780
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
the chest which could be a fun project
 

781
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,590
the chest which could be a fun project
too so

782

be randomly in the middle of an episode

792
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:05,360
be randomly in the middle of an episode

or
at the very end of an episode which do

796
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
at the very end of an episode which do
 

797
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,509
at the very end of an episode which do
you think would be

798
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
you think would be
 

799
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,710
you think would be
better

800
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720

 

801
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,110

all right moving on uh the other day i

802
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
all right moving on uh the other day i
 

803
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,790
all right moving on uh the other day i
went through the sheep farm and did some

804
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
went through the sheep farm and did some
 

805
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,550
went through the sheep farm and did some
more fine tuning i'll just show you that

806
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
more fine tuning i'll just show you that
 

807
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,069
more fine tuning i'll just show you that
real quick

808
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
real quick
 

809
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,749
real quick
before the walls were all flat now i

810
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
before the walls were all flat now i
 

811
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,550
before the walls were all flat now i
have these little indents

812
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
have these little indents
 

813
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,110
have these little indents
on both sides which are kind of cool it

814
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
on both sides which are kind of cool it
 

815
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,389
on both sides which are kind of cool it
gives it more character

816
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
gives it more character
 

817
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,949
gives it more character
and also the ceiling was completely flat

818
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
and also the ceiling was completely flat
 

819
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,389
and also the ceiling was completely flat
before

820
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
before
 

821
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,509
before
now we have these half slabs half slab

822
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
now we have these half slabs half slab
 

823
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,269
now we have these half slabs half slab
beams

824
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:37,279
beams
 

825
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,310
beams
every every so often to give it

826
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
every every so often to give it
 

827
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,990
every every so often to give it
more more shape i guess

828
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
more more shape i guess
 

829
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,030
more more shape i guess
uh there's also some dead sheep which

830
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
uh there's also some dead sheep which
 

831
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,710
uh there's also some dead sheep which
have been replaced and

832
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
have been replaced and
 

833
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,870
have been replaced and
also the sheep that was wandering around

834
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
also the sheep that was wandering around
 

835
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,629
also the sheep that was wandering around
has been put back

836
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
has been put back
 

837
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,110
has been put back
so all is good in the sheep farm

838
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120

 

839
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,509

you know what i would like to try out is

840
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
you know what i would like to try out is
 

841
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,030
you know what i would like to try out is
this thing

842
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
this thing
 

843
