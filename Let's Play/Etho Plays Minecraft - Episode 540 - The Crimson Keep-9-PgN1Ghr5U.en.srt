pretty tall actually this is what we
 

77
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,330
pretty tall actually this is what we
ended up with we have like 64 fungi

78
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:43,340
ended up with we have like 64 fungi
 

79

last episode we did some trading with
 

83
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,100
last episode we did some trading with
the big lens and we ended up getting

84
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,110
the big lens and we ended up getting
 

85
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,870
the big lens and we ended up getting
another right-o off of them I've been

86
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:49,880
another right-o off of them I've been
 

87

another right-o off of them I've been
chanted it now with efficiency and we

88
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:52,280
chanted it now with efficiency and we
 

89
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,190
chanted it now with efficiency and we
can instant mine and other work blocks

90
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,200
can instant mine and other work blocks
 

91
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,740
can instant mine and other work blocks
that grow on these trees which is pretty

92
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:56,750
that grow on these trees which is pretty
 

93
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,499

cool in instant - shroom lights with it

94
00:01:59,499 --> 00:01:59,509
cool in instant - shroom lights with it
 

95
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:05,200
cool in instant - shroom lights with it
as well okay so looking at this I'm

96
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,210
as well okay so looking at this I'm
 

97
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,430
as well okay so looking at this I'm
pretty sure the nether wart blocks

98
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:06,440
pretty sure the nether wart blocks
 

99
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,380
pretty sure the nether wart blocks
overwrite the wood if they grow overtop

100
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:08,390
overwrite the wood if they grow overtop
 

101
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,540
overwrite the wood if they grow overtop
of it so we ended up with very little

102
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:10,550
of it so we ended up with very little
 

103
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,479
of it so we ended up with very little
wood here actually probably best not to

104
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:13,489
wood here actually probably best not to
 

105
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:16,509
wood here actually probably best not to
grow them together like this then but it

106
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:16,519
grow them together like this then but it
 

107
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:19,540
grow them together like this then but it
was interesting to try it out yep yep

108
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:19,550
was interesting to try it out yep yep
 

109
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,100
was interesting to try it out yep yep
and as you saw there we can also

110
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,110
and as you saw there we can also
 

111
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,590
and as you saw there we can also
instantly mine the crimson and warp

112
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:23,600
instantly mine the crimson and warp
 

113
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,900
instantly mine the crimson and warp
woods and you can use these the craft

114
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:25,910
woods and you can use these the craft
 

115
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,030
woods and you can use these the craft
wood products like chests and stuff so

116
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,040
wood products like chests and stuff so
 

117
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,759
wood products like chests and stuff so
that's a new way of collecting wood

118
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:30,769
that's a new way of collecting wood
 

119
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:32,830
that's a new way of collecting wood
quickly because like spruce you can't

120
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:32,840
quickly because like spruce you can't
 

121
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,360
quickly because like spruce you can't
instant mind none of the other wood

122
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,370

the basalt block guys which is a
 

129
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,610
the basalt block guys which is a
especially interesting one so basalts

130
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:45,620
especially interesting one so basalts
 

131
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,550

has its own biome basalt delta's you'll

132
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
has its own biome basalt delta's you'll
 

133
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,900
has its own biome basalt delta's you'll
find plenty of the stuff there if you

134
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:49,910
find plenty of the stuff there if you
 

135
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,210
find plenty of the stuff there if you
need it but even if that's not enough

136
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:52,220
need it but even if that's not enough
 

137
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,220

00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,230
they made a way for you to be able to
 

139
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,850
they made a way for you to be able to
generate it so if you put lava and have

generate it so if you put lava and have
 

141
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,280
generate it so if you put lava and have
it flow over top a soul soil and then

142
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,290
it flow over top a soul soil and then
 

143
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,780
it flow over top a soul soil and then
touch some blue ice it'll create a

144
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:01,790
touch some blue ice it'll create a
 

145
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,050

basalt block in the middle here I messed

146
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,060
basalt block in the middle here I messed
 

147
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,430

around with a few different firms for

148
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:06,440
around with a few different firms for

this obviously you make afk farms and

150
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:08,569
this obviously you make afk farms and
 

151
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:10,210
this obviously you make afk farms and
stuff with it but I thought this one was

152
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:10,220
stuff with it but I thought this one was
 

153
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,630
stuff with it but I thought this one was
particularly satisfying and interesting

154
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:13,640
particularly satisfying and interesting
 

155
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,590

maybe a little less obvious can you use

156
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:17,600
maybe a little less obvious can you use
 

157
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,210
maybe a little less obvious can you use
some note blocks here and can easily

158
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,220
some note blocks here and can easily
 

159
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,090
some note blocks here and can easily
make a bunch of smart pistons to create

00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:31,319
some more browsing around looking
 

313
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,290
some more browsing around looking
through the nether and I have found a

314
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:33,300
through the nether and I have found a
 

315
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,919
through the nether and I have found a
spot it's at minus 1,000 minus 3,500

316
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:36,929
spot it's at minus 1,000 minus 3,500

00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,959
spot it's at minus 1,000 minus 3,500
here so it's a little ways from 0 0 but

318
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:38,969
here so it's a little ways from 0 0 but
 

319
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:40,819
here so it's a little ways from 0 0 but
it's not crazy I think that's a doable

00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:40,829
it's not crazy I think that's a doable

trip still as far as building scheme the
 

323
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:45,259
trip still as far as building scheme the
block pellet I wanted to use the black

324
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:45,269
block pellet I wanted to use the black
 

325
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:47,359
block pellet I wanted to use the black
stone it's a new cool block right and

326
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:47,369
stone it's a new cool block right and
 

327
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:50,239
stone it's a new cool block right and
then I thought hey crimson forest is my

328
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:50,249
then I thought hey crimson forest is my
 

329
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:52,040
then I thought hey crimson forest is my
favorite of the biomes let's go for red

330
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,050
favorite of the biomes let's go for red
 

331
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,019
favorite of the biomes let's go for red
so we're probably gonna use the crimson

332
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:54,029
so we're probably gonna use the crimson
 

333
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:56,239
so we're probably gonna use the crimson
wood maybe some other red blocks to mix

334
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:56,249
wood maybe some other red blocks to mix
 

335
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,049
wood maybe some other red blocks to mix
in with it and then I started thinking

336
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:00,059
in with it and then I started thinking
 

337
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:03,319
in with it and then I started thinking
what else would go with these two it's

338
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:03,329
what else would go with these two it's
 

339
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:06,049
what else would go with these two it's
like ok oranges yellows and light gray I

340
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:06,059
like ok oranges yellows and light gray I
 

341
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,019
like ok oranges yellows and light gray I
think that's like a traditional Chinese

342
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:09,029
think that's like a traditional Chinese
 

343
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,729
think that's like a traditional Chinese
color scheme I could be wrong about that

344
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:10,739
color scheme I could be wrong about that
 

345
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:15,159
color scheme I could be wrong about that
though but I see like fancy Chinese

346
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:15,169
though but I see like fancy Chinese
 

347
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,569
though but I see like fancy Chinese
buildings like in moving the movies and

348
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:17,579
buildings like in moving the movies and
 

349
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:19,519
buildings like in moving the movies and
stuff I think of these colors for some

350
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:19,529
stuff I think of these colors for some
 

351
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:21,889
stuff I think of these colors for some
reason so that is what inspired it and

352
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:21,899
reason so that is what inspired it and
 

353
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,769
reason so that is what inspired it and
now as far as location goes I wanted a

354
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:24,779
now as far as location goes I wanted a
 

355
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,289
now as far as location goes I wanted a
area with like two big land masses like

356
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:27,299
area with like two big land masses like
 

357
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:29,569
area with like two big land masses like
big landmass here at big landmass here

358
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:29,579
big landmass here at big landmass here
 

359
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,549
big landmass here at big landmass here
and I'm lava moat in the middle and I

360
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:31,559
and I'm lava moat in the middle and I
 

361
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:33,979
and I'm lava moat in the middle and I
wanted to build a big bridge to like a

362
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:33,989
wanted to build a big bridge to like a
 

363
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:38,089
wanted to build a big bridge to like a
castle let's go take a look around look

364
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:38,099
castle let's go take a look around look
 

365
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,759
castle let's go take a look around look
at this we are in this pretty amazing

366
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:40,769
at this we are in this pretty amazing
 

367
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,469
at this we are in this pretty amazing
nether fortress actually and it looks

368
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
nether fortress actually and it looks
 

369
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,819
nether fortress actually and it looks
pretty cool but then it joins up with a

370
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:45,829
pretty cool but then it joins up with a
 

371
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:48,109
pretty cool but then it joins up with a
what do you call it a bastion or

372
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:48,119
what do you call it a bastion or
 

373
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:50,989
what do you call it a bastion or
something one of the new structures in

374
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:50,999
something one of the new structures in
 

375
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:53,169
something one of the new structures in
the game let's take a little peek inside

376
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:53,179
the game let's take a little peek inside
 

377
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:55,939
the game let's take a little peek inside
and I recognise the layout of this one

378
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:55,949
and I recognise the layout of this one
 

379
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:58,899
and I recognise the layout of this one
it is the one with the make my slime

380
00:07:58,899 --> 00:07:58,909
it is the one with the make my slime
 

381
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:02,449
it is the one with the make my slime
spawner inside and like the giant room

382
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:02,459
spawner inside and like the giant room
 

383
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:08,829
spawner inside and like the giant room
so I got to thinking this is pretty cool

384
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:08,839

 

385
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,819

probably very dangerous in here by the

386
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:10,829
probably very dangerous in here by the
 

387
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:15,109
probably very dangerous in here by the
way oh I thought I heard someone load up

388
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:15,119
way oh I thought I heard someone load up
 

389
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,259
way oh I thought I heard someone load up
the crossbow yeah yeah so the fortress

390
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:18,269
the crossbow yeah yeah so the fortress
 

391
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:21,729
the crossbow yeah yeah so the fortress
goes right into this thing actually and

392
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:21,739
goes right into this thing actually and
 

393
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:27,919
goes right into this thing actually and
I was thinking maybe let's move inside

394
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:27,929
I was thinking maybe let's move inside
 

395
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:29,989
I was thinking maybe let's move inside
and like take this place over or

396
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:29,999
and like take this place over or
 

397
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:32,540
and like take this place over or
renovate it or do something similar of

398
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:32,550
renovate it or do something similar of
 

399
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,089
renovate it or do something similar of
that nature so I was looking around

400
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:35,099
that nature so I was looking around
 

401
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,110
that nature so I was looking around
outside of the the bastion here oh I

402
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
outside of the the bastion here oh I
 

403
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,519
outside of the the bastion here oh I
should eat before I jump down that was

404
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:40,529
should eat before I jump down that was
 

405
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:46,240
should eat before I jump down that was
dangerous I got caught up on that bridge

406
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,250
dangerous I got caught up on that bridge
 

407
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,990
dangerous I got caught up on that bridge
bad news

408
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
bad news
 

409
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,799
bad news
oh there's no lava and freaked me out

410
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:54,809
oh there's no lava and freaked me out
 

411
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:58,220
oh there's no lava and freaked me out
really bad I think this is where we want

412
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,230
really bad I think this is where we want
 

413
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:04,369
really bad I think this is where we want
to do it if we yeah I think I think this

414
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:04,379
to do it if we yeah I think I think this
 

415
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:06,230
to do it if we yeah I think I think this
is the side over here so I was looking

416
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
is the side over here so I was looking
 

417
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,379
is the side over here so I was looking
around outside yeah here it is there's a

418
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:09,389
around outside yeah here it is there's a
 

419
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:14,360
around outside yeah here it is there's a
big big lava area here and then we got

420
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,370
big big lava area here and then we got
 

421
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,970
big big lava area here and then we got
more of the crimson forest over over

422
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:16,980
more of the crimson forest over over
 

423
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,160
more of the crimson forest over over
here so what I'm thinking we're gonna

424
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,170
here so what I'm thinking we're gonna
 

425
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,549
here so what I'm thinking we're gonna
start here with our build I'm gonna

426
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:22,559
start here with our build I'm gonna
 

427
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,939
start here with our build I'm gonna
build a big massive bridge from here to

428
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:25,949
build a big massive bridge from here to
 

429
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:27,769
build a big massive bridge from here to
there and then we'll build like a

430
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:27,779
there and then we'll build like a
 

431
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,980
there and then we'll build like a
cool-looking castle facade in front of

432
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:30,990
cool-looking castle facade in front of
 

433
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,040
cool-looking castle facade in front of
that thing and then that bastion is

434
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,050
that thing and then that bastion is
 

435
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,619
that thing and then that bastion is
gonna be the interior of our base okay

436
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:36,629
gonna be the interior of our base okay
 

437
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:38,419
gonna be the interior of our base okay
so let's get to it here guys so the

438
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:38,429
so let's get to it here guys so the
 

439
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:40,249
so let's get to it here guys so the
first thing I did is I just set up a

440
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:40,259
first thing I did is I just set up a
 

441
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,439
first thing I did is I just set up a
temporary hut while we fill this up with

442
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:42,449
temporary hut while we fill this up with
 

443
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,659
temporary hut while we fill this up with
chests and like the stonecutter and

444
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:44,669
chests and like the stonecutter and
 

445
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:46,429
chests and like the stonecutter and
different different things

446
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:46,439
different different things
 

447
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:48,980
different different things
so when I fill my inventory book jungle

448
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:48,990
so when I fill my inventory book jungle
 

449
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,590
so when I fill my inventory book jungle
somewhere to drop it off then I built

450
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
somewhere to drop it off then I built
 

451
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,350
somewhere to drop it off then I built
like a temporary bridge to so I can try

452
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:54,360
like a temporary bridge to so I can try
 

453
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,180
like a temporary bridge to so I can try
figure out how I wanted to line up with

454
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,190
figure out how I wanted to line up with
 

455
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,269
figure out how I wanted to line up with
the bastion here like what height level

456
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
the bastion here like what height level
 

457
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,030
the bastion here like what height level
the bridge should be you fit through

458
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,040
the bridge should be you fit through
 

459
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,630
the bridge should be you fit through
there really you're not not after that I

460
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
there really you're not not after that I
 

461
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,940
there really you're not not after that I
think this is a center unfortunately

462
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:10,950
think this is a center unfortunately
 

463
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,980
think this is a center unfortunately
it's like an even number so I'll

464
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:12,990
it's like an even number so I'll
 

465
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,750
it's like an even number so I'll
probably have to either lopsided to this

466
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:14,760
probably have to either lopsided to this
 

467
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,829
probably have to either lopsided to this
side or over here this is about 45

468
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:18,839
side or over here this is about 45
 

469
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,840
side or over here this is about 45
blocks long from from that Island to the

470
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:20,850
blocks long from from that Island to the
 

471
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,040
blocks long from from that Island to the
bastion now I need to figure out roughly

472
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,050
bastion now I need to figure out roughly
 

473
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,170
bastion now I need to figure out roughly
what I'm calling the wall here so this

474
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:30,180
what I'm calling the wall here so this
 

475
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,320
what I'm calling the wall here so this
is like a walkway area inside what's

476
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,330
is like a walkway area inside what's
 

477
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,579
is like a walkway area inside what's
behind here we got a staircase and then

478
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:37,589
behind here we got a staircase and then
 

479
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:39,230
behind here we got a staircase and then
it looks like the wall is like two

480
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,240
it looks like the wall is like two
 

481
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,370
it looks like the wall is like two
blocks here actually so I'm gonna try go

482
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:43,380
blocks here actually so I'm gonna try go
 

483
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,769
blocks here actually so I'm gonna try go
off of odd numbers as much as I can so

484
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:45,779
off of odd numbers as much as I can so
 

485
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,949
off of odd numbers as much as I can so
let's uh say it's three blocks wide and

486
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:47,959
let's uh say it's three blocks wide and
 

487
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:50,780
let's uh say it's three blocks wide and
then like this is a big cube this

488
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:50,790
then like this is a big cube this
 

489
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,280
then like this is a big cube this
building here so if we want to give it

490
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,290
building here so if we want to give it
 

491
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,590
building here so if we want to give it
any shape or definition we're gonna need

492
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:54,600
any shape or definition we're gonna need
 

493
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,389
any shape or definition we're gonna need
to come out quite a few blocks away from

494
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
to come out quite a few blocks away from
 

495
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,449
to come out quite a few blocks away from
that so I'm thinking at least seven

496
00:10:59,449 --> 00:10:59,459
that so I'm thinking at least seven
 

497
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,329
that so I'm thinking at least seven
probably more two three four five six

498
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:02,339
probably more two three four five six
 

499
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,850
probably more two three four five six
seven all right I don't know what I'm

500
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:04,860
seven all right I don't know what I'm
 

501
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,280
seven all right I don't know what I'm
doing exactly I'm gonna say let's go

502
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,290
doing exactly I'm gonna say let's go
 

503
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,560
doing exactly I'm gonna say let's go
this far away from the face of the thing

504
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:09,570
this far away from the face of the thing
 

505
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,150
this far away from the face of the thing
though so roughly where we're standing

506
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,160
though so roughly where we're standing
 

507
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,120
though so roughly where we're standing
at this torch here is gonna be the start

508
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,130
at this torch here is gonna be the start
 

509
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,840
at this torch here is gonna be the start
of our crimson keep right where we're

510
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:17,850
of our crimson keep right where we're
 

511
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,490
of our crimson keep right where we're
standing is gonna be the door like the

512
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:19,500
standing is gonna be the door like the
 

513
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,800
standing is gonna be the door like the
entrance into it and then the bridge is

514
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:21,810
entrance into it and then the bridge is
 

515
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,389
entrance into it and then the bridge is
gonna go right up that door so let's

516
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:23,399
gonna go right up that door so let's
 

517
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,090
gonna go right up that door so let's
work on the bridge here my fire

518
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,100
work on the bridge here my fire
 

519
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,269
work on the bridge here my fire
resistance has worn out so I got a check

520
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
resistance has worn out so I got a check
 

521
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,370
resistance has worn out so I got a check
if I got any more of my shelter boxes

522
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:33,380

 

523
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,380

away I think I want this as a center so

524
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:36,390
away I think I want this as a center so
 

525
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,970
away I think I want this as a center so
what we're gonna do get rid of that one

526
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:39,980
what we're gonna do get rid of that one
 

527
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,560
what we're gonna do get rid of that one
the pattern we're going for first stuff

528
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:42,570
the pattern we're going for first stuff
 

529
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,930
the pattern we're going for first stuff
here is two crimson wood and then a

530
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:44,940
here is two crimson wood and then a
 

531
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,670
here is two crimson wood and then a
shroom light in the middle and that's

532
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:46,680
shroom light in the middle and that's
 

533
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,710
shroom light in the middle and that's
gonna extend all the way down here I

534
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
gonna extend all the way down here I
 

535
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
gonna extend all the way down here I
want plenty of light with this build if

536
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:50,730
want plenty of light with this build if
 

537
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,310
want plenty of light with this build if
you guys don't know it I really hates

538
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
you guys don't know it I really hates
 

539
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,569
you guys don't know it I really hates
dark nether builds drives me crazy so

540
00:11:56,569 --> 00:11:56,579
dark nether builds drives me crazy so
 

541
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,280
dark nether builds drives me crazy so
it's gonna be gloomy right it's gonna be

542
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,290
it's gonna be gloomy right it's gonna be
 

543
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,750
it's gonna be gloomy right it's gonna be
gloomy but I want it to be a little bit

544
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
gloomy but I want it to be a little bit
 

545
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,000
gloomy but I want it to be a little bit
bright

546
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,010
bright
 

547
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,800

here's the tough part now we have so

548
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:04,810
here's the tough part now we have so
 

549
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,390
here's the tough part now we have so
many options with the Blackstone it's

550
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:06,400
many options with the Blackstone it's
 

551
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,860
many options with the Blackstone it's
like we got to decide which one we're

552
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:07,870
like we got to decide which one we're
 

553
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,660
like we got to decide which one we're
actually gonna go for I think for our

554
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:09,670
actually gonna go for I think for our
 

555
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,870
actually gonna go for I think for our
bridge the polished Blackstone makes the

556
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
bridge the polished Blackstone makes the
 

557
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,520
bridge the polished Blackstone makes the
most sense like I think the bricks are

558
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:14,530
most sense like I think the bricks are
 

559
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,830
most sense like I think the bricks are
better for walls when I do the borders

560
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:16,840
better for walls when I do the borders
 

561
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,510
better for walls when I do the borders
of a bridge I usually have to go a slab

562
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:18,520
of a bridge I usually have to go a slab
 

563
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,970
of a bridge I usually have to go a slab
below like the base of it so I think

564
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:20,980
below like the base of it so I think
 

565
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,180
below like the base of it so I think
we're gonna go down a slab and then up

566
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,190
we're gonna go down a slab and then up
 

567
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,520
we're gonna go down a slab and then up
one will be able to see a little bit of

568
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:26,530
one will be able to see a little bit of
 

569
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,630
one will be able to see a little bit of
crimson wood through the side here full

570
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:30,640
crimson wood through the side here full
 

571
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,540
crimson wood through the side here full
blocks above those now you might have

572
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:33,550
blocks above those now you might have
 

573
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,980
blocks above those now you might have
noticed with our bridge here the shroom

574
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:34,990
noticed with our bridge here the shroom
 

575
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,660
noticed with our bridge here the shroom
light and the crimson wood don't exactly

576
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:36,670
light and the crimson wood don't exactly
 

577
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,240
light and the crimson wood don't exactly
blend together the best so we're gonna

578
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,250
blend together the best so we're gonna
 

579
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,420
blend together the best so we're gonna
try mill them out a bit by putting glass

580
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:42,430
try mill them out a bit by putting glass
 

581
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,500
try mill them out a bit by putting glass
over top and then we're gonna have red

582
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:46,510
over top and then we're gonna have red
 

583
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,490
over top and then we're gonna have red
glass over the crimson wood and then I

584
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:50,500
glass over the crimson wood and then I
 

585
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,890
glass over the crimson wood and then I
want to start mixing in some acacia as

586
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:52,900
want to start mixing in some acacia as
 

587
00:12:52,900 --> 00:13:00,420
want to start mixing in some acacia as
well yeah so I think that's good that

588
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:00,430
well yeah so I think that's good that
 

589
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,700
well yeah so I think that's good that
adds a bit of 3d depth to the bridge and

590
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:02,710
adds a bit of 3d depth to the bridge and
 

591
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,770
adds a bit of 3d depth to the bridge and
also a little bit of variation with the

592
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:04,780
also a little bit of variation with the
 

593
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,550
also a little bit of variation with the
colors the trim lights aren't quite as

594
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:07,560
colors the trim lights aren't quite as
 

595
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,050
colors the trim lights aren't quite as
shocking either with a bit of glass over

596
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:10,060
shocking either with a bit of glass over
 

597
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,250
shocking either with a bit of glass over
top and now we're gonna line the border

598
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:14,260
top and now we're gonna line the border
 

599
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,140
top and now we're gonna line the border
here so we don't fall off with some of

600
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,150
here so we don't fall off with some of
 

601
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,230
here so we don't fall off with some of
these bricks uh yeah yeah so I'm liking

602
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,240
these bricks uh yeah yeah so I'm liking
 

603
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,600
these bricks uh yeah yeah so I'm liking
the look of this I do feel like the

604
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:21,610
the look of this I do feel like the
 

605
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,010
the look of this I do feel like the
bridge needs to be a bit longer though

606
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,020
bridge needs to be a bit longer though
 

607
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,960
bridge needs to be a bit longer though
so we'll probably extend it further onto

608
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:24,970
so we'll probably extend it further onto
 

609
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,180
so we'll probably extend it further onto
land here or even terraform a bit and

610
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,190
land here or even terraform a bit and
 

611
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,710
land here or even terraform a bit and
have more lava below here but the look

612
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:31,720
have more lava below here but the look
 

613
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,300
have more lava below here but the look
is okay I'm really trying to push myself

614
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,310
is okay I'm really trying to push myself
 

615
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,660
is okay I'm really trying to push myself
with this build to get better at bigger

616
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:36,670
with this build to get better at bigger
 

617
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,400
with this build to get better at bigger
structures it's something I kind of suck

618
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,410
structures it's something I kind of suck
 

619
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,510
structures it's something I kind of suck
at to be honest so I'm having a huge

620
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:42,520
at to be honest so I'm having a huge
 

621
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,780
at to be honest so I'm having a huge
bridge like really trying to add space

622
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:45,790
bridge like really trying to add space
 

623
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,220
bridge like really trying to add space
to the build I usually I like to go

624
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:47,230
to the build I usually I like to go
 

625
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,370
to the build I usually I like to go
small and compact with the entrance I'm

626
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:50,380
small and compact with the entrance I'm
 

627
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,050
small and compact with the entrance I'm
gonna go up I think seven blocks here

628
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:52,060
gonna go up I think seven blocks here
 

629
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,480
gonna go up I think seven blocks here
for the door

630
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:53,490
for the door
 

631
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,830
for the door
another thing I'm pushing myself to do

632
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:55,840
another thing I'm pushing myself to do
 

633
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,620
another thing I'm pushing myself to do
with this build is to use a lot of walls

634
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:57,630
with this build is to use a lot of walls
 

635
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,690
with this build is to use a lot of walls
walls are a lot better now than they

636
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:00,700
walls are a lot better now than they
 

637
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,950
walls are a lot better now than they
used to be and kind of use them as

638
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:01,960
used to be and kind of use them as
 

639
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,040
used to be and kind of use them as
vertical slabs with this update like if

640
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,050
vertical slabs with this update like if
 

641
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,590
vertical slabs with this update like if
you if you do this it actually looks

642
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
you if you do this it actually looks
 

643
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,450
you if you do this it actually looks
really good now you don't have that

644
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:09,460
really good now you don't have that
 

645
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,150
really good now you don't have that
space between them anymore

646
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,160
space between them anymore
 

647
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,980
space between them anymore
so to get your building to the next

648
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:13,990
so to get your building to the next
 

649
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,370

level
that's what you're gonna have to start

652
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,210
that's what you're gonna have to start
 

653
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,590
that's what you're gonna have to start
doing and I need to practice so I'm

654
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
doing and I need to practice so I'm
 

655
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,680
doing and I need to practice so I'm
gonna use them for detailing for adding

656
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,690
gonna use them for detailing for adding
 

657
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,030
gonna use them for detailing for adding
interesting shapes and steps of the

658
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,040
interesting shapes and steps of the
 

659
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,580
interesting shapes and steps of the
build this way like we don't have a big

660
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:26,590
build this way like we don't have a big
 

661
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,260
build this way like we don't have a big
piece of orange now we just definitely a

662
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:28,270
piece of orange now we just definitely a
 

663
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,480
piece of orange now we just definitely a
thin line there alright so check it out

664
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:30,490
thin line there alright so check it out
 

665
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,190
thin line there alright so check it out
guys we're using the black stone here to

666
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:32,200
guys we're using the black stone here to
 

667
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,710
guys we're using the black stone here to
beef up our door make it look a bit more

668
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
beef up our door make it look a bit more
 

669
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,480
beef up our door make it look a bit more
impressive a little bit more

670
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:36,490
impressive a little bit more
 

671
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,060
impressive a little bit more
structurally sound I snuck in some red

672
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,070
structurally sound I snuck in some red
 

673
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,550
structurally sound I snuck in some red
clay over here so thin sliver of it you

674
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:41,560
clay over here so thin sliver of it you
 

675
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,860
clay over here so thin sliver of it you
can barely notice blends in pretty close

676
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:43,870
can barely notice blends in pretty close
 

677
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,470
can barely notice blends in pretty close
to the acacia and I'm starting to use

678
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
to the acacia and I'm starting to use
 

679
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,060
to the acacia and I'm starting to use
basalt as well I think we're gonna go

680
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,070
basalt as well I think we're gonna go
 

681
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,070
basalt as well I think we're gonna go
for the polished basalt I liked it a

682
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,080
for the polished basalt I liked it a
 

683
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,950
for the polished basalt I liked it a
little bit more and now I'm kind of

684
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:52,960
little bit more and now I'm kind of
 

685
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,940
little bit more and now I'm kind of
getting to the point where I just need

686
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:53,950
getting to the point where I just need
 

687
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,590
getting to the point where I just need
to start detailing this thing and it's

688
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:55,600
to start detailing this thing and it's
 

689
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,920
to start detailing this thing and it's
going to be hard to record that a lot of

690
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:58,930
going to be hard to record that a lot of
 

691
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,160
going to be hard to record that a lot of
trial and error but I was thinking try

692
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,170
trial and error but I was thinking try
 

693
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,720
trial and error but I was thinking try
to mix some of this stuff in over here

694
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:05,730
to mix some of this stuff in over here
 

695
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,290
to mix some of this stuff in over here
alright

696
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:07,300
alright
 

697
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,280
alright
I brought some that's kind of cool

698
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:11,290
I brought some that's kind of cool
 

699
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,520
I brought some that's kind of cool
I brought some acacia fences to use as

700
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:14,530
I brought some acacia fences to use as
 

701
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,970
I brought some acacia fences to use as
like the thingy that comes down from the

702
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:17,980
like the thingy that comes down from the
 

703
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,530
like the thingy that comes down from the
door the actual door I don't know what

704
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:19,540
door the actual door I don't know what
 

705
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,030
door the actual door I don't know what
you call it it starts with @p you know

706
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,040
you call it it starts with @p you know
 

707
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,730
you call it it starts with @p you know
what I'm talking about right yeah yeah

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:26,740
what I'm talking about right yeah yeah
 

709
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,340
what I'm talking about right yeah yeah
and now I also want to detail the bridge

710
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,350
and now I also want to detail the bridge
 

711
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,620
and now I also want to detail the bridge
a bit more so I think every fifth block

712
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:31,630
a bit more so I think every fifth block
 

713
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,610
a bit more so I think every fifth block
one to here let's count on the glass

714
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:35,620
one to here let's count on the glass
 

715
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,550
one to here let's count on the glass
this is your one two three four five

716
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:37,560
this is your one two three four five
 

717
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,870
this is your one two three four five
we're gonna add a piece of basalt here

718
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:39,880
we're gonna add a piece of basalt here
 

719
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,480
we're gonna add a piece of basalt here
and then like a slab over top of that

720
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:42,490
and then like a slab over top of that
 

721
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,400
and then like a slab over top of that
that's our piece of basalt I got a slab

722
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:44,410
that's our piece of basalt I got a slab
 

723
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,950
that's our piece of basalt I got a slab
a stayer chiseled and now this is gonna

724
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:46,960
a stayer chiseled and now this is gonna
 

725
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,170
a stayer chiseled and now this is gonna
go straight down into the ground into

726
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:49,180
go straight down into the ground into
 

727
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,780
go straight down into the ground into
the lava there a couple walls here which

728
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:51,790
the lava there a couple walls here which
 

729
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,040
the lava there a couple walls here which
are nice because they don't connect to

730
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,050
are nice because they don't connect to
 

731
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,200
are nice because they don't connect to
the slabs it's a little kind of cool and

732
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,210
the slabs it's a little kind of cool and
 

733
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,020
the slabs it's a little kind of cool and
then some stairs and I'm gonna try

734
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,030
then some stairs and I'm gonna try
 

735
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,480
then some stairs and I'm gonna try
detail underneath the bridge even which

736
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:00,490
detail underneath the bridge even which
 

737
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,810
detail underneath the bridge even which
is gonna be tough here so I think we're

738
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:03,820
is gonna be tough here so I think we're
 

739
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,280
is gonna be tough here so I think we're
gonna run some slabs all along the

740
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,290
gonna run some slabs all along the
 

741
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,870
gonna run some slabs all along the
shroom lights will leave the crimson

742
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
shroom lights will leave the crimson
 

743
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,140
shroom lights will leave the crimson
wood exposed that like how it looks will

744
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,150
wood exposed that like how it looks will
 

745
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,040
wood exposed that like how it looks will
run a beam across

746
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,050

 

747
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:19,800

and what some stairs maybe I kind of

748
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:19,810
and what some stairs maybe I kind of
 

749
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,100
and what some stairs maybe I kind of
start arching up to support this uh-huh

750
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,110
start arching up to support this uh-huh
 

751
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,329
start arching up to support this uh-huh
I'll figure something out

752
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:24,339
I'll figure something out
 

753
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:25,920
I'll figure something out
I messed with it a bit here and we

754
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:25,930
I messed with it a bit here and we
 

755
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,840
I messed with it a bit here and we
actually went for a pretty detailed arch

756
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:27,850
actually went for a pretty detailed arch
 

757
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,730
actually went for a pretty detailed arch
thing here so I like the shape of this I

758
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:29,740
thing here so I like the shape of this I
 

759
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,710
thing here so I like the shape of this I
think that's a good arch and then we

760
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:31,720
think that's a good arch and then we
 

761
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
think that's a good arch and then we
replaced a lot of the slabs with stairs

762
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:33,730
replaced a lot of the slabs with stairs
 

763
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,759
replaced a lot of the slabs with stairs
and just did some funny patterns with

764
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:35,769
and just did some funny patterns with
 

765
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,800
and just did some funny patterns with
them I got a couple chiseled blocks in

766
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:37,810
them I got a couple chiseled blocks in
 

767
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,139
them I got a couple chiseled blocks in
here and I've been using the nether wart

768
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:40,149
here and I've been using the nether wart
 

769
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,120
here and I've been using the nether wart
as my scaffolding because it's easy to

770
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,130
as my scaffolding because it's easy to
 

771
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,300
as my scaffolding because it's easy to
collect you can grow it easy to line up

772
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:45,310
collect you can grow it easy to line up
 

773
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:51,060
collect you can grow it easy to line up
afterwards oh you jerk I'm working here

774
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,070
afterwards oh you jerk I'm working here
 

775
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,630
afterwards oh you jerk I'm working here
man I'm working here these are the

776
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:54,640
man I'm working here these are the
 

777
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,889
man I'm working here these are the
dangerous guys the ones with the gold

778
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:55,899
dangerous guys the ones with the gold
 

779
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:58,560
dangerous guys the ones with the gold
sores they do so much damage so quickly

780
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:58,570
sores they do so much damage so quickly
 

781
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,120
sores they do so much damage so quickly
and if they're enchanted you're just

782
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,130
and if they're enchanted you're just
 

783
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,880
and if they're enchanted you're just
like dead instantly

784
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:01,890
like dead instantly
 

785
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,410
like dead instantly
yeah we can't reach it and it looks like

786
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:04,420
yeah we can't reach it and it looks like
 

787
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,150
yeah we can't reach it and it looks like
it's floating on the lava if we don't go

788
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,160
it's floating on the lava if we don't go
 

789
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,400
it's floating on the lava if we don't go
just a little bit further down so we

790
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,410
just a little bit further down so we
 

791
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,929
just a little bit further down so we
have actually have to go one more block

792
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:09,939
have actually have to go one more block
 

793
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:12,780
have actually have to go one more block
lower oh whoa yeah okay that looks

794
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:12,790
lower oh whoa yeah okay that looks
 

795
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:20,520
lower oh whoa yeah okay that looks

903
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:34,690
that's that's kind of what we're going
for and I think we're about done with

904
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:34,700
for and I think we're about done with
 

905
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,180
for and I think we're about done with
the door here like the entrance add some

906
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,190
the door here like the entrance add some
 

907
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,599
the door here like the entrance add some
jagged ease up at the top there and the

908
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:40,609
jagged ease up at the top there and the
 

909
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:42,129
jagged ease up at the top there and the
next thing I think we should do with

910
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:42,139
next thing I think we should do with
 

911
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:46,029
next thing I think we should do with
this is boof and boof add two towers

912
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:46,039
this is boof and boof add two towers
 

913
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:48,430
this is boof and boof add two towers
next to the entrance here to the beef up

914
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:48,440
next to the entrance here to the beef up
 

915
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,099
next to the entrance here to the beef up
the build a bit more the problem is

916
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:53,109
the build a bit more the problem is
 

917
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,479
the build a bit more the problem is
because we're not building this on land

918
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:55,489
because we're not building this on land
 

919
00:19:55,489 --> 00:19:58,419
because we're not building this on land
like I originally planned is this gonna

920
00:19:58,419 --> 00:19:58,429
like I originally planned is this gonna
 

921
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:02,289
like I originally planned is this gonna
be like lava below here so we either

922
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:02,299
be like lava below here so we either
 

923
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,690
be like lava below here so we either
need to make the towers go down into the

924
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:04,700
need to make the towers go down into the
 

925
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,690
need to make the towers go down into the
lava or I need to do some terraforming

926
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:07,700
lava or I need to do some terraforming
 

927
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,399
lava or I need to do some terraforming
here and make it look like there's

928
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:09,409
here and make it look like there's
 

929
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12,190
here and make it look like there's
actually some land like at the edge here

930
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:12,200
actually some land like at the edge here
 

931
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,349
actually some land like at the edge here
which might be the best thing to do

932
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:14,359
which might be the best thing to do
 

933
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,440
which might be the best thing to do
because I would like to get the nyam the

because I would like to get the nyam the
 

935
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,950
because I would like to get the nyam the

but we got a nice faceplate to it at
 

945
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,580

of the bastion that sticks out about
 

953
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,890
of the bastion that sticks out about
five blocks further there so if we just

954
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:49,900
five blocks further there so if we just
 

955
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,720
five blocks further there so if we just
add a little bit more bulk it we can

956
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:51,730
add a little bit more bulk it we can
 

957
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,120
add a little bit more bulk it we can
kind of surround the whole thing and

958
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,130
kind of surround the whole thing and
 

959
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,770
kind of surround the whole thing and
we'll probably want to build some more

960
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:55,780
we'll probably want to build some more
 

961
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,810
we'll probably want to build some more
towers up above there as well or more

962
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:57,820
towers up above there as well or more
 

963
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,780
towers up above there as well or more
structure in time but I think the next

964
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:00,790
structure in time but I think the next
 

965
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,150
structure in time but I think the next
thing we're gonna be doing with this is

966
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:03,160
thing we're gonna be doing with this is
 

967
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,190
thing we're gonna be doing with this is
start working on the interior and then

968
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,200
start working on the interior and then
 

969
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,780
start working on the interior and then
later we might come back to the front

970
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:06,790
later we might come back to the front
 

971
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,510
later we might come back to the front
here and add more to it but yeah look at

972
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
here and add more to it but yeah look at

00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:39,739
thing the respawn anchor because like I
 

989
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:41,560
thing the respawn anchor because like I
found this spot there and I managed to

990

found this spot there and I managed to
 

991
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,239
found this spot there and I managed to
build all of that without heading back

00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,030

 

1007
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,720

I'd be pretty close to here oh that's

1008
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:06,730
I'd be pretty close to here oh that's
 

1009
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,030
I'd be pretty close to here oh that's
the fortress that's it we found it

1010
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,040
the fortress that's it we found it
 

1011
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,910
the fortress that's it we found it
oh and there's the build Wow okay that

1012
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:11,920
oh and there's the build Wow okay that
 

1013
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,440
oh and there's the build Wow okay that
worked out really well actually I don't

1014
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,450
worked out really well actually I don't
 

1015
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,700
worked out really well actually I don't
think we lost anything or nothing

1016
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:14,710
think we lost anything or nothing
 

1017
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,700
think we lost anything or nothing
important that I can tell so that was

1018
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,710
important that I can tell so that was
 

1019
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,580
important that I can tell so that was
pretty lucky because we used walls guys

1020
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:20,590
pretty lucky because we used walls guys
 

1021
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,950
pretty lucky because we used walls guys
Oh such a good decision they're a little

1022
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:22,960
Oh such a good decision they're a little
 

1023
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,480
Oh such a good decision they're a little
bit taller you know it's harder for the

1024
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:24,490
bit taller you know it's harder for the
 

1025
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,810
bit taller you know it's harder for the
items to fall overboard so let's figure

1026
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:27,820
items to fall overboard so let's figure
 

1027
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,030
items to fall overboard so let's figure
out how this respawn anger works we're

1028
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,040
out how this respawn anger works we're
 

1029
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,290
out how this respawn anger works we're
gonna set up in our our little Hut here

1030
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:33,300
gonna set up in our our little Hut here

1032
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:38,640

 

1033
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,520

very good very good so now if we die

1034
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,530
very good very good so now if we die
 

1035
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,920
very good very good so now if we die
with that respawn anchor will respawn in

1036
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:43,930
with that respawn anchor will respawn in
 

1037
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,570
with that respawn anchor will respawn in
our little Hut there and we brought some

backup here with us and we got backup
food and stuff so it shouldn't be as big

1042
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,230
food and stuff so it shouldn't be as big
 

1043
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,450
food and stuff so it shouldn't be as big
of a deal if we do die here now so yeah

1044
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:54,460
of a deal if we do die here now so yeah
 

1045
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,330
of a deal if we do die here now so yeah
these are our towers again by the way so

1046
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:57,340
these are our towers again by the way so
 

1047
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,130
these are our towers again by the way so
they're pretty detailed they actually go

1048
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,140
they're pretty detailed they actually go
 

1049
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,370
they're pretty detailed they actually go
like seven blocks thick or so maybe even

1050
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:02,380
like seven blocks thick or so maybe even
 

1051
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,260
like seven blocks thick or so maybe even
more than that they're pretty pretty

1052
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,270
more than that they're pretty pretty
 

1053
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:09,750
more than that they're pretty pretty
crazy uh-huh and then I'm thinking we're

1054
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
crazy uh-huh and then I'm thinking we're
 

1055
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,580
crazy uh-huh and then I'm thinking we're
gonna have a bit of a walkway to get

1056
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:11,590
gonna have a bit of a walkway to get
 

1057
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,250
gonna have a bit of a walkway to get
into the builds or into the bastion here

1058
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:14,260
into the builds or into the bastion here
 

1059
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,920
into the builds or into the bastion here
and then later like with this empty

1060
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:16,930
and then later like with this empty
 

1061
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,710
and then later like with this empty
space we can put some rooms is that not

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,430
closed up okay yeah maybe
 

1065
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,550
closed up okay yeah maybe
let's let's go check this out real quick

1066
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:26,560
let's let's go check this out real quick
 

1067
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,420
let's let's go check this out real quick
as well ah fire resistance let's drink
