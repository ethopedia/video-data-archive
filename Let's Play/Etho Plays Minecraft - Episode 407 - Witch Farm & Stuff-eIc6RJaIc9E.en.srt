last episode we went scouting for a
 

25
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,709
last episode we went scouting for a
witch hut and it didn't really find one

to clear all the land and set up a
 

49
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,789
to clear all the land and set up a
perimeter I saw a picture of this one

50
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
perimeter I saw a picture of this one
 

51
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,850
perimeter I saw a picture of this one
over here we're gonna go check it out

52
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:25,860
over here we're gonna go check it out
 

53
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,060
over here we're gonna go check it out
and look around a bit I didn't see any

54
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,070
and look around a bit I didn't see any
 

55
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,429
and look around a bit I didn't see any
mountains we'll have to just do a little

56
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
mountains we'll have to just do a little
 

57
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,010
mountains we'll have to just do a little
bit of scouting ideally we want nothing

58
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,020
bit of scouting ideally we want nothing
 

59
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,080
bit of scouting ideally we want nothing
but water around the witch hut so we

60
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,090
but water around the witch hut so we
 

61
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,910
but water around the witch hut so we
don't have to clear clear very much land

62
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
don't have to clear clear very much land
 

63
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,640
don't have to clear clear very much land
and we can set up a witch farm really

64
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:40,650
and we can set up a witch farm really
 

65
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,910
and we can set up a witch farm really
quickly that way

66
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:42,920
quickly that way
 

67
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,440
quickly that way
that was a long load I'm guessing I've

68
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:45,450
that was a long load I'm guessing I've
 

69
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,789
that was a long load I'm guessing I've
never been here then whoa

70
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:49,799
never been here then whoa

happening what no you don't do it like
this

76
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,250
this
 

77
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:10,890
this
oh man it No

78
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:10,900

 

79
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,450

are you kidding me okay we got to go

80
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:13,460
are you kidding me okay we got to go
 

81
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,810
are you kidding me okay we got to go
back we have to go back to the island

82
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:16,820
back we have to go back to the island
 

83
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,530
back we have to go back to the island
um when I went through the portal my end

84
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:20,540
um when I went through the portal my end
 

85
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,530
um when I went through the portal my end
reporter activated I guess it does that

86
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:23,540
reporter activated I guess it does that
 

87
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,670
reporter activated I guess it does that
sometimes I didn't think it would work

88
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:24,680
sometimes I didn't think it would work
 

89
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:33,940
sometimes I didn't think it would work
over that far of a distance though that

90
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:33,950
over that far of a distance though that
 

91
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,940
over that far of a distance though that
is very bad over there we do not want

92
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:36,950
is very bad over there we do not want
 

93
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,930
is very bad over there we do not want
that oh man okay well let's do some

94
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:40,940
that oh man okay well let's do some
 

95
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,820
that oh man okay well let's do some
measurements and just see how bad this

96
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:42,830
measurements and just see how bad this
 

97
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,720
measurements and just see how bad this
actually is

98
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:43,730
actually is
 

99
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,150
actually is
I got TNT like we can blow up a little

100
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
I got TNT like we can blow up a little
 

101
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,220
I got TNT like we can blow up a little
bit of mountain but not like all that I

102
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,230
bit of mountain but not like all that I
 

103
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,390
bit of mountain but not like all that I
don't think all right let's get inside

104
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
don't think all right let's get inside
 

105
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,090
don't think all right let's get inside
here so we have to clear land at 128

106
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,100
here so we have to clear land at 128
 

107
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,770
here so we have to clear land at 128
blocks away from this witch hut so if

108
00:02:59,770 --> 00:02:59,780
blocks away from this witch hut so if
 

109
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:08,440
blocks away from this witch hut so if
this is three 588 roughly we need 128

110
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,450
this is three 588 roughly we need 128
 

111
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,949
this is three 588 roughly we need 128
blocks this way

112
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
blocks this way
 

113
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:18,670
blocks this way
so like 3700 and it looks like it goes

114
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:18,680
so like 3700 and it looks like it goes
 

115
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,530
so like 3700 and it looks like it goes
up to oh it's actually pretty close I

116
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:22,540
up to oh it's actually pretty close I
 

117
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:30,759
up to oh it's actually pretty close I
don't know though don't know although it

118
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:30,769
don't know though don't know although it
 

119
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:33,160
don't know though don't know although it
I don't necessarily have to like afk

120
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,170
I don't necessarily have to like afk
 

121
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,840
I don't necessarily have to like afk
right at the center of the witch hut

122
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:34,850
right at the center of the witch hut
 

123
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,550
right at the center of the witch hut
right I can afk a little bit that way

124
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
right I can afk a little bit that way
 

125
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,539
right I can afk a little bit that way
and that way yeah that's that's true

126
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:40,549
and that way yeah that's that's true
 

127
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:43,720
and that way yeah that's that's true
okay so this might work if we stay far

128
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:43,730
okay so this might work if we stay far
 

129
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,460
okay so this might work if we stay far
enough away from this mountain it looks

130
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:45,470
enough away from this mountain it looks
 

131
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,569
enough away from this mountain it looks
like we would have to blow up that

132
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:46,579
like we would have to blow up that
 

133
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:49,060
like we would have to blow up that
mountain over there though

134
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,070
mountain over there though
 

135
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,350
mountain over there though
to clear the land and this is all nice

136
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
to clear the land and this is all nice
 

137
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,970
to clear the land and this is all nice
and flat I can easily do this with a

138
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:54,980
and flat I can easily do this with a
 

139
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,569
and flat I can easily do this with a
shovel over here so let's just look a

140
00:03:58,569 --> 00:03:58,579
shovel over here so let's just look a
 

141
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,100
shovel over here so let's just look a
little bit further this way it's

142
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,110
little bit further this way it's
 

143
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,420
little bit further this way it's
actually quite a bit of water here this

144
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:01,430
actually quite a bit of water here this
 

145
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,490
actually quite a bit of water here this
might be not too bad

146
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:06,500

 

147
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,770

yeah I think this could work out I'm

148
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:08,780
yeah I think this could work out I'm
 

149
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,570
yeah I think this could work out I'm
gonna set up some pillars and we'll just

150
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:10,580
gonna set up some pillars and we'll just
 

151
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,730
gonna set up some pillars and we'll just
kind of get an idea of where we got a

152
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:12,740
kind of get an idea of where we got a
 

153
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,310
kind of get an idea of where we got a
dig from if we were to to do it to make

154
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,320
dig from if we were to to do it to make
 

155
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,580
dig from if we were to to do it to make
the farm here this this would be our

156
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:18,590
the farm here this this would be our
 

157
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,240
the farm here this this would be our
biggest obstacle all right so I'll check

158
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,250
biggest obstacle all right so I'll check
 

159
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,160
biggest obstacle all right so I'll check
it out guys I got the pillars up in the

160
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,170
it out guys I got the pillars up in the
 

161
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,660
it out guys I got the pillars up in the
four corners so this would be one of the

162
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:25,670
four corners so this would be one of the
 

163
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,700
four corners so this would be one of the
corners here I don't know if you can see

164
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:27,710
corners here I don't know if you can see
 

165
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,650
corners here I don't know if you can see
it it's pretty far away but right over

166
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:29,660
it it's pretty far away but right over
 

167
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,470
it it's pretty far away but right over
there is one of the pillars the other

168
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:32,480
there is one of the pillars the other
 

169
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,120
there is one of the pillars the other
corner and there's one right over there

170
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,130
corner and there's one right over there
 

171
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,940
corner and there's one right over there
again it's pretty far away it looks like

172
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:39,950
again it's pretty far away it looks like
 

173
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,770
again it's pretty far away it looks like
we got pretty lucky with his spawn

174
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:41,780
we got pretty lucky with his spawn
 

175
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,240
we got pretty lucky with his spawn
actually like there's a lot of water

176
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,250
actually like there's a lot of water
 

177
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,820
actually like there's a lot of water
here and where there is land it's only

178
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:45,830
here and where there is land it's only
 

179
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,620
here and where there is land it's only
about two or three blocks thick for the

180
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:47,630
about two or three blocks thick for the
 

181
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,050
about two or three blocks thick for the
most parts this is the big thing though

182
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,060
most parts this is the big thing though
 

183
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,240
most parts this is the big thing though
here this is Mountain but I'm pretty

184
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,250
here this is Mountain but I'm pretty
 

185
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,340
here this is Mountain but I'm pretty
sure I think just get away with torching

186
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:54,350
sure I think just get away with torching
 

187
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,800
sure I think just get away with torching
it up right I think that would be the

188
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:56,810
it up right I think that would be the
 

189
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,720
it up right I think that would be the
way to do it I don't even have to clear

190
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:58,730
way to do it I don't even have to clear
 

191
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,990
way to do it I don't even have to clear
it you can't do that really in the swamp

192
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
it you can't do that really in the swamp
 

193
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,700
it you can't do that really in the swamp
because you'll still get slime spawning

194
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:03,710
because you'll still get slime spawning
 

195
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,850
because you'll still get slime spawning
that's the whole goal is to get rid of

196
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:05,860
that's the whole goal is to get rid of
 

197
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,460
that's the whole goal is to get rid of
possible places for mobs to spawn and in

198
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:09,470
possible places for mobs to spawn and in
 

199
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,040
possible places for mobs to spawn and in
the swamp slime spawn regardless of the

200
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,050
the swamp slime spawn regardless of the
 

201
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,290
the swamp slime spawn regardless of the
light level so I think we could only do

202
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:14,300
light level so I think we could only do
 

203
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,250
light level so I think we could only do
that on the hill here

204
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:15,260
that on the hill here
 

205
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,540
that on the hill here
and oh there it is there's another

206
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:19,550
and oh there it is there's another
 

207
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,460
and oh there it is there's another
pillar there so yeah it's not too bad

208
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:21,470
pillar there so yeah it's not too bad
 

209
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,250
pillar there so yeah it's not too bad
this is the other biggest section of

210
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:24,260
this is the other biggest section of
 

211
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,870
this is the other biggest section of
land here but we could take care of this

212
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:25,880
land here but we could take care of this
 

213
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,650
land here but we could take care of this
with a shovel

214
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:26,660
with a shovel
 

215
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:36,400
with a shovel
I think yeah oh oh no oh I have my

216
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:36,410
I think yeah oh oh no oh I have my
 

217
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,140
I think yeah oh oh no oh I have my
render distance cranked up right now so

218
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,150
render distance cranked up right now so
 

219
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,200
render distance cranked up right now so
that's why everything so slow but yeah

220
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,210
that's why everything so slow but yeah
 

221
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,490
that's why everything so slow but yeah
we basically got to clear all this and

222
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:44,500
we basically got to clear all this and
 

223
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,659
we basically got to clear all this and
it is about

224
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:48,669

 

225
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:51,430

maybe three or four blocks thick in some

226
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
maybe three or four blocks thick in some
 

227
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,670
maybe three or four blocks thick in some
places at the worst that's not too bad

228
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:54,680
places at the worst that's not too bad
 

229
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,060
places at the worst that's not too bad
at all ah all right we got to have some

230
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,070
at all ah all right we got to have some
 

231
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,650
at all ah all right we got to have some
fun with clearing land here guys we're

232
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:02,660
fun with clearing land here guys we're
 

233
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,340
fun with clearing land here guys we're
not gonna do too much on this today but

234
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:06,350
not gonna do too much on this today but
 

235
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,170
not gonna do too much on this today but
I just wanted to like get going here so

236
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:08,180
I just wanted to like get going here so
 

237
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,610
I just wanted to like get going here so
you might notice I cleared a bit of land

238
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:09,620
you might notice I cleared a bit of land
 

239
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,620
you might notice I cleared a bit of land
already five minutes

240
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:11,630
already five minutes
 

241
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,770
already five minutes
seriously five minutes I did legal one

242
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:14,780
seriously five minutes I did legal one
 

243
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,510
seriously five minutes I did legal one

pass on this we got one more pass to do
 

245
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,470
pass on this we got one more pass to do
and that's that's basically it and we're

246
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:20,480
and that's that's basically it and we're
 

247
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,030
and that's that's basically it and we're
almost at the the pillar there you see

248
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:22,040
almost at the the pillar there you see
 

249
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,190
almost at the the pillar there you see
it's over there so this is not gonna

250
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:24,200
it's over there so this is not gonna
 

251
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,320
it's over there so this is not gonna
take very long at all we got to do some

252
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,330
take very long at all we got to do some
 

253
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,090
take very long at all we got to do some
TNT stuff though this has to be fun

254
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:28,100
TNT stuff though this has to be fun
 

255
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,840
TNT stuff though this has to be fun
right we can't we cannot clearly did not

256
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:31,850
right we can't we cannot clearly did not
 

257
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,909
right we can't we cannot clearly did not
blow something up that's one of my rules

258
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
blow something up that's one of my rules
 

259
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,680
blow something up that's one of my rules
I don't know if it's really gonna speed

260
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:38,690
I don't know if it's really gonna speed
 

261
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,960
I don't know if it's really gonna speed
things up too much but it'll help I'm

262
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:40,970
things up too much but it'll help I'm
 

263
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,690
things up too much but it'll help I'm
sure oh did you see that pig flying you

264
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:43,700
sure oh did you see that pig flying you
 

265
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,780
sure oh did you see that pig flying you
like a caught on fire and everything

266
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:45,790
like a caught on fire and everything
 

267
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,510
like a caught on fire and everything
awesome all right we don't want to go

268
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
awesome all right we don't want to go
 

269
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,600
awesome all right we don't want to go
too deep though let's see we gotta get

270
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:52,610
too deep though let's see we gotta get
 

271
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:59,469
too deep though let's see we gotta get
down to why 62 how deep this blow up why

272
00:06:59,469 --> 00:06:59,479
down to why 62 how deep this blow up why
 

273
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:01,450
down to why 62 how deep this blow up why
62 okay that's not too bad we can

274
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:01,460
62 okay that's not too bad we can
 

275
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,520
62 okay that's not too bad we can
actually like even do a little bit more

276
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:03,530
actually like even do a little bit more
 

277
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,870
actually like even do a little bit more
TNT if we wanted oh I think I heard it I

278
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:07,880
TNT if we wanted oh I think I heard it I
 

279
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:14,580
TNT if we wanted oh I think I heard it I
think I heard it there goes big you know

280
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:14,590

 

281
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:33,730

oh yeah

282
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:33,740

 

283
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,080

all right so I think we'll get out of

284
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,090
all right so I think we'll get out of
 

285
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,290
all right so I think we'll get out of
here for today we did a fair bit already

286
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:38,300
here for today we did a fair bit already
 

287
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,630
here for today we did a fair bit already
basically all that you see see where the

288
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:41,640
basically all that you see see where the
 

289
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,780
basically all that you see see where the
land is and the ocean gets deeper so we

290
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:44,790
land is and the ocean gets deeper so we
 

291
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,730
land is and the ocean gets deeper so we
cleared all that have a little bit more

292
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:46,740
cleared all that have a little bit more
 

293
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,860
cleared all that have a little bit more
left to do here and then just little

294
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:48,870
left to do here and then just little
 

295
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,930
left to do here and then just little
pieces of land throughout the place and

296
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:50,940
pieces of land throughout the place and
 

297
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,300
pieces of land throughout the place and
then just torch up the big hill so maybe

298
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,310
then just torch up the big hill so maybe
 

299
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,300
then just torch up the big hill so maybe
in maybe two hours I would guess for the

300
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,310
in maybe two hours I would guess for the
 

301
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,180
in maybe two hours I would guess for the
land and about five or six hours at

302
00:07:59,180 --> 00:07:59,190
land and about five or six hours at
 

303
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,030
land and about five or six hours at
least for the caving that's gonna take

304
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:02,040
least for the caving that's gonna take
 

305
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,200
least for the caving that's gonna take
the longest because we got to light up

306
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,210
the longest because we got to light up
 

307
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,140
the longest because we got to light up
all the caves around this area to

308
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,150
all the caves around this area to
 

309
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,690
all the caves around this area to
prevent the mobs from spawning but yeah

310
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:08,700
prevent the mobs from spawning but yeah
 

311
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,740
prevent the mobs from spawning but yeah
shouldn't be too bad actually

312
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:11,750
shouldn't be too bad actually
 

313
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,180
shouldn't be too bad actually
so I tell you what everyone we need to

314
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,190
so I tell you what everyone we need to
 

315
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,890
so I tell you what everyone we need to
bounce things out now we've done a lot

316
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:15,900
bounce things out now we've done a lot
 

317
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,560
bounce things out now we've done a lot
of destruction today I love the

318
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:18,570
of destruction today I love the

really a lot of no there's not really a
lot of random stuff around here so it

462
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:36,900
lot of random stuff around here so it
 

463
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,960
lot of random stuff around here so it
might look a little out of place you

464
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:38,970
might look a little out of place you
 

465
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,820
might look a little out of place you
know things look better in context and

466
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:40,830
know things look better in context and
 

467
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,950
know things look better in context and
right now it's kind of out of context I

468
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:42,960
right now it's kind of out of context I
 

469
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,990
right now it's kind of out of context I
think uh-huh those Endor borders by the

470
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
think uh-huh those Endor borders by the
 

471
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,290
think uh-huh those Endor borders by the
way I think the thing that's triggering

472
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:51,300
way I think the thing that's triggering
 

473
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,060
way I think the thing that's triggering
them is when my game starts lighting so

474
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,070

475
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,610
them is when my game starts lighting so
right now I'm recording it seems to

476
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:55,620
right now I'm recording it seems to
 

477
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,930
right now I'm recording it seems to
happen a lot more often when I'm

478
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:56,940
happen a lot more often when I'm
 

479
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,000
happen a lot more often when I'm
recording where the

480
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,010
recording where the
 

481
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,940
recording where the
randomly do that and before when we went

482
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:01,950
randomly do that and before when we went
 

483
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,400
randomly do that and before when we went
through that portal you know my game was

484
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:04,410
through that portal you know my game was
 

485
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,160
through that portal you know my game was
lighting like crazy so you might want to

486
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,170
lighting like crazy so you might want to
 

487
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,810
lighting like crazy so you might want to
hold off building is I don't know we'll

488
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:08,820
hold off building is I don't know we'll
 

489
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,050
hold off building is I don't know we'll
have to try work that out it's like the

490
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:12,060
have to try work that out it's like the
 

491
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,050
have to try work that out it's like the
ender pearl doesn't calculate properly

492
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:14,060
ender pearl doesn't calculate properly
 

493
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,010
ender pearl doesn't calculate properly
once the game slows down or something

494
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:18,020
once the game slows down or something
 

495
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,260
once the game slows down or something
anyway let's head over to the Nexus I've

496
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,270
anyway let's head over to the Nexus I've
 

497
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,090
anyway let's head over to the Nexus I've
done quite a bit of work here again guys

498
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:23,100
done quite a bit of work here again guys
 

499
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,210
done quite a bit of work here again guys
nothing too exciting right now

500
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:28,220
nothing too exciting right now
 

501
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,320
nothing too exciting right now
nothing too exciting but I wanted to

502
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,330
nothing too exciting but I wanted to
 

503
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,290
nothing too exciting but I wanted to
show you where we're at anyway we're

504
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:33,300
show you where we're at anyway we're
 

505
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,040
show you where we're at anyway we're
actually very very very very very very

506
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,050
actually very very very very very very
 

507
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,160
actually very very very very very very
very close to done so that it's gonna be

508
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,170
very close to done so that it's gonna be
 

509
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,070
very close to done so that it's gonna be
functioning here uh so we had to run the

510
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,080
functioning here uh so we had to run the
 

511
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,640
functioning here uh so we had to run the
wires basically and you can see it goes

512
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:46,650
wires basically and you can see it goes
 

513
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,610
wires basically and you can see it goes
quite a ways down now we have to go

514
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:49,620
quite a ways down now we have to go
 

515
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,100
quite a ways down now we have to go
deeper it's not quite done yet

516
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,110
deeper it's not quite done yet
 

517
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,050
deeper it's not quite done yet
in total there's gonna be eight of these

518
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:54,060
in total there's gonna be eight of these
 

519
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,470
in total there's gonna be eight of these
wires on both levels so the bottom and

520
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:57,480
wires on both levels so the bottom and
 

521
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,010
wires on both levels so the bottom and
the top level and we gotta join them all

522
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,020
the top level and we gotta join them all
 

523
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,550
the top level and we gotta join them all
together and it's gonna be crazy

524
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
together and it's gonna be crazy
 

525
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,520
together and it's gonna be crazy
and then there's a ninth wire here as

526
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:07,530
and then there's a ninth wire here as
 

527
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,040
and then there's a ninth wire here as
well so basically eight of the wires

528
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,050
well so basically eight of the wires
 

529
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,640
well so basically eight of the wires
control the the bits these Pistons it

530
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:13,650
control the the bits these Pistons it
 

531
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,140
control the the bits these Pistons it
switches them either to the left or the

532
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,150
switches them either to the left or the
 

533
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,010
switches them either to the left or the
right and then the final one will be to

534
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,020
right and then the final one will be to
 

535
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,530
right and then the final one will be to
send the signal to the droppers that

536
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:21,540
send the signal to the droppers that
 

537
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,310
send the signal to the droppers that
hold the items so depending where the

538
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:25,320
hold the items so depending where the
 

539
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,830
hold the items so depending where the
bits are determines which dropper it

540
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:27,840
bits are determines which dropper it
 

541
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,180
bits are determines which dropper it
reaches now to actually finish a wiring

542
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,190
reaches now to actually finish a wiring
 

543
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,950
reaches now to actually finish a wiring
in the Nexus this is what I have to do

544
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:33,960
in the Nexus this is what I have to do
 

545
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,810
in the Nexus this is what I have to do
we have to take the eight wires we're

546
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:35,820
we have to take the eight wires we're
 

547
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,150
we have to take the eight wires we're
gonna build at the bottom that's the

548
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
gonna build at the bottom that's the
 

549
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,800
gonna build at the bottom that's the
easy part of this because we can always

550
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:39,810
easy part of this because we can always
 

551
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,320
easy part of this because we can always
just go deeper if we need more space for

552
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,330
just go deeper if we need more space for
 

553
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,990
just go deeper if we need more space for
the wiring down below there's going to

554
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,000
the wiring down below there's going to
 

555
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,400
the wiring down below there's going to
be eight of them down below but we also

556
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,410
be eight of them down below but we also
 

557
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,640
be eight of them down below but we also
need eight of them at this top level

558
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:48,650
need eight of them at this top level
 

559
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,590
need eight of them at this top level
connecting the top together here these

560
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
connecting the top together here these
 

561
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,400
connecting the top together here these
are the loose wires over here and

562
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:54,410
are the loose wires over here and
 

563
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,540
are the loose wires over here and
there's gonna be like a green wire at

564
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:56,550
there's gonna be like a green wire at
 

565
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,040
there's gonna be like a green wire at
the top we got to connect that to the

566
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,050
the top we got to connect that to the
 

567
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,530
the top we got to connect that to the
green wire down below yellow one from

568
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:00,540
green wire down below yellow one from
 

569
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,740
green wire down below yellow one from
the top to the bottom orange red and so

570
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:03,750
the top to the bottom orange red and so
 

571
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,630
the top to the bottom orange red and so
forth all eight of them plus the ninth

572
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:05,640
forth all eight of them plus the ninth
 

573
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,060
forth all eight of them plus the ninth
power wire all has to be hooked together

574
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,070
power wire all has to be hooked together
 

575
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,470
power wire all has to be hooked together
and then we take those eight wires and

576
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
and then we take those eight wires and
 

577
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,329
and then we take those eight wires and
connect them to the hexadecimal decoder

578
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:14,339
connect them to the hexadecimal decoder
 

579
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,540
connect them to the hexadecimal decoder
we built over here last episode and we

580
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:17,550
we built over here last episode and we
 

581
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:22,400
we built over here last episode and we
are done easy-peasy not quite so so easy

582
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:22,410
are done easy-peasy not quite so so easy
 

583
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,670
are done easy-peasy not quite so so easy
there's a lot of work to it the thing

584
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
there's a lot of work to it the thing
 

585
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,019
there's a lot of work to it the thing
that's gonna give me trouble here though

586
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:27,029
that's gonna give me trouble here though
 

587
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:29,269
that's gonna give me trouble here though
is if we just run a wire across like we

588
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
is if we just run a wire across like we
 

589
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,290
is if we just run a wire across like we
did down below

590
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:30,300
did down below
 

591
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,329
did down below
look at this it's gonna cut right in

592
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:32,339
look at this it's gonna cut right in
 

593
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,850
look at this it's gonna cut right in
front of this room here where the

594
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:34,860
front of this room here where the
 

595
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,910
front of this room here where the
building is so we're gonna have to build

596
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
building is so we're gonna have to build
 

597
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,610
building is so we're gonna have to build
it up above the Nexus here up above the

598
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:43,620
it up above the Nexus here up above the
 

599
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,379
it up above the Nexus here up above the
world so high like a diamond in the sky

600
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:45,389
world so high like a diamond in the sky
 

601
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:49,310
world so high like a diamond in the sky
and then connect them together probably

602
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:49,320
and then connect them together probably
 

603
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,689
and then connect them together probably
on the sides of the wires or something

604
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:52,699
on the sides of the wires or something
 

605
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,970
on the sides of the wires or something
anyway we're getting very close so it's

606
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:55,980
anyway we're getting very close so it's
 

607
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,430
anyway we're getting very close so it's
gonna be pretty cool once it's all done

608
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:58,440
gonna be pretty cool once it's all done
 

609
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,329
gonna be pretty cool once it's all done
here all right so I think we'll just do

610
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:02,339
here all right so I think we'll just do
 

611
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,189
here all right so I think we'll just do
a couple random things to finish off

612
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:04,199
a couple random things to finish off
 

613
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:12,259
a couple random things to finish off
this episode guys oh well oh no this is

614
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:12,269
this episode guys oh well oh no this is
 

615
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:18,530
this episode guys oh well oh no this is
not what I wanted to do live live what

616
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:18,540
not what I wanted to do live live what
 

617
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,059
not what I wanted to do live live what
can I feed them I got nothing I can feed

618
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:20,069
can I feed them I got nothing I can feed
 

619
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:29,650
can I feed them I got nothing I can feed
them stop burning stop it either pumpkin

620
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:29,660

 

621
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,100

don't there goes my right start it and

622
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,110
don't there goes my right start it and
 

623
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,900
don't there goes my right start it and
I'm trapped down here yes we're gonna

624
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:35,910
I'm trapped down here yes we're gonna
 

625
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,110
I'm trapped down here yes we're gonna
head over to the gold farm we built here

626
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
head over to the gold farm we built here
 

627
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,819
head over to the gold farm we built here
guys I want to double check if it works

628
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:40,829
guys I want to double check if it works
 

629
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:44,930
guys I want to double check if it works
or not in 1.84 and all the iron golems

630
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:44,940
or not in 1.84 and all the iron golems
 

631
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,819
or not in 1.84 and all the iron golems
eventually did die in it so I have to

632
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:46,829

projects and after the Nexus is done I

860
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:46,350
projects and after the Nexus is done I
 

861
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,350
projects and after the Nexus is done I
think we'll focus on those a bit more or

862
