mob system again today to try to fix

228
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
mob system again today to try to fix
 

229
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,710
mob system again today to try to fix
some of those problems last time we were

230
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
some of those problems last time we were
 

231
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,230
some of those problems last time we were
here

232
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
here
 

233
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,909
here
and i've been watching it for a while we

234
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
and i've been watching it for a while we
 

235
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,310
and i've been watching it for a while we
have we have a lot of problems this

236
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
have we have a lot of problems this
 

237
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,670
have we have a lot of problems this
thing's a mess

238
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
thing's a mess
 

239
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,270
thing's a mess
and maybe we should try to fix some of

240
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
and maybe we should try to fix some of
 

241
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,510
and maybe we should try to fix some of
these so zombies are supposed to go that

242
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
these so zombies are supposed to go that
 

243
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,270
these so zombies are supposed to go that
way this is a mob sorter creepers are

244
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
way this is a mob sorter creepers are
 

245
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,189
way this is a mob sorter creepers are
supposed to go to the right

246
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
supposed to go to the right
 

247
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,029
supposed to go to the right
he just barely made it skeletons are

248
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
he just barely made it skeletons are
 

249
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,950
he just barely made it skeletons are
supposed to fall

250
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
supposed to fall
 

251
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,670
supposed to fall
like that that's good that's good

252
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
like that that's good that's good
 

253
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,510
like that that's good that's good
seems to run pretty good if there's not

254
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
seems to run pretty good if there's not
 

255
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,189
seems to run pretty good if there's not
a lot of mobs but once there's a lot of

256
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
a lot of mobs but once there's a lot of
 

257
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,870
a lot of mobs but once there's a lot of
mobs it starts to mess up

258
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880

 

259
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,990

creeper ran good so far we're batting

260
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
creeper ran good so far we're batting
 

261
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,749
creeper ran good so far we're batting
100

262
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759

 

263
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,510

ah there we go there's our first problem

264
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
ah there we go there's our first problem
 

265
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,670
ah there we go there's our first problem
so sometimes this trap door is sending

266
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
so sometimes this trap door is sending
 

267
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,350
so sometimes this trap door is sending
two mobs at a time

268
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
two mobs at a time
 

269
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,270
two mobs at a time
when it gets backed up like this

270
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280

 

271
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,350

and that causes problems usually they're

272
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
and that causes problems usually they're
 

273
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,629
and that causes problems usually they're
still sorting 100

274
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
still sorting 100
 

275
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,309
still sorting 100
though that's actually surprising

276
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319

 

277
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,469

yeah oh well there we go we saw a

278
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
yeah oh well there we go we saw a
 

279
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,670
yeah oh well there we go we saw a
creeper fall down the skeleton way

280
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
creeper fall down the skeleton way
 

281
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,670
creeper fall down the skeleton way
and again i think something i'm going to

282
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
and again i think something i'm going to
 

283
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,790
and again i think something i'm going to
try today is

284
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
try today is
 

285
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,270
try today is
to get more than one cat in this thing

286
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
to get more than one cat in this thing
 

287
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,749
to get more than one cat in this thing
so they're more likely to run

288
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
so they're more likely to run
 

289
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,909
so they're more likely to run
because we just have this one one kitty

290
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
because we just have this one one kitty
 

291
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,790
because we just have this one one kitty
cat here maybe if we had three or four

292
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
cat here maybe if we had three or four
 

293
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,110
cat here maybe if we had three or four
in that one in that spot there they'll

294
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
in that one in that spot there they'll
 

295
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,350
in that one in that spot there they'll
run more likely

296
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
run more likely
 

297
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,790
run more likely
i'm also going to try to see if i can

298
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
i'm also going to try to see if i can
 

299
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,469
i'm also going to try to see if i can
adjust the timing on the strap door make

300
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
adjust the timing on the strap door make
 

301
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,950
adjust the timing on the strap door make
it a little quicker

302
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960

 

303
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,430

although it looks like they're just

304
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
although it looks like they're just
 

305
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,070
although it looks like they're just
getting in

306
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
getting in
 

307
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,870
getting in
each other's same space because they're

308
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
each other's same space because they're
 

309
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,029
each other's same space because they're
getting pushed so hard so maybe

310
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
getting pushed so hard so maybe
 

311
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,710
getting pushed so hard so maybe
i'll have to add some way of regulating

312
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
i'll have to add some way of regulating
 

313
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,070
i'll have to add some way of regulating
this if it gets backed up

314
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
this if it gets backed up
 

315
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,189
this if it gets backed up
stop sending mobs to it

316
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199

 

317
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,790

here's another big problem we got this

318
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
here's another big problem we got this
 

319
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,469
here's another big problem we got this
thing gets backed up

320
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
thing gets backed up
 

321
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,870
thing gets backed up
and we have uh water sources up in the

322
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
and we have uh water sources up in the
 

323
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,510
and we have uh water sources up in the
air so the

324
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
air so the
 

325
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,110
air so the
creepers will just start drowning in

326
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
creepers will just start drowning in
 

327
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,350
creepers will just start drowning in
them and the skeletons

328
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360

 

329
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,150

uh this thing too this is another big

330
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
uh this thing too this is another big
 

331
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,830
uh this thing too this is another big
problem

332
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:42,840

 

333
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,350

um where to begin so

334
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
um where to begin so
 

335
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,990
um where to begin so
i wasn't sure what was wrong with it

336
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
i wasn't sure what was wrong with it
 

337
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,070
i wasn't sure what was wrong with it
last time like

338
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
last time like
 

339
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,589
last time like
sometimes the creepers would blow up on

340
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
sometimes the creepers would blow up on
 

341
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,629
sometimes the creepers would blow up on
the skeleton sometimes they wouldn't

342
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
the skeleton sometimes they wouldn't
 

343
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,230
the skeleton sometimes they wouldn't
and you guys a lot of you guys suggested

344
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
and you guys a lot of you guys suggested
 

345
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,670
and you guys a lot of you guys suggested
that it was because

346
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
that it was because
 

347
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,309
that it was because
the snow golem was shooting the creeper

348
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
the snow golem was shooting the creeper
 

349
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,430
the snow golem was shooting the creeper
which

350
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
which
 

351
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,830
which
is partially the problem but the thing

352
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
is partially the problem but the thing
 

353
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,830
is partially the problem but the thing
is the snow golem was shooting the

354
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
is the snow golem was shooting the
 

355
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,309
is the snow golem was shooting the
creeper

356
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
creeper
 

357
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,150
creeper
every single time so it doesn't explain

358
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
every single time so it doesn't explain
 

359
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,070
every single time so it doesn't explain
why sometimes the creeper would

360
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
why sometimes the creeper would
 

361
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,150
why sometimes the creeper would
explode and sometimes it wouldn't on the

362
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
explode and sometimes it wouldn't on the
 

363
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,070
explode and sometimes it wouldn't on the
skeleton

364
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
skeleton
 

365
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,350
skeleton
um this thing's really messing up now

366
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
um this thing's really messing up now
 

367
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,230
um this thing's really messing up now
because it's

368
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
because it's
 

369
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,350
because it's
because of those other problems

370
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
because of those other problems
 

371
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,270
because of those other problems
um so i went into a creative world

372
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
um so i went into a creative world
 

373
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,629
um so i went into a creative world
actually to try to figure out what was

374
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
actually to try to figure out what was
 

375
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,749
actually to try to figure out what was
going on here

376
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
going on here
 

377
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,990
going on here
and i i learned a lot of things and i'm

378
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
and i i learned a lot of things and i'm
 

379
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,430
and i i learned a lot of things and i'm
gonna share those with you so let's head

380
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
gonna share those with you so let's head
 

381
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,949
gonna share those with you so let's head
on over to

382
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
on over to
 

383
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,149
on over to
uh my creative world and we will we will

384
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
uh my creative world and we will we will
 

385
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,110
uh my creative world and we will we will
check out a few

386
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
check out a few
 

387
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,550
check out a few
interesting facts about mob behavior

388
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560

 

389
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,150

okay here we are and this is the

390
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
okay here we are and this is the
 

391
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,990
okay here we are and this is the
experiment i set up to try to figure out

392
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
experiment i set up to try to figure out
 

393
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,509
experiment i set up to try to figure out
what was going on

394
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
what was going on
 

395
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,190
what was going on
we got a skeleton we'll have a creeper

396
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
we got a skeleton we'll have a creeper
 

397
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,190
we got a skeleton we'll have a creeper
in the middle and the snow golem

398
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
in the middle and the snow golem
 

399
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,710
in the middle and the snow golem
and i just wanted to see how they

400
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
and i just wanted to see how they
 

401
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,150
and i just wanted to see how they
interact with each other and i learned

402
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
interact with each other and i learned
 

403
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,949
interact with each other and i learned
to

404
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959
to
 

405
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,630
to
a few interesting things about mob

406
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
a few interesting things about mob
 

407
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,430
a few interesting things about mob
behavior from this

408
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
behavior from this
 

409
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,590
behavior from this
and in this experiment i have a button

410
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
and in this experiment i have a button
 

411
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,710
and in this experiment i have a button
which makes these pistons retract

412
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
which makes these pistons retract
 

413
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,230
which makes these pistons retract
for a very short amount of time

414
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
for a very short amount of time
 

415
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,990
for a very short amount of time
and then they go right back so that

416
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
and then they go right back so that
 

417
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,670
and then they go right back so that
gives the snowglobe line of sight to the

418
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
gives the snowglobe line of sight to the
 

419
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,110
gives the snowglobe line of sight to the
skeleton

420
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
skeleton
 

421
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,949
skeleton
and the skeleton has line of sight to

422
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
and the skeleton has line of sight to
 

423
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,990
and the skeleton has line of sight to
the snow golem so

424
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
the snow golem so
 

425
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,990
the snow golem so
one thing you'll notice this snow golem

426
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
one thing you'll notice this snow golem
 

427
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,350
one thing you'll notice this snow golem
he doesn't have a care in the world he's

428
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
he doesn't have a care in the world he's
 

429
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,310
he doesn't have a care in the world he's
kind of just

430
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
kind of just
 

431
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,070
kind of just
turning his body around he's looking

432
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
turning his body around he's looking
 

433
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,670
turning his body around he's looking
around

434
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
around
 

435

around
not too interested in anyone at the

436
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
not too interested in anyone at the
 

437
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,269
not too interested in anyone at the
moment same with the skeleton he's

438
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279
moment same with the skeleton he's
 

439
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,310
moment same with the skeleton he's
he's looking around he's happy uh when i

440
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
he's looking around he's happy uh when i
 

441
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,389
he's looking around he's happy uh when i
hit this button though

442
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
hit this button though
 

443
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,190
hit this button though
this snow golem instantly targets the

444
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
this snow golem instantly targets the
 

445
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,790
this snow golem instantly targets the
skeleton

446
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
skeleton
 

447
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,470
skeleton
he saw his head his head turn and then

448
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
he saw his head his head turn and then
 

449
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,870
he saw his head his head turn and then
his body turns with him

450
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
his body turns with him
 

451
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,550
his body turns with him
and then he stays locked onto the

452
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
and then he stays locked onto the
 

453
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,389
and then he stays locked onto the
skeleton for

454
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
skeleton for
 

455
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,870
skeleton for
a random amount of time it's it's pretty

456
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
a random amount of time it's it's pretty
 

457
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,550
a random amount of time it's it's pretty
short

458
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
short
 

459
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,990
short
he instantly focuses on him um he's not

460
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
he instantly focuses on him um he's not
 

461
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,990
he instantly focuses on him um he's not
able to shoot at the skeleton until his

00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
able to shoot at the skeleton until his
 

463
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,670
able to shoot at the skeleton until his
body fully

turns and faces a skeleton
 

467
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,190
turns and faces a skeleton
so he has no chance of shooting the

468
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
so he has no chance of shooting the
 

469
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,310
so he has no chance of shooting the

he tried there try it again
 

487
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,670
he tried there try it again
and now now that he hit the skeleton

and now now that he hit the skeleton
 

489
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,590
and now now that he hit the skeleton
this skeleton he's not so careless

this skeleton he's not so careless
 

491
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,190
this skeleton he's not so careless
anymore he's he's got

snow golem even though he hit him he
 

497
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,269
snow golem even though he hit him he
still doesn't really care he's still

turning his body around
 

501
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,069
turning his body around
he doesn't view the skeleton as a target

502

he doesn't view the skeleton as a target
 

503
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,509
he doesn't view the skeleton as a target
he only targets them if he gets line of

he only targets them if he gets line of
 

505
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,949
he only targets them if he gets line of
sight to him again

sight to him again
and just for a certain amount of time

508
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
and just for a certain amount of time
 

509
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,030
and just for a certain amount of time
afterwards but this skeleton

510
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
afterwards but this skeleton
 

511
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,910
afterwards but this skeleton
he can shoot any time this opens now

512
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920

 

513
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,509

and again that's random too

514
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519

 

515
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,150

oh okay snow golem shot first and

516
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
oh okay snow golem shot first and
 

517
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,389
oh okay snow golem shot first and
skelton just shot the snow golem

518
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
skelton just shot the snow golem
 

519
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,430
skelton just shot the snow golem
now if we have a creeper in here this is

520
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
now if we have a creeper in here this is
 

521
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,190
now if we have a creeper in here this is
where things get interesting

522
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
where things get interesting
 

523
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,550
where things get interesting
so he's caught in the middle between

524
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
so he's caught in the middle between
 

525
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,630
so he's caught in the middle between
these two

526
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
these two
 

527
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,470
these two
let's do this a few times let's try to

528
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
let's do this a few times let's try to
 

529
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,670
let's do this a few times let's try to
try to watch which one

530
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
try to watch which one
 

531
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,190
try to watch which one
shoots the creeper

532
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
shoots the creeper
 

533
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,670
shoots the creeper
come on yeah and it's random

534
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680

 

535
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,030

rainy day now

536
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040

 

537
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,949

so i think the skeleton shot him first

538
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
so i think the skeleton shot him first
 

539
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,269
so i think the skeleton shot him first
there

540
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
there
 

541
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,310
there
yeah and so what if what it boils down

542
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
yeah and so what if what it boils down
 

543
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,630
yeah and so what if what it boils down
to

544
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640
to
 

545
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,829
to
is whoever whoever shoots uh the creeper

546
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
is whoever whoever shoots uh the creeper
 

547
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,470
is whoever whoever shoots uh the creeper
first is whoever he targets

548
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
first is whoever he targets
 

549
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,470
first is whoever he targets
and even though he's targeting the

550
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
and even though he's targeting the
 

551
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,790
and even though he's targeting the
skeleton for some reason creepers don't

552
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
skeleton for some reason creepers don't
 

553
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,829
skeleton for some reason creepers don't
look at their targets

554
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
look at their targets
 

555
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,710
look at their targets
necessarily he's still wandering his

556
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
necessarily he's still wandering his
 

557
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,670
necessarily he's still wandering his
around

558
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
around
 

559
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,389
around
but if he has line of sight he doesn't

560
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:04,399
but if he has line of sight he doesn't
 

561
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,310
but if he has line of sight he doesn't
turn to the skeleton but he still

562
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
turn to the skeleton but he still
 

563
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,030
turn to the skeleton but he still
does his sizzle move

564
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
does his sizzle move
 

565
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,870
does his sizzle move
now if the snow golem was to shoot him

566
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
now if the snow golem was to shoot him
 

567
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,150
now if the snow golem was to shoot him
again it it

568
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
again it it
 

569
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,150
again it it
doesn't matter he has his target chosen

570
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,160
doesn't matter he has his target chosen
 

571
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,990
doesn't matter he has his target chosen
the skeleton

572
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
the skeleton
 

573
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,670
the skeleton
doesn't matter um

574
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680

 

575
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,590

doesn't matter if a snow golem hits them

576
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
doesn't matter if a snow golem hits them
 

577
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,509
doesn't matter if a snow golem hits them
or another skeleton he's going to set

578
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
or another skeleton he's going to set
 

579
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,389
or another skeleton he's going to set
his eyes on that

580
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
his eyes on that
 

581
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,509
his eyes on that
that skeleton i think only person that

582
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
that skeleton i think only person that
 

583
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,350
that skeleton i think only person that
can make him change his mind is me

584
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360

 

585
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,350

maybe we'll try that okay now he sees me

586
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
maybe we'll try that okay now he sees me
 

587
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,069
maybe we'll try that okay now he sees me
as a target

588
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079

 

589
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,509

if i take this out

590
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
if i take this out
 

591
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,269
if i take this out
he's no longer sizzling at the skeleton

592
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
he's no longer sizzling at the skeleton
 

593
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,829
he's no longer sizzling at the skeleton
so he chooses me as a target over the

594
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
so he chooses me as a target over the
 

595
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,670
so he chooses me as a target over the
skeleton

596
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
skeleton
 

597
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,069
skeleton
so this experiment teaches us two really

598
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
so this experiment teaches us two really
 

599
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,110
so this experiment teaches us two really
important things

600
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
important things
 

601
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,470
important things
that we need to keep in mind with our

602
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
that we need to keep in mind with our
 

603
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,790
that we need to keep in mind with our
mob system uh first off

604
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
mob system uh first off
 

605
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,829
mob system uh first off
what really matters is who hits the

606
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839
what really matters is who hits the
 

607
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,430
what really matters is who hits the
creeper first

608
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440
creeper first
 

609
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,750
creeper first
in this case the snow golem did doesn't

610
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
in this case the snow golem did doesn't
 

611
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,550
in this case the snow golem did doesn't
matter if th

612
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
matter if th
 

613
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,269
matter if th
the skeleton hits him afterwards he

614
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
the skeleton hits him afterwards he
 

615
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,230
the skeleton hits him afterwards he
wants

616
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
wants
 

617
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,389
wants
the snow golem he needs the snow going

618
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
the snow golem he needs the snow going
 

619
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,150
the snow golem he needs the snow going
so he skeleton shot him doesn't care

620
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
so he skeleton shot him doesn't care
 

621
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,670
so he skeleton shot him doesn't care
wants a snow goal now the second really

622
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
wants a snow goal now the second really
 

623
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,949
wants a snow goal now the second really
important thing we learned from this

624
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
important thing we learned from this
 

625
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:25,990
important thing we learned from this
though is

626
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
though is
 

627
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,590
though is
we get priority over whoever hits them

628
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
we get priority over whoever hits them
 

629
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,710
we get priority over whoever hits them
all right so he wants us even if we go

630
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
all right so he wants us even if we go
 

631
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,670
all right so he wants us even if we go
game mode one he still sees us and look

632
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
game mode one he still sees us and look
 

633
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,269
game mode one he still sees us and look
at this

634
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
at this
 

635
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,949
at this
these two can wail on him he doesn't

636
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
these two can wail on him he doesn't
 

637
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,030
these two can wail on him he doesn't
care unless i move out of his target

638
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
care unless i move out of his target
 

639
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,990
care unless i move out of his target
range

640
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000

 

641
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,230

then we're no longer seen as a target he

642
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
then we're no longer seen as a target he
 

643
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,470
then we're no longer seen as a target he
can find a new target and uh

644
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
can find a new target and uh
 

645
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,470
can find a new target and uh
he blows up on these guys

646
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480

 

647
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,550

now the challenge with all of this is to

648
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
now the challenge with all of this is to
 

649
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,670
now the challenge with all of this is to
find some way

650
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
find some way
 

651
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,750
find some way
we can allow the snow golem to shoot the

652
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
we can allow the snow golem to shoot the
 

653
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,829
we can allow the snow golem to shoot the
skeleton

654
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
skeleton
 

655
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,629
skeleton
but then when the creeper gets added uh

656
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
but then when the creeper gets added uh
 

657
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,470
but then when the creeper gets added uh
we need the skeleton to be able to shoot

658
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:04,480
we need the skeleton to be able to shoot
 

659
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,470
we need the skeleton to be able to shoot
at the snow golem without the snow golem

660
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
at the snow golem without the snow golem
 

661
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,990
at the snow golem without the snow golem
shooting at the creeper

662
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
shooting at the creeper
 

663
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,269
shooting at the creeper
so how do we do that well this is what i

664
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:11,279
so how do we do that well this is what i
 

665
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,949
so how do we do that well this is what i
team up with here just this little half

666
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
team up with here just this little half
 

667
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,150
team up with here just this little half
slab

668
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
slab
 

669
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,990
slab
is all we needed shove it right in his

670
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
is all we needed shove it right in his
 

671
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,389
is all we needed shove it right in his
face now when we

672
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
face now when we
 

673
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,110
face now when we
give him line of sight to the skeleton

674
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
give him line of sight to the skeleton
 

675
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,269
give him line of sight to the skeleton
you can see he tries to shoot that way

676
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
you can see he tries to shoot that way
 

677
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,470
you can see he tries to shoot that way
but he's hitting the half slab um

678
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480

 

679
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,990

so he's not going to hit the creeper if

680
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
so he's not going to hit the creeper if
 

681
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,550
so he's not going to hit the creeper if
the half slap is in his face

682
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
the half slap is in his face
 

683
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,509
the half slap is in his face
uh with mobs they actually see from the

684
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
uh with mobs they actually see from the
 

685
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,269
uh with mobs they actually see from the
top of their head so if we stick that

686
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
top of their head so if we stick that
 

687
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,269
top of their head so if we stick that
like that

688
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
like that
 

689
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,069
like that
now he's blind he can't see anything

690
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
now he's blind he can't see anything
 

691
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:42,470
now he's blind he can't see anything
that's

692
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
that's
 

693
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,350
that's
as blocking his vision his pathfinding

694
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
as blocking his vision his pathfinding
 

695
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,189
as blocking his vision his pathfinding
um

696
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
um
 

697
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,550
um
so what we need to do basically

698
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:50,560
so what we need to do basically
 

699
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,389
so what we need to do basically
is when the skeleton comes by

700
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:54,399
is when the skeleton comes by
 

701
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,550
is when the skeleton comes by
open this up let him shoot close it

702
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
open this up let him shoot close it
 

703
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,389
open this up let him shoot close it
have the creeper come into place and

704
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
have the creeper come into place and
 

705
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,269
have the creeper come into place and
then have this in his face

706
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
then have this in his face
 

707
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,629
then have this in his face
and then open this again you see he

708
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
and then open this again you see he
 

709
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,710
and then open this again you see he
tried to shoot first there

710
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
tried to shoot first there
 

711
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,310
tried to shoot first there
but this blocked it and then the

712
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
but this blocked it and then the
 

713
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,389
but this blocked it and then the
skeleton shot him

714
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
skeleton shot him
 

715
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,670
skeleton shot him
and now he's locked onto the skeleton

716
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
and now he's locked onto the skeleton
 

717
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,430
and now he's locked onto the skeleton
and then we just need to make sure that

718
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
and then we just need to make sure that
 

719
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,670
and then we just need to make sure that
the trooper can't see me too

720
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
the trooper can't see me too
 

721
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,790
the trooper can't see me too
and if we do all of that it should work

722
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
and if we do all of that it should work
 

723
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,949
and if we do all of that it should work
okay we're back in the let's play world

724
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
okay we're back in the let's play world
 

725
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,310
okay we're back in the let's play world
here and i just want to point out

726
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
here and i just want to point out
 

727
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,350
here and i just want to point out
something

728
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360
something
 

729
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,670
something
i'm working at revamping the mob system

730
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680
i'm working at revamping the mob system
 

731
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,829
i'm working at revamping the mob system
making bunch of changes to it

732
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
making bunch of changes to it
 

733
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,230
making bunch of changes to it
uh one one thing i did is i extended the

734
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
uh one one thing i did is i extended the
 

735
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,069
uh one one thing i did is i extended the
length of the creeper and the scalping

736
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
length of the creeper and the scalping
 

737
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,749
length of the creeper and the scalping
pipes here

738
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:41,759
pipes here
 

739
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,870
pipes here
to try to prevent them from clumping up

740
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:44,880
to try to prevent them from clumping up
 

741
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,910
to try to prevent them from clumping up
and uh one thing i also did here is i

742
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
and uh one thing i also did here is i
 

743
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,990
and uh one thing i also did here is i
added a whole bunch of bends

744
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000
added a whole bunch of bends
 

745
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,790
added a whole bunch of bends
at the end here it does like a couple of

746
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
at the end here it does like a couple of
 

747
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,310
at the end here it does like a couple of
jig jags

748
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,320
jig jags
 

749
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,110
jig jags
and i did that to try to keep them from

750
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
and i did that to try to keep them from
 

751
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,389
and i did that to try to keep them from
clumping up as well but look what

752
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399
clumping up as well but look what
 

753
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,110
clumping up as well but look what
happens

754
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
happens
 

755
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,749
happens
i've never seen this before if you have

756
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:01,759
i've never seen this before if you have
 

757
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,590
i've never seen this before if you have
too many bends in the pipe they can get

758
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
too many bends in the pipe they can get
 

759
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,990
too many bends in the pipe they can get
stuck like that

760
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
stuck like that
 

761
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,509
stuck like that
like there's not nothing in front of

762
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
like there's not nothing in front of
 

763
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,110
like there's not nothing in front of
this guy but they keep bumping each

764
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
this guy but they keep bumping each
 

765
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,430
this guy but they keep bumping each
other

766
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
other
 

767
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,990
other
which prevents this guy from getting out

768
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
which prevents this guy from getting out
 

769
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,550
which prevents this guy from getting out
of this

770
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
of this
 

771
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,389
of this
this corner because that guy's bumping

772
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
this corner because that guy's bumping
 

773
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,590
this corner because that guy's bumping
him there

774
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
him there
 

775
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,670
him there
and they seem to just get stuck

776
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
and they seem to just get stuck
 

777
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,470
and they seem to just get stuck
permanently here

778
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
permanently here
 

779
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,910
permanently here
so i'm gonna have to redo this and

780
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
so i'm gonna have to redo this and
 

781
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,949
so i'm gonna have to redo this and
straighten up things

782
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959

 

783
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,670

wow this is a real problem actually i've

784
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
wow this is a real problem actually i've
 

785
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,870
wow this is a real problem actually i've
never

786
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
never
 

787
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,110
never
i've never seen this before it must be

788
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
i've never seen this before it must be
 

789
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,829
i've never seen this before it must be
kind of new

790
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
kind of new
 

791
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,910
kind of new
behavior but uh

792
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
behavior but uh
 

793
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,470
behavior but uh
they can get stuck on any right angle it

794
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
they can get stuck on any right angle it
 

795
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,350
they can get stuck on any right angle it
looks like in a water system

796
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
looks like in a water system
 

797
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,150
looks like in a water system
um i tried adding a trap door here in

798
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,160
um i tried adding a trap door here in
 

799
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,749
um i tried adding a trap door here in
that corner

800
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
that corner
 

801
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,910
that corner
to give them less space to get stuck at

802
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:49,920
to give them less space to get stuck at
 

803
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,110
to give them less space to get stuck at
but they still

804
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
but they still
 

805
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,389
but they still
are getting stuck there for some reason

806
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
are getting stuck there for some reason
 

807
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,790
are getting stuck there for some reason
um the odd time a couple will get

808
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
um the odd time a couple will get
 

809
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,310
um the odd time a couple will get
through but then they just get stuck

810
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
through but then they just get stuck
 

811
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,430
through but then they just get stuck
again

812
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
again
 

813
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,350
again
uh only if there's a lot of mobs in here

814
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
uh only if there's a lot of mobs in here
 

815
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,670
uh only if there's a lot of mobs in here
though of course

816
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
though of course
 

817
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,710
though of course
but i'm gonna have to regulate it

818
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
but i'm gonna have to regulate it
 

819
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,829
but i'm gonna have to regulate it
somehow i'm not really sure how to

820
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
somehow i'm not really sure how to
 

821
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,390
somehow i'm not really sure how to
though

822
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
though
 

823
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,069
though
what i did is i just added up

824
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079
what i did is i just added up
 

825
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,750
what i did is i just added up
like an extension to the water stream

826
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760
like an extension to the water stream
 

827
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,189
like an extension to the water stream
here to give them more space

828
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:17,199
here to give them more space
 

829
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,230
here to give them more space
to gather up so they hopefully don't get

830
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
to gather up so they hopefully don't get
 

831
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,549
to gather up so they hopefully don't get
uh clumped up and stuck but

832
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
uh clumped up and stuck but
 

833
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,110
uh clumped up and stuck but
that's not that's not working i'm gonna

834
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
that's not that's not working i'm gonna
 

835
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,470
that's not that's not working i'm gonna
have to get rid of this

836
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
have to get rid of this
 

837
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,669
have to get rid of this
because they're getting stuck on all

838
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
because they're getting stuck on all
 

839
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,390
because they're getting stuck on all
these right angles

840
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400

 

841
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,590

you can see it a little clearer when

842
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,600
you can see it a little clearer when
 

843
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,750
you can see it a little clearer when
we're inside the tube basically i had

844
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
we're inside the tube basically i had
 

845
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,270
we're inside the tube basically i had
them going straight across here

846
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280
them going straight across here
 

847
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,190
them going straight across here
originally

848
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,200
originally
 

849
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,549
originally
and they would wait here and this would

850
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
and they would wait here and this would
 

851
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,230
and they would wait here and this would
open up and they'd fall down

852
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
open up and they'd fall down
 

853
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,630
open up and they'd fall down
but then i added in this this bend just

854
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
but then i added in this this bend just
 

855
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,909
but then i added in this this bend just
to extend it a little bit

856
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
to extend it a little bit
 

857
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,909
to extend it a little bit
but that's causing problems so we're

858
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
but that's causing problems so we're
 

859
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,430
but that's causing problems so we're
going to take that out and just have

860
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
going to take that out and just have
 

861
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,950
going to take that out and just have
them go straight through

862
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:52,960
them go straight through
 

863
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,190
them go straight through
and find some way to slow them down

864
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200

 

865
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,789

uh the main problem we're having with

866
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:00,799
uh the main problem we're having with
 

867
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,549
uh the main problem we're having with
the mob system is we're just getting too

868
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
the mob system is we're just getting too
 

869
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,630
the mob system is we're just getting too
many mobs in it at once it can't sort

870
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
many mobs in it at once it can't sort
 

871
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,909
many mobs in it at once it can't sort
them that quickly

872
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
them that quickly
 

873
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,150
them that quickly
and it gets backed up and then two mobs

874
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
and it gets backed up and then two mobs
 

875
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,909
and it gets backed up and then two mobs
start going through at a time or three

876
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:09,919
start going through at a time or three
 

877
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:10,470
start going through at a time or three
and it just

878
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
and it just
 

879
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,350
and it just
totally wrecks everything uh normally we

880
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
totally wrecks everything uh normally we
 

881
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,230
totally wrecks everything uh normally we
have a switch

882
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
have a switch
 

883
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,029
have a switch
to to switch between killing the mobs or

884
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,039
to to switch between killing the mobs or
 

885
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,510
to to switch between killing the mobs or
sending them through the mob sorter

886
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
sending them through the mob sorter
 

887
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,350
sending them through the mob sorter
over here so my plan on to on regulating

888
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
over here so my plan on to on regulating
 

889
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:23,830
over here so my plan on to on regulating
this

890
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:23,840
this
 

891
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,110
this
is i've added a tripwire here

892
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
is i've added a tripwire here
 

893
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,310
is i've added a tripwire here
now so if there's if the mobs get backed

894
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,320
now so if there's if the mobs get backed
 

895
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:30,630
now so if there's if the mobs get backed
up

896
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
up
 

897
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,430
up
from like this is the front of the line

898
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440
from like this is the front of the line
 

899
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:33,990
from like this is the front of the line
here

900
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
here
 

901
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,590
here
if they get them up if they get backed

902
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600
if they get them up if they get backed
 

903
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,990
if they get them up if they get backed
up four blocks to here

904
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
up four blocks to here
 

905
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,710
up four blocks to here
uh this truck tripwire's gonna get

906
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
uh this truck tripwire's gonna get
 

907
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,510
uh this truck tripwire's gonna get
triggered

908
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
triggered
 

909
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,110
triggered
that sends power to all these pistons

910
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
that sends power to all these pistons
 

911
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,830
that sends power to all these pistons
and then any more mobs that enter

912
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
and then any more mobs that enter
 

913
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,510
and then any more mobs that enter
are gonna falls down to their death

914
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
are gonna falls down to their death
 

915
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,789
are gonna falls down to their death
until this this line decreases

916
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
until this this line decreases
 

917
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,510
until this this line decreases
so hopefully that

918
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520

 

919
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,430

let's works to get this back the way it

920
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,440
let's works to get this back the way it
 

921
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,510
let's works to get this back the way it
was

922
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
was
 

923
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,150
was
it goes there let's get out of here it's

924
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
it goes there let's get out of here it's
 

925
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,029
it goes there let's get out of here it's
really hard

926
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:05,039
really hard
 

927
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:14,390
really hard
working on this on hard mode

928
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400

 

929
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,510

okay so this first time is going to be a

930
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
okay so this first time is going to be a
 

931
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,310
okay so this first time is going to be a
huge mess

932
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
huge mess
 

933
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,590
huge mess
because it's not supposed to deal with

934
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
because it's not supposed to deal with
 

935
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:27,430
because it's not supposed to deal with
this many all at once but

936
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,440

 

937
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,110

that filled up quick

938
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120

 

939
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,549

all right i'll clear this we'll

940
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
all right i'll clear this we'll
 

941
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,110
all right i'll clear this we'll
hopefully see it working properly

942
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
hopefully see it working properly
 

943
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,110
hopefully see it working properly
but you can see since it's jammed up

944
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,120
but you can see since it's jammed up
 

945
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,230
but you can see since it's jammed up
it's backed up

946
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
it's backed up
 

947
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,430
it's backed up
uh to where this line is any new guys

948
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
uh to where this line is any new guys
 

949
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,750
uh to where this line is any new guys
are falling straight down now to their

950
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
are falling straight down now to their
 

951
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,470
are falling straight down now to their
death

952
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,480
death
 

953
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,190
death
instead of going into the line as well

954
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200

 

955
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,590

so he just fell

956
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600

 

957
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,110

no that's a little short-sighted i

958
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
no that's a little short-sighted i
 

959
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,950
no that's a little short-sighted i
forgot it cuts off the water too

960
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:58,960
forgot it cuts off the water too
 

961
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,830
forgot it cuts off the water too
so these guys are just stuck now

962
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:03,840

 

963
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,430

let's just watch this for a little bit

964
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
let's just watch this for a little bit
 

965
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,070
let's just watch this for a little bit
shall we i've added in

966
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
shall we i've added in
 

967
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,470
shall we i've added in
another piston over there now which

968
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:10,480
another piston over there now which
 

969
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,149
another piston over there now which
pulls a block down

970
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:12,159
pulls a block down
 

971
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,630
pulls a block down
and there's a second water stream hidden

972
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
and there's a second water stream hidden
 

973
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,430
and there's a second water stream hidden
underneath the

974
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
underneath the
 

975
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,110
underneath the
the trap wire there so

976
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
the trap wire there so
 

977
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,870
the trap wire there so
so if this stream gets broken here then

978
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
so if this stream gets broken here then
 

979
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,710
so if this stream gets broken here then
this one continues it

980
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720
this one continues it
 

981
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,909
this one continues it
and that seems to work okay

982
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
and that seems to work okay
 

983
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,590
and that seems to work okay
i need to make these guys fall further

984
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
i need to make these guys fall further
 

985
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,070
i need to make these guys fall further
though because if they stop here

986
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080
though because if they stop here
 

987
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,630
though because if they stop here
it's not a far enough drop to kill them

988
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
it's not a far enough drop to kill them
 

989
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,430
it's not a far enough drop to kill them
when they land there

990
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
when they land there
 

991
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,070
when they land there
um this thing's getting kind of crazy

992
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
um this thing's getting kind of crazy
 

993
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,830
um this thing's getting kind of crazy
that the actual like

994
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
that the actual like
 

995
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,830
that the actual like

00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
working really well now
 

999
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,350

the way i wired this is actually really

1028
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
the way i wired this is actually really
 

1029
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,230
the way i wired this is actually really
simple too all i did is i hooked

1030
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,240
simple too all i did is i hooked
 

1031
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,789
simple too all i did is i hooked
uh from this tripwire there if there's a

1032
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
uh from this tripwire there if there's a
 

1033
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,909
uh from this tripwire there if there's a
creeper in there it

1034
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:35,919
creeper in there it
 

1035
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,950
creeper in there it
sends power to this and pushes the half

1036
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
sends power to this and pushes the half
 

1037
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,510
sends power to this and pushes the half
slab

1038
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,520
slab
 

1039
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,430
slab
or if there's any mob in there um

1040
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
or if there's any mob in there um
 

1041
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,830
or if there's any mob in there um
so that's working really well we just

1042
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:45,840
so that's working really well we just
 

1043
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,909
so that's working really well we just
need to fix the mob sorter and the

1044
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
need to fix the mob sorter and the
 

1045
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,669
need to fix the mob sorter and the
regulator and all that

1046
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:49,679
regulator and all that
 

1047
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,710
regulator and all that
and this will work like a dream and then

1048
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
and this will work like a dream and then
 

1049
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,070
and this will work like a dream and then
we can figure out what we want to do

1050
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,080
we can figure out what we want to do
 

1051
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,470
we can figure out what we want to do
with

1052
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480
with
 

1053
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,549
with
the mobs exploding afterwards that the

1054
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:56,559
the mobs exploding afterwards that the
 

1055
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,110
the mobs exploding afterwards that the
goal is kind of some kind of tree farm

1056
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,120
goal is kind of some kind of tree farm
 

1057
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,190
goal is kind of some kind of tree farm
but we might do some other stuff too

1058
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
but we might do some other stuff too
 

1059
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,549
but we might do some other stuff too
we'll see how this goes

1060
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559

 

1061
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,710

but it is working a lot better

1062
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:08,720

 

1063
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,230

blow up oh yeah

1064
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240
blow up oh yeah
 

1065
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,149
blow up oh yeah
all automatic that is so cool

1066
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159

 

1067
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,870

yeah and i added in an rs nor latch

1068
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:18,880
yeah and i added in an rs nor latch
 

1069
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,909
yeah and i added in an rs nor latch
there for

1070
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
there for
 

1071
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,470
there for
releasing the mobs there's a tripwire

1072
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:22,480
releasing the mobs there's a tripwire
 

1073
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,070
releasing the mobs there's a tripwire
that when they fall

1074
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080
that when they fall
 

1075
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,870
that when they fall
trip i over here that goes to there when

1076
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
trip i over here that goes to there when
 

1077
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,149
trip i over here that goes to there when
they fall down the tube

1078
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
they fall down the tube
 

1079
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,789
they fall down the tube
it switches that that redstone block

1080
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
it switches that that redstone block
 

1081
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,430
it switches that that redstone block
and uh resets it

1082
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440

 

1083
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,950

plan
through data plan and there's a limit of

1112
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
through data plan and there's a limit of
 

1113
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,070
through data plan and there's a limit of
five gigs on that

1114
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,080
