are going to be making a hole from that
 

35
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,460
are going to be making a hole from that
pillar

36

we're standing in right now we got to
 

43
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,330
we're standing in right now we got to
dig out it's like a 57 by 57 square and

44
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:17,340
dig out it's like a 57 by 57 square and
 

45
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,300
dig out it's like a 57 by 57 square and
we got to dig it down to why 40 and

46
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,310
we got to dig it down to why 40 and
 

47
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,399
we got to dig it down to why 40 and
we're at why 63 at the moment so yes

48
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:25,409
we're at why 63 at the moment so yes
 

49

don't have a real super duper plan for
 

53
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,520
don't have a real super duper plan for
the farm just yet I figure we will dig

54
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:34,530
the farm just yet I figure we will dig
 

55
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,179
the farm just yet I figure we will dig
the hole and and like flood it and stuff

56
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:38,189
the hole and and like flood it and stuff
 

57
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,069
the hole and and like flood it and stuff
and then we'll take it from there we'll

58
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
and then we'll take it from there we'll
 

59
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,690
and then we'll take it from there we'll
have to experiment a little bit I'm not

60
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:41,700
have to experiment a little bit I'm not
 

61
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,080
have to experiment a little bit I'm not
sure how I want to do the firm exactly

00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,090
sure how I want to do the firm exactly
 

63
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,060

we'll see we'll see what we do so I got
 

79
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,930
we'll see we'll see what we do so I got
a little camp here for storing some

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:15,940
a little camp here for storing some
 

81
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,610
a little camp here for storing some
blocks under they need a lot more chests

82

blocks under they need a lot more chests
 

83
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,589
blocks under they need a lot more chests
and enderchest

84
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
and enderchest
 

85
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,660

elder Guardian I just want to see what
it does you have to dry it out in the

90
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
it does you have to dry it out in the
 

91
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,759
it does you have to dry it out in the
furnace and then you can place it again

92
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:29,769
furnace and then you can place it again
 

93
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:39,360
furnace and then you can place it again
and it'll soak up water I am in the

94
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,370
and it'll soak up water I am in the
 

95
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,340
and it'll soak up water I am in the
snapshot where stuff doesn't really

96
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:41,350
snapshot where stuff doesn't really
 

97
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,340
snapshot where stuff doesn't really
update what I'm recording did that not

98
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,350
update what I'm recording did that not
 

99
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,949
update what I'm recording did that not
do anything oh it did do something the

100
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
do anything oh it did do something the
 

101
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,920

waters gone it did pick up a whole lot

102
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:49,930
waters gone it did pick up a whole lot
 

103
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:57,930
waters gone it did pick up a whole lot
of water though did it yeah I had a

104
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:57,940
of water though did it yeah I had a
 

105
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,970
of water though did it yeah I had a
feeling one sponge wasn't gonna be quite

106
00:02:59,970 --> 00:02:59,980
feeling one sponge wasn't gonna be quite
 

107
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,009
feeling one sponge wasn't gonna be quite
enough we might go back to that water

108
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:02,019
enough we might go back to that water
 

109
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:03,780
enough we might go back to that water
temple today just to get some more

110
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:03,790
temple today just to get some more
 

111
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,030
temple today just to get some more
because otherwise I'm going to be

112
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,040
because otherwise I'm going to be
 

113
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,210
because otherwise I'm going to be
running back and forth to the furnace I

114
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:08,220
running back and forth to the furnace I
 

115
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,160
running back and forth to the furnace I
need to be able to spam drop them down I

116
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,170
need to be able to spam drop them down I
 

117
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,259
need to be able to spam drop them down I
think otherwise they have trouble

118
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:13,269
think otherwise they have trouble
 

119
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:16,259
think otherwise they have trouble
picking up the water give it time to

120
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:16,269
picking up the water give it time to
 

121
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:20,220
picking up the water give it time to
update hopefully the next snapshot comes

122
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,230
update hopefully the next snapshot comes
 

123
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,960
update hopefully the next snapshot comes
out soon so that I didn't actually

124
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:21,970
out soon so that I didn't actually
 

125
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,870
out soon so that I didn't actually
record what I'm doing um MOG the miner

126
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:24,880
record what I'm doing um MOG the miner
 

127
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,759
record what I'm doing um MOG the miner
just put out a screenshot actually of

128
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:26,769
just put out a screenshot actually of
 

129
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,819
just put out a screenshot actually of
him getting over a thousand frames per

130
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:29,829
him getting over a thousand frames per
 

131
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:33,059
him getting over a thousand frames per
second on whatever they've done with the

132
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:33,069
second on whatever they've done with the
 

133
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:34,770
second on whatever they've done with the
next snapshot which I'm very excited

134
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:34,780
next snapshot which I'm very excited
 

135
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,520
next snapshot which I'm very excited
about if that actually translates to oh

136
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:40,530
about if that actually translates to oh
 

137
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,629
about if that actually translates to oh
the working and I believe he was even

138
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:45,639
the working and I believe he was even
 

139
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,240
the working and I believe he was even
using the same graphics card I I use on

140
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,250
using the same graphics card I I use on
 

141
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,680
using the same graphics card I I use on
my computer so that might be good news

142
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:52,690

 

143
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,110

let me show you this as well there's a

144
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,120
let me show you this as well there's a
 

145
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,570
let me show you this as well there's a
lot of dark caves around here we're

146
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:58,580
lot of dark caves around here we're
 

147
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,610
lot of dark caves around here we're
gonna have to light these up I'm pretty

148
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:00,620
gonna have to light these up I'm pretty
 

149
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,420
gonna have to light these up I'm pretty
sure because these Guardian guys I'm

150
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,430
sure because these Guardian guys I'm
 

151
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,620
sure because these Guardian guys I'm
guessing take up a hostile mob spawning

152
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:07,630
guessing take up a hostile mob spawning
 

153
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,600
guessing take up a hostile mob spawning
space right which you can have like up

154
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:10,610
space right which you can have like up
 

155
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,199
space right which you can have like up
to I forget the exact number 79 or

156
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:14,209
to I forget the exact number 79 or
 

157
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:17,920
to I forget the exact number 79 or
something um not counting like extra

158
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:17,930
something um not counting like extra
 

159
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,920
something um not counting like extra
from back spawning and and whatnot so ya

160
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:23,930
from back spawning and and whatnot so ya
 

161
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,969
from back spawning and and whatnot so ya
might have to do do a bit of caving here

162
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:26,979
might have to do do a bit of caving here
 

163
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:33,010
might have to do do a bit of caving here
well and all of this is for making the

164
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:33,020
well and all of this is for making the
 

165
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,920
well and all of this is for making the
prismarine blocks let me show you we can

166
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:35,930
prismarine blocks let me show you we can
 

167
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,750
prismarine blocks let me show you we can
make a lamp right now I think we got

168
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:37,760
make a lamp right now I think we got
 

169
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,260
make a lamp right now I think we got
five of these these crystals are the

170
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,270
five of these these crystals are the
 

171
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,140
five of these these crystals are the
rare drop you don't get them too often

172
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,150
rare drop you don't get them too often
 

173
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,810
rare drop you don't get them too often
you get these shards a lot more but with

174
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:46,820
you get these shards a lot more but with
 

175
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,040
you get these shards a lot more but with
the crystals you can make the sea

176
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,050
the crystals you can make the sea
 

177
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,550
the crystals you can make the sea
lantern and with this can do that and I

178
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:51,560
lantern and with this can do that and I
 

179
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,930
lantern and with this can do that and I
think there's also dark prismarine and

180
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:55,940
think there's also dark prismarine and
 

181
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,790
think there's also dark prismarine and
maybe one other one I have to look at

182
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:57,800
maybe one other one I have to look at
 

183
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,560
maybe one other one I have to look at
the recipes I'm not too familiar with

184
00:04:59,560 --> 00:04:59,570
the recipes I'm not too familiar with
 

185
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,230
the recipes I'm not too familiar with
them oh there's another one okay

186
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
them oh there's another one okay
 

187
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,270
them oh there's another one okay
I just guessed that that's the bricks

188
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,280
I just guessed that that's the bricks
 

189
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,550
I just guessed that that's the bricks
there is a dark one too I know for sure

190
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
there is a dark one too I know for sure
 

191
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,029
there is a dark one too I know for sure
which I believe uses the crystals which

192
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:10,039
which I believe uses the crystals which
 

193
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:15,969
which I believe uses the crystals which
I'm all out of so yeah pretty cool new

194
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:15,979
I'm all out of so yeah pretty cool new
 

195
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:18,070
I'm all out of so yeah pretty cool new
block types I really like that there's a

196
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
block types I really like that there's a
 

197
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,490
block types I really like that there's a
new type of light that's that's in a

198
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:21,500
new type of light that's that's in a
 

199
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,430
new type of light that's that's in a
block form not and not a torch I don't

200
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:24,440
block form not and not a torch I don't
 

201
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,390
block form not and not a torch I don't
like torches too much oh and by the way

202
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
like torches too much oh and by the way
 

203
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,129
like torches too much oh and by the way
I'm making a mycelium farm over here

204
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:32,139
I'm making a mycelium farm over here
 

205
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:35,170
I'm making a mycelium farm over here
from the mycelium we got at the mushroom

206
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:35,180
from the mycelium we got at the mushroom
 

207
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,450
from the mycelium we got at the mushroom
biome last episode I figured instead of

208
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:37,460
biome last episode I figured instead of
 

209
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,370
biome last episode I figured instead of
destroying that biome we would just grow

210
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:39,380
destroying that biome we would just grow
 

211
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,790
destroying that biome we would just grow
some here and since I'm here for a long

212
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
some here and since I'm here for a long
 

213
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,570
some here and since I'm here for a long
time we can probably grow a lot of it

214
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:45,580
time we can probably grow a lot of it
 

215
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,659
time we can probably grow a lot of it
and yeah I guess it's time I get to

216
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:49,669
and yeah I guess it's time I get to
 

217
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:51,520
and yeah I guess it's time I get to
digging I can't really do it on camera

218
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:51,530
digging I can't really do it on camera
 

219
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,400
digging I can't really do it on camera
it looks like because when I'm not

220
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,410
it looks like because when I'm not
 

221
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,350
it looks like because when I'm not
recording everything is fine the blocks

222
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:56,360
recording everything is fine the blocks
 

223
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,060
recording everything is fine the blocks
disappear like they should but when I am

224
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,070
disappear like they should but when I am
 

225
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,360
disappear like they should but when I am
recording we get this

226
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,370
recording we get this
 

227
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,300
recording we get this
which is a bit of an issue although it

228
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:04,310
which is a bit of an issue although it
 

229
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:12,100
which is a bit of an issue although it
is kind of cool so so weird isn't it but

230
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,110
is kind of cool so so weird isn't it but
 

231
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,300
is kind of cool so so weird isn't it but
yeah I'm going to do some digging

232
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:13,310
yeah I'm going to do some digging
 

233
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,320
yeah I'm going to do some digging
and I'll be back in a little bit maybe

234
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:17,330
and I'll be back in a little bit maybe
 

235
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,909
and I'll be back in a little bit maybe
I'll give you a little updates as we go

236
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:18,919
I'll give you a little updates as we go
 

237
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:20,559
I'll give you a little updates as we go
here so just got a little chunk out

238
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:20,569
here so just got a little chunk out
 

239
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:21,999
here so just got a little chunk out
right now and my shovel needs to be

240
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:22,009
right now and my shovel needs to be
 

241
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,930
right now and my shovel needs to be
repaired let's go do that I'm going to

242
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:25,940
repaired let's go do that I'm going to
 

243
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,580
repaired let's go do that I'm going to
go through a lot of tool repairs

244
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:27,590
go through a lot of tool repairs
 

245
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,649
go through a lot of tool repairs
probably so we should just have an anvil

246
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:29,659
probably so we should just have an anvil
 

247
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:31,270
probably so we should just have an anvil
here now that I think of it

248
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
here now that I think of it
 

249
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,200
here now that I think of it
ouch it's up to 17 levels getting more

250
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,210
ouch it's up to 17 levels getting more
 

251
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,770
ouch it's up to 17 levels getting more
and more expensive we just about got all

252
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:38,780
and more expensive we just about got all
 

253
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,320
and more expensive we just about got all
the dirt in the sand out now I put a

254
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,330
the dirt in the sand out now I put a
 

255
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,960
the dirt in the sand out now I put a
perimeter around the water that we need

256
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:43,970
perimeter around the water that we need
 

257
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,200
perimeter around the water that we need
to dig out as well so we will probably

258
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,210
to dig out as well so we will probably
 

259
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,659
to dig out as well so we will probably
have to go get some more sponges in just

260
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:49,669
have to go get some more sponges in just
 

261
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:51,939
have to go get some more sponges in just
a moment here and my tools are about to

262
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:51,949
a moment here and my tools are about to
 

263
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,589
a moment here and my tools are about to
break again and I have no experience

264
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
break again and I have no experience
 

265
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:00,070
break again and I have no experience
levels to repair them so yeah

266
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080

 

267
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,219

mm yeah okay we're doing it guys we're

268
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:06,229
mm yeah okay we're doing it guys we're
 

269
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:09,309
mm yeah okay we're doing it guys we're
doing it our mission is to kill the

270
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:09,319
doing it our mission is to kill the
 

271
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,249
doing it our mission is to kill the
remaining two elder Guardians in the

272
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:12,259
remaining two elder Guardians in the
 

273
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:15,809
remaining two elder Guardians in the
temple here loot the sponge room and

274
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:15,819
temple here loot the sponge room and
 

275
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:18,189
temple here loot the sponge room and
then get home before dinner because we

276
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:18,199
then get home before dinner because we
 

277
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,990
then get home before dinner because we
got a lot of building to do today we

278
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
got a lot of building to do today we
 

279
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,640
got a lot of building to do today we
can't waste too much time here

280
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:21,650
can't waste too much time here
 

281
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,480
can't waste too much time here
all right so this first parts the rough

282
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,490
all right so this first parts the rough
 

283
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,760
all right so this first parts the rough
part getting inside the temple if we can

284
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:27,770
part getting inside the temple if we can
 

285
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,749
part getting inside the temple if we can
do that we're fine

286
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:28,759
do that we're fine
 

287
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,719
do that we're fine

something
 

303
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,820
something

304
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:54,830
I didn't bring night vision no all right
 

305
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,320

306
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,330
we're not gonna be here long anyway and
 

307

up here this is where I saw one of the
 

311
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,309
up here this is where I saw one of the
bosses I think on the second floor let's

every time maybe he was on the very top
 

317
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,129
every time maybe he was on the very top

now earlier today when I was here they

608
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:27,850
now earlier today when I was here they
 

609
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,880
now earlier today when I was here they
were all pretty much mowed down like

610
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:29,890
were all pretty much mowed down like
 

611
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,600
were all pretty much mowed down like
there was no

612
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:30,610
there was no
 

613
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,600
there was no
so I'm guessing since I've been working

614
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:33,610
so I'm guessing since I've been working
 

615
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,689
so I'm guessing since I've been working
in the area this area was loaded the

616
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:36,699
in the area this area was loaded the
 

617
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:39,749
in the area this area was loaded the
village and the farmer villagers the old

618
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
village and the farmer villagers the old
 

619
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,289
village and the farmer villagers the old
school ones must now actually pick up

620
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:43,299
school ones must now actually pick up
 

621
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:46,079
school ones must now actually pick up
the the wheat and the seeds and regrow

622
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,089
the the wheat and the seeds and regrow
 

623
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,989
the the wheat and the seeds and regrow
the crops because it was only the the

624
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:48,999
the crops because it was only the the
 

625
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:50,999
the crops because it was only the the
new villagers not the old ones like the

626
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:51,009
new villagers not the old ones like the
 

627
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:54,329
new villagers not the old ones like the
ones with the old trades but there's

628
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:54,339
ones with the old trades but there's
 

629
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:57,720
ones with the old trades but there's
nothing but the old farmer villagers

630
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:57,730
nothing but the old farmer villagers
 

631
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,289
nothing but the old farmer villagers
here so they are definitely the ones

632
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:01,299
here so they are definitely the ones
 

633
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:04,500
here so they are definitely the ones
doing it right pretty sure that's a

634
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:04,510
doing it right pretty sure that's a
 

635
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,929
doing it right pretty sure that's a
that's a new change I guess for a new

636
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:06,939
that's a new change I guess for a new
 

637
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,769
that's a new change I guess for a new
fix depending on how you looked at it

638
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:09,779
fix depending on how you looked at it
 

639
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:16,189
fix depending on how you looked at it
anyway let's go over to the digging site

640
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:16,199
anyway let's go over to the digging site
 

641
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,289
anyway let's go over to the digging site
pull those sponge blocks they they

642
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:19,299
pull those sponge blocks they they
 

643
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,710
pull those sponge blocks they they
helped a lot I wish I had more of them

644
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:21,720
helped a lot I wish I had more of them
 

645
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,460
helped a lot I wish I had more of them
they were very very handy that's a lot

646
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:26,470
they were very very handy that's a lot
 

647
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,340
they were very very handy that's a lot
of water to get rid of I didn't realize

648
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:29,350
of water to get rid of I didn't realize
 

649
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,899
of water to get rid of I didn't realize
this till later I was like trying to

650
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:30,909
this till later I was like trying to
 

651
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:32,220
this till later I was like trying to
figure out the best way of using them

652
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,230
figure out the best way of using them
 

653
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,100
figure out the best way of using them
but I think you should really section

654
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,110
but I think you should really section
 

655
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,320
but I think you should really section
off the water as you're removing it

656
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,330
off the water as you're removing it
 

657
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,159
off the water as you're removing it
otherwise you will you'll just have the

658
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:41,169
otherwise you will you'll just have the
 

659
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:45,149
otherwise you will you'll just have the
water refill all the time and you might

660
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:45,159
water refill all the time and you might
 

661
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:46,710
water refill all the time and you might
get a couple blocks here and there but

662
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
get a couple blocks here and there but
 

663
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,759
get a couple blocks here and there but
like a water of water source blocks but

664
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:49,769
like a water of water source blocks but
 

665
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:53,190
like a water of water source blocks but
it's a bit tricky so once I started

666
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200
it's a bit tricky so once I started
 

667
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,480
it's a bit tricky so once I started
sectioning it off like this it made a

668
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,490
sectioning it off like this it made a
 

669
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,149
sectioning it off like this it made a
lot easier I think I should make the

670
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:56,159
lot easier I think I should make the
 

671
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,649
lot easier I think I should make the
area a little bit more narrow and have

672
00:17:58,649 --> 00:17:58,659
area a little bit more narrow and have
 

673
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:01,590
area a little bit more narrow and have
like long strips for whatever water I'm

674
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:01,600
like long strips for whatever water I'm
 

675
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,379
like long strips for whatever water I'm
I'm trying to get rid of I think is the

676
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:04,389
I'm trying to get rid of I think is the
 

677
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:06,810
I'm trying to get rid of I think is the
best way of doing it and you can see

678
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:06,820
best way of doing it and you can see
 

679
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,460
best way of doing it and you can see
these guys are actually spawning outside

680
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:08,470
these guys are actually spawning outside
 

681
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,159
these guys are actually spawning outside
of our perimeter there's one over there

682
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:10,169
of our perimeter there's one over there
 

683
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:13,889
of our perimeter there's one over there
so they must spawn outside of the temple

684
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:13,899
so they must spawn outside of the temple
 

685
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:17,399
so they must spawn outside of the temple
region and not just in packs ponds so I

686
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:17,409
region and not just in packs ponds so I
 

687
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:19,379
region and not just in packs ponds so I
might want to extend this just a little

688
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:19,389
might want to extend this just a little
 

689
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:25,820
might want to extend this just a little
bit like like two to four blocks uh-huh

690
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:25,830
bit like like two to four blocks uh-huh
 

691
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,070
bit like like two to four blocks uh-huh
anyway I'm going to do some more digging

692
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,080
anyway I'm going to do some more digging
 

693
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,769

695
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:37,919
I'll be back in a little bit okay little
updates again I've been digging it I've

696

a hole today flood it and
 

703
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,900
a hole today flood it and
we can start adjusting it and making it

704
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:47,910
we can start adjusting it and making it
 

705
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,620
we can start adjusting it and making it
the way we want no this is a project oh

this whole what we've done so far has

710
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,060
this whole what we've done so far has
 

711
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,910
this whole what we've done so far has
taken many hours already

and we're only at y55 so we go down 15

714
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:03,960
and we're only at y55 so we go down 15
 

715
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,490
and we're only at y55 so we go down 15
more blocks over half half the ways yet

716
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:07,500
more blocks over half half the ways yet
 

717
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,080
more blocks over half half the ways yet
although there's a lot of teams on the

718
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,090
although there's a lot of teams on the
 

719
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,850
although there's a lot of teams on the
ground which is actually good that'll

720
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:10,860
ground which is actually good that'll
 

721
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,050
ground which is actually good that'll
save a lot of time so I think we are

722
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:15,060
save a lot of time so I think we are
 

723
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,500

four more layers down now and it took a

724
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:18,510
four more layers down now and it took a
 

725
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,320
four more layers down now and it took a
long time they did not go quickly and I

726
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:21,330
long time they did not go quickly and I
 

727
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,390
long time they did not go quickly and I
got to thinking what kind of etho

728

got to thinking what kind of etho
 

729
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,370
got to thinking what kind of etho
episode would this be if we did not have

730

which I think we'll save for next
 

791
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,630
which I think we'll save for next
episode because this this has taken so

792
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
episode because this this has taken so
 

793
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,110
episode because this this has taken so
long um somebody said in the comments

794
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,120
long um somebody said in the comments
 

795
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,060
long um somebody said in the comments
last time that I shouldn't dig the hole

796
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,070
last time that I shouldn't dig the hole
 

797
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,520
last time that I shouldn't dig the hole
here and I should do it out in the water

798
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:40,530
here and I should do it out in the water
 

799
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,980
here and I should do it out in the water
and like a real water temple that I was

800
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:42,990
and like a real water temple that I was
 

801
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,600
and like a real water temple that I was
kind of cheating doing it this way that

802
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:44,610
kind of cheating doing it this way that
 

803
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,010
kind of cheating doing it this way that
it was it was easier no this is much

804
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:49,020
it was it was easier no this is much
 

805
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,930
it was it was easier no this is much
harder than just going to a water temple

806
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:50,940
harder than just going to a water temple
 

807
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,470
harder than just going to a water temple
because basically all I've done here is

808
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480
because basically all I've done here is
 

809
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,240
because basically all I've done here is
I've dug a hole which has taken many

810
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,250
I've dug a hole which has taken many
 

811
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,950
I've dug a hole which has taken many
hours and now I have to fill it with

812
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:57,960
hours and now I have to fill it with
 

813
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,910
hours and now I have to fill it with
water and I could have just went to a

814
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:01,920
water and I could have just went to a
 

815
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,170
water and I could have just went to a
water temple and leveled the water

816
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:03,180
water temple and leveled the water
 

817
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,880
water temple and leveled the water
temple and I would have had the same

818
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:04,890
temple and I would have had the same
 

819
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,740
temple and I would have had the same
thing basically and I could've did that

820
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:06,750
thing basically and I could've did that
 

821
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,690
thing basically and I could've did that
in less than an hour so if you're making

822
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:08,700
in less than an hour so if you're making
 

823
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,360
in less than an hour so if you're making
one of these don't do it this way the

824
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,370
one of these don't do it this way the
 

825
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,650
one of these don't do it this way the
only reason I'm doing it this way is

826
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:12,660
only reason I'm doing it this way is
 

827
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,010
only reason I'm doing it this way is
because I want it close to my home base

828
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:15,020
because I want it close to my home base
 

829
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,310
because I want it close to my home base
the other life I want an actual water

830
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:19,320
the other life I want an actual water
 

831
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,410
the other life I want an actual water
temple I have to go like a couple

832
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:21,420
temple I have to go like a couple
 

833
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,030
temple I have to go like a couple
thousand blocks away from here which I

834
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,040
thousand blocks away from here which I
 

835
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,460
thousand blocks away from here which I
don't really like so that's the only

836
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:25,470
don't really like so that's the only
 

837
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:31,150
don't really like so that's the only
reason why I'm doing it like this and

838
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:31,160

 

839
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,850

while doing this I came up with some

840
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:34,860
while doing this I came up with some
 

841
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,650
while doing this I came up with some
plans for how we how we should actually

842
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:36,660
plans for how we how we should actually
 

843
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,310
plans for how we how we should actually
build the farm some pretty good ideas

844
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:39,320
build the farm some pretty good ideas
 

845
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,540
build the farm some pretty good ideas
maybe one more thing we'll do this

846
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:41,550
maybe one more thing we'll do this
 

847
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,200
maybe one more thing we'll do this
episode though is I'm going

848
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,210
episode though is I'm going
 

849
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,909
episode though is I'm going
to be putting a glass-bottom on the

850
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:44,919
to be putting a glass-bottom on the
 

851
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,820
to be putting a glass-bottom on the
whole thing invisible one as you would

852
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:50,830
whole thing invisible one as you would
 

853
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:56,159
whole thing invisible one as you would
expect so from what I observed they

854
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:56,169
expect so from what I observed they
 

855
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:59,789
expect so from what I observed they
spawn at y40 and up light up to the

856
00:22:59,789 --> 00:22:59,799
spawn at y40 and up light up to the
 

857
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,010
spawn at y40 and up light up to the
surface of the water so they spawn at

858
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,020
surface of the water so they spawn at
 

859
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,380
surface of the water so they spawn at
this level they don't spawn at Y 39

860
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:04,390
this level they don't spawn at Y 39
 

861
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,340
this level they don't spawn at Y 39
which is where our heads at right now so

862
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,350
which is where our heads at right now so
 

863
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,279
which is where our heads at right now so
this will be the like everything above

864
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:11,289
this will be the like everything above
 

865
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:15,029
this will be the like everything above
here will be spawning space see I'm

866
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,039
here will be spawning space see I'm
 

867
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,519
here will be spawning space see I'm
going to place the glass floor next

868
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:17,529
going to place the glass floor next
 

869
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,200
going to place the glass floor next
episode will flood it and then we'll

870
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,210
episode will flood it and then we'll
 

871
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,789
episode will flood it and then we'll
start building the actual thing oh man

872
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:23,799
start building the actual thing oh man
 

873
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,430
start building the actual thing oh man
that was a lot of glass that was crazy

874
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:26,440
that was a lot of glass that was crazy
 

875
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,549
that was a lot of glass that was crazy
it's really hard to understand the scale

876
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:29,559
it's really hard to understand the scale
 

877
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,200
it's really hard to understand the scale
of this thing until you start actually

878
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,210
of this thing until you start actually
 

879
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,760
of this thing until you start actually
doing something oh we did get one

880
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:32,770
doing something oh we did get one
 

881
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,149
doing something oh we did get one
spawning there's a guy right there I was

882
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
spawning there's a guy right there I was
 

883
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,649
spawning there's a guy right there I was
trying to see that's what this water is

884
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:37,659
trying to see that's what this water is
 

885
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:39,810
trying to see that's what this water is
for is trying to see if anything would

886
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:39,820
for is trying to see if anything would
 

887
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,799
for is trying to see if anything would
spawn oh you got stuck underneath let's

888
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:43,809
spawn oh you got stuck underneath let's
 

889
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:51,000
spawn oh you got stuck underneath let's
go down sucker these is zipping around

890
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,010
go down sucker these is zipping around
 

891
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,930
go down sucker these is zipping around
down there that's awesome I

892
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:53,940
down there that's awesome I
 

893
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,330
down there that's awesome I
so with this farm this is what I figured

894
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:57,340
so with this farm this is what I figured
 

895
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,220
so with this farm this is what I figured
out to buy though it's like 54 stacks of

896
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,230
out to buy though it's like 54 stacks of
 

897
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,769
out to buy though it's like 54 stacks of
glass just to do one layer the bottom of

898
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:01,779
glass just to do one layer the bottom of
 

899
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:05,909
glass just to do one layer the bottom of
the farm here with this farm our goal is

900
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:05,919
the farm here with this farm our goal is
 

901
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,370
the farm here with this farm our goal is
not super efficiency I decided we are

902
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:08,380
not super efficiency I decided we are
 

903
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,409
not super efficiency I decided we are
going to try have fun with it to test

904
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:10,419
going to try have fun with it to test
 

905
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:17,659
going to try have fun with it to test
things out and and instead of trying to

906
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:17,669
things out and and instead of trying to
 

907
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:20,399
things out and and instead of trying to
kill the mobs as quickly as possible we

908
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:20,409
kill the mobs as quickly as possible we
 

909
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:23,070
kill the mobs as quickly as possible we
are going to try move the mobs to the

910
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,080
are going to try move the mobs to the
 

911
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,700
are going to try move the mobs to the
center of the farm instead of trying to

912
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:26,710
center of the farm instead of trying to
 

913
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,320
center of the farm instead of trying to
move the items that they drop to the

914
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,330
move the items that they drop to the
 

915
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,950
move the items that they drop to the
center of the farm and you'll see why

916
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:31,960
center of the farm and you'll see why
 

917
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,310
center of the farm and you'll see why
later

918
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
later
 

919
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,799
later
it's it's kind of so that I can move

920
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:34,809
it's it's kind of so that I can move
 

921
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,419
it's it's kind of so that I can move
them through portals and stuff and have

922
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:36,429
them through portals and stuff and have
 

923
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:39,630
them through portals and stuff and have
fun with them that way but we'll get

924
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:39,640
fun with them that way but we'll get
 

925
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,149
fun with them that way but we'll get
more into that next step next time so

926
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:42,159
more into that next step next time so
 

927
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,950
more into that next step next time so
here is our comment for today it says

928
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:43,960
here is our comment for today it says
 

929
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,440
here is our comment for today it says
etho you should replace the cows in your

930
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:46,450
etho you should replace the cows in your
 

931
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,690
etho you should replace the cows in your
wheat and Cal farm with mushrooms from

932
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:48,700
wheat and Cal farm with mushrooms from
 

933
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,930
wheat and Cal farm with mushrooms from
the mushroom island that is a really

934
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:51,940
the mushroom island that is a really
 

935
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,190
the mushroom island that is a really
good idea I think we will do that

936
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,200
good idea I think we will do that
 

937
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,220
good idea I think we will do that
actually because at at the tail farm I

938
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:56,230
actually because at at the tail farm I
 

939
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,700
actually because at at the tail farm I
have in the

940
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:56,710
have in the
 

941
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,590
have in the
man cave there's even the fence that

942
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:58,600
man cave there's even the fence that
 

943
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,690
man cave there's even the fence that
divides two sides so we could have

944
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:00,700
divides two sides so we could have
 

945
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,269
divides two sides so we could have
mushrooms on one in and normal cows on

946
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:03,279
mushrooms on one in and normal cows on
 

947
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,820
mushrooms on one in and normal cows on
the other that would be pretty cool he's

948
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:08,830
