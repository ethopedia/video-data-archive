00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,430
over there so at the same level there's
always two and they kind of just spiral

164
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
always two and they kind of just spiral
 

165
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,290
always two and they kind of just spiral
all the way through and you can see I

166
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:52,300
all the way through and you can see I
 

167
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,800
all the way through and you can see I
have wood lines all the way down every

168
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:55,810
have wood lines all the way down every
 

169
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,050
have wood lines all the way down every
a fourth block is the pattern I've been

170
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,060
a fourth block is the pattern I've been
 

171
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,650
a fourth block is the pattern I've been
doing without these torches it was pitch

172
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:01,660
doing without these torches it was pitch
 

173
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,570
doing without these torches it was pitch
black like where I am right now so I

174
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:03,580
black like where I am right now so I
 

175
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,520
black like where I am right now so I
needed some lighting and I didn't want

176
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:05,530
needed some lighting and I didn't want
 

177
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,290
needed some lighting and I didn't want
to use regular torches I want to try

178
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:07,300
to use regular torches I want to try
 

179
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,409
to use regular torches I want to try
something with a little more character

180
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:09,419
something with a little more character
 

181
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:14,400
something with a little more character
something out of the ordinary so this

182
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,410
something out of the ordinary so this
 

183
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,680
something out of the ordinary so this
works really well and then the water is

184
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:16,690
works really well and then the water is
 

185
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,800
works really well and then the water is
just being held up by signs maybe we'll

186
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:19,810
just being held up by signs maybe we'll
 

187
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,720
just being held up by signs maybe we'll
go up one more time see if we can see it

188
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:24,730
go up one more time see if we can see it
 

189
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,310
go up one more time see if we can see it
yeah so there's a there signs here to

190
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:29,320
yeah so there's a there signs here to
 

191
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,390
yeah so there's a there signs here to
kind of see it I hope oh and we have a

192
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:33,400
kind of see it I hope oh and we have a
 

193
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,290
kind of see it I hope oh and we have a
glowing pumpkin below for lights we're

194
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:37,300
glowing pumpkin below for lights we're
 

195
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,460
glowing pumpkin below for lights we're
going to be adjusting the lighting

196
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:38,470
going to be adjusting the lighting
 

197
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,080

back to our base or whatever we can just
 

295
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,100
back to our base or whatever we can just
store them here temporarily we'll

ingots and also we'll probably smelt a
 

303
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,579
ingots and also we'll probably smelt a
bunch of cobble into smooth stone I've

304

bunch of cobble into smooth stone I've
 

305
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:35,610
bunch of cobble into smooth stone I've
already been doing it a little bit here

306
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:35,620
already been doing it a little bit here
 

307
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,810
already been doing it a little bit here
I also am probably going to set up

to your your mining destination you just
 

317
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,500
to your your mining destination you just
come down here get a speed potion and

318

come down here get a speed potion and
 

319
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,390
come down here get a speed potion and
then take off to wherever you need to go

320
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:58,400
then take off to wherever you need to go
 

321
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,320
then take off to wherever you need to go
if it's a ways away with these main

322
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,330
if it's a ways away with these main
 

323
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,120
if it's a ways away with these main
corridors I have here they're going to

324
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,130
corridors I have here they're going to
 

325
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,120
corridors I have here they're going to
extend 100 blocks in each directions and

326
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,130
extend 100 blocks in each directions and
 

327
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,050
extend 100 blocks in each directions and
form like a square so it'll go like a

328
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,060
form like a square so it'll go like a
 

329
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,450
form like a square so it'll go like a
hundred blocks that way and then we'll

330
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:16,460
hundred blocks that way and then we'll
 

331
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,340
hundred blocks that way and then we'll
have another main corridor going 100

332
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:18,350
have another main corridor going 100
 

333
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,430
have another main corridor going 100
blocks this way then then 100 blocks

334
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
blocks this way then then 100 blocks
 

335
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,660
blocks this way then then 100 blocks
that way 100 block

336
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:22,670
that way 100 block
 

337
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,670
that way 100 block
this way and it will meet up meet back

338
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:24,680
this way and it will meet up meet back
 

339
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,930
this way and it will meet up meet back
to this spot here and form 100 by 100 2

340
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:28,940
to this spot here and form 100 by 100 2
 

341
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,700
to this spot here and form 100 by 100 2
or 100 by 100 square sections type thing

342
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:33,710
or 100 by 100 square sections type thing
 

343
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,860
or 100 by 100 square sections type thing
so each of these tunnels is going to be

344
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:35,870
so each of these tunnels is going to be
 

345
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,180
so each of these tunnels is going to be
one wide to high like a normal mining

346
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,190
one wide to high like a normal mining
 

347
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,430
one wide to high like a normal mining
tunnel it takes a long time to mine out

348
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:42,440
tunnel it takes a long time to mine out
 

349
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,650
tunnel it takes a long time to mine out
a big space like this so these are just

350
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:44,660
a big space like this so these are just
 

351
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,130
a big space like this so these are just
going to be your standard tunnels and

352
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:47,140
going to be your standard tunnels and
 

353
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,950
going to be your standard tunnels and
they will stretch 100 blocks in that

354
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:50,960
they will stretch 100 blocks in that
 

355
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,640
they will stretch 100 blocks in that
direction

356
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:51,650
direction
 

357
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,770
direction
type thing and we're going this way

358
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:53,780
type thing and we're going this way
 

359
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,870
type thing and we're going this way
because the mountains are above us and I

360
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:55,880
because the mountains are above us and I
 

361
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,050
because the mountains are above us and I
have no intention of ever making a mob

362
00:09:59,050 --> 00:09:59,060
have no intention of ever making a mob
 

363
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,130
have no intention of ever making a mob
system in a mountain biome you know it's

364
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:03,140
system in a mountain biome you know it's
 

365
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,870
system in a mountain biome you know it's
not really good because there's a lot

366
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
not really good because there's a lot
 

367
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,170
not really good because there's a lot
more tunnels in them usually a lot

368
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:08,180
more tunnels in them usually a lot
 

369
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,730
more tunnels in them usually a lot
harder to light stuff up so that's the

370
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:12,740
harder to light stuff up so that's the
 

371
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,560
harder to light stuff up so that's the
basic pattern I'm going here at the

372
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:17,570
basic pattern I'm going here at the
 

373
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,000
basic pattern I'm going here at the
start of each of these I put a glowing

374
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,010
start of each of these I put a glowing
 

375
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,160
start of each of these I put a glowing
pumpkin and this works out really good

376
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,170
pumpkin and this works out really good
 

377
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,770
pumpkin and this works out really good
for lighting this area up actually

378
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:23,780
for lighting this area up actually
 

379
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,080
for lighting this area up actually
because that's a light level of 15 there

380
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,090
because that's a light level of 15 there
 

381
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:34,780
because that's a light level of 15 there
one block up is 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 mob

382
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:34,790
one block up is 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 mob
 

383
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,610
one block up is 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 mob
spawn at light level below 8 so it just

384
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:38,620
spawn at light level below 8 so it just
 

385
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,030
spawn at light level below 8 so it just
perfectly makes it and same if we go

386
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
perfectly makes it and same if we go
 

387
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,910
perfectly makes it and same if we go
like over here 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 so it

388
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:48,920
like over here 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 so it
 

389
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,380
like over here 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 so it
it lights up the whole thing and if you

390
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:53,390
it lights up the whole thing and if you
 

391
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,750
it lights up the whole thing and if you
were to put like lamp in the ceiling

392
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
were to put like lamp in the ceiling
 

393
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,940
were to put like lamp in the ceiling
here like right here that would be light

394
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:57,950
here like right here that would be light
 

395
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:03,220
here like right here that would be light
level 15 down 1 is 14 13 12 11 right

396
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:03,230
level 15 down 1 is 14 13 12 11 right
 

397
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,380
level 15 down 1 is 14 13 12 11 right
here and then 10 9 8 so it works out

398
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:08,390
here and then 10 9 8 so it works out
 

399
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,910
here and then 10 9 8 so it works out
really good for lighting and I'm

400
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
really good for lighting and I'm
 

401
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,500
really good for lighting and I'm
actually going to we're probably going

402
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:11,510
actually going to we're probably going
 

403
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,670
actually going to we're probably going
to do that today we're going to put a

404
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:12,680
to do that today we're going to put a
 

405
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,120
to do that today we're going to put a
few lamps in this main area here at each

406
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,130
few lamps in this main area here at each
 

407
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,870
few lamps in this main area here at each
of these places and get rid of all these

408
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:19,880
of these places and get rid of all these
 

409
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,830
of these places and get rid of all these
torches probably and I think that'll

410
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:23,840
torches probably and I think that'll
 

411
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,050
torches probably and I think that'll
look really cool so maybe we'll do that

412
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:26,060
look really cool so maybe we'll do that
 

413
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,540
look really cool so maybe we'll do that
now actually I'm going to get some lamps

414
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:28,550
now actually I'm going to get some lamps
 

415
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:33,310
now actually I'm going to get some lamps
and did I mention the minecart plan I

416
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:33,320
and did I mention the minecart plan I
 

417
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,830
and did I mention the minecart plan I
don't think I did

418
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:34,840
don't think I did
 

419
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,450
don't think I did
I may also set up minecart tracks to

420
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:39,460
I may also set up minecart tracks to
 

421
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:45,090
I may also set up minecart tracks to
haul the stuff we mine up from here to

422
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,100
haul the stuff we mine up from here to
 

423
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,730
haul the stuff we mine up from here to
our base to our storage room or whatever

424
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:47,740
our base to our storage room or whatever
 

425
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,420
our base to our storage room or whatever
I think that might be cool have like

426
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:51,430
I think that might be cool have like
 

427
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,130
I think that might be cool have like
storage of mine carts on the track and

428
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,140
storage of mine carts on the track and
 

429
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,690
storage of mine carts on the track and
we will probably be able to ride them

430
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:54,700
we will probably be able to ride them
 

431
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,180
we will probably be able to ride them
too so we'll have two ways in and out of

432
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,190
too so we'll have two ways in and out of
 

433
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,800
too so we'll have two ways in and out of
here instead of taking this you could

434
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:58,810
here instead of taking this you could
 

435
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,000
here instead of taking this you could
take the tracks back and I may I don't

436
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,010
take the tracks back and I may I don't
 

437
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,760
take the tracks back and I may I don't
know yet I may put tracks in all these

438
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:05,770
know yet I may put tracks in all these
 

439
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:11,700
know yet I may put tracks in all these
main corridors I don't know the thing is

440
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:11,710
main corridors I don't know the thing is
 

441
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,710
main corridors I don't know the thing is
that the goal of this is to get

442
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:13,720
that the goal of this is to get
 

443
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,840
that the goal of this is to get
resources and if I spend a bunch of them

444
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:15,850
resources and if I spend a bunch of them
 

445
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,060
resources and if I spend a bunch of them
just on looks and convenience and

446
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,070
just on looks and convenience and
 

447
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,640
just on looks and convenience and
everything we might be putting more into

448
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:20,650
everything we might be putting more into
 

449
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,400
everything we might be putting more into
this and we get is what I'm worried

450
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:23,410
this and we get is what I'm worried
 

451
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,490
this and we get is what I'm worried
about although we'll definitely get more

452
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:26,500
about although we'll definitely get more
 

453
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,400
about although we'll definitely get more
red dust and blue rocks then we put into

454
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,410
red dust and blue rocks then we put into
 

455
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,910
red dust and blue rocks then we put into
this I know but we might lose out a

456
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:32,920
this I know but we might lose out a
 

457
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,850
this I know but we might lose out a
little bit on iron if we get into mine

458
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:35,860
little bit on iron if we get into mine
 

459
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,410
little bit on iron if we get into mine
cart tracks I don't know we'll see we'll

460
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:40,420
cart tracks I don't know we'll see we'll
 

461
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,960
cart tracks I don't know we'll see we'll
see how it goes okay I'm going to get

462
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:42,970
see how it goes okay I'm going to get
 

463
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,400
see how it goes okay I'm going to get
the lamps and I'll be back another

464
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:47,410
the lamps and I'll be back another
 

465
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,080
the lamps and I'll be back another
really cool thing about the location of

466
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,090
really cool thing about the location of
 

467
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,030
really cool thing about the location of
the mine is it's next to all the glowing

468
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
the mine is it's next to all the glowing
 

469
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,780
the mine is it's next to all the glowing
trees here that we did before so looks

470
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:54,790
trees here that we did before so looks
 

471
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,210
trees here that we did before so looks
really cool at night and we also have

472
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:57,220
really cool at night and we also have
 

473
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,200
really cool at night and we also have
the ravine right next to it may make

474
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,210
the ravine right next to it may make
 

475
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,330
the ravine right next to it may make
bridges or something over that set up

476
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:03,340
bridges or something over that set up
 

477
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,120
bridges or something over that set up
some paths out here or something

478
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,130
some paths out here or something
 

479
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,610
some paths out here or something
I changed this to so it matches the

480
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:08,620
I changed this to so it matches the
 

481
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,720
I changed this to so it matches the
other style before the walls are more

482
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:12,730
other style before the walls are more
 

483
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:19,410
other style before the walls are more
like over here alright um sit down I got

484
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:19,420
like over here alright um sit down I got
 

485
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,860
like over here alright um sit down I got
the lamps a little install them here

486
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:24,870
the lamps a little install them here
 

487
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,920
the lamps a little install them here
I'm tempted to put them at at each of

488
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:28,930
I'm tempted to put them at at each of
 

489
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,050
I'm tempted to put them at at each of
these things but I don't know be too

490
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,060
these things but I don't know be too
 

491
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,920
these things but I don't know be too
expensive I think each one is a

492
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:34,930
expensive I think each one is a
 

493
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:40,170
expensive I think each one is a
glowstone and for redstone and then you

494
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:40,180
glowstone and for redstone and then you
 

495
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,720
glowstone and for redstone and then you
got install wiring for them maybe I got

496
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:45,730
got install wiring for them maybe I got
 

497
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,080
got install wiring for them maybe I got
an idea for the wiring for these

498
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,090
an idea for the wiring for these
 

499
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,470
an idea for the wiring for these
you know how when I think of lighting in

500
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
you know how when I think of lighting in
 

501
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,210
you know how when I think of lighting in
mineshafts I think of the lights that

502
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:54,220
mineshafts I think of the lights that
 

503
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,490
mineshafts I think of the lights that
flicker on and off randomly every so

504
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:56,500
flicker on and off randomly every so
 

505
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,990
flicker on and off randomly every so
often I'm going to try to do that with

506
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,000
often I'm going to try to do that with
 

507
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,550
often I'm going to try to do that with
these I got an idea how to do it I'll do

508
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
these I got an idea how to do it I'll do
 

509
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,870
these I got an idea how to do it I'll do
tear at least for these main this main

510
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
tear at least for these main this main
 

511
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,340
tear at least for these main this main
corridor here we're going to have lamps

512
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:11,350
corridor here we're going to have lamps
 

513
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,120
corridor here we're going to have lamps
and beyond that like over here I think

514
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,130
and beyond that like over here I think
 

515
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:20,210
and beyond that like over here I think
we may leave plain I don't know

516
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:20,220
we may leave plain I don't know
 

517
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,980
we may leave plain I don't know
or at least for right now alright so we

518
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:25,990
or at least for right now alright so we
 

519
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,670
or at least for right now alright so we
got the lamps there and the chest I was

520
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
got the lamps there and the chest I was
 

521
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,410
got the lamps there and the chest I was
thinking about it as I was walking I

522
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:31,420
thinking about it as I was walking I
 

523
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,560
thinking about it as I was walking I
think it would look really cool if we

524
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:34,570
think it would look really cool if we
 

525
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:42,810
think it would look really cool if we
have get a bunch of chests here I think

526
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:42,820
have get a bunch of chests here I think
 

527
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:49,140
have get a bunch of chests here I think
we should do it like this have in this

528
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,150
we should do it like this have in this
 

529
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,370
we should do it like this have in this
section here here here and here have

530
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:53,380
section here here here and here have
 

531
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,790
section here here here and here have
have designated for the chests and have

532
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
have designated for the chests and have
 

533
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,180
have designated for the chests and have
threw a chest here here here here here

534
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,190
threw a chest here here here here here
 

535
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,530
threw a chest here here here here here
here so six and then maybe crafting

536
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:04,540
here so six and then maybe crafting
 

537
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,060
here so six and then maybe crafting
table in the middle and furnace furnace

538
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,070
table in the middle and furnace furnace
 

539
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,310
table in the middle and furnace furnace
that might be cool but then you got the

540
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:11,320
that might be cool but then you got the
 

541
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,140
that might be cool but then you got the
problem of not being able open the chest

542
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,150
problem of not being able open the chest
 

543
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,100
problem of not being able open the chest
on on the top so we need to replace

544
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,110
on on the top so we need to replace
 

545
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,360
on on the top so we need to replace
these blocks with stairs so that we can

546
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,370
these blocks with stairs so that we can
 

547
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,560
these blocks with stairs so that we can
open the chest so I'm going to do that

548
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:25,570
open the chest so I'm going to do that
 

549
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,150
open the chest so I'm going to do that
and we'll see how it looks at least for

550
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,160
and we'll see how it looks at least for
 

551
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,130
and we'll see how it looks at least for
one of these all right that's what it

552
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:32,140
one of these all right that's what it
 

553
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,310
one of these all right that's what it
looks like here not quite happy with it

554
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:35,320
looks like here not quite happy with it
 

555
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,230
looks like here not quite happy with it
I think I should have put in one more

556
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:37,240
I think I should have put in one more
 

557
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,650
I think I should have put in one more
block so it's inset like everything else

558
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:40,660
block so it's inset like everything else
 

559
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,920
block so it's inset like everything else
is here like this is inset this is inset

560
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:43,930
is here like this is inset this is inset
 

561
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,190
is here like this is inset this is inset
the whole whole mineshaft everything is

562
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,200
the whole whole mineshaft everything is
 

563
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,380
the whole whole mineshaft everything is
in one block it doesn't look right if

564
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:49,390
in one block it doesn't look right if
 

565
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,490
in one block it doesn't look right if
it's flush with the wooden planks that

566
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:52,500
it's flush with the wooden planks that
 

567
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,230
it's flush with the wooden planks that
also fix another problem I'm having with

568
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:55,240
also fix another problem I'm having with
 

569
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,030

the stairs here they have a lighting

570
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
the stairs here they have a lighting
 

571
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,840
the stairs here they have a lighting
glitch so the lower half is darker and

572
00:15:59,840 --> 00:15:59,850
glitch so the lower half is darker and
 

573
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,689
glitch so the lower half is darker and
it doesn't

574
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:01,699
it doesn't
 

575
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:04,599
it doesn't
doesn't look right so if if I move it in

576
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:04,609
doesn't look right so if if I move it in
 

577
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:06,599
doesn't look right so if if I move it in
one block I won't have that problem and

578
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:06,609
one block I won't have that problem and
 

579
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:10,169
one block I won't have that problem and
we'll see how it looks

580
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:10,179
we'll see how it looks
 

581
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,519
we'll see how it looks
yeah I like that a lot more looks a lot

582
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:12,529
yeah I like that a lot more looks a lot
 

583
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:16,179
yeah I like that a lot more looks a lot
better maybe other options too maybe not

584
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:16,189
better maybe other options too maybe not
 

585
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:17,799
better maybe other options too maybe not
have the crafting table and have three

586
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:17,809
have the crafting table and have three
 

587
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:21,389
have the crafting table and have three
furnaces just so it's a little more

588
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:21,399
furnaces just so it's a little more
 

589
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,739
furnaces just so it's a little more
consistent I don't know what do you guys

590
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:23,749
consistent I don't know what do you guys
 

591
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,929
consistent I don't know what do you guys
think we'd have to put the crafting

592
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:25,939
think we'd have to put the crafting
 

593
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:28,809
think we'd have to put the crafting
table somewhere else so if we do it the

594
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:28,819
table somewhere else so if we do it the
 

595
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:31,809
table somewhere else so if we do it the
other way so I'll set up the other three

596
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:31,819
other way so I'll set up the other three
 

597
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:36,419
other way so I'll set up the other three
of these one there there and there

598
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:36,429

 

599
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,009

mm-hmm slight change of plans here out

600
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:39,019
mm-hmm slight change of plans here out
 

601
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:41,319
mm-hmm slight change of plans here out
we can't put the storage in these ones

602
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:41,329
we can't put the storage in these ones
 

603
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:43,210
we can't put the storage in these ones
because it will leave a gap and you'll

604
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:43,220
because it will leave a gap and you'll
 

605
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,559
because it will leave a gap and you'll
be able to see chests from over here so

606
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:46,569
be able to see chests from over here so
 

607
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:49,569
be able to see chests from over here so
I'm going to put the speed dispensers

608
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:49,579
I'm going to put the speed dispensers
 

609
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:53,079
I'm going to put the speed dispensers
over here and maybe a second one here

610
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:53,089
over here and maybe a second one here
 

611
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:56,769
over here and maybe a second one here
just for extra quantity and this is what

612
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:56,779
just for extra quantity and this is what
 

613
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:58,720
just for extra quantity and this is what
I've done with the chests I think it

614
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:58,730
I've done with the chests I think it
 

615
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,900
I've done with the chests I think it
looks pretty good

616
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:00,910
looks pretty good
 

617
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,120
looks pretty good
so we got the three furnaces we got six

618
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,130
so we got the three furnaces we got six
 

619
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,189
so we got the three furnaces we got six
chests and then three trafficking tables

620
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:06,199
chests and then three trafficking tables
 

621
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,750
chests and then three trafficking tables
down here just to balance out the look

622
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
down here just to balance out the look
 

623
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,340
down here just to balance out the look
and there's six stations like that so 36

624
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,350
and there's six stations like that so 36
 

625
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,470
and there's six stations like that so 36
chests total it's a little bit it's

626
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
chests total it's a little bit it's
 

627
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
chests total it's a little bit it's
overkill really I don't think I'll ever

628
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:16,490
overkill really I don't think I'll ever
 

629
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,059
overkill really I don't think I'll ever
fill them all but just makes it look

630
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:19,069
fill them all but just makes it look
 

631
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,329
fill them all but just makes it look
better if every one of these walls has

632
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:22,339
better if every one of these walls has
 

633
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,360
better if every one of these walls has
something and I can also put like signs

634
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:25,370
something and I can also put like signs
 

635
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,370
something and I can also put like signs
like for each of the chests like one

636
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:27,380
like for each of the chests like one
 

637
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,430
like for each of the chests like one
here here here here here here

638
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:30,440
here here here here here here
 

639
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,039
here here here here here here
saying what's in the chests if I want

640
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,049

 

641
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:38,529

yeah so the dispenser thing will go here

642
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:38,539
yeah so the dispenser thing will go here
 

643
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:43,090
yeah so the dispenser thing will go here
like that dispenser over there and I

644
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:43,100
like that dispenser over there and I
 

645
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,379
like that dispenser over there and I
just going to hook up the wiring for

646
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:44,389
just going to hook up the wiring for
 

647
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:46,570
just going to hook up the wiring for
that you won't be able to see it from

648
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:46,580
that you won't be able to see it from
 

649
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,879
that you won't be able to see it from
over here and that just leaves these two

650
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:51,889
over here and that just leaves these two
 

651
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:55,240
over here and that just leaves these two
walls over here which I'll if I do the

652
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,250
walls over here which I'll if I do the
 

653
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:59,440
walls over here which I'll if I do the
minecart thing that sends the stuff we

654
00:17:59,440 --> 00:17:59,450
minecart thing that sends the stuff we
 

655
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,389
minecart thing that sends the stuff we
mined to the storage room at our real

656
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:01,399
mined to the storage room at our real
 

657
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:04,600
mined to the storage room at our real
base then they will probably go here and

658
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:04,610
base then they will probably go here and
 

659
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,440
base then they will probably go here and
maybe here I don't know just just an

660
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,450
maybe here I don't know just just an
 

661
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,610
maybe here I don't know just just an
idea I'll leave them blank for now

662
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:09,620
idea I'll leave them blank for now
 

663
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,960
idea I'll leave them blank for now
because we probably won't do that today

664
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:14,970

 

665
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:22,410

yeah what was I going to do next going

666
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:22,420
yeah what was I going to do next going
 

667
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:27,570
yeah what was I going to do next going
to hook these up but yes I'm going to do

668
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:27,580
to hook these up but yes I'm going to do
 

669
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,400
to hook these up but yes I'm going to do
a tunnel above them so just give me a

670
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,410
a tunnel above them so just give me a
 

671
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:37,320
a tunnel above them so just give me a
minute while mine that out well we need

672
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,330
minute while mine that out well we need
 

673
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,760
minute while mine that out well we need
a new shovel so here we go 42 vision c4

674
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:41,770
a new shovel so here we go 42 vision c4
 

675
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,560
a new shovel so here we go 42 vision c4
and braking three great that's a good

676
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:43,570
and braking three great that's a good
 

677
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:43,890
and braking three great that's a good
one

another set here only feather falling

688
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,200
another set here only feather falling
 

689
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,190
another set here only feather falling
three though on that I thought I had

690
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
three though on that I thought I had
 

691
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,160
three though on that I thought I had
another pair I guess not so but yeah

692
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,170
another pair I guess not so but yeah
 

693
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:16,980
another pair I guess not so but yeah
this pick oh man okay so I dug out a

694
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:16,990
this pick oh man okay so I dug out a
 

695
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,980
this pick oh man okay so I dug out a
tunnel here we're going to hook up the

696
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:19,990
tunnel here we're going to hook up the
 

697
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,820
tunnel here we're going to hook up the
lighting it's really simple if I just

698
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:23,830
lighting it's really simple if I just
 

699
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,950
lighting it's really simple if I just
wanted them on I could just put levers

700
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:25,960
wanted them on I could just put levers
 

701
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,960
wanted them on I could just put levers
right on top of them but we want it

702
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:27,970
right on top of them but we want it
 

703
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,330
right on top of them but we want it
select it flicker kind of randomly and

704
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:32,340
select it flicker kind of randomly and
 

705
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,610
select it flicker kind of randomly and
to do that I think I'm just going to do

706
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:35,620
to do that I think I'm just going to do
 

707
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,610
to do that I think I'm just going to do
something like this where I have a block

708
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:40,620

 

709
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:46,380

torch and then redstone then on top of

710
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:46,390
torch and then redstone then on top of
 

711
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:55,530
torch and then redstone then on top of
that little put pressure plates

712
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:55,540

 

713
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:00,250

like so and then we're going to have

714
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:00,260
like so and then we're going to have
 

715
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,260
like so and then we're going to have
snowmen wandering around in here maybe

716
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:02,270
snowmen wandering around in here maybe
 

717
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,750
snowmen wandering around in here maybe
one or two and when they walk on the

718
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:04,760
one or two and when they walk on the
 

719
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,180
one or two and when they walk on the
pressure plate the light will go off for

720
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,190
pressure plate the light will go off for
 

721
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,990
pressure plate the light will go off for
a little while and I think it will be

722
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,000
a little while and I think it will be
 

723
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,890
a little while and I think it will be

00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:17,950
um under the pressure plate is redstone
 

929
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,029
um under the pressure plate is redstone
dust that goes to this block here with

we got to do yet is the minecart thing

948
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:55,160
we got to do yet is the minecart thing
 

949
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,850
we got to do yet is the minecart thing
but we'll do that another day lights are

950
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:57,860
but we'll do that another day lights are
 

951
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,970
but we'll do that another day lights are
done here

952
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:02,980

 

953
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:08,380

this is pretty much done now this here

954
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:08,390
this is pretty much done now this here
 

955
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,710
this is pretty much done now this here
this is a special case now like for this

956
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:11,720
this is a special case now like for this
 

957
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,410
this is a special case now like for this
corridor we have the pumpkins lighting

958
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:14,420
corridor we have the pumpkins lighting
 

959
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,730
corridor we have the pumpkins lighting
it so we don't need overhead lights

960
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:17,740
it so we don't need overhead lights
 

961
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,980
it so we don't need overhead lights
necessarily but the mine shafts are

962
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:20,990
necessarily but the mine shafts are
 

963
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,990
necessarily but the mine shafts are
going to be running this direction right

964
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,000
going to be running this direction right
 

965
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,750
going to be running this direction right
so with this corridor it's also running

966
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:25,760
so with this corridor it's also running
 

967
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,050
so with this corridor it's also running
that direction and we won't be having

968
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:29,060
that direction and we won't be having
 

969
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,720
that direction and we won't be having
tunnels going this way you know so there

970
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:31,730
tunnels going this way you know so there
 

971
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,050
tunnels going this way you know so there
won't be pumpkins down here so we need

972
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:35,060
won't be pumpkins down here so we need
 

973
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:40,330
won't be pumpkins down here so we need
lighting overhead for these and I'll

974
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:40,340
lighting overhead for these and I'll
 

975
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,570
lighting overhead for these and I'll
probably put pumpkins they're going to

976
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:43,580
probably put pumpkins they're going to
 

977
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,360
probably put pumpkins they're going to
be a pain to place though because I

978
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:46,370
be a pain to place though because I
 

979
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,620
be a pain to place though because I
can't just put them there I have to

980
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:47,630
can't just put them there I have to
 

981
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:53,110
can't just put them there I have to
block underneath yeah I got plenty of

982
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,120
block underneath yeah I got plenty of
 

983
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,150
block underneath yeah I got plenty of
this stuff get a block underneath that

984
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,160
this stuff get a block underneath that
 

985
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,810
this stuff get a block underneath that
was a regular pumpkin darn it

986
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:03,820

 

987
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,510

there we go

988
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:06,520
there we go
 

989
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:15,430
there we go
remove it and it would look like that Oh

990
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:15,440

 

991
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,530

don't really want to waste glowstone on

992
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:17,540
don't really want to waste glowstone on
 

993
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,650
don't really want to waste glowstone on
it and torches when it be bright enough

994
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:20,660
it and torches when it be bright enough
 

995
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,550
it and torches when it be bright enough
um unless we lowered them and I don't

996
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:24,560
um unless we lowered them and I don't
 

997
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:30,780
um unless we lowered them and I don't
want to use torches if possible so yeah

998
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:30,790
want to use torches if possible so yeah
 

999
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,880
want to use torches if possible so yeah
anyway that's the mineshaft one thing

1000
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:33,890
anyway that's the mineshaft one thing
 

1001
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:38,170
anyway that's the mineshaft one thing
I'm thinking possibly I said I wasn't

1002
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:38,180
I'm thinking possibly I said I wasn't
 

1003
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,150
I'm thinking possibly I said I wasn't
going to extend the tree farm anymore

1004
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:40,160
going to extend the tree farm anymore
 

1005
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,830
going to extend the tree farm anymore
the donor tree farm so we need some new

1006
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:44,840
the donor tree farm so we need some new
 

1007
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,900
the donor tree farm so we need some new
way of showing respect to the donors

1008
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:49,910
way of showing respect to the donors
 

1009
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:54,850
way of showing respect to the donors
people have donated to my channel I had

1010
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:54,860
people have donated to my channel I had
 

1011
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:00,130
people have donated to my channel I had
I'm Way behind on on giving people a

1012
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,140
I'm Way behind on on giving people a
 

1013
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,940
I'm Way behind on on giving people a
credit they just they deserve so an idea

1014
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:03,950
credit they just they deserve so an idea
 

1015
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,380
credit they just they deserve so an idea
I had maybe is to give each donor one of

1016
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,390
I had maybe is to give each donor one of
 

1017
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,230
I had maybe is to give each donor one of
these shafts one of these tunnels have

1018
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:11,240
these shafts one of these tunnels have
 

1019
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,040
these shafts one of these tunnels have
their name beside it and then maybe I'll

1020
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,050
their name beside it and then maybe I'll
 

1021
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,020
their name beside it and then maybe I'll
keep track of what I get as I go through

1022
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,030
keep track of what I get as I go through
 

1023
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:21,490
keep track of what I get as I go through
it and I'll put how much coal lapis gold

1024
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:21,500
it and I'll put how much coal lapis gold
 

1025
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:26,080
it and I'll put how much coal lapis gold
iron whatever on record here - I don't

1026
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,090
iron whatever on record here - I don't
 

1027
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,380
iron whatever on record here - I don't
know like I said I just want to get

1028
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:29,390
know like I said I just want to get
 

1029
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,060
know like I said I just want to get
their name somewhere in my world and

1030
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,070
their name somewhere in my world and
 

1031
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,230
their name somewhere in my world and
that would be a really simple way of

1032
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,240
that would be a really simple way of
 

1033
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,980
that would be a really simple way of
doing it for a hundred by 100 square

1034
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:35,990
doing it for a hundred by 100 square
 

1035
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,840
doing it for a hundred by 100 square
liked it like I talked about that would

1036
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:37,850
liked it like I talked about that would
 

1037
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:43,600
liked it like I talked about that would
be 25 of these shafts so 25 this way 25

1038
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:43,610
be 25 of these shafts so 25 this way 25
 

1039
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,930
be 25 of these shafts so 25 this way 25
that way that would be 50 could get

1040
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:46,940
that way that would be 50 could get
 

1041
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,460
that way that would be 50 could get
quite a few names out that way

1042
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:48,470
quite a few names out that way
 

1043
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,490
quite a few names out that way
and it would be pretty a pretty simple

1044
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:51,500
and it would be pretty a pretty simple
 

1045
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,200
and it would be pretty a pretty simple
thing and that way wouldn't take a whole

1046
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,210
thing and that way wouldn't take a whole
 

1047
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,870
thing and that way wouldn't take a whole
lot of time for me to do something kind

1048
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:58,880
lot of time for me to do something kind
 

1049
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,400
lot of time for me to do something kind
of special for them because if I if I

1050
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,410
of special for them because if I if I
 

1051
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,980
of special for them because if I if I
take too long making unique things for

1052
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:05,990
take too long making unique things for
 

1053
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:09,100
take too long making unique things for
people kind of a problem I had before it

1054
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,110
people kind of a problem I had before it
 

1055
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,640
people kind of a problem I had before it
starts to take away from my time I can

1056
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:12,650
starts to take away from my time I can
 

1057
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,100
starts to take away from my time I can
use to make my LP episodes and stuff so

1058
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,110
use to make my LP episodes and stuff so
 

1059
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,850
use to make my LP episodes and stuff so
I know that wouldn't make people happy

1060
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:18,860
I know that wouldn't make people happy
 

1061
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,420
I know that wouldn't make people happy
either so I don't know let me know what

either so I don't know let me know what
you think of that idea really happy with

1064
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:25,700
you think of that idea really happy with
 

1065
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,300
you think of that idea really happy with
this place so I think it looks awesome

1066
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,310
this place so I think it looks awesome
 

1067
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,390
this place so I think it looks awesome
and I'm going to have fun mining when I

1068
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:31,400
and I'm going to have fun mining when I
 

1069
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,210
and I'm going to have fun mining when I
finally do starts going to think about

1070
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:34,220
finally do starts going to think about
 

1071
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,540
finally do starts going to think about
the tracks I might do them yet I do have

1072
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:37,550
the tracks I might do them yet I do have
 

1073
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,810
the tracks I might do them yet I do have
quite a few tracks just sitting around

1074
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:39,820
quite a few tracks just sitting around
 

1075
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,730
