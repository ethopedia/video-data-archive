all my mob tubes and stuff with TNT so
 

281
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,800

we're going to head back to our base now

282
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:46,810
we're going to head back to our base now
 

283
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,910
we're going to head back to our base now
to do that but before we do that there's

284
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:50,920
to do that but before we do that there's
 

285
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,830
to do that but before we do that there's
one thing I actually wanted to try a new

286
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:54,840
one thing I actually wanted to try a new
 

287
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:01,530
one thing I actually wanted to try a new
invention a new idea this is going to be

288
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:01,540
invention a new idea this is going to be
 

289
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:09,360
invention a new idea this is going to be
like on-the-fly portal so to build a

290
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,370
like on-the-fly portal so to build a
 

291
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,500
like on-the-fly portal so to build a
portal you need about 14 obsidian or 14

292
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:13,510
portal you need about 14 obsidian or 14
 

293
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:20,370
portal you need about 14 obsidian or 14
lava and flint and steel to light it but

294
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:20,380
lava and flint and steel to light it but
 

295
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,340
lava and flint and steel to light it but
that is not easy to find or to carry

296
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,350
that is not easy to find or to carry
 

297
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,530
that is not easy to find or to carry
with you

298
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:24,540
with you
 

299
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,990
with you
so this is kind of like on-the-fly easy

300
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
so this is kind of like on-the-fly easy
 

301
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,490
so this is kind of like on-the-fly easy
to build portal I think is going to work

302
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:31,500
to build portal I think is going to work
 

303
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,410
to build portal I think is going to work
I'm about 77 percent sure it's going to

304
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:34,420
I'm about 77 percent sure it's going to
 

305
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,130
I'm about 77 percent sure it's going to
work and what we're going to do is we're

306
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:38,140
work and what we're going to do is we're
 

307
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,660
work and what we're going to do is we're
going to build it out of cobblestone and

308
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:41,670
going to build it out of cobblestone and
 

309
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:48,410
going to build it out of cobblestone and
wood instead of obsidian like this and

310
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:48,420
wood instead of obsidian like this and
 

311
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,700
wood instead of obsidian like this and
we're going to light it like you would a

312
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:50,710
we're going to light it like you would a
 

313
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:57,840
we're going to light it like you would a
normal portal make sure trees don't

314
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:57,850
normal portal make sure trees don't
 

315
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,169
normal portal make sure trees don't
catch on fire

316
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:01,179

 

317
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:03,970

but obviously this is not a portal if I

318
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:03,980
but obviously this is not a portal if I
 

319
