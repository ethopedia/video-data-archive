some of the game logic we did last time
 

113
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,770
some of the game logic we did last time
but the big thing we had to do the

but the big thing we had to do the
 

115
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,370
but the big thing we had to do the
memory for the game and that was going

116
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:20,380
memory for the game and that was going
 

117
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,050
memory for the game and that was going
to be the most difficult part of it but

118
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,060
to be the most difficult part of it but
 

119
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,759

through the basic idea here what what

126
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:31,300
through the basic idea here what what
 

127
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,130
through the basic idea here what what
trouble we had originally so I wanted to

have like red blue green yellow clay put

130
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,310
have like red blue green yellow clay put
 

131
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,940
have like red blue green yellow clay put
it in droppers right and then when you

132
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:41,950
it in droppers right and then when you
 

133
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,520
it in droppers right and then when you
press a button it would go to the next

134
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:44,530
press a button it would go to the next
 

135
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,229
press a button it would go to the next
one right and we can make a memory chain

136
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
one right and we can make a memory chain
 

137
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:46,830
one right and we can make a memory chain
that way

138
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:46,840
that way
 

139
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,410
that way
well it turns out if you just use

00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,560
redstone works in this game since it
activates all these in the same instance

164
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:25,570
activates all these in the same instance
 

165
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,990
activates all these in the same instance
in the programming it has to pick one to

166
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
in the programming it has to pick one to
 

167
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,200
in the programming it has to pick one to
update first so if it updates like this

168
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,210
update first so if it updates like this
 

169
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,700
update first so if it updates like this
one first then this one then this one

170
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:32,710
one first then this one then this one
 

171
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,950
one first then this one then this one
all in that same instant it shoots it

172
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
all in that same instant it shoots it
 

173
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,820
all in that same instant it shoots it
through the whole chain so the solution

174
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:38,830
through the whole chain so the solution
 

175
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,440
through the whole chain so the solution
to this problem was actually suggested

176
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:40,450
to this problem was actually suggested
 

177
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,170
to this problem was actually suggested
by you guys in the comments just put a

178
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:43,180
by you guys in the comments just put a
 

179
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,850
by you guys in the comments just put a
hopper between into the droppers and it

180
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:44,860
hopper between into the droppers and it
 

181
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,130
hopper between into the droppers and it
works wonderfully it's amazing it's

182
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,140
works wonderfully it's amazing it's
 

183
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,170
works wonderfully it's amazing it's
beautiful

184
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,180
beautiful
 

185
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,450
beautiful
basically hoppers they have a point for

186
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:51,460
basically hoppers they have a point for
 

187
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,250
basically hoppers they have a point for
second delay with them at least last

188
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:53,260
second delay with them at least last
 

189
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,820
second delay with them at least last
time I checked where it takes like for

190
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:56,830
time I checked where it takes like for
 

191
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,100
time I checked where it takes like for
the dropper to shoot an item into it it

192
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,110
the dropper to shoot an item into it it
 

193
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,990
the dropper to shoot an item into it it
takes point for seconds for it then to

194
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,000
takes point for seconds for it then to
 

195
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,810
takes point for seconds for it then to
automatically move it into the next one

196
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:03,820
automatically move it into the next one
 

197
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,120
automatically move it into the next one
so that it creates a delay forces a

198
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,130
so that it creates a delay forces a
 

199
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,430
so that it creates a delay forces a
delay so that items can't just shoot

200
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:08,440
delay so that items can't just shoot
 

201
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,840
delay so that items can't just shoot
like from there all the way through all

202
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:09,850
like from there all the way through all
 

203
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,390
like from there all the way through all
these because each each dropper has that

204
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
these because each each dropper has that
 

205
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,000
these because each each dropper has that
delay to them right so that makes this a

206
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,010
delay to them right so that makes this a
 

207
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,690
delay to them right so that makes this a
lot a lot easier to do and I've just

208
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:18,700
lot a lot easier to do and I've just
 

209
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,980
lot a lot easier to do and I've just
been playing around with it a little

210
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:19,990
been playing around with it a little
 

211
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,690
been playing around with it a little
bit's imagine it's a worm or a snake

212
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:24,700
bit's imagine it's a worm or a snake
 

213
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,620
bit's imagine it's a worm or a snake
okay going around in a circle in a loop

214
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:27,630
okay going around in a circle in a loop
 

215
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,330
okay going around in a circle in a loop
this is the head of the snake right we

216
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:30,340
this is the head of the snake right we
 

217
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,190
this is the head of the snake right we
got we got a green there blue this one

218
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,200
got we got a green there blue this one
 

219
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,960
got we got a green there blue this one
here is a yellow then red and then we

220
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:39,970
here is a yellow then red and then we
 

221
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,670
here is a yellow then red and then we
got some air spaces here this is just

222
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
got some air spaces here this is just
 

223
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,950
got some air spaces here this is just
empty space room for this snake to grow

224
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:43,960
empty space room for this snake to grow
 

225
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,110
empty space room for this snake to grow
because every time we do a cycle we want

226
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,120
because every time we do a cycle we want
 

227
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,290
because every time we do a cycle we want
to add one on to the tail so basically a

228
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:49,300
to add one on to the tail so basically a
 

229
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,330
to add one on to the tail so basically a
random one here next umm and then over

230
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:54,340
random one here next umm and then over
 

231
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,660
random one here next umm and then over
and over here it passes through for item

232
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:57,670
and over here it passes through for item
 

233
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,690
and over here it passes through for item
detectors alright and this can tell what

234
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:00,700
detectors alright and this can tell what
 

235
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,570
detectors alright and this can tell what
block color passes through either red

236
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:03,580
block color passes through either red
 

237
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,240
block color passes through either red
blue yellow or green and then it

238
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,250
blue yellow or green and then it
 

239
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,200
blue yellow or green and then it
activates these pistons accordingly and

240
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,210
activates these pistons accordingly and
 

241
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,650
activates these pistons accordingly and
sets the memory to that color alright

242
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:12,660
sets the memory to that color alright
 

243
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,690
sets the memory to that color alright
still following me I hope you're not

people are fans of redstone let me take

250
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:24,610
people are fans of redstone let me take

people are fans of redstone let me take
you through it though so first step was

252
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:27,750
you through it though so first step was
 

253
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,040
you through it though so first step was
green right there you see the green one

254
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,050
green right there you see the green one
 

255
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,340
green right there you see the green one
got activated okay and now that green

256
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:35,350
got activated okay and now that green
 

257
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,830
got activated okay and now that green
one passed through the items detector

258
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
one passed through the items detector
 

259
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,330
one passed through the items detector
here it goes down

260
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:39,340
here it goes down
 

261
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,400
here it goes down
and then into this dropper here so

262
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:41,410
and then into this dropper here so
 

263
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,280
and then into this dropper here so
that's that's how it gets the next side

264
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,290
that's that's how it gets the next side
 

265
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,340
that's that's how it gets the next side
press it again should be blue they're

266
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:47,350
press it again should be blue they're
 

267
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,280
press it again should be blue they're
activated blue greens up there blues in

268
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,290
activated blue greens up there blues in
 

269
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,960
activated blue greens up there blues in
oh blues over there uh-huh

270
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:53,970
oh blues over there uh-huh
 

271
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,189
oh blues over there uh-huh
press it again for yellow yellow and

272
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
press it again for yellow yellow and
 

273
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,320
press it again for yellow yellow and
then finally red but the other thing

274
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,330
then finally red but the other thing
 

275
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,930
then finally red but the other thing
okay so we got red in here this

276
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:06,940
okay so we got red in here this
 

277
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,790
okay so we got red in here this
comparator is on it's detecting there's

278
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
comparator is on it's detecting there's
 

279
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,159
comparator is on it's detecting there's
an item in there still this one's empty

280
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:11,169
an item in there still this one's empty
 

281
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:14,219
an item in there still this one's empty
though and we don't really want empty

282
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:14,229
though and we don't really want empty
 

283
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:17,100
though and we don't really want empty
spaces so we need to advance from from

284
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,110
spaces so we need to advance from from
 

285
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,500
spaces so we need to advance from from
the empty one back to green which is

286
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:19,510
the empty one back to green which is
 

287
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,260
the empty one back to green which is
over here right now so there's a clock

288
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,270
over here right now so there's a clock
 

289
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,670
over here right now so there's a clock
that runs when this becomes empty that

290
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:26,680
that runs when this becomes empty that
 

291
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,920
that runs when this becomes empty that
just updates us to send it up to the

292
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:28,930
just updates us to send it up to the
 

293
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,950
just updates us to send it up to the
front then confused let me do it just to

294
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:31,960
front then confused let me do it just to
 

295
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,260
front then confused let me do it just to
show you okay now this clock is running

296
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,270
show you okay now this clock is running
 

297
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,590
show you okay now this clock is running
and this piston extends to shut it off

298
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:42,600
and this piston extends to shut it off
 

299
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,830
and this piston extends to shut it off
and now greens they're green blue yellow

300
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:46,840
and now greens they're green blue yellow
 

301
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,920
and now greens they're green blue yellow
red keeps the order automatically

302
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:49,930
red keeps the order automatically
 

303
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,719
red keeps the order automatically
advances it it's very cool whoo so I've

304
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:54,729
advances it it's very cool whoo so I've
 

305
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:57,180
advances it it's very cool whoo so I've
spent some more hours on this got some

306
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,190
spent some more hours on this got some
 

307
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,890
spent some more hours on this got some
more features at it this project is

308
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:58,900
more features at it this project is
 

309
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,390
more features at it this project is
crazy guys what have we got ourselves

310
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
crazy guys what have we got ourselves
 

311
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,420
crazy guys what have we got ourselves
into this time I gotta take a break from

312
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:03,430
into this time I gotta take a break from
 

313
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,330
into this time I gotta take a break from
it today though I've smashed my head

314
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:06,340
it today though I've smashed my head
 

315
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,219
it today though I've smashed my head
into this wall a few times here umm it's

316
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:11,229
into this wall a few times here umm it's
 

317
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:12,930
into this wall a few times here umm it's
gotten it's gotten pretty good though

318
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:12,940
gotten it's gotten pretty good though
 

319
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,580
gotten it's gotten pretty good though
it's it's very difficult to work out

320
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:14,590
it's it's very difficult to work out
 

321
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,820
it's it's very difficult to work out
some of this the details to it but yeah

322
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:17,830
some of this the details to it but yeah
 

323
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,020
some of this the details to it but yeah
I'll just show you where we're at with

324
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,030
I'll just show you where we're at with
 

325
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,270
I'll just show you where we're at with
it right now so as of right now we

326
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
it right now so as of right now we
 

327
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,120
it right now so as of right now we
cannot build the chain on it

328
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,130
cannot build the chain on it
 

329
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,790
cannot build the chain on it
that's not implemented yet so I just

330
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
that's not implemented yet so I just
 

331
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,270
that's not implemented yet so I just
have it hard-coded a sequence here

332
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:30,280
have it hard-coded a sequence here
 

333
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,750
have it hard-coded a sequence here
yellow red green blue so right now we're

334
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
yellow red green blue so right now we're
 

335
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,209
yellow red green blue so right now we're
on yellow and it's also in cheap mode

336
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:36,219
on yellow and it's also in cheap mode
 

337
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:40,829
on yellow and it's also in cheap mode
right now so when I when I get yellow it

338
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:40,839
right now so when I when I get yellow it
 

339
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,839
right now so when I when I get yellow it
shows me what the correct answer is next

340
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:42,849
shows me what the correct answer is next
 

341
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:46,650
shows me what the correct answer is next
I didn't easily get rid of that later so

342
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:46,660
I didn't easily get rid of that later so
 

343
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,980
I didn't easily get rid of that later so
red is next if we step on green our lose

344
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:49,990
red is next if we step on green our lose
 

345
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,910
red is next if we step on green our lose
condition checker there turns on

346
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:52,920
condition checker there turns on
 

347
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,460
condition checker there turns on
um it doesn't actually end the game

348
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:55,470
um it doesn't actually end the game
 

349
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,910
um it doesn't actually end the game
though right now is it but yeah so let's

350
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:58,920
though right now is it but yeah so let's
 

351
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,030
though right now is it but yeah so let's
select red that's the correct answer so

352
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,040
select red that's the correct answer so
 

353
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,660
select red that's the correct answer so
then it's green step on green this part

354
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:05,670
then it's green step on green this part
 

355
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,129
then it's green step on green this part
of it goes pretty quick I'm happy with

356
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:07,139
of it goes pretty quick I'm happy with
 

357
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:09,310
of it goes pretty quick I'm happy with
that like it it picks the next answer

358
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:09,320
that like it it picks the next answer
 

359
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,699
that like it it picks the next answer
fairly fast it's nice and evenly timed

360
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:12,709
fairly fast it's nice and evenly timed
 

361
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:17,350
fairly fast it's nice and evenly timed
so blue is the end of our sequence here

362
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
so blue is the end of our sequence here
 

363
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,129
so blue is the end of our sequence here
so now what happens is it shows us the

364
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:21,139
so now what happens is it shows us the
 

365
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:24,620
so now what happens is it shows us the
sequence again and it's supposed to add

366
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:24,630
sequence again and it's supposed to add
 

367
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,360
sequence again and it's supposed to add
one on to it but it doesn't do that

368
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,370
one on to it but it doesn't do that
 

369
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,400
one on to it but it doesn't do that
currently so goes through it yellow red

370
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,410
currently so goes through it yellow red
 

371
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,400
currently so goes through it yellow red
green blue this part is not fast enough

372
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,410
green blue this part is not fast enough
 

373
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,680
green blue this part is not fast enough
I'm not happy with this I can make it

374
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:36,690
I'm not happy with this I can make it
 

375
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,810
I'm not happy with this I can make it
twice as quick and I think I'm going to

376
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:38,820
twice as quick and I think I'm going to
 

377
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,780
twice as quick and I think I'm going to
have to try to do that which would be

378
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:41,790
have to try to do that which would be
 

379
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,860
have to try to do that which would be
about perfect you know alright so it

380
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:45,870
about perfect you know alright so it
 

381
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,079
about perfect you know alright so it
showed us the sequence again yellow red

382
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:48,089
showed us the sequence again yellow red
 

383
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,269
showed us the sequence again yellow red
green blue and now it's set it back to

384
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:50,279
green blue and now it's set it back to
 

385
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,030
green blue and now it's set it back to
yellow it's ready to go

386
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,040
yellow it's ready to go
 

387
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,480
yellow it's ready to go
you can enter the sequence again ah um

388
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,490
you can enter the sequence again ah um
 

389
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,949
you can enter the sequence again ah um
so it's getting there it's getting there

390
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
so it's getting there it's getting there
 

391
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,460
so it's getting there it's getting there
we got a bit left to do on it though let

392
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:04,470
we got a bit left to do on it though let
 

393
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,740
we got a bit left to do on it though let
me show you how crazy it is down here

394
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:06,750
me show you how crazy it is down here
 

395
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,480
me show you how crazy it is down here
now some blue was last on the list let's

396
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:11,490
now some blue was last on the list let's
 

397
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,079
now some blue was last on the list let's
run in here see all the things changing

398
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:15,089
run in here see all the things changing
 

399
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:19,819
run in here see all the things changing
all the crazy chaotic redstone doing

400
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:19,829
all the crazy chaotic redstone doing
 

401
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:21,139
all the crazy chaotic redstone doing
things I don't even know what's gonna

402
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:21,149
things I don't even know what's gonna
 

403
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:23,259
things I don't even know what's gonna
happen next

404
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:23,269
happen next
 

405
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:25,579
happen next
also the blocks are like randomly

406
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:25,589
also the blocks are like randomly
 

407
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:27,590
also the blocks are like randomly
rotating every time Pistons move which

408
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
rotating every time Pistons move which
 

409
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,439
rotating every time Pistons move which
is freaky something to do with the

410
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:30,449
is freaky something to do with the
 

411
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:36,199
is freaky something to do with the
latest updates uh-huh

412
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:36,209
latest updates uh-huh
 

413
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:39,040
latest updates uh-huh
so yeah basically that's what happens

414
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,050
so yeah basically that's what happens
 

415
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:46,670
so yeah basically that's what happens
and is done okay oh this was fun to work

416
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:46,680
and is done okay oh this was fun to work
 

417
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,840
and is done okay oh this was fun to work
out oh and by the way once we get out of

418
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:50,850
out oh and by the way once we get out of
 

419
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,610
out oh and by the way once we get out of
the testing stage with this I'm going to

420
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:52,620
the testing stage with this I'm going to
 

421
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,620
the testing stage with this I'm going to
add more memory onto it more more

422
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:54,630
add more memory onto it more more
 

423
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,389
add more memory onto it more more
droppers and hoppers currently we only

424
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
droppers and hoppers currently we only
 

425
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,569
droppers and hoppers currently we only
have like a combo of nine I'll probably

426
00:10:59,569 --> 00:10:59,579
have like a combo of nine I'll probably
 

427
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:04,009
have like a combo of nine I'll probably
bring that up to about thirty or forty I

428
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:04,019
bring that up to about thirty or forty I
 

429
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,610
bring that up to about thirty or forty I
built it in such a way that we can

430
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:06,620
built it in such a way that we can
 

431
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,970
built it in such a way that we can
as much memory as we want which is cool

432
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:09,980
as much memory as we want which is cool
 

433
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,030
as much memory as we want which is cool
and also no blocks will be adding no

434
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
and also no blocks will be adding no
 

435
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,280
and also no blocks will be adding no
blocks don't you worry but one thing at

436
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,290
blocks don't you worry but one thing at
 

437
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,700
blocks don't you worry but one thing at
a time alright everybody so maybe next

438
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:18,710
a time alright everybody so maybe next
 

439
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,890
a time alright everybody so maybe next
up here let's just take a moment to

little shack you're nothing too crazy
 

613
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,800
little shack you're nothing too crazy
let's let's plan this out and we might

614
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:07,810
let's let's plan this out and we might
 

615
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,930
let's let's plan this out and we might
even like go over into the water and

616
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:09,940
even like go over into the water and
 

617
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,400
even like go over into the water and
build like a little deck or so that

618
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,410
build like a little deck or so that
 

619
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,780
build like a little deck or so that
overlooks the water let's let's kind of

620
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:18,790
overlooks the water let's let's kind of
 

621
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,480
overlooks the water let's let's kind of
measure this out though basically the

622
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:21,490
measure this out though basically the
 

623
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,190
measure this out though basically the
plan is I'm going to put a button here a

624
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:23,200
plan is I'm going to put a button here a
 

625
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,410
plan is I'm going to put a button here a
button in here to activate the fireworks

626
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:25,420
button in here to activate the fireworks
 

627
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,460
button in here to activate the fireworks
eventually all right one two three four

628
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:29,470
eventually all right one two three four
 

629
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,740
eventually all right one two three four
five six seven always with odd numbers

630
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:31,750
five six seven always with odd numbers
 

631
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,800
five six seven always with odd numbers
that's the way to go just make a little

632
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:34,810
that's the way to go just make a little
 

633
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,370
that's the way to go just make a little
layouts

634
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:37,380
