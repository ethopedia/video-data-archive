because the pistons can't push them
sideways when they're stationary like

64
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
sideways when they're stationary like
 

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,589
sideways when they're stationary like
that

66
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,470

otherwise this would have made probably

70
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
otherwise this would have made probably
 

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,630
otherwise this would have made probably

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,630
before

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
i wanted to do i wanted to try see if i
 

713
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,430
i wanted to do i wanted to try see if i

714
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,150
battle mobs from the horse too there's
nothing really around so i guess we'll

718
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
nothing really around so i guess we'll
 

719
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,750
nothing really around so i guess we'll
use this sheep

720
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
use this sheep
 

721
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,870
use this sheep
it would be really cool if you could

722
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
it would be really cool if you could
 

723
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,029
it would be really cool if you could
like move independently of him somehow

724
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
like move independently of him somehow
 

725
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,350
like move independently of him somehow
like if he helds

726
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
like if he helds
 

727
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,350
like if he helds
like control for example if i could turn

728
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
like control for example if i could turn
 

729
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,789
like control for example if i could turn
without the horse turning with me

730
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
without the horse turning with me
 

731
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,230
without the horse turning with me
because i think if i do this it's gonna

732
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
because i think if i do this it's gonna
 

733
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,070
because i think if i do this it's gonna
hit him oh no

734
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,080

 

735
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,230

okay that is really neat

736
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
okay that is really neat
 

737
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,669
okay that is really neat
so i'm guessing there's if i aim

738
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:11,679
so i'm guessing there's if i aim
 

739
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,630
so i'm guessing there's if i aim
high enough it's not going to hit him

740
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640

 

741
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,830

really i can't hit him at all that's

742
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
really i can't hit him at all that's
 

743
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,230
really i can't hit him at all that's
awesome

744
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
awesome
 

745
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,669
awesome
so does that mean

746
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679

 

747
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,350

00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,440
better so i can fight mobs while on a
 

751
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,270

or even other players presumably there's
going to be so many game modes that come

756
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
going to be so many game modes that come
 

757
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,310
going to be so many game modes that come
out of this too

758
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320

looks like he's recovering even in the
 

919
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,950

he's not gonna like lava too much even
with a fire resist potion i'm guessing

926
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
with a fire resist potion i'm guessing
 

927
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,029
with a fire resist potion i'm guessing
what he'll do

928
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:17,039
what he'll do
 

929
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,549
what he'll do
is the same thing he does in the water

930
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:18,559
is the same thing he does in the water
 

931
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,950
is the same thing he does in the water
will where he will swim to the bottom

932
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:20,960
will where he will swim to the bottom
 

933
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,310
will where he will swim to the bottom
and then try to eat

934
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,320
and then try to eat
 

935
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,350
and then try to eat
in the lava uh

936
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
in the lava uh
 

937
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,430
in the lava uh
i'm assuming that's what's gonna happen

938
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,440
i'm assuming that's what's gonna happen
 

939
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,909
i'm assuming that's what's gonna happen
i don't know if i really wanna

940
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:33,919

 

941
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,669

because i i don't even think i can move

942
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:35,679
because i i don't even think i can move
 

943

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,430
oh i'm afraid to let him go a little
deeper

960
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:09,440

 

961
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,029

all right okay i don't like this

962
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:15,039

 

963
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,710

it's not too bad actually

964
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720

 

965
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,950

yeah he won't take drown damage

966
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:22,960

 

967
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,470

pretty sure

968
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480

 

969
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,350

that hmm i wonder why the fire resist is

970
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,360
that hmm i wonder why the fire resist is
 

971
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,230
that hmm i wonder why the fire resist is
only at three minutes

972
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,240
only at three minutes
 

973
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,669
only at three minutes
only at 3.4 is it

974
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:37,679

 

975
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,269

that was a six minute potion that didn't

976
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:39,279
that was a six minute potion that didn't
 

977
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,350
that was a six minute potion that didn't
get used too well i

978
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,360
get used too well i
 

979
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,909
get used too well i
probably not aiming too well yes so i

980
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
probably not aiming too well yes so i
 

981
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:44,390
probably not aiming too well yes so i
think

982
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,400
think
 

983
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,950
think
we could actually potentially go

984
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:46,960
we could actually potentially go
 

985
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,950
we could actually potentially go
swimming with this guy in lava i wish i

986
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960
swimming with this guy in lava i wish i
 

987
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,230
swimming with this guy in lava i wish i
brought a

988
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,240
brought a
 

989
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,669
brought a
night vision i think that would let me

990
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
night vision i think that would let me
 

991
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,909
night vision i think that would let me
see under the lava even

992
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:55,919

 

993
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,510

he moves very slow though

994
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520

 

995
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,110

but yeah you can get through lava with

996
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,120
but yeah you can get through lava with
 

997
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,990
but yeah you can get through lava with
them i think

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,000

 

999
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,110
