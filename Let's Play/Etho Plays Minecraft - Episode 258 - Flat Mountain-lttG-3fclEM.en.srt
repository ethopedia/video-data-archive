00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,640

hey everybody this is etho how are you

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:10,650
hey everybody this is etho how are you
 

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,400
hey everybody this is etho how are you
doing we are at the library agent today

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,410
doing we are at the library agent today
 

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,350
doing we are at the library agent today
and we're going to work on this little

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360
and we're going to work on this little
 

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,140
and we're going to work on this little
bits and maybe do some other stuff but

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:18,150
bits and maybe do some other stuff but
 

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,099
bits and maybe do some other stuff but
first I got a new trick to show you I

10
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:21,109
first I got a new trick to show you I
 

11
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:23,420
first I got a new trick to show you I
was just playing with this this is fun

12
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:23,430
was just playing with this this is fun
 

13
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,810
was just playing with this this is fun
you ready check it out it's awesome here

14
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:26,820
you ready check it out it's awesome here
 

15
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:42,139
you ready check it out it's awesome here
we go ah let's start over here and the

16
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:42,149
we go ah let's start over here and the
 

17
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,139
we go ah let's start over here and the
cool all right

18
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:44,149
cool all right
 

19
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,430
cool all right
yeah so I was looking at this library

20
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:46,440
yeah so I was looking at this library
 

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,310
yeah so I was looking at this library
check this out we got a little bit of a

22
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:49,320
check this out we got a little bit of a
 

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,950
check this out we got a little bit of a
problem which is definitely going to

24
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:51,960
problem which is definitely going to
 

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,069
problem which is definitely going to
have to be changed like I like how it's

26
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:55,079
have to be changed like I like how it's
 

27
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,139
have to be changed like I like how it's
going so far I start adding some I don't

28
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:00,149
going so far I start adding some I don't
 

29
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,459
going so far I start adding some I don't
know what you call like little tower

30
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:01,469
know what you call like little tower
 

31
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,229
know what you call like little tower
areas here I was going to build up a

32
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:03,239
areas here I was going to build up a
 

33
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,870
areas here I was going to build up a
little bit higher length to the second

34
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:05,880
little bit higher length to the second
 

35
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,020
little bit higher length to the second
or second story or maybe even taller who

36
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,030
or second story or maybe even taller who
 

37
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,480
or second story or maybe even taller who
knows there's gonna be Windows and these

38
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:13,490
knows there's gonna be Windows and these
 

39
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,010
knows there's gonna be Windows and these
nice diagonal windows and that kind of

40
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,020
nice diagonal windows and that kind of
 

41
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,219
nice diagonal windows and that kind of
thing but if you go to here that would

42
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:19,229
thing but if you go to here that would
 

43
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,280
thing but if you go to here that would
make it a total of like 60 blocks from

44
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,290
make it a total of like 60 blocks from
 

45
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,280
make it a total of like 60 blocks from
here to all the way to the other side

46
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,290
here to all the way to the other side
 

47
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,190
here to all the way to the other side
which is way way too big let's get real

48
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:28,200
which is way way too big let's get real
 

49
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,899
which is way way too big let's get real
here this is going to take me forever to

50
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:29,909
here this is going to take me forever to
 

51
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,170
here this is going to take me forever to
finish if I do that and even if I don't

52
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:33,180
finish if I do that and even if I don't
 

53
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,580
finish if I do that and even if I don't
do that it's continued forever probably

54
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:34,590
do that it's continued forever probably
 

55
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,969
do that it's continued forever probably
so we got to make a library smaller this

56
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:37,979
so we got to make a library smaller this
 

57
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,480
so we got to make a library smaller this
is uh it's getting a bit crazy so what I

58
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:41,490
is uh it's getting a bit crazy so what I
 

59
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,870
is uh it's getting a bit crazy so what I
think we're going to have to do is let's

60
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:47,880
think we're going to have to do is let's
 

61
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,440
think we're going to have to do is let's
let's take out one of these sections

62
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:50,450
let's take out one of these sections
 

63
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,520
let's take out one of these sections
even though I really like the window

64
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:52,530
even though I really like the window
 

65
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,850
even though I really like the window
this wide I think we should take out

66
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:54,860
this wide I think we should take out
 

67
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,980
this wide I think we should take out
like cut it's here that will bring it

68
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:00,990
like cut it's here that will bring it
 

69
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,800
like cut it's here that will bring it
down at least 4 blocks both sides so

70
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:03,810
down at least 4 blocks both sides so
 

71
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,600
down at least 4 blocks both sides so
that's a total of 8 that I'll bring it

72
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,610
that's a total of 8 that I'll bring it
 

73
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,809
that's a total of 8 that I'll bring it
down to about 50 I would like to have

74
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:08,819
down to about 50 I would like to have
 

75
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,029
down to about 50 I would like to have
something like this in the corners like

76
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
something like this in the corners like
 

77
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,960
something like this in the corners like
a tower but we should make it some

78
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:13,970
a tower but we should make it some
 

79
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,710
a tower but we should make it some
or so we will maybe only make it come

80
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:17,720
or so we will maybe only make it come
 

81
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,740
or so we will maybe only make it come
out to here and instead of having this

82
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:20,750
out to here and instead of having this
 

83
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,930
out to here and instead of having this
nine blocks stretch we might make it

84
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:22,940
nine blocks stretch we might make it
 

85
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,870
nine blocks stretch we might make it
down to five or so yeah we just got to

86
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:28,880
down to five or so yeah we just got to
 

87
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,700
down to five or so yeah we just got to
make things smaller this is this is too

88
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:30,710
make things smaller this is this is too
 

89
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,890
make things smaller this is this is too
crazy so I'm going to resize some stuff

90
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:32,900
crazy so I'm going to resize some stuff
 

91
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,200
crazy so I'm going to resize some stuff
here and see how that goes all right so

92
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,210
here and see how that goes all right so
 

93
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,810
here and see how that goes all right so
I resize the left side and we can

94
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:40,820
I resize the left side and we can
 

95
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,580
I resize the left side and we can
compare the difference to the right side

96
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:42,590
compare the difference to the right side
 

97
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,490
compare the difference to the right side
it's a fair bit smaller now and you know

98
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:45,500
it's a fair bit smaller now and you know
 

99
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,280
it's a fair bit smaller now and you know
I think it's going to be okay

100
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,290
I think it's going to be okay
 

101
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,930
I think it's going to be okay
everything's going to be just fine don't

102
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:49,940
everything's going to be just fine don't
 

103
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,320
everything's going to be just fine don't
worry so that's what we'll go with

104
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,330
worry so that's what we'll go with
 

105
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,770
worry so that's what we'll go with
and I resized this tower we can see how

106
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:56,780
and I resized this tower we can see how
 

107
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,440
and I resized this tower we can see how
much closer it is now compared to before

108
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,450
much closer it is now compared to before
 

109
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,699
much closer it is now compared to before
like just I counted this this is like

110
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:03,709
like just I counted this this is like
 

111
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,790
like just I counted this this is like
one two three four five six seven eight

112
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
one two three four five six seven eight
 

113
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,740
one two three four five six seven eight
nine you know we're going to be like

114
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:11,750
nine you know we're going to be like
 

115
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,470
nine you know we're going to be like
probably about 10 blocks shorter on both

116
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
probably about 10 blocks shorter on both
 

117
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,380
probably about 10 blocks shorter on both
sides or 20 blocks total which will make

118
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:17,390
sides or 20 blocks total which will make
 

119
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,440
sides or 20 blocks total which will make
it about a 40 to 50 wide building and

120
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:20,450
it about a 40 to 50 wide building and
 

121
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,890
it about a 40 to 50 wide building and
we'll do that 40 to 50 long as well

122
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:23,900
we'll do that 40 to 50 long as well
 

123
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,570
we'll do that 40 to 50 long as well
because it's going to look really weird

124
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:25,580
because it's going to look really weird
 

125
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,190
because it's going to look really weird
if the front is shorter like the front

126
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,200
if the front is shorter like the front
 

127
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,420
if the front is shorter like the front
side if it'll look weird if we have the

128
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,430
side if it'll look weird if we have the
 

129
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,990
side if it'll look weird if we have the
front here and the building is wider

130
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
front here and the building is wider
 

131
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,740
front here and the building is wider
than it is long you know so we got to

132
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:41,750
than it is long you know so we got to
 

133
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,660
than it is long you know so we got to
make it go at least 40 50 blocks this

134
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:43,670
make it go at least 40 50 blocks this
 

135
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,479
make it go at least 40 50 blocks this
way to balance out the look of the

136
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:46,489
way to balance out the look of the
 

137
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:51,009
way to balance out the look of the
building and I put some trapdoors up

138
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:51,019
building and I put some trapdoors up
 

139
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:55,289
building and I put some trapdoors up
here I've got to do some more changes

140
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:55,299
here I've got to do some more changes
 

141
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:59,560
here I've got to do some more changes
into the top and yeah the windows the

142
00:03:59,560 --> 00:03:59,570
into the top and yeah the windows the
 

143
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,729
into the top and yeah the windows the
windows we will do and might make this

144
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:03,739
windows we will do and might make this
 

145
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:07,800
windows we will do and might make this
come up one more then have glass panes

146
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:07,810
come up one more then have glass panes
 

147
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,620
come up one more then have glass panes
this stone brick will change to clay

148
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:11,630
this stone brick will change to clay
 

149
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,870
this stone brick will change to clay
most likely as well let's see let's make

150
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
most likely as well let's see let's make
 

151
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,270
most likely as well let's see let's make
it been

152
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:20,280

 

153
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,370

let's do a window like this where we

154
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:23,380
let's do a window like this where we
 

155
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,290
let's do a window like this where we
have just a beam in the middle here

156
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:27,300

 

157
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,110

where else we could break it into three

158
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
where else we could break it into three
 

159
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,390
where else we could break it into three
sections instead of two I will do it

160
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:33,400
sections instead of two I will do it
 

161
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,589
sections instead of two I will do it
like this for now to see how that goes

162
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:36,599
like this for now to see how that goes
 

163
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:42,779
like this for now to see how that goes
to do to go around and then we'll have

164
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:42,789
to do to go around and then we'll have
 

165
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:47,900
to do to go around and then we'll have
another break here I guess

166
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:47,910

 

167
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,610

the inside of the library itself I'm

168
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:50,620
the inside of the library itself I'm
 

169
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,249
the inside of the library itself I'm
going to build mostly out of wood

170
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:52,259
going to build mostly out of wood
 

171
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,920
going to build mostly out of wood
because from pictures I've seen most

172
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:55,930
because from pictures I've seen most
 

173
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,960
because from pictures I've seen most
libraries like fancy ones are all wood

174
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:57,970
libraries like fancy ones are all wood
 

175
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,409
libraries like fancy ones are all wood
inside and they look really nice so like

176
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:01,419
inside and they look really nice so like
 

177
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:03,210
inside and they look really nice so like
things like this clay and that we can

178
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:03,220
things like this clay and that we can
 

179
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,450
things like this clay and that we can
easily hide with stairs or or something

180
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:06,460
easily hide with stairs or or something
 

181
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:17,339
easily hide with stairs or or something
and have it and they shape still okay so

182
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:17,349
and have it and they shape still okay so
 

183
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,710
and have it and they shape still okay so
what I got to do now let's get a bunch

184
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:19,720
what I got to do now let's get a bunch
 

185
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,710
what I got to do now let's get a bunch
of cobblestone and dirt to fill in this

186
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
of cobblestone and dirt to fill in this
 

187
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,499
of cobblestone and dirt to fill in this
hole we have here and then flatten out

188
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:25,509
hole we have here and then flatten out
 

189
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:32,430
hole we have here and then flatten out
this mountain and maybe I'll lay out the

190
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:32,440
this mountain and maybe I'll lay out the
 

191
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,240
this mountain and maybe I'll lay out the
overall shape of the building too just

192
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,250
overall shape of the building too just
 

193
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,540
overall shape of the building too just
so we can get idea of what we want it to

194
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:39,550
so we can get idea of what we want it to
 

195
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,360
so we can get idea of what we want it to
look like this mountain this is a bad

196
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,370
look like this mountain this is a bad
 

197
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,980
look like this mountain this is a bad
mountain it's in our way we got to move

198
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:46,990
mountain it's in our way we got to move
 

199
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,080

217
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,140
that should do for a bit we'll probably
have to clear more but that'll do us

218
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,150
have to clear more but that'll do us
 

219
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,519
have to clear more but that'll do us
some space to work anyway

220
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:39,529
some space to work anyway
 

221
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:43,080
some space to work anyway
so I gotta clear out the fragments

222
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,090
so I gotta clear out the fragments
 

223
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,040
so I gotta clear out the fragments
actually one of the nice things about

224
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,050
actually one of the nice things about
 

225
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,559
actually one of the nice things about
this building project is my soil supply

226
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:47,569
this building project is my soil supply
 

227
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:49,959
this building project is my soil supply
is pretty low so I've been able to strip

228
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:49,969
is pretty low so I've been able to strip
 

229
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:54,939
is pretty low so I've been able to strip
this mountain clear and replenish it or

230
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:54,949
this mountain clear and replenish it or
 

231
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:59,070
this mountain clear and replenish it or
whatever we need it for in the future oh

232
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,080

 

233
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,920

what a mess mm-hmm

234
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:02,930
what a mess mm-hmm
 

235
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,649
what a mess mm-hmm
yes very good very good what's good we

236
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:05,659
yes very good very good what's good we
 

237
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:10,689
yes very good very good what's good we
got this area cleared out now except for

238
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:10,699
got this area cleared out now except for
 

239
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,390
got this area cleared out now except for
this I got tired of clearing so we'll

240
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:13,400
this I got tired of clearing so we'll
 

241
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,519
this I got tired of clearing so we'll
leave that for today and we'll just work

242
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:15,529
leave that for today and we'll just work
 

243
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:21,519
leave that for today and we'll just work
on some other stuff so from here to the

244
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:21,529
on some other stuff so from here to the
 

245
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:24,869
on some other stuff so from here to the
other end now is 42 blocks and I marked

246
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:24,879
other end now is 42 blocks and I marked
 

247
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,579
other end now is 42 blocks and I marked
from here to this end about 40 42 blocks

248
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:30,589
from here to this end about 40 42 blocks
 

249
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:32,439
from here to this end about 40 42 blocks
is at the gravel here so that's about

250
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:32,449
is at the gravel here so that's about
 

251
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:34,450
is at the gravel here so that's about
the size of our building we're going to

252
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:34,460
the size of our building we're going to
 

253
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,029
the size of our building we're going to
be making which if I remember correctly

254
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
be making which if I remember correctly
 

255
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,929
be making which if I remember correctly
is actually about the same size as my

256
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:40,939
is actually about the same size as my
 

257
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:43,719
is actually about the same size as my
old storage room so it's a decent sized

258
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:43,729
old storage room so it's a decent sized
 

259
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:48,429
old storage room so it's a decent sized
building and it's gonna be two layers I

260
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:48,439
building and it's gonna be two layers I
 

261
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,379
building and it's gonna be two layers I
believe that's what we're going to go

262
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:50,389
believe that's what we're going to go
 

263
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:57,399
believe that's what we're going to go
for so yeah so I when I marked this out

264
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:57,409
for so yeah so I when I marked this out
 

265
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,929
for so yeah so I when I marked this out
I just made it a straight line but we

266
00:07:58,929 --> 00:07:58,939
I just made it a straight line but we
 

267
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:00,779
I just made it a straight line but we
will try to add more character to this

268
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:00,789
will try to add more character to this
 

269
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:05,379
will try to add more character to this
wall later we'll give it some some you

270
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:05,389
wall later we'll give it some some you
 

271
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:08,350
wall later we'll give it some some you
know curves or jigs or something and so

272
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:08,360
know curves or jigs or something and so
 

273
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,880
know curves or jigs or something and so
it's not straight and

274
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:11,890

 

275
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,260

fronts looking good let's work on the

276
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,270
fronts looking good let's work on the
 

277
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,270
fronts looking good let's work on the
front a bit since we got that going

278
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:16,280
front a bit since we got that going
 

279
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:22,510
front a bit since we got that going
already let us grab well actually I

280
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:22,520
already let us grab well actually I
 

281
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,530
already let us grab well actually I
think we got everything we need let's

282
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:25,540
think we got everything we need let's
 

283
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,240
think we got everything we need let's
let's go over this okay so we got these

284
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,250
let's go over this okay so we got these
 

285
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,110
let's go over this okay so we got these
stairs they're going to bring us up to

286
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
stairs they're going to bring us up to
 

287
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,010
stairs they're going to bring us up to
sort of a platform up here and I've

288
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,020
sort of a platform up here and I've
 

289
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,740
sort of a platform up here and I've
talked about wanting a balcony area up

290
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:38,750
talked about wanting a balcony area up
 

291
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,940
talked about wanting a balcony area up
at this level here so I think we'll make

292
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:42,950
at this level here so I think we'll make
 

293
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:49,900
at this level here so I think we'll make
the stairs come up like so they will go

294
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:49,910
the stairs come up like so they will go
 

295
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,300
the stairs come up like so they will go
if we keep going straight we're going to

296
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:52,310
if we keep going straight we're going to
 

297
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,510
if we keep going straight we're going to
come to a 3x3 door that is the main

298
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:55,520
come to a 3x3 door that is the main
 

299
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,730
come to a 3x3 door that is the main
entrance to the library let's go a

300
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:00,740
entrance to the library let's go a
 

301
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,180
entrance to the library let's go a
little bit further and then there's also

302
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,190
little bit further and then there's also
 

303
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,270
little bit further and then there's also
going to be to 2 more staircases here I

304
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:07,280
going to be to 2 more staircases here I
 

305
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,640
going to be to 2 more staircases here I
think we'll make go up to that balcony

306
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:09,650
think we'll make go up to that balcony
 

307
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,250
think we'll make go up to that balcony
level there so like three or four more

308
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:12,260
level there so like three or four more
 

309
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,140
level there so like three or four more
blocks higher and we could do that let's

310
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,150
blocks higher and we could do that let's
 

311
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,100
blocks higher and we could do that let's
try this out we'll go we'll just lay

312
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,110
try this out we'll go we'll just lay
 

313
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:27,990
try this out we'll go we'll just lay
this out and see where that brings us

314
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000

 

315
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:37,880

yeah it's about that's about right that

316
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:37,890
yeah it's about that's about right that
 

317
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,310
yeah it's about that's about right that
and least one more okay that brings up

318
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:43,320
and least one more okay that brings up
 

319
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,470
and least one more okay that brings up
brings us up to here and then that will

320
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:45,480
brings us up to here and then that will
 

321
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,410
brings us up to here and then that will
lead up to a half slab probably so it's

322
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:51,420
lead up to a half slab probably so it's
 

323
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,889
lead up to a half slab probably so it's
free white staircase the big thing I got

324
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:54,899
free white staircase the big thing I got
 

325
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,630
free white staircase the big thing I got
to watch for when I do this though is

326
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
to watch for when I do this though is
 

327
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,139
to watch for when I do this though is
that I'm not blocked in the window that

328
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:00,149
that I'm not blocked in the window that
 

329
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:01,550
that I'm not blocked in the window that
we built down there because then it's

330
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:01,560
we built down there because then it's
 

331
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,210
we built down there because then it's
totally pointless so we'll do it on this

332
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:05,220
totally pointless so we'll do it on this
 

333
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,680
totally pointless so we'll do it on this
side we'll do it on that side and then

334
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:09,690
side we'll do it on that side and then
 

335
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,300
side we'll do it on that side and then
we'll have a little like fence here

336
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,310
we'll have a little like fence here
 

337
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,069
we'll have a little like fence here
where we can look down at the staircase

338
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
where we can look down at the staircase
 

339
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,889
where we can look down at the staircase
here let's actually make sure we don't

340
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:21,899
here let's actually make sure we don't
 

341
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,069
here let's actually make sure we don't
block the window by just putting what we

342
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:25,079
block the window by just putting what we
 

343
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,680
block the window by just putting what we
need here so we'll definitely want to

344
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:27,690
need here so we'll definitely want to
 

345
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,480
need here so we'll definitely want to
put some stairs here we'll just use

346
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:29,490
put some stairs here we'll just use
 

347
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,630
put some stairs here we'll just use
regular ones for now we'll put them at

348
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
regular ones for now we'll put them at
 

349
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:41,329
regular ones for now we'll put them at
the top as well I would say libary

350
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:41,339
the top as well I would say libary
 

351
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,340
the top as well I would say libary
instead of library and like for most of

352
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:46,350
instead of library and like for most of
 

353
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,759
instead of library and like for most of
my life I've said library and then one

354
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:49,769
my life I've said library and then one
 

355
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:52,370
my life I've said library and then one
day when I was looking up the word in a

356
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:52,380
day when I was looking up the word in a
 

357
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,780
day when I was looking up the word in a
dictionary I couldn't remember how to

358
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:53,790
dictionary I couldn't remember how to
 

359
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,329
dictionary I couldn't remember how to
spell it for for whatever reason and

360
00:10:58,329 --> 00:10:58,339

 

361
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:00,740

surprise there's another R in there so

362
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:00,750
surprise there's another R in there so
 

363
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,970
surprise there's another R in there so
that since then I've been trying to

364
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:01,980
that since then I've been trying to
 

365
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,819
that since then I've been trying to
force myself to say library I sometimes

366
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:04,829
force myself to say library I sometimes
 

367
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:08,120
force myself to say library I sometimes
make the mistake still of saying library

368
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,130
make the mistake still of saying library
 

369
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,139
make the mistake still of saying library
you might catch me doing that same with

370
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:12,149
you might catch me doing that same with
 

371
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:15,290
you might catch me doing that same with
like deaf February and February there's

372
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:15,300
like deaf February and February there's
 

373
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,439
like deaf February and February there's
an R in February I still say February I

374
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:18,449
an R in February I still say February I
 

375
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:22,639
an R in February I still say February I
don't know if that's right or not at

376
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:22,649
don't know if that's right or not at
 

377
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,069
don't know if that's right or not at
least I think there's an R yeah there is

378
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:25,079
least I think there's an R yeah there is
 

379
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,009
least I think there's an R yeah there is
yeah OOP

380
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:27,019
yeah OOP
 

381
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:32,480
yeah OOP
okay so we'll probably want another

382
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:32,490
okay so we'll probably want another
 

383
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,730
okay so we'll probably want another
block here

384
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:37,740

 

385
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,330

okay so comes close to the window but I

386
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:42,340
okay so comes close to the window but I
 

387
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,950
okay so comes close to the window but I
think we'll be able to make it go over

388
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:43,960
think we'll be able to make it go over
 

389
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,200
think we'll be able to make it go over
top like we could angle the wall like

390
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,210
top like we could angle the wall like
 

391
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,530
top like we could angle the wall like
this or something that's that's a pretty

392
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:49,540
this or something that's that's a pretty
 

393
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:55,590
this or something that's that's a pretty
good amount of space free yeah all right

394
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
good amount of space free yeah all right
 

395
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,350
good amount of space free yeah all right
so this will come up a hand will make it

396
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:58,360
so this will come up a hand will make it
 

397
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,970
so this will come up a hand will make it
go to a 3x3 door let's just put this

398
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:02,980
go to a 3x3 door let's just put this
 

399
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,150
go to a 3x3 door let's just put this
here I'm going to copy the same 3x3 door

400
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
here I'm going to copy the same 3x3 door
 

401
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,350
here I'm going to copy the same 3x3 door
I used in my village I believe so

402
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,360
I used in my village I believe so
 

403
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,050
I used in my village I believe so
it will be like three stone pressure

404
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:16,060
it will be like three stone pressure
 

405
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,630
it will be like three stone pressure
plates here and then the actual door

406
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:18,640
plates here and then the actual door
 

407
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,590
plates here and then the actual door
itself will be right here and on the

408
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:22,600
itself will be right here and on the
 

409
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,510
itself will be right here and on the
other side stone pressure plates will be

410
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:26,520
other side stone pressure plates will be
 

411
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:34,860
other side stone pressure plates will be
here again but I got to make sure this

412
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:34,870
here again but I got to make sure this
 

413
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,920
here again but I got to make sure this
all looks good so give me a moment to

414
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:37,930
all looks good so give me a moment to
 

415
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,170
all looks good so give me a moment to
refine things here and we'll see where

416
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:40,180
refine things here and we'll see where
 

417
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,170
refine things here and we'll see where
we're at

418
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:42,180
we're at
 

419
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,790
we're at
now if we go with that layout it's gonna

420
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
now if we go with that layout it's gonna
 

421
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,040
now if we go with that layout it's gonna
look something like this I believe I

422
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,050
look something like this I believe I
 

423
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,920
look something like this I believe I
just kind of did a few more things here

424
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:49,930
just kind of did a few more things here
 

425
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,120
just kind of did a few more things here
this is this would be the door and then

426
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,130
this is this would be the door and then
 

427
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,710
this is this would be the door and then
we'll have stairs to go down into the

428
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:55,720
we'll have stairs to go down into the
 

429
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,860
we'll have stairs to go down into the
library and also an upper area an upper

430
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:58,870
library and also an upper area an upper
 

431
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,380
library and also an upper area an upper
balcony in the library as well is what I

432
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:01,390
balcony in the library as well is what I
 

433
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:06,120
balcony in the library as well is what I
want to do ah these go up here to the

434
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,130
want to do ah these go up here to the
 

435
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,800
want to do ah these go up here to the
outside balcony and or patio or whatever

436
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:10,810
outside balcony and or patio or whatever
 

437
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,420
outside balcony and or patio or whatever
you whatever it's actually going to be

438
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:12,430
you whatever it's actually going to be
 

439
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,740
you whatever it's actually going to be
it's not just a balcony and looks pretty

440
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:16,750
it's not just a balcony and looks pretty
 

441
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,100
it's not just a balcony and looks pretty
good the only thing I'm really thinking

442
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,110
good the only thing I'm really thinking
 

443
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,000
good the only thing I'm really thinking
now though is this is more like the back

444
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,010
now though is this is more like the back
 

445
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,280
now though is this is more like the back
of the library like a back exit or

446
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,290
of the library like a back exit or
 

447
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,860
of the library like a back exit or
something then it is a front so if you

448
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:28,870
something then it is a front so if you
 

449
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,210
something then it is a front so if you
consider real life buildings you're

450
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:30,220
consider real life buildings you're
 

451
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,440
consider real life buildings you're
never going to have the entrance on the

452
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,450
never going to have the entrance on the
 

453
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,970
never going to have the entrance on the
second floor or even the exit you're not

454
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:35,980
second floor or even the exit you're not
 

455
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,350
second floor or even the exit you're not
going to have on the second floor really

456
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
going to have on the second floor really
 

457
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,280
going to have on the second floor really
so let's that's that's one thing to

458
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,290
so let's that's that's one thing to
 

459
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,140
so let's that's that's one thing to
consider but this is my draft stuff

460
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,150
consider but this is my draft stuff
 

461
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,090
consider but this is my draft stuff
doesn't have to make sense so we might

462
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,100
doesn't have to make sense so we might
 

463
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,400
doesn't have to make sense so we might
go with that still let me know what you

464
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:47,410
go with that still let me know what you
 

465
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,540
go with that still let me know what you
think

466
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:48,550
think
 

467
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,760
think
one thing I do know though for the front

468
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:50,770
one thing I do know though for the front
 

469
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,740
one thing I do know though for the front
of the library you know those three by

470
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:52,750
of the library you know those three by
 

471
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,000
of the library you know those three by
three letters I showed the other day I

472
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,010

like be like that this let's just try
 

521
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:30,990
like be like that this let's just try
this out so then we would have to put

522
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,000
this out so then we would have to put
 

523
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,470
this out so then we would have to put
slabs in front of that and then in some

524
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:37,480
slabs in front of that and then in some
 

525
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,639
slabs in front of that and then in some
places will add stairs like we did here

526
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:40,649
places will add stairs like we did here
 

527
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:49,290
places will add stairs like we did here
this doesn't really work mmm kind of

528
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:49,300
this doesn't really work mmm kind of
 

529
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:57,920
this doesn't really work mmm kind of
hard to put stairs though isn't it and

530
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:57,930
hard to put stairs though isn't it and
 

531
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:02,790
hard to put stairs though isn't it and
mmm I have to go in the middle if

532
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,800
mmm I have to go in the middle if
 

533
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:13,890
mmm I have to go in the middle if
anywhere huh all right by the way if

534
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:13,900
anywhere huh all right by the way if
 

535
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,329

you're wondering what quartz blocks look
 

537
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:19,760
you're wondering what quartz blocks look
like we'll just try that up too

538
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:19,770
like we'll just try that up too

but that's another idea I think we

542
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,010
but that's another idea I think we
 

543
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,120
but that's another idea I think we
should stick with the wool if we do that

544
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,130
should stick with the wool if we do that
 

545
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,650
should stick with the wool if we do that
another idea I had is maybe we should

546
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:34,660
another idea I had is maybe we should
 

547
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,150
another idea I had is maybe we should
drop this all down one block like go

548
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:39,160
drop this all down one block like go
 

549
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:47,569
drop this all down one block like go
along here with these stairs oops

550
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:47,579

 

551
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:53,310

like so just try this out real quick an

idea is maybe we'll put leaves here and

554
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,190
idea is maybe we'll put leaves here and
 

555
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:03,919

and I'm having a hard decision now

580
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,030
and I'm having a hard decision now
 

581
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,840
and I'm having a hard decision now
should we or shouldn't we is the

582
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:12,850
should we or shouldn't we is the
 

583
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,860
should we or shouldn't we is the
question if we do this we can hide

584
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:16,870
question if we do this we can hide
 

585
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,350
question if we do this we can hide
glowstone and that kind of thing behind

586
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,360
glowstone and that kind of thing behind
 

587
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,780
glowstone and that kind of thing behind
it and it'll make it easier to light up

588
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:21,790
it and it'll make it easier to light up
 

589
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,890
it and it'll make it easier to light up
the base here because as it is right now

590
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:25,900
the base here because as it is right now
 

591
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:32,100
the base here because as it is right now
it's kind of dark but it looks weird

592
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,110
it's kind of dark but it looks weird
 

593
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,970
it's kind of dark but it looks weird
around these edges so if we do I think

594
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:35,980
around these edges so if we do I think
 

595
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,200
around these edges so if we do I think
we'll have to make the land go up here

596
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,210
we'll have to make the land go up here
 

597
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:47,010
we'll have to make the land go up here
or something the other problem is that

598
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:47,020
or something the other problem is that
 

599
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,159
or something the other problem is that
adds you know it's another block height

600
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:50,169
adds you know it's another block height
 

601
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:51,780
adds you know it's another block height
where I have to do something with so

602
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:51,790
where I have to do something with so
 

603
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,940
where I have to do something with so
it's more work and I I'm leaning towards

604
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:56,950
it's more work and I I'm leaning towards
 

605
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,549
it's more work and I I'm leaning towards
not doing it but what do you guys think

606
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:01,559

 

607
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,510

well I think that's going to be all the

608
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,520
well I think that's going to be all the
 

609
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,220
well I think that's going to be all the
work we do on the library today we got a

610
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,230
work we do on the library today we got a
 

611
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,350
work we do on the library today we got a
lot done especially with terraforming

612
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360
lot done especially with terraforming
 

613
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,909
lot done especially with terraforming
you didn't seem well so that but that

614
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:08,919
you didn't seem well so that but that
 

615
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:12,480
you didn't seem well so that but that
was a lot of a lot of time to get this

616
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:12,490
was a lot of a lot of time to get this
 

617
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,860
was a lot of a lot of time to get this
where it's at now but I did do one of

618
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:16,870
where it's at now but I did do one of
 

619
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,200
where it's at now but I did do one of
these windows here I'll show you that I

620
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,210
these windows here I'll show you that I
 

621
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,710
these windows here I'll show you that I
think it looks pretty sweet

622
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720

 

623
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,170

the only one problem with it is that

624
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,180
the only one problem with it is that
 

625
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,080
the only one problem with it is that
block right there

626
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,090
block right there
 

627
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,540
block right there
I curved the wool so it goes inward

628
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:30,550
I curved the wool so it goes inward
 

629
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,640
I curved the wool so it goes inward
toward the building and I need that

630
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:32,650
toward the building and I need that
 

631
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,890
toward the building and I need that
block there to get the half look on the

632
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:34,900
block there to get the half look on the
 

633
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,290
block there to get the half look on the
wool block but it blocks the clay then

634
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:37,300
wool block but it blocks the clay then
 

635
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,680

637
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,390

638
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:42,400
kind of a trade-off we could fix it by
 

639
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,220
kind of a trade-off we could fix it by
lowering the window one block but it

640
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,230
lowering the window one block but it
 

641
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,110
lowering the window one block but it

646
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,210
with it I just know something the
 

647
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,230
with it I just know something the
fishing rods when you spam cast it now

648
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
