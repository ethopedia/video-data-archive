319
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,710
and now not too often I kind of
understand why they're pretty painful to

320

325
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,920
you don't know what you're doing but
once they are set up it I don't know it

326
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:43,930
once they are set up it I don't know it
 

327
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,510
once they are set up it I don't know it

update they did something with the

334
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,170
update they did something with the
 

335
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,949
update they did something with the
textures I think they set it up in a way

336
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:55,959
textures I think they set it up in a way
 

337
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:59,490
textures I think they set it up in a way
that's you can animate them now which is

338
00:09:59,490 --> 00:09:59,500
that's you can animate them now which is
 

339
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,240
that's you can animate them now which is
really cool idea like built into texture

340
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,250
really cool idea like built into texture
 

341
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,560
really cool idea like built into texture
packs I think people could simulate

342
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:04,570
packs I think people could simulate
 

343
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,510
packs I think people could simulate
moving leaves on trees or like

344
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:08,520
moving leaves on trees or like
 

345
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,470
moving leaves on trees or like
glittering ores or stuff like that

346
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:11,480
glittering ores or stuff like that
 

347
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,120
glittering ores or stuff like that
which would be really cool maybe

348
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,130
which would be really cool maybe
 

349
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,870
which would be really cool maybe
glittering sand you know really neat

350
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
glittering sand you know really neat
 

351
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,680
glittering sand you know really neat
stuff like that

352
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:17,690
stuff like that
 

353
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,870
stuff like that
but there's also a bunch of bugs in this

354
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:19,880
but there's also a bunch of bugs in this
 

355
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,930
but there's also a bunch of bugs in this
texture pad and one of them are in the

356
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:22,940
texture pad and one of them are in the
 

357
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,150
texture pad and one of them are in the
snapshot like a bunch of textures aren't

358
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,160
snapshot like a bunch of textures aren't
 

359
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,520
snapshot like a bunch of textures aren't
working correctly and one of the things

360
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:27,530
working correctly and one of the things
 

361
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,490
working correctly and one of the things
is we have this lime-green on the grass

362
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:30,500
is we have this lime-green on the grass
 

363
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,370
is we have this lime-green on the grass
edges so if you look up at a mountain

364
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:33,380
edges so if you look up at a mountain
 

365
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,880
edges so if you look up at a mountain
like this this is what a mountain looked

366
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:36,890
like this this is what a mountain looked
 

367
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,830
like this this is what a mountain looked
like in Alpha yep I'm pretty sure it's

368
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:41,840
like in Alpha yep I'm pretty sure it's
 

369
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,080
like in Alpha yep I'm pretty sure it's
exactly the same there would be no

370
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,090
exactly the same there would be no
 

371
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,120
exactly the same there would be no
difference if you switch because if we

372
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,130
difference if you switch because if we
 

373
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,620
difference if you switch because if we
don't see the grass if we just see the

374
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:47,630
don't see the grass if we just see the
 

375
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:54,210
don't see the grass if we just see the
edges that's what it looked like oh yeah

376
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:54,220

 

377
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,870

actually I was kind of just walking

actually I was kind of just walking
 

379
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,400
actually I was kind of just walking
around here this is a really nice

mountain isn't it very cool that might

382
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:04,220
mountain isn't it very cool that might
 

383
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,320
mountain isn't it very cool that might
be where we did that realistic caving

384
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,330
be where we did that realistic caving
 

385
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,860
be where we did that realistic caving
thing I think but check this out we got

realistic caving thing maybe we'll go

464
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:24,899
realistic caving thing maybe we'll go
 

465
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:30,560
realistic caving thing maybe we'll go
check that up too today they are still

466
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:30,570
check that up too today they are still
