this is kind of what i saw when i went
 

77
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,270
this is kind of what i saw when i went
through before

78
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
through before
 

79
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,030
through before
it's a little bit toned down this time

80
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
it's a little bit toned down this time
 

81
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,630
it's a little bit toned down this time
but

82
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
but
 

83
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,030
but
like it just fills up with mobs it's

84
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
like it just fills up with mobs it's
 

85
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,749
like it just fills up with mobs it's
like i've created a trap here somehow

86
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
like i've created a trap here somehow
 

87
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,670
like i've created a trap here somehow
this area is totally spawn proof which

88
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
this area is totally spawn proof which
 

89
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,270
this area is totally spawn proof which
is what's confusing me like they can't

90
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
is what's confusing me like they can't
 

91
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,990
is what's confusing me like they can't
wander through the portal here

92
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
wander through the portal here
 

93
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,670
wander through the portal here
so i don't know how they're getting into

94
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
so i don't know how they're getting into
 

95
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,069
so i don't know how they're getting into
it there is one more portal in the area

96
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
it there is one more portal in the area
 

97
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,749
it there is one more portal in the area
i believe i think this is also spawn

98
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
i believe i think this is also spawn
 

99
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,469
i believe i think this is also spawn
proof yeah

100
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
proof yeah
 

101
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,190
proof yeah
way over here this is all slab though

102
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
way over here this is all slab though
 

103
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,710
way over here this is all slab though
like they're not gonna wander

104
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
like they're not gonna wander
 

105
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,749
like they're not gonna wander
through this portal so i don't know how

106
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
through this portal so i don't know how
 

107
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,950
through this portal so i don't know how
they're getting there let's check this

108
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
they're getting there let's check this
 

109
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,230
they're getting there let's check this
one

110
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240

 

111
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,950

yeah we got a few guys here i suspect

112
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
yeah we got a few guys here i suspect
 

113
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,590
yeah we got a few guys here i suspect
you know how

114
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
you know how
 

115
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,630
you know how
zombie pigmen spawn on portal blocks and

116
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
zombie pigmen spawn on portal blocks and
 

117
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,069
zombie pigmen spawn on portal blocks and
they'll probably wander around and then

118
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
they'll probably wander around and then
 

119
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,590
they'll probably wander around and then
accidentally wander through sometimes

120
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
accidentally wander through sometimes
 

121
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,870
accidentally wander through sometimes
that's that explains where the zombie

122
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
that's that explains where the zombie
 

123
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,990
that's that explains where the zombie
pigmen come from

124
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
pigmen come from
 

125
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,589
pigmen come from
and why they're at the podzilla area

126
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
and why they're at the podzilla area
 

127
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,910
and why they're at the podzilla area
there but the blazes where are the

128
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
there but the blazes where are the
 

129
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,589
there but the blazes where are the
blazes coming from is what's really

130
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
blazes coming from is what's really
 

131
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,030
blazes coming from is what's really
confusing me

132
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
confusing me
 

133
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,990
confusing me
i think because portals only have a

134
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
i think because portals only have a
 

135
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,630
i think because portals only have a
light level

136
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
light level
 

137
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,589
light level
of 11 and blazes can spawn at 11 and

138
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
of 11 and blazes can spawn at 11 and
 

139
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,710
of 11 and blazes can spawn at 11 and
below

140
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
below
 

141
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,630
below
i think they also might be spawning on

142
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
i think they also might be spawning on
 

143
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,390
i think they also might be spawning on
the portal blocks here and instantly

144
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
the portal blocks here and instantly
 

145
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,350
the portal blocks here and instantly
going through

146
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
going through
 

147
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,670
going through
anyways let's get to it here so there's

148
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
anyways let's get to it here so there's
 

149
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,589
anyways let's get to it here so there's
a bit of an odd idea i've been wanting

150
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
a bit of an odd idea i've been wanting
 

151
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,509
a bit of an odd idea i've been wanting
to experiment with and with the new cave

152
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
to experiment with and with the new cave
 

153
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,470
to experiment with and with the new cave
update coming out

154
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,480
update coming out
 

155
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,070
update coming out
this might be a perfect time we're going

156
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
this might be a perfect time we're going
 

157
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,750
this might be a perfect time we're going
to be playing around with

158
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
to be playing around with
 

159
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,110
to be playing around with
maps today more specifically i've been

160
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
maps today more specifically i've been
 

161
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,150
maps today more specifically i've been
wondering

162
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
wondering
 

163
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,309
wondering
what kind of redstone devices could we

164
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
what kind of redstone devices could we
 

165
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,229
what kind of redstone devices could we
incorporate with maps you know we kind

166
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
incorporate with maps you know we kind
 

167
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,070
incorporate with maps you know we kind
of look at them as these static images

168
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
of look at them as these static images
 

169
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,070
of look at them as these static images
but i kind of feel like

170
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
but i kind of feel like
 

171
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,229
but i kind of feel like
they can be animated to a certain extent

172
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
they can be animated to a certain extent
 

173
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,309
they can be animated to a certain extent
right and used to display

174
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
right and used to display
 

175
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,869
right and used to display
information almost like a monitor right

176
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
information almost like a monitor right
 

177
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,949
information almost like a monitor right
and with people living underground with

178
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
and with people living underground with
 

179
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,390
and with people living underground with
the cave update you're gonna have the

180
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
the cave update you're gonna have the
 

181
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,790
the cave update you're gonna have the
whole surface of your world free

182
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
whole surface of your world free
 

183
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,990
whole surface of your world free
maybe we can make some sort of monitor

184
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
maybe we can make some sort of monitor
 

185
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,830
maybe we can make some sort of monitor
above your base so i'm imagining you

186
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
above your base so i'm imagining you
 

187
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,350
above your base so i'm imagining you
would put your base

188
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
would put your base
 

189
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,309
would put your base
in the middle of the map and then have

190
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
in the middle of the map and then have
 

191
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,990
in the middle of the map and then have
all kinds of wacky contraptions

192
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
all kinds of wacky contraptions
 

193
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,949
all kinds of wacky contraptions
on on the surface does that make sense

194
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
on on the surface does that make sense
 

195
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,470
on on the surface does that make sense
what are those wacky contraptions well

196
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
what are those wacky contraptions well
 

197
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,750
what are those wacky contraptions well
we're gonna experiment to play around

198
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
we're gonna experiment to play around
 

199
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,670
we're gonna experiment to play around
with a few ideas here just to see

200
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
with a few ideas here just to see
 

201
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,430
with a few ideas here just to see
uh how they work i think the very first

202
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
uh how they work i think the very first
 

203
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,949
uh how they work i think the very first
thing though we got to figure out what

204
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
thing though we got to figure out what
 

205
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:25,509
thing though we got to figure out what
is the

206
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
is the
 

207
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,350
is the
refresh rate on maps because i don't

208
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
refresh rate on maps because i don't
 

209
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,670
refresh rate on maps because i don't
know

210
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680

 

211
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,190

aha so a fully zoomed in map is 128 by

212
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
aha so a fully zoomed in map is 128 by
 

213
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,030
aha so a fully zoomed in map is 128 by
128 pixels

214
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
128 pixels
 

215
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,869
128 pixels
and each pixel is represented by a

216
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
and each pixel is represented by a
 

217
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,070
and each pixel is represented by a
single block so we got a

218
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
single block so we got a
 

219
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,390
single block so we got a
a black background here black concrete

220
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
a black background here black concrete
 

221
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,229
a black background here black concrete
just to get a nice contrast

222
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
just to get a nice contrast
 

223
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,309
just to get a nice contrast
if we put a white concrete on top of

224
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
if we put a white concrete on top of
 

225
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,430
if we put a white concrete on top of
that

226
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
that
 

227
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,949
that
bam you see it took a little moment to

228
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
bam you see it took a little moment to
 

229
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,550
bam you see it took a little moment to
show up but it did show up and now you

230
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
show up but it did show up and now you
 

231
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,750
show up but it did show up and now you
can clearly see

232
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
can clearly see
 

233
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,149
can clearly see
that one block on our black background

234
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
that one block on our black background
 

235
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,750
that one block on our black background
now i'm thinking probably one of the

236
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
now i'm thinking probably one of the
 

237
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,910
now i'm thinking probably one of the
easiest and best ways of animating maps

238
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
easiest and best ways of animating maps
 

239
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,350
easiest and best ways of animating maps
is to do something like this where we

240
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
is to do something like this where we
 

241
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,429
is to do something like this where we
have pistons pushing blocks over top of

242
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
have pistons pushing blocks over top of
 

243
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,070
have pistons pushing blocks over top of
other blocks

244
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
other blocks
 

245
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,070
other blocks
so uh the white blocks are gonna get

246
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
so uh the white blocks are gonna get
 

247
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,429
so uh the white blocks are gonna get
pushed over the black box and they

248
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
pushed over the black box and they
 

249
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,030
pushed over the black box and they
should change on the map

250
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
should change on the map
 

251
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,869
should change on the map
and the maps only really care about the

252
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
and the maps only really care about the
 

253
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,229
and the maps only really care about the
top blocks so you can cover

254
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
top blocks so you can cover
 

255
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,429
top blocks so you can cover
over this with the black blocks and on

256
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
over this with the black blocks and on
 

257
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,270
over this with the black blocks and on
the map you can't really see that oh

258
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
the map you can't really see that oh
 

259
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,229
the map you can't really see that oh
these ones down here

260
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
these ones down here
 

261
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,509
these ones down here
are lower than these ones it doesn't

262
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
are lower than these ones it doesn't
 

263
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,870
are lower than these ones it doesn't
really matter it just kind of all looks

264
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
really matter it just kind of all looks
 

265
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,749
really matter it just kind of all looks
black to us

266
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
black to us
 

267
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,270
black to us
we don't see the white blocks hidden

268
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
we don't see the white blocks hidden
 

269
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,430
we don't see the white blocks hidden
there and then when we

270
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
there and then when we
 

271
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,790
there and then when we
start controlling the pistons with

272
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
start controlling the pistons with
 

273
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,790
start controlling the pistons with
redstone

274
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
redstone
 

275
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,030
redstone
it should change question mark

276
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
it should change question mark
 

277
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,310
it should change question mark
okay yeah stuff is happening

278
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
okay yeah stuff is happening
 

279
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,150
okay yeah stuff is happening
so i think it's too fast it can't quite

280
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
so i think it's too fast it can't quite
 

281
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,469
so i think it's too fast it can't quite
draw it quick enough

282
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
draw it quick enough
 

283
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,390
draw it quick enough
it's interesting the line is kind of

284
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
it's interesting the line is kind of
 

285
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,590
it's interesting the line is kind of
showing up

286
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
showing up
 

287
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,950
showing up
somewhere in the middle of this too so

288
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
somewhere in the middle of this too so
 

289
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,310
somewhere in the middle of this too so
let's add a bit of delay we'll double it

290
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
let's add a bit of delay we'll double it
 

291
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,749
let's add a bit of delay we'll double it
well pretty much double it okay

292
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
well pretty much double it okay
 

293
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,270
well pretty much double it okay
okay we're still getting kind of draw

294
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
okay we're still getting kind of draw
 

295
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,430
okay we're still getting kind of draw
lines on it

296
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440

 

297
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,550

hmm oh snap okay we got some good news

298
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
hmm oh snap okay we got some good news
 

299
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,870
hmm oh snap okay we got some good news
here

300
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
here
 

301
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,990
here
everybody it seems to be consistent wavy

302
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
everybody it seems to be consistent wavy
 

303
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,790
everybody it seems to be consistent wavy
line

304
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
line
 

305
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,790
line
wavy line solid solid

306
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
wavy line solid solid
 

307
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,270
wavy line solid solid
then wavy line wavy line then solid

308
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
then wavy line wavy line then solid
 

309
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,110
then wavy line wavy line then solid
solid so it's following a pattern

310
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
solid so it's following a pattern
 

311
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,710
solid so it's following a pattern
which is good when you do redstone you

312
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
which is good when you do redstone you
 

313
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,710
which is good when you do redstone you
want stuff to be predictable

314
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
want stuff to be predictable
 

315
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,870
want stuff to be predictable
uh it seems that the delay is too short

316
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
uh it seems that the delay is too short
 

317
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,110
uh it seems that the delay is too short
or too long it falls out of sync

318
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
or too long it falls out of sync
 

319
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,110
or too long it falls out of sync
and i found the perfect delay seems to

320
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
and i found the perfect delay seems to
 

321
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,110
and i found the perfect delay seems to
be one more to this

322
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
be one more to this
 

323
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,550
be one more to this
and now it's like always in sync

324
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
and now it's like always in sync
 

325
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,590
and now it's like always in sync
look at that oh that's beautiful so what

326
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
look at that oh that's beautiful so what
 

327
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,110
look at that oh that's beautiful so what
is the refresh rate well

328
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
is the refresh rate well
 

329
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,990
is the refresh rate well
redstone torches take two redstone ticks

330
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
redstone torches take two redstone ticks
 

331
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,950
redstone torches take two redstone ticks
to update

332
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
to update
 

333
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,550
to update
and then we got seven on the repeater so

334
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
and then we got seven on the repeater so
 

335
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,189
and then we got seven on the repeater so
that's a total of nine redstone ticks

336
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
that's a total of nine redstone ticks
 

337
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,950
that's a total of nine redstone ticks
nine on nine off for the full cycle and

338
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
nine on nine off for the full cycle and
 

339
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,029
nine on nine off for the full cycle and
there's ten redstone ticks per second so

340
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
there's ten redstone ticks per second so
 

341
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,670
there's ten redstone ticks per second so
we're just shy of that so it's like 1.11

342
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
we're just shy of that so it's like 1.11
 

343
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,670
we're just shy of that so it's like 1.11
frames per second

344
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
frames per second
 

345
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,950
frames per second
for the ideal right here uh i say about

346
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
for the ideal right here uh i say about
 

347
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,550
for the ideal right here uh i say about
because the other thing to keep in mind

348
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
because the other thing to keep in mind
 

349
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,990
because the other thing to keep in mind
is pistons

350
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
is pistons
 

351
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,150
is pistons
retract instantly but they take two

352
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
retract instantly but they take two
 

353
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,790
retract instantly but they take two
redstone picks to extend

354
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
redstone picks to extend
 

355
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,870
redstone picks to extend
so that gets a little bit confusing okay

356
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
so that gets a little bit confusing okay
 

357
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,950
so that gets a little bit confusing okay
so now we're doing a distance test and

358
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
so now we're doing a distance test and
 

359
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,550
so now we're doing a distance test and
it seems like it updates at the same

360
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
it seems like it updates at the same
 

361
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,070
it seems like it updates at the same
rate no matter how far away you

362
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
rate no matter how far away you
 

363
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,550
rate no matter how far away you
are but if you get over 128 blocks away

364
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
are but if you get over 128 blocks away
 

365
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,510
are but if you get over 128 blocks away
from it

366
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
from it
 

367
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,189
from it
it'll stop updating we were just on the

368
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
it'll stop updating we were just on the
 

369
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,550
it'll stop updating we were just on the
border there so

370
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
border there so
 

371
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,469
border there so
only part of it was updating if we go

372
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
only part of it was updating if we go
 

373
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,870
only part of it was updating if we go
further than that it freezes

374
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
further than that it freezes
 

375
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,350
further than that it freezes
we get closer we're within 128 blocks of

376
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
we get closer we're within 128 blocks of
 

377
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,309
we get closer we're within 128 blocks of
it again

378
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
it again
 

379
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,629
it again
now we can see it updating and now it

380
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
now we can see it updating and now it
 

381
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,150
now we can see it updating and now it
froze now the other thing is

382
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
froze now the other thing is
 

383
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,670
froze now the other thing is
when you hang them on the wall like this

384
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
when you hang them on the wall like this
 

385
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,189
when you hang them on the wall like this
unfortunately it stops drawing it

386
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
unfortunately it stops drawing it
 

387
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,790
unfortunately it stops drawing it
actually has to be in your hand i'm

388
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
actually has to be in your hand i'm
 

389
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,150
actually has to be in your hand i'm
pretty sure

390
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160

 

391
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,309

oh and now the cycle's off so the other

392
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
oh and now the cycle's off so the other
 

393
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,990
oh and now the cycle's off so the other
interesting thing about this is

394
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
interesting thing about this is
 

395
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,909
interesting thing about this is
now we're getting wavy lines right i

396
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
now we're getting wavy lines right i
 

397
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,749
now we're getting wavy lines right i
think if i go off of it and go back on

398
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
think if i go off of it and go back on
 

399
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,430
think if i go off of it and go back on
it

400
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
it
 

401
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,990
it
it fixes itself it sinks with our first

402
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
it fixes itself it sinks with our first
 

403
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,909
it fixes itself it sinks with our first
test here we kept it simple it's just

404
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
test here we kept it simple it's just
 

405
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,350
test here we kept it simple it's just
two frames of animation

406
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
two frames of animation
 

407
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,110
two frames of animation
white or black right but you can

408
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
white or black right but you can
 

409
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,589
white or black right but you can
obviously use your full world height and

410
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
obviously use your full world height and
 

411
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,230
obviously use your full world height and
stack

412
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
stack
 

413
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,469
stack
multiple pistons on top of each other

414
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
multiple pistons on top of each other
 

415
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,070
multiple pistons on top of each other
and get several different frames of

416
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
and get several different frames of
 

417
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,589
and get several different frames of
animation different colors that kind of

418
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599
animation different colors that kind of
 

419
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,870
animation different colors that kind of
thing

420
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
thing
 

421
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,189
thing
so with this right now it's black

422
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
so with this right now it's black
 

423
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,629
so with this right now it's black
boop turned green boop

424
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
boop turned green boop
 

425
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,670
boop turned green boop
turned yellow boop turned red another

426
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
turned yellow boop turned red another
 

427
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,469
turned yellow boop turned red another
cool thing though

428
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
cool thing though
 

429
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,309
cool thing though
is even though we've been using pistons

430
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
is even though we've been using pistons
 

431
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,390
is even though we've been using pistons
for our animation there are other

432
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
for our animation there are other
 

433
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,710
for our animation there are other
methods we could use such as

434
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
methods we could use such as
 

435
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,350
methods we could use such as
dispensers and shocker boxes as a way of

436
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
dispensers and shocker boxes as a way of
 

437
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,270
dispensers and shocker boxes as a way of
automatically placing

438
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
automatically placing
 

439
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,029
automatically placing
colored pixels right you can see we've

440
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
colored pixels right you can see we've
 

441
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,469
colored pixels right you can see we've
got an orange dot there because our

442
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
got an orange dot there because our
 

443
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,070
got an orange dot there because our
shulker box is orange so it keeps the

444
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
shulker box is orange so it keeps the
 

445
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,070
shulker box is orange so it keeps the
color of the shulker box as well

446
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
color of the shulker box as well
 

447
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,230
color of the shulker box as well
it seems certain types of blocks get

448
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
it seems certain types of blocks get
 

449
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,990
it seems certain types of blocks get
ignored when drawing maps such as the

450
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000
ignored when drawing maps such as the
 

451
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,830
ignored when drawing maps such as the
redstone dust on the sand here you can't

452
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
redstone dust on the sand here you can't
 

453
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,189
redstone dust on the sand here you can't
see that in any way

454
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
see that in any way
 

455
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,350
see that in any way
uh unfortunately redstone lamps also

456
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
uh unfortunately redstone lamps also
 

457
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,710
uh unfortunately redstone lamps also
seem to get ignored

458
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
seem to get ignored
 

459
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,550
seem to get ignored
you just see the black concrete

460
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
you just see the black concrete
 

461
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,309
you just see the black concrete
underneath them or like when they're on

462
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
underneath them or like when they're on
 

463
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,990
underneath them or like when they're on
the sand here you just see the sand they

464
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
the sand here you just see the sand they
 

465
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,309
the sand here you just see the sand they
don't

466
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
don't
 

467
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,070
don't
get drawn at all yeah so i feel like

468
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
get drawn at all yeah so i feel like
 

469
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,230
get drawn at all yeah so i feel like
there's a lot of potential for doing fun

470
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
there's a lot of potential for doing fun
 

471
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,510
there's a lot of potential for doing fun
cool things with this

472
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
cool things with this
 

473
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,510
cool things with this
i feel like a lot of them would be more

474
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
i feel like a lot of them would be more
 

475
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,710
i feel like a lot of them would be more
just to show off though

476
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
just to show off though
 

477
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,589
just to show off though
and i'm wondering what are some actual

478
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
and i'm wondering what are some actual
 

479
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,670
and i'm wondering what are some actual
practical applications of it where it's

480
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
practical applications of it where it's
 

481
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,469
practical applications of it where it's
actually going to help you out one idea

482
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
actually going to help you out one idea
 

483
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,990
actually going to help you out one idea
is the progress bar

484
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
is the progress bar
 

485
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,230
is the progress bar
so all we gotta do is run a comparator

486
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
so all we gotta do is run a comparator
 

487
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,110
so all we gotta do is run a comparator
to the pistons

488
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
to the pistons
 

489
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,550
to the pistons
it's pretty simple right you can have a

490
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
it's pretty simple right you can have a
 

491
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,710
it's pretty simple right you can have a
comparator chain going from like maybe

492
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
comparator chain going from like maybe
 

493
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,150
comparator chain going from like maybe
deep down underground

494
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
deep down underground
 

495
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,670
deep down underground
you run it up to your display on the

496
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
you run it up to your display on the
 

497
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,670
you run it up to your display on the
surface and it's like oh i wonder how

498
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
surface and it's like oh i wonder how
 

499
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,510
surface and it's like oh i wonder how
many sugar cane

500
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
many sugar cane
 

501
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,230
many sugar cane
until uh my sugarcane farm fills up the

502
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
until uh my sugarcane farm fills up the
 

503
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,350
until uh my sugarcane farm fills up the
chest right

504
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
chest right
 

505
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,390
chest right
so you can hook it up to an inventory

506
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
so you can hook it up to an inventory
 

507
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,230
so you can hook it up to an inventory
and now when items go in or out of it

508
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
and now when items go in or out of it
 

509
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,150
and now when items go in or out of it
you can actually see

510
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
you can actually see
 

511
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,710
you can actually see
on the map where it's at so that would

512
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
on the map where it's at so that would
 

513
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,149
on the map where it's at so that would
be kind of cool or maybe your sorting

514
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
be kind of cool or maybe your sorting
 

515
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,589
be kind of cool or maybe your sorting
system how long until it's done sorting

516
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
system how long until it's done sorting
 

517
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,550
system how long until it's done sorting
the items

518
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
the items
 

519
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,230
the items
or your super smelter how long until

520
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
or your super smelter how long until
 

521
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,790
or your super smelter how long until
it's done it's melting all the items

522
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
it's done it's melting all the items
 

523
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,709
it's done it's melting all the items
another idea is maybe you could hook up

524
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
another idea is maybe you could hook up
 

525
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,110
another idea is maybe you could hook up
some pistons to a minecart track if you

526
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
some pistons to a minecart track if you
 

527
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,630
some pistons to a minecart track if you
wanted to keep track of where the

528
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
wanted to keep track of where the
 

529
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,230
wanted to keep track of where the
minecart actually is

530
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
minecart actually is
 

531
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,389
minecart actually is
but uh i gotta say it would get pretty

532
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
but uh i gotta say it would get pretty
 

533
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,630
but uh i gotta say it would get pretty
annoying if you were riding it yourself

534
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
annoying if you were riding it yourself
 

535
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,790
annoying if you were riding it yourself
this is more like if you're moving mobs

536
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
this is more like if you're moving mobs
 

537
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,630
this is more like if you're moving mobs
around or a storage minecart i think

538
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
around or a storage minecart i think
 

539
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,190
around or a storage minecart i think
it would be cool to see whenever a mob

540
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
it would be cool to see whenever a mob
 

541
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,870
it would be cool to see whenever a mob
falls down in our mob system here that's

542
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
falls down in our mob system here that's
 

543
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,070
falls down in our mob system here that's
something we could do

544
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
something we could do
 

545
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,590
something we could do
that would be a good practical

546
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
that would be a good practical
 

547
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,509
that would be a good practical
application of it but i'm guessing

548
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
application of it but i'm guessing
 

549
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,870
application of it but i'm guessing
another problem here is

550
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
another problem here is
 

551
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,710
another problem here is
a lot of times the maps don't line up if

552
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
a lot of times the maps don't line up if
 

553
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,350
a lot of times the maps don't line up if
you don't plan ahead

554
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
you don't plan ahead
 

555
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,110
you don't plan ahead
yeah we're like see this we're like

556
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
yeah we're like see this we're like
 

557
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,870
yeah we're like see this we're like
right on the edge of it so

558
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:12,880
right on the edge of it so
 

559
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,910
right on the edge of it so
that's not the greatest right let's

560
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
that's not the greatest right let's
 

561
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,230
that's not the greatest right let's
check the nexus area here maybe we could

562
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
check the nexus area here maybe we could
 

563
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,190
check the nexus area here maybe we could
do something here

564
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
do something here
 

565
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,190
do something here
with it see how it lines up

566
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
with it see how it lines up
 

567
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,110
with it see how it lines up
uh the super smelter is kind of in the

568
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
uh the super smelter is kind of in the
 

569
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,590
uh the super smelter is kind of in the
center there

570
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
center there
 

571
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,670
center there
hmm yeah i got this problem though in my

572
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
hmm yeah i got this problem though in my
 

573
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,110
hmm yeah i got this problem though in my
world you see all the gray lines

574
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
world you see all the gray lines
 

575
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,350
world you see all the gray lines
that's from a snapshot a long time ago

576
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
that's from a snapshot a long time ago
 

577
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,949
that's from a snapshot a long time ago
when it messed up my height maps that's

578
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
when it messed up my height maps that's
 

579
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,550
when it messed up my height maps that's
why it rains underground

580
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
why it rains underground
 

581
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,910
why it rains underground
we're gonna work on our storage room

582
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
we're gonna work on our storage room
 

583
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,590
we're gonna work on our storage room
here everybody so look at this it looks

584
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
here everybody so look at this it looks
 

585
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:39,910
here everybody so look at this it looks
like

586
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
like
 

587
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,630
like
most of the nexus is actually within

588
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
most of the nexus is actually within
 

589
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,670
most of the nexus is actually within
frame and pretty much

590
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
frame and pretty much
 

591
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,150
frame and pretty much
center too it's not bad it's just like

592
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
center too it's not bad it's just like
 

593
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,150
center too it's not bad it's just like
we enter the map right over here

594
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
we enter the map right over here
 

595
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,910
we enter the map right over here
on this block we're out of it so just

596
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
on this block we're out of it so just
 

597
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,269
on this block we're out of it so just
the very

598
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
the very
 

599
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,790
the very
front of the building is cut off so it's

600
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
front of the building is cut off so it's
 

601
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,030
front of the building is cut off so it's
not quite perfect but

602
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
not quite perfect but
 

603
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,470
not quite perfect but
like most of the important stuff is

604
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
like most of the important stuff is
 

605
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,870
like most of the important stuff is
within frame here so that's cool

606
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
within frame here so that's cool
 

607
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,110
within frame here so that's cool
and here's the idea i had i realized we

608
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
and here's the idea i had i realized we
 

609
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,550
and here's the idea i had i realized we
could modify things

610
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
could modify things
 

611
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,870
could modify things
slightly to get an extra functionality

612
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
slightly to get an extra functionality
 

613
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,389
slightly to get an extra functionality
out of this thing so

614
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
out of this thing so
 

615
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,269
out of this thing so
for all these item filters that hold our

616
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
for all these item filters that hold our
 

617
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,910
for all these item filters that hold our
items

618
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
items
 

619
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,949
items
we can um

620
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
we can um
 

621
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,870
we can um
what are we gonna do here i'll show you

622
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
what are we gonna do here i'll show you
 

623
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,990
what are we gonna do here i'll show you
i'll show you

624
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
i'll show you
 

625
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,949
i'll show you
so we can build this up like so add some

626
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
so we can build this up like so add some
 

627
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,350
so we can build this up like so add some
redstone going up here

628
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
redstone going up here
 

629
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,230
redstone going up here
all right and then we attach that to

630
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
all right and then we attach that to
 

631
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,590
all right and then we attach that to
some target blocks or something

632
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
some target blocks or something
 

633
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,069
some target blocks or something
like this and then piston

634
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
like this and then piston
 

635
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,630
like this and then piston
and when the piston moves we'll have to

636
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
and when the piston moves we'll have to
 

637
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,230
and when the piston moves we'll have to
remove the blocks above us but when it

638
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
remove the blocks above us but when it
 

639
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,150
remove the blocks above us but when it
moves it'll show us when an item

640
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
moves it'll show us when an item
 

641
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,550
moves it'll show us when an item
is going in the item filter or when

642
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
is going in the item filter or when
 

643
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,550
is going in the item filter or when
we're out of storage space for that item

644
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
we're out of storage space for that item
 

645
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,949
we're out of storage space for that item
what if this is totally full the piston

646
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
what if this is totally full the piston
 

647
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,389
what if this is totally full the piston
will stay extended

648
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
will stay extended
 

649
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,389
will stay extended
i think we're gonna be using basalt for

650
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
i think we're gonna be using basalt for
 

651
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,710
i think we're gonna be using basalt for
this has a nice black color on the map

652
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
this has a nice black color on the map
 

653
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,550
this has a nice black color on the map
so it will give us good contrast

654
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
so it will give us good contrast
 

655
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,389
so it will give us good contrast
and uh it's easy to collect and it's

656
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
and uh it's easy to collect and it's
 

657
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,389
and uh it's easy to collect and it's
easy to tear down if we

658
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
easy to tear down if we
 

659
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,590
easy to tear down if we
realize this is a bad idea but we're

660
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
realize this is a bad idea but we're
 

661
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,670
realize this is a bad idea but we're
going to do is just highlight the

662
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
going to do is just highlight the
 

663
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,910
going to do is just highlight the
the area where the pistons extend it

664
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:03,920
the area where the pistons extend it
 

665
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,030
the area where the pistons extend it
when they extend it

666
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
when they extend it
 

667
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,710
when they extend it
it's going to turn red and that'll

668
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
it's going to turn red and that'll
 

669
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,630
it's going to turn red and that'll
indicate that it is full

670
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
indicate that it is full
 

671
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,150
indicate that it is full
so you can kind of see how it's going to

672
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
so you can kind of see how it's going to
 

673
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,910
so you can kind of see how it's going to
look on the map here i was thinking

674
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
look on the map here i was thinking
 

675
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,430
look on the map here i was thinking
about removing this mountain but

676
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
about removing this mountain but
 

677
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,230
about removing this mountain but
man is it thick that's like a 20 or 30

678
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
man is it thick that's like a 20 or 30
 

679
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,630
man is it thick that's like a 20 or 30
block

680
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
block
 

681
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,350
block
thick mountain it's insane okay let's do

682
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
thick mountain it's insane okay let's do
 

683
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,630
thick mountain it's insane okay let's do
a little test here so we're going to put

684
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
a little test here so we're going to put
 

685
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,509
a little test here so we're going to put
some basalt

686
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
some basalt
 

687
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,670
some basalt
into the system we're going to keep the

688
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
into the system we're going to keep the
 

689
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,430
into the system we're going to keep the
map here i think and then whenever we

690
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
map here i think and then whenever we
 

691
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,030
map here i think and then whenever we
want to check it we'll just take a look

692
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
want to check it we'll just take a look
 

693
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,990
want to check it we'll just take a look
right now we only

694
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
right now we only
 

695
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,350
right now we only
have 32 out of the 256 items set up

696
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
have 32 out of the 256 items set up
 

697
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,550
have 32 out of the 256 items set up
so just one row there and we should see

698
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
so just one row there and we should see
 

699
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,310
so just one row there and we should see
the basalt one trigger

700
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320

 

701
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,870

oh it is working okay that took a really

702
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
oh it is working okay that took a really
 

703
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,389
oh it is working okay that took a really
long time to get there

704
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
long time to get there
 

705
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,030
long time to get there
so i switched it from the red terracotta

706
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
so i switched it from the red terracotta
 

707
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,630
so i switched it from the red terracotta
to end stone i think it shows up a

708
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640
to end stone i think it shows up a
 

709
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,069
to end stone i think it shows up a
little bit better it says that one

710
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
little bit better it says that one
 

711
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,350
little bit better it says that one
little pixel

712
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
little pixel
 

713
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,509
little pixel
now the question is how useful is this

714
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
now the question is how useful is this
 

715
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,110
now the question is how useful is this
to us actually so if we were to put some

716
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
to us actually so if we were to put some
 

717
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,870
to us actually so if we were to put some
nether bricks in here

718
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
nether bricks in here
 

719
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,829
nether bricks in here
let's just do a little test um like can

720
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
let's just do a little test um like can
 

721
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,790
let's just do a little test um like can
we figure out

722
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
we figure out
 

723
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,870
we figure out
what the item is just based on the

724
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
what the item is just based on the
 

725
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,030
what the item is just based on the
position of them being lit up i think we

726
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
position of them being lit up i think we
 

727
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,310
position of them being lit up i think we
can i just don't think it's gonna be

728
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
can i just don't think it's gonna be
 

729
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,710
can i just don't think it's gonna be
very

730
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
very
 

731
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,069
very
intuitive okay

732
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
intuitive okay
 

733
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,389
intuitive okay
there it goes so we count from the right

734
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
there it goes so we count from the right
 

735
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,190
there it goes so we count from the right
to the left so that's on the fifth one

736
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
to the left so that's on the fifth one
 

737
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,269
to the left so that's on the fifth one
the fifth group and the third one on

738
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
the fifth group and the third one on
 

739
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,590
the fifth group and the third one on
that group let's check this out so we'd

740
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
that group let's check this out so we'd
 

741
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,269
that group let's check this out so we'd
have to use the menu to figure it out

742
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
have to use the menu to figure it out
 

743
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:19,990
have to use the menu to figure it out
here

744
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
here
 

745
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,790
here
that group of eight there goes from four

746
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
that group of eight there goes from four
 

747
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,829
that group of eight there goes from four
zero to 5

748
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:23,839
zero to 5
 

749
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,190
zero to 5
f because it's the fifth group and

750
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
f because it's the fifth group and
 

751
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,230
f because it's the fifth group and
third this first four here would be the

752
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
third this first four here would be the
 

753
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,949
third this first four here would be the
first group

754
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
first group
 

755
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,030
first group
this second one would be the second

756
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
this second one would be the second
 

757
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,870
this second one would be the second
these four would be the third these four

758
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
these four would be the third these four
 

759
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,550
these four would be the third these four
four would be the fourth and then this

760
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
four would be the fourth and then this
 

761
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,150
four would be the fourth and then this
would be the fifth group

762
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
would be the fifth group
 

763
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,030
would be the fifth group
and the third one in the four is the

764
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
and the third one in the four is the
 

765
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,190
and the third one in the four is the
nether brick so it does match up

766
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
nether brick so it does match up
 

767
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,310
nether brick so it does match up
so we can figure it out

768
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
so we can figure it out
 

769
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,150
so we can figure it out
there's a little bit of a mental

770
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
there's a little bit of a mental
 

771
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,150
there's a little bit of a mental
gymnastics though to figure it out

772
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,160
gymnastics though to figure it out
 

773
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,750
gymnastics though to figure it out
can you guys think of any better way of

774
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
can you guys think of any better way of
 

775
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,590
can you guys think of any better way of
doing this

776
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600

 

777
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,670

oh man okay well i decided to go ahead

778
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
oh man okay well i decided to go ahead
 

779
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,629
oh man okay well i decided to go ahead
here and do it for all 256 items in the

780
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
here and do it for all 256 items in the
 

781
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,670
here and do it for all 256 items in the
nexus

782
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
nexus
 

783
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,750
nexus
seemed like a good idea to be at first

784
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
seemed like a good idea to be at first
 

785
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,269
seemed like a good idea to be at first
until i actually started doing it and i

786
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
until i actually started doing it and i
 

787
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:05,990
until i actually started doing it and i
was like oh

788
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
was like oh
 

789
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,550
was like oh
yeah this is uh this is giving me some

790
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
yeah this is uh this is giving me some
 

791
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,509
yeah this is uh this is giving me some
flashbacks

792
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
flashbacks
 

793
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,910
flashbacks
to building the nexus it's like even

794
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
to building the nexus it's like even
 

795
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,389
to building the nexus it's like even
though it's a simple thing we're doing

796
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
though it's a simple thing we're doing
 

797
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,110
though it's a simple thing we're doing
because you're multiplying by 256 is

798
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
because you're multiplying by 256 is
 

799
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,990
because you're multiplying by 256 is
actually a massive project and

800
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
actually a massive project and
 

801
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,110
actually a massive project and
my nemesis this mountain if this

802
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
my nemesis this mountain if this
 

803
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,949
my nemesis this mountain if this
mountain wasn't here i could do it so

804
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
mountain wasn't here i could do it so
 

805
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,190
mountain wasn't here i could do it so
fast but i have to clear it out and look

806
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
fast but i have to clear it out and look
 

807
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,430
fast but i have to clear it out and look
how thick this stupid thing is

808
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
how thick this stupid thing is
 

809
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,069
how thick this stupid thing is
there's a lot of land to clear out so

810
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
there's a lot of land to clear out so
 

811
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,269
there's a lot of land to clear out so
it's going to take a bit of time

812
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
it's going to take a bit of time
 

813
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,590
it's going to take a bit of time
plus we gotta farm up target blocks a

814
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
plus we gotta farm up target blocks a
 

815
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,350
plus we gotta farm up target blocks a
bunch of hay bales that's not easy to

816
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
bunch of hay bales that's not easy to
 

817
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,949
bunch of hay bales that's not easy to
get exactly

818
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
get exactly
 

819
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,150
get exactly
and uh yeah but we'll get it done we're

820
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
and uh yeah but we'll get it done we're
 

821
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,870
and uh yeah but we'll get it done we're
gonna do it

822
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
gonna do it
 

823
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,230
gonna do it
just because it's something new and

824
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
just because it's something new and
 

825
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,230
just because it's something new and
exciting i wanna try it out as i'm

826
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
exciting i wanna try it out as i'm
 

827
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,910
exciting i wanna try it out as i'm
working on this i'm discovering the odd

828
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
working on this i'm discovering the odd
 

829
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,509
working on this i'm discovering the odd
mistake here and there on the nexus

830
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
mistake here and there on the nexus
 

831
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,269
mistake here and there on the nexus
that's like i don't think those wires

832
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
that's like i don't think those wires
 

833
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,750
that's like i don't think those wires
over there are supposed to be connected

834
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
over there are supposed to be connected
 

835
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,350
over there are supposed to be connected
pretty sure that'll mess up the item

836
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
pretty sure that'll mess up the item
 

837
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,150
pretty sure that'll mess up the item
filters in total we're gonna need

838
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,160
filters in total we're gonna need
 

839
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,069
filters in total we're gonna need
256 target blocks for this upgrade which

840
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
256 target blocks for this upgrade which
 

841
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,670
256 target blocks for this upgrade which
is 256 hay bales that's a

842
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
is 256 hay bales that's a
 

843
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,710
is 256 hay bales that's a
whole lot of wheat so i got to thinking

844
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
whole lot of wheat so i got to thinking
 

845
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,949
whole lot of wheat so i got to thinking
why don't we go to our wheat field here

846
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
why don't we go to our wheat field here
 

847
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,389
why don't we go to our wheat field here
and uh

848
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:12,399
and uh
 

849
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,269
and uh
clean it up right nice and quick well

850
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
clean it up right nice and quick well
 

851
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,389
clean it up right nice and quick well
actually i think this is

852
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
actually i think this is
 

853
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,230
actually i think this is
a lot slower than using a mini farm like

854
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
a lot slower than using a mini farm like
 

855
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,189
a lot slower than using a mini farm like
i never do this i tried it out as like

856
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
i never do this i tried it out as like
 

857
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,389
i never do this i tried it out as like
it's not really all that great honestly

858
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
it's not really all that great honestly
 

859
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,750
it's not really all that great honestly
like i thought oh you know it's all

860
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,760
like i thought oh you know it's all
 

861
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,350
like i thought oh you know it's all
grown already it seems like it would be

862
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
grown already it seems like it would be
 

863
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,550
grown already it seems like it would be
good

864
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
good
 

865
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,910
good
but because you got to move around to

866
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:29,920
but because you got to move around to
 

867
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,470
but because you got to move around to
pick up the stuff and to replant and

868
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
pick up the stuff and to replant and
 

869
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,310
pick up the stuff and to replant and
you end up wasting a lot of time just in

870
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
you end up wasting a lot of time just in
 

871
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,470
you end up wasting a lot of time just in
the little little gaps in timing between

872
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
the little little gaps in timing between
 

873
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,829
the little little gaps in timing between
planting and stuff

874
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
planting and stuff
 

875
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,629
planting and stuff
that a mini farm is like two to three

876
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
that a mini farm is like two to three
 

877
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,870
that a mini farm is like two to three
times faster i think

878
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:42,880
times faster i think
 

879
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,710
times faster i think
if you got it mine broke in the last

880
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
if you got it mine broke in the last
 

881
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,910
if you got it mine broke in the last
update so i'm gonna build a new one i

882
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:45,920
update so i'm gonna build a new one i
 

883
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,790
update so i'm gonna build a new one i
think

884
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
think
 

885
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,269
think
this kind of stinks all right so we got

886
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
this kind of stinks all right so we got
 

887
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,030
this kind of stinks all right so we got
one observer going up one observer going

888
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
one observer going up one observer going
 

889
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,470
one observer going up one observer going
down to the redstone down there and

890
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
down to the redstone down there and
 

891
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,310
down to the redstone down there and
that's pretty much all we need to do

892
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,320
that's pretty much all we need to do
 

893
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,870
that's pretty much all we need to do
here

894
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
here
 

895
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,030
here
pretty simple uh the thing about mini

896
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
pretty simple uh the thing about mini
 

897
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,990
pretty simple uh the thing about mini
farms though is they

898
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
farms though is they
 

899
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,550
farms though is they
seem to break every single update i

900
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
seem to break every single update i
 

901
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,269
seem to break every single update i
think this is my sixth version now

902
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
think this is my sixth version now
 

903
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,870
think this is my sixth version now
stand here right click that's all you

904
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
stand here right click that's all you
 

905
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,470
stand here right click that's all you
got to do you can afk

906
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:06,480
got to do you can afk
 

907
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,829
got to do you can afk
and look how fast we're getting the

908
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:07,839
and look how fast we're getting the
 

909
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,430
and look how fast we're getting the
wheat like there's no way you can

910
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
wheat like there's no way you can
 

911
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,670
wheat like there's no way you can
harvest it that quickly and replant

912
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:11,680
harvest it that quickly and replant
 

913
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,670
harvest it that quickly and replant
all right everybody so check it out i've

914
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
all right everybody so check it out i've
 

915
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,750
all right everybody so check it out i've
been at this for a few hours now and i

916
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:15,760
been at this for a few hours now and i
 

917
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,509
been at this for a few hours now and i
just wanted to catch you up with what's

918
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
just wanted to catch you up with what's
 

919
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,870
just wanted to catch you up with what's
been done

920
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
been done
 

921
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,189
been done
and uh you can see cut out a lot of land

922
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
and uh you can see cut out a lot of land
 

923
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,310
and uh you can see cut out a lot of land
here

924
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
here
 

925
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,310
here
the mountain is in a bit of rough shape

926
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
the mountain is in a bit of rough shape
 

927
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,069
the mountain is in a bit of rough shape
now we gotta decide what to do with it

928
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
now we gotta decide what to do with it
 

929
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,870
now we gotta decide what to do with it
as well but yeah we cut some slits out

930
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:28,880
as well but yeah we cut some slits out
 

931
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,350
as well but yeah we cut some slits out
and

932
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
and
 

933
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,670
and
on the map this is what it looks like

934
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
on the map this is what it looks like
 

935
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,590
on the map this is what it looks like
currently so

936
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
currently so
 

937
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,670
currently so
you can see the top layer kind of

938
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
you can see the top layer kind of
 

939
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,670
you can see the top layer kind of
overlaps with the bottom layer

940
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
overlaps with the bottom layer
 

941
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,670
overlaps with the bottom layer
the block over here and they kind of

942
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:39,680
the block over here and they kind of
 

943
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,189
the block over here and they kind of
just look like they're side by side on

944
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,199
just look like they're side by side on
 

945
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,189
just look like they're side by side on
the map so i think that's kind of cool

946
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
the map so i think that's kind of cool
 

947
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,550
the map so i think that's kind of cool
good way of doing it and

948
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
good way of doing it and
 

949
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,550
good way of doing it and
likewise on the other side we also

950
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
likewise on the other side we also
 

951
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,910
likewise on the other side we also
i couldn't hear anything i just realized

952
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:51,920
i couldn't hear anything i just realized
 

953
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,389
i couldn't hear anything i just realized
my speakers are off it's like uh oh

954
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
my speakers are off it's like uh oh
 

955
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,910
my speakers are off it's like uh oh
there's no game sounds what's going on

956
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
there's no game sounds what's going on
 

957
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,990
there's no game sounds what's going on
and i look at my my speakers aren't on

958
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
and i look at my my speakers aren't on
 

959
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,350
and i look at my my speakers aren't on
and kind of explains it anyways yeah so

960
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
and kind of explains it anyways yeah so
 

961
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,069
and kind of explains it anyways yeah so
we cut out the

962
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
we cut out the
 

963
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,269
we cut out the
the mountain on this side there was a

964
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:03,279
the mountain on this side there was a
 

965
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,749
the mountain on this side there was a
lot less land over here so it was easier

966
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759
lot less land over here so it was easier
 

967
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,829
lot less land over here so it was easier
now we got to decide like what do we do

968
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:07,839
now we got to decide like what do we do
 

969
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,749
now we got to decide like what do we do
with this mountain i'm thinking we

970
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
with this mountain i'm thinking we
 

971
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,350
with this mountain i'm thinking we
probably should shape it so it's a

972
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
probably should shape it so it's a
 

973
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,350
probably should shape it so it's a
little bit more natural looking

974
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
little bit more natural looking
 

975
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,629
little bit more natural looking
also um should probably build some more

976
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639
also um should probably build some more
 

977
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,749
also um should probably build some more
walls on the nexus

978
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
walls on the nexus
 

979
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,590
walls on the nexus
i know that's like a never done project

980
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
i know that's like a never done project
 

981
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,110
i know that's like a never done project
right but look at this i think you'd

982
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
right but look at this i think you'd
 

983
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,790
right but look at this i think you'd
look a lot better if there was a wall

984
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
look a lot better if there was a wall
 

985
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,829
look a lot better if there was a wall
that went up to

986
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
that went up to
 

987
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,150
that went up to
at least the basalt there and then like

988
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
at least the basalt there and then like
 

989
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,069
at least the basalt there and then like
connected to the building there

990
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,079
connected to the building there
 

991
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,870
connected to the building there
would be good uh also we cut out a bunch

992
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
would be good uh also we cut out a bunch
 

993
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,870
would be good uh also we cut out a bunch
of land in the middle of the mountain

994
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
of land in the middle of the mountain
 

995
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,470
of land in the middle of the mountain
over here

996
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
over here
 

997
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,870
over here
we got more of the displays right there

998
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
we got more of the displays right there
 

999
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,829
we got more of the displays right there
right

1000
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
right
 

1001
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,430
right
all this has been cut out oh boy

1002
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
all this has been cut out oh boy
 

1003
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,990
all this has been cut out oh boy
this mountain i hate this mountain so

1004
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
this mountain i hate this mountain so
 

1005
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,870
this mountain i hate this mountain so
much

1006
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
much
 

1007
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,030
much
oh man but it's all it's almost done

1008
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
oh man but it's all it's almost done
 

1009
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,389
oh man but it's all it's almost done
here possibly

1010
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
here possibly
 

1011
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,629
here possibly
so here's here's the real question what

1012
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
so here's here's the real question what
 

1013
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,710
so here's here's the real question what
i'm thinking

1014
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720
i'm thinking
 

1015
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,269
i'm thinking
the thing is this pattern over here

1016
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279
the thing is this pattern over here
 

1017
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,470
the thing is this pattern over here
actually looks really cool

1018
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
actually looks really cool
 

1019
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,550
actually looks really cool
like where we're standing on the map

1020
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560
like where we're standing on the map
 

1021
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,310
like where we're standing on the map
anyways it looks like it would be really

1022
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,320
anyways it looks like it would be really
 

1023
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,509
anyways it looks like it would be really
cool if we got rid of

1024
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
cool if we got rid of
 

1025
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,710
cool if we got rid of
the land above here too um

1026
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
the land above here too um
 

1027
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,789
the land above here too um
and likewise on the other side and if we

1028
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
and likewise on the other side and if we
 

1029
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,230
and likewise on the other side and if we
do that then there's pretty much nothing

1030
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
do that then there's pretty much nothing
 

1031
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,429
do that then there's pretty much nothing
left of the mountain and we should just

1032
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
left of the mountain and we should just
 

1033
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,510
left of the mountain and we should just
get rid of it right

1034
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,520
get rid of it right
 

1035
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,110
get rid of it right
so i'm deciding if we should do that or

1036
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,120
so i'm deciding if we should do that or
 

1037
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,230
so i'm deciding if we should do that or
not again it's a lot more land to clear

1038
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,240
not again it's a lot more land to clear
 

1039
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,630
not again it's a lot more land to clear
but i think it might be worth it i think

1040
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
but i think it might be worth it i think
 

1041
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,909
but i think it might be worth it i think
i think it would be good if we just got

1042
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:19,919
i think it would be good if we just got
 

1043
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:20,630
i think it would be good if we just got
rid of it

1044
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
rid of it
 

1045
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,470
rid of it
and like tried to refine the area

1046
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480
and like tried to refine the area
 

1047
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,069
and like tried to refine the area
because it never really looked

1048
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
because it never really looked
 

1049
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,150
because it never really looked
proper even the way it was before i

1050
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
proper even the way it was before i
 

1051
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,429
proper even the way it was before i
always debated if i should get rid of

1052
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
always debated if i should get rid of
 

1053
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,549
always debated if i should get rid of
the mountain or not

1054
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
the mountain or not
 

1055
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,470
the mountain or not
but i think i should wait for you guys

1056
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
but i think i should wait for you guys
 

1057
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,150
but i think i should wait for you guys
feedback before making that decision

1058
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
feedback before making that decision
 

1059
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,909
feedback before making that decision
so i'm going to wait on doing that today

1060
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
so i'm going to wait on doing that today
 

1061
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,430
so i'm going to wait on doing that today
let's finish what we were working on

1062
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
let's finish what we were working on
 

1063
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:35,990
let's finish what we were working on
here

1064
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
here
 

1065
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,230
here
we have six out of the eight rows done

1066
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
we have six out of the eight rows done
 

1067
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,590
we have six out of the eight rows done
just two left

1068
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
just two left
 

1069
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,630
just two left
just two more rows and

1070
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
just two more rows and
 

1071
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,070
just two more rows and
uh we hit a snag a huge

1072
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
uh we hit a snag a huge
 

1073
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,190
uh we hit a snag a huge
snag it looks like

1074
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
snag it looks like
 

1075
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,150
snag it looks like
uh it might be near impossible not quite

1076
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
uh it might be near impossible not quite
 

1077
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,750
uh it might be near impossible not quite
impossible i did figure out a way of

1078
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
impossible i did figure out a way of
 

1079
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,470
impossible i did figure out a way of
doing it but man was it a head stretcher

1080
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,480
doing it but man was it a head stretcher
 

1081
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,190
doing it but man was it a head stretcher
okay so the thing is we have to

1082
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
okay so the thing is we have to
 

1083
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,190
okay so the thing is we have to
where is it yeah these are the item

1084
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
where is it yeah these are the item
 

1085
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,950
where is it yeah these are the item
filters down here we need to connect to

1086
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
filters down here we need to connect to
 

1087
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,750
filters down here we need to connect to
these

1088
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
these
 

1089
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,950
these
and then somehow

1090
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960

 

1091
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,070

have the map see us how on earth are we

1092
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
have the map see us how on earth are we
 

1093
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,990
have the map see us how on earth are we
gonna do that it's actually possible i

1094
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
gonna do that it's actually possible i
 

1095
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,350
gonna do that it's actually possible i
did figure out a way

1096
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
did figure out a way
 

1097
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,870
did figure out a way
uh it's a bit weird though okay so for

1098
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880
uh it's a bit weird though okay so for
 

1099
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,150
uh it's a bit weird though okay so for
one thing let's see here

1100
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160
one thing let's see here
 

1101
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,630
one thing let's see here
the way i've been doing the other ones

1102
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
the way i've been doing the other ones
 

1103
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,470
the way i've been doing the other ones
for the most part is like this i took

1104
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
for the most part is like this i took
 

1105
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,630
for the most part is like this i took
the target box over here

1106
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
the target box over here
 

1107
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,990
the target box over here
and then you can put the piston on top

1108
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
and then you can put the piston on top
 

1109
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,430
and then you can put the piston on top
and that's pretty much all you got to do

1110
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440
and that's pretty much all you got to do
 

1111
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,110
and that's pretty much all you got to do
right nice and simple

1112
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
right nice and simple
 

1113
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,710
right nice and simple
end stone in front of that and then when

1114
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
end stone in front of that and then when
 

1115
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,310
end stone in front of that and then when
it extends the map sees it

1116
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
it extends the map sees it
 

1117
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,350
it extends the map sees it
but guess what if we do that it's gonna

1118
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,360
but guess what if we do that it's gonna
 

1119
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,110
but guess what if we do that it's gonna
be right in the center the map will see

1120
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
be right in the center the map will see
 

1121
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,430
be right in the center the map will see
it but then the other side

1122
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
it but then the other side
 

1123
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,230
it but then the other side
is also gonna end up over here and when

1124
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
is also gonna end up over here and when
 

1125
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,909
is also gonna end up over here and when
this side extends they're gonna be in

1126
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
this side extends they're gonna be in
 

1127
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,990
this side extends they're gonna be in
the same place and that can't happen

1128
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
the same place and that can't happen
 

1129
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,669
the same place and that can't happen
all right there's not enough space is

1130
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
all right there's not enough space is
 

1131
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,669
all right there's not enough space is
what i'm trying to say

1132
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
what i'm trying to say
 

1133
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,270
what i'm trying to say
again this is an afterthought i didn't

1134
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
again this is an afterthought i didn't
 

1135
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,430
again this is an afterthought i didn't
plan to do this the nexus i just thought

1136
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
plan to do this the nexus i just thought
 

1137
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,350
plan to do this the nexus i just thought
hey let's see if we can do it today

1138
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
hey let's see if we can do it today
 

1139
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,390
hey let's see if we can do it today
um and yeah so what we're gonna do i

1140
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,400
um and yeah so what we're gonna do i
 

1141
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,990
um and yeah so what we're gonna do i
figured out another way of arranging

1142
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
figured out another way of arranging
 

1143
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,390
figured out another way of arranging
this

1144
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,400
this
 

1145
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,070
this
actually or did i i can't remember

1146
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
actually or did i i can't remember
 

1147
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,350
actually or did i i can't remember
it now something to do with torches

1148
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
it now something to do with torches
 

1149
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,029
it now something to do with torches
uh yeah okay i remember i remember so

1150
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
uh yeah okay i remember i remember so
 

1151
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,549
uh yeah okay i remember i remember so
what we're gonna do is put the sticky

1152
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
what we're gonna do is put the sticky
 

1153
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,909
what we're gonna do is put the sticky
pistons above

1154
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
pistons above
 

1155
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,669
pistons above
the arms will be extended we're gonna do

1156
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
the arms will be extended we're gonna do
 

1157
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,590
the arms will be extended we're gonna do
like reverse pistons

1158
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
like reverse pistons
 

1159
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,830
like reverse pistons
so when they retract then we'll be able

1160
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:23,840
so when they retract then we'll be able
 

1161
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,029
so when they retract then we'll be able
to see the end stone

1162
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
to see the end stone
 

1163
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,310
to see the end stone
so on the map the piston arms look grey

1164
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
so on the map the piston arms look grey
 

1165
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,590
so on the map the piston arms look grey
which is fine because like the default

1166
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
which is fine because like the default
 

1167
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,430
which is fine because like the default
color is gray on all the other ones as

1168
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440
color is gray on all the other ones as
 

1169
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,150
color is gray on all the other ones as
well

1170
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
well
 

1171
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,430
well
what we're going to do is hide the end

1172
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
what we're going to do is hide the end
 

1173
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,430
what we're going to do is hide the end
stone underneath the piston arms and

1174
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,440
stone underneath the piston arms and
 

1175
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,630
stone underneath the piston arms and
when they retract

1176
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,640
when they retract
 

1177
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,669
when they retract
then we'll see the end stone

1178
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
then we'll see the end stone
 

1179
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,029
then we'll see the end stone
and by doing that we save one block of

1180
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:45,039
and by doing that we save one block of
 

1181
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:45,590
and by doing that we save one block of
space

1182
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
space
 

1183
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,029
space
it doesn't go to the middle anymore it's

1184
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
it doesn't go to the middle anymore it's
 

1185
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,710
it doesn't go to the middle anymore it's
one block short and

1186
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,720
one block short and
 

1187
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,630
one block short and
we'll be able to do that on both sides

1188
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:50,640
we'll be able to do that on both sides
 

1189
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,710
we'll be able to do that on both sides
now again the problem is we have blocks

1190
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:52,720
now again the problem is we have blocks
 

1191
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,909
now again the problem is we have blocks
above that

1192
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:53,919
above that
 

1193
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,470
above that
and there's redstone on those blocks we

1194
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480
and there's redstone on those blocks we
 

1195
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,950
and there's redstone on those blocks we
can't exactly get rid of them

1196
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:58,960
can't exactly get rid of them
 

1197
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,710
can't exactly get rid of them
so what are we going to do if we look

1198
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
so what are we going to do if we look
 

1199
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,470
so what are we going to do if we look
from up above here we can kind of see

1200
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
from up above here we can kind of see
 

1201
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,149
from up above here we can kind of see
what's in our way there's

1202
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
what's in our way there's
 

1203
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,990
what's in our way there's
this stone brick with the redstone on

1204
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
this stone brick with the redstone on
 

1205
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,909
this stone brick with the redstone on
top and then this stone brick

1206
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:07,919
top and then this stone brick
 

1207
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,510
top and then this stone brick
and this stone brick actually serves a

1208
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
and this stone brick actually serves a
 

1209
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,510
and this stone brick actually serves a
function as well it keeps the wire from

1210
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:11,520
function as well it keeps the wire from
 

1211
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,390
function as well it keeps the wire from
connecting there

1212
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
connecting there
 

1213
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,110
connecting there
remember how not all blocks are visible

1214
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
remember how not all blocks are visible
 

1215
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,110
remember how not all blocks are visible
on maps

1216
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
on maps
 

1217
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,750
on maps
well lamps have a special property where

1218
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
well lamps have a special property where
 

1219
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,350
well lamps have a special property where
they're a solid block but they're

1220
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
they're a solid block but they're
 

1221
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,110
they're a solid block but they're
invisible on maps so we can use that to

1222
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,120
invisible on maps so we can use that to
 

1223
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,110
invisible on maps so we can use that to
cut the wire

1224
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,120
cut the wire
 

1225
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,350
cut the wire
and then for the lower one we don't

1226
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
and then for the lower one we don't
 

1227
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,270
and then for the lower one we don't
really want these lamps flashing on and

1228
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
really want these lamps flashing on and
 

1229
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,789
really want these lamps flashing on and
off constantly because that'll create an

1230
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
off constantly because that'll create an
 

1231
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,390
off constantly because that'll create an
insane amount of lag they won't be

1232
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400
insane amount of lag they won't be
 

1233
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,070
insane amount of lag they won't be
affected on this top layer

1234
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,080
affected on this top layer
 

1235
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,830
affected on this top layer
because the redstone's beside it but for

1236
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
because the redstone's beside it but for
 

1237
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,830
because the redstone's beside it but for
the lower layer here if the redstone's

1238
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:37,840
the lower layer here if the redstone's
 

1239
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,110
the lower layer here if the redstone's
on the lamps

1240
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,120
on the lamps
 

1241
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,029
on the lamps
we don't want them lighting up so on the

1242
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,039
we don't want them lighting up so on the
 

1243
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,310
we don't want them lighting up so on the
lower layer

1244
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,320
lower layer
 

1245
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,549
lower layer
we're going to use glass which is also

1246
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
we're going to use glass which is also
 

1247
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,350
we're going to use glass which is also
invisible

1248
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,360
invisible
 

1249
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,270
invisible
on maps and that

1250
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280
on maps and that
 

1251
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,350
on maps and that
should do it like that

1252
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,360
should do it like that
 

1253
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,510
should do it like that
i think and then the map will be able to

1254
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,520
i think and then the map will be able to
 

1255
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,950
i think and then the map will be able to
see the end stone below here when the

1256
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
see the end stone below here when the
 

1257
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,710
see the end stone below here when the
piston is retracted

1258
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
piston is retracted
 

1259
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,590
piston is retracted
uh let's do a little test here the

1260
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
uh let's do a little test here the
 

1261
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,669
uh let's do a little test here the
torches

1262
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:03,679
torches
 

1263
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,190
torches
and yeah i can see the end stone

1264
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
and yeah i can see the end stone
 

1265
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,310
and yeah i can see the end stone
put this back and now it should be gray

1266
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320
put this back and now it should be gray
 

1267
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,750
put this back and now it should be gray
yeah now it's gone oh snappers

1268
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
yeah now it's gone oh snappers
 

1269
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,590
yeah now it's gone oh snappers
all right everybody we got her done it

1270
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
all right everybody we got her done it
 

1271
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,270
all right everybody we got her done it
was tricky but we did it

1272
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,280
was tricky but we did it
 

1273
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,669
was tricky but we did it
we got 256 single pixel displays on the

1274
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
we got 256 single pixel displays on the
 

1275
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,750
we got 256 single pixel displays on the
nexus now to show us the position of

1276
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:23,760
nexus now to show us the position of
 

1277
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,270
nexus now to show us the position of
where the items are going in

1278
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,280
where the items are going in
 

1279
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,029
where the items are going in
when they're going in and also we can

1280
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:27,039
when they're going in and also we can
 

1281
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,430
when they're going in and also we can
see when the inventories are full

1282
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,440
see when the inventories are full
 

1283
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,909
see when the inventories are full
with just that single pixel so it would

1284
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919
with just that single pixel so it would
 

1285
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,470
with just that single pixel so it would
be cool if we had more information on

1286
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
be cool if we had more information on
 

1287
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,230
be cool if we had more information on
on here like what the items actually

1288
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,240
on here like what the items actually
 

1289
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,630
on here like what the items actually
were at each of the positions you know

1290
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
were at each of the positions you know
 

1291
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,630
were at each of the positions you know
uh if we could see when the inventories

1292
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
uh if we could see when the inventories
 

1293
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,830
uh if we could see when the inventories
were empty when they were

1294
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:41,840
were empty when they were
 

1295
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,110
were empty when they were
20 full 40 you know have a range of

1296
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,120
20 full 40 you know have a range of
 

1297
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,549
20 full 40 you know have a range of
fullness but with the nexus being

1298
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
fullness but with the nexus being
 

1299
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,350
fullness but with the nexus being
like so old and unplanned for this it's

1300
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,360
like so old and unplanned for this it's
 

1301
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,950
like so old and unplanned for this it's
not possible this is about the only

1302
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
not possible this is about the only
 

1303
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,149
not possible this is about the only
thing we could do

1304
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:54,159
thing we could do
 

1305
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,230
thing we could do
there's not the way the redstone's laid

1306
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
there's not the way the redstone's laid
 

1307
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,669
there's not the way the redstone's laid
out we can't add any more onto it really

1308
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
out we can't add any more onto it really
 

1309
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,149
out we can't add any more onto it really
because it's all like clumped together

1310
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159
because it's all like clumped together
 

1311
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,350
because it's all like clumped together
you know

1312
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360
you know
 

1313
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,110
you know
so you'd have to plan that out from the

1314
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120
so you'd have to plan that out from the
 

1315
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,710
so you'd have to plan that out from the
start of your storage room but it is

1316
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
start of your storage room but it is
 

1317
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,310
start of your storage room but it is
definitely possible

1318
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
definitely possible
 

1319
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,909
definitely possible
now i do know how this is laid out so i

1320
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
now i do know how this is laid out so i
 

1321
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,830
now i do know how this is laid out so i
can figure out the where the items are

1322
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,840
can figure out the where the items are
 

1323
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,110
can figure out the where the items are
just based on the position

1324
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,120
just based on the position
 

1325
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,789
just based on the position
if you look at the top right there it's

1326
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799
if you look at the top right there it's
 

1327
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,149
if you look at the top right there it's
on the fifth

1328
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
on the fifth
 

1329
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,350
on the fifth
row third from the right third group

1330
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
row third from the right third group
 

1331
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,070
row third from the right third group
from the right and

1332
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,080
from the right and
 

1333
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,789
from the right and
fourth item so these three chests here

1334
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:22,799
fourth item so these three chests here
 

1335
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,390
fourth item so these three chests here
are for rows one to four

1336
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
are for rows one to four
 

1337
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,029
are for rows one to four
these three are for rows five to eight i

1338
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
these three are for rows five to eight i
 

1339
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:27,510
these three are for rows five to eight i
might

1340
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
might
 

1341
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,669
might
number it on the map actually might make

1342
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:29,679
number it on the map actually might make
 

1343
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:30,549
number it on the map actually might make
it a little

1344
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
it a little
 

1345
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,270
it a little
clearer uh but since it's in the fifth

1346
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,280
clearer uh but since it's in the fifth
 

1347
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,470
clearer uh but since it's in the fifth
row

1348
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,480
row
 

1349
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,470
row
third from the right and fourth item

1350
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,480
third from the right and fourth item
 

1351
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,230
third from the right and fourth item
is a group of one here group of two

1352
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,240
is a group of one here group of two
 

1353
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,909
is a group of one here group of two
group third group here

1354
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:41,919
group third group here
 

1355
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,909
group third group here
fourth item is grass so it's a grass

1356
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
fourth item is grass so it's a grass
 

1357
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,830
fourth item is grass so it's a grass
block that is lit up right now

1358
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
block that is lit up right now
 

1359
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,310
block that is lit up right now
there's no space for it in the nexus so

1360
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,320
there's no space for it in the nexus so
 

1361
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,070
there's no space for it in the nexus so
i can't figure it out this is not

1362
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,080
i can't figure it out this is not
 

1363
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,350
i can't figure it out this is not
the the best right uh you know what i

1364
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,360
the the best right uh you know what i
 

1365
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,029
the the best right uh you know what i
realized though i probably got a bunch

1366
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
realized though i probably got a bunch
 

1367
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:55,990
realized though i probably got a bunch
of comments on this

1368
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
of comments on this
 

1369
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,390
of comments on this
we can add text to this as well using

1370
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
we can add text to this as well using
 

1371
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,110
we can add text to this as well using
banners

1372
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120
banners
 

1373
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,190
banners
oh man maybe we do that too

1374
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,200
oh man maybe we do that too
 

1375
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,710
oh man maybe we do that too
at the very least we should use that to

1376
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:04,720
at the very least we should use that to
 

1377
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,149
at the very least we should use that to
number the rows then that would be a

1378
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:06,159
number the rows then that would be a
 

1379
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,190
number the rows then that would be a
good idea i think

1380
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,200
good idea i think
 

1381
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,350
good idea i think
but we could like name the items maybe

1382
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
but we could like name the items maybe
 

1383
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,390
but we could like name the items maybe
too with

1384
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
too with
 

1385
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,549
too with
with text so i want to play around with

1386
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:12,559
with text so i want to play around with
 

1387
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,310
with text so i want to play around with
that just real quick here this has been

1388
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
that just real quick here this has been
 

1389
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,990
that just real quick here this has been
in the game for such a long time now and

1390
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
in the game for such a long time now and
 

1391
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,750
in the game for such a long time now and
i feel like so many people forget about

1392
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:17,760
i feel like so many people forget about
 

1393
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,270
i feel like so many people forget about
it myself included

1394
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,280
it myself included
 

1395
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,789
it myself included
even though i've used it a few times now

1396
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:20,799
even though i've used it a few times now
 

1397
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,110
even though i've used it a few times now
i always forget about sil

1398
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
i always forget about sil
 

1399
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,990
i always forget about sil
um let's just try do that is that how

1400
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,000
um let's just try do that is that how
 

1401
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,470
um let's just try do that is that how
you spell netherrack i don't even know

1402
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
you spell netherrack i don't even know
 

1403
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,909
you spell netherrack i don't even know
let's try place it somewhere and see

1404
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
let's try place it somewhere and see
 

1405
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,590
let's try place it somewhere and see
what it looks like i think the more you

1406
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
what it looks like i think the more you
 

1407
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,909
what it looks like i think the more you
write on the banner the smaller the text

1408
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
write on the banner the smaller the text
 

1409
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:34,470
write on the banner the smaller the text
gets

1410
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:34,480
gets
 

1411
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,510
gets
i think you gotta right click it yeah so

1412
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
i think you gotta right click it yeah so
 

1413
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,430
i think you gotta right click it yeah so
it'll show up

1414
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:39,440
it'll show up
 

1415
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,590
it'll show up
but that text is pretty big right

1416
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:43,600
but that text is pretty big right
 

1417
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,510
but that text is pretty big right
and also oh yeah the banner gets marked

1418
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520
and also oh yeah the banner gets marked
 

1419
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,669
and also oh yeah the banner gets marked
too as well as the color so that we got

1420
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:47,679
too as well as the color so that we got
 

1421
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,669
too as well as the color so that we got
a big banner there now too

1422
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:49,679
a big banner there now too
 

1423
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,950
a big banner there now too
so maybe with some clever shorthand

1424
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960
so maybe with some clever shorthand
 

1425
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,029
so maybe with some clever shorthand
writing there would be a way of

1426
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
writing there would be a way of
 

1427
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,070
writing there would be a way of
like marking each one but uh i have to

1428
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,080
like marking each one but uh i have to
 

1429
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,669
like marking each one but uh i have to
be very compact

1430
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
be very compact
 

1431
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,590
be very compact
aha so i think that's all the map stuff

1432
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:01,600
aha so i think that's all the map stuff
 

1433
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,269
aha so i think that's all the map stuff
we're gonna be doing for today but

1434
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:03,279
we're gonna be doing for today but
 

1435
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:03,990
we're gonna be doing for today but
before we wrap

1436
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
before we wrap
 

1437
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,990
before we wrap
up i'm gonna try to sneak in one quick

1438
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
up i'm gonna try to sneak in one quick
 

1439
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,070
up i'm gonna try to sneak in one quick
build project here as well

1440
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
build project here as well
 

1441
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,029
build project here as well
so we've uh added paths and stuff around

1442
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:11,039
so we've uh added paths and stuff around
 

1443
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,310
so we've uh added paths and stuff around
our world right i wanna

1444
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
our world right i wanna
 

1445
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,789
our world right i wanna
try polish things up a bit more this is

1446
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
try polish things up a bit more this is
 

1447
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,549
try polish things up a bit more this is
a good start i think having paths like

1448
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
a good start i think having paths like
 

1449
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:16,950
a good start i think having paths like
this

1450
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:16,960
this
 

1451
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,549
this
is great but these are very very plain

1452
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
is great but these are very very plain
 

1453
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,950
is great but these are very very plain
very simple at the moment still

1454
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:22,960
very simple at the moment still
 

1455
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,710
very simple at the moment still
we want to add more onto them this area

1456
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
we want to add more onto them this area
 

1457
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,789
we want to add more onto them this area
is a little bit more developed but even

1458
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:26,799
is a little bit more developed but even
 

1459
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,269
is a little bit more developed but even
this can get even more developed i feel

1460
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:29,279
this can get even more developed i feel
 

1461
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,710
this can get even more developed i feel
so let's work on

1462
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720
so let's work on
 

1463
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,110
so let's work on
this area over here we got the trees on

1464
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,120
this area over here we got the trees on
 

1465
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,630
this area over here we got the trees on
the left which is nice we kind of got

1466
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
the left which is nice we kind of got
 

1467
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,390
the left which is nice we kind of got
something around the water

1468
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,400
something around the water
 

1469
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,710
something around the water
but it's uh it can be improved quite a

1470
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
but it's uh it can be improved quite a
 

1471
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,669
but it's uh it can be improved quite a
bit still

1472
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:39,679
bit still
 

1473
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,549
bit still
um what i want to try to do is add like

1474
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:42,559
um what i want to try to do is add like
 

1475
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,070
um what i want to try to do is add like
a retaining wall

1476
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,080
a retaining wall
 

1477
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,750
a retaining wall
along here so it looks like it's holding

1478
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,760
along here so it looks like it's holding
 

1479
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,590
along here so it looks like it's holding
the grass the dirt from

1480
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,600
the grass the dirt from
 

1481
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,909
the grass the dirt from
you know falling over we're gonna go for

1482
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919
you know falling over we're gonna go for
 

1483
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,870
you know falling over we're gonna go for
bricks just so we have a different color

1484
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
bricks just so we have a different color
 

1485
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,909
bricks just so we have a different color
the gravel is kind of grayish and

1486
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:55,919
the gravel is kind of grayish and
 

1487
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,269
the gravel is kind of grayish and
this goes well with it but it's

1488
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:57,279
this goes well with it but it's
 

1489
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,190
this goes well with it but it's
different color so it'll help

1490
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
different color so it'll help
 

1491
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,990
different color so it'll help
add a bit more to the area here and we

1492
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
add a bit more to the area here and we
 

1493
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,149
add a bit more to the area here and we
might want to mix some panda site in

1494
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:04,159
might want to mix some panda site in
 

1495
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,710
might want to mix some panda site in
with this as well

1496
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
with this as well
 

1497
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,870
with this as well
let's do andesite slabs

1498
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880

 

1499
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,990

and maybe we'll just add these all along

1500
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
and maybe we'll just add these all along
 

1501
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,950
and maybe we'll just add these all along
the path on the outside one mistake i

1502
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:16,960
the path on the outside one mistake i
 

1503
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,710
the path on the outside one mistake i
made with this though is i made my paths

1504
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
made with this though is i made my paths
 

1505
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,029
made with this though is i made my paths
too

1506
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:19,039
too
 

1507
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,269
too
thin i think we should try fatten them

1508
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:21,279
thin i think we should try fatten them
 

1509
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,110
thin i think we should try fatten them
up wherever we can there's not a lot of

1510
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
up wherever we can there's not a lot of
 

1511
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,710
up wherever we can there's not a lot of
space over here

1512
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720
space over here
 

1513
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,029
space over here
but maybe one or two blocks thicker

1514
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039
but maybe one or two blocks thicker
 

1515
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,630
but maybe one or two blocks thicker
would be better

1516
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
would be better
 

1517
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,149
would be better
so on this side we're gonna go

1518
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
so on this side we're gonna go
 

1519
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,830
so on this side we're gonna go
right on the path but i think on this

1520
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
right on the path but i think on this
 

1521
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,830
right on the path but i think on this
side let's like try to

1522
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
side let's like try to
 

1523
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,149
side let's like try to
build it out by at least the block here

1524
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
build it out by at least the block here
 

1525
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,070
build it out by at least the block here
man i gotta say i would love to get

1526
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,080
man i gotta say i would love to get
 

1527
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,830
man i gotta say i would love to get
better at landscaping in this game like

1528
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:41,840
better at landscaping in this game like
 

1529
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,190
better at landscaping in this game like
if you think about it

1530
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
if you think about it
 

1531
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,029
if you think about it
probably at least 95 percent of your

1532
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039
probably at least 95 percent of your
 

1533
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,950
probably at least 95 percent of your
world is the land right

1534
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
world is the land right
 

1535
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,710
world is the land right
then like five percent or less is the

1536
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
then like five percent or less is the
 

1537
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,549
then like five percent or less is the
buildings and then the redstone the

1538
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:50,559
buildings and then the redstone the
 

1539
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,070
buildings and then the redstone the
stuff i do the most

1540
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,080
stuff i do the most
 

1541
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,510
stuff i do the most
you don't even see that you try to hide

1542
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
you don't even see that you try to hide
 

1543
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,590
you don't even see that you try to hide
that stuff right so

1544
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:55,600
that stuff right so
 

1545
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,310
that stuff right so
a very small portion of my world feels

1546
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
a very small portion of my world feels
 

1547
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,310
a very small portion of my world feels
developed at the moment

1548
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,320
developed at the moment
 

1549
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,990
developed at the moment
but if i got better at landscaping like

1550
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,000
but if i got better at landscaping like
 

1551
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,390
but if i got better at landscaping like
that would cover a lot of the world

1552
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,400
that would cover a lot of the world
 

1553
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,190
that would cover a lot of the world
um but yeah it's one of those things i

1554
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,200
um but yeah it's one of those things i
 

1555
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,390
um but yeah it's one of those things i
probably just got to do it a bit

1556
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:08,400
probably just got to do it a bit
 

1557
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,909
probably just got to do it a bit
and i'll get better at it you know um

1558
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:11,919
and i'll get better at it you know um
 

1559
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,990
and i'll get better at it you know um
yeah you learn tricks and then once you

1560
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,000
yeah you learn tricks and then once you
 

1561
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,590
yeah you learn tricks and then once you
learn those tricks you always have them

1562
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,600

 

1563
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,590

good stuff all right so we just did a

1564
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
good stuff all right so we just did a
 

1565
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,630
good stuff all right so we just did a
little section here

1566
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:22,640
little section here
 

1567
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,950
little section here
nothing too major but i think it helps

1568
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:24,960
nothing too major but i think it helps
 

1569
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,870
nothing too major but i think it helps
uh quite a bit actually we gotta do uh

1570
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
uh quite a bit actually we gotta do uh
 

1571
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,750
uh quite a bit actually we gotta do uh
more stuff like this i feel like if you

1572
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760
more stuff like this i feel like if you
 

1573
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,950
more stuff like this i feel like if you
think about it if you do too much

1574
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
think about it if you do too much
 

1575
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,310
think about it if you do too much
redstone in your world

1576
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
redstone in your world
 

1577
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,750
redstone in your world
your world kind of sucks because it's

1578
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:33,760
your world kind of sucks because it's
 

1579
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,950
your world kind of sucks because it's
just like uh almost like a

1580
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:36,960
just like uh almost like a
 

1581
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,950
just like uh almost like a
a creative world like it is got random

1582
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:38,960
a creative world like it is got random
 

1583
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,870
a creative world like it is got random
stuff everywhere that doesn't really

1584
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:40,880
stuff everywhere that doesn't really
 

1585
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,110
stuff everywhere that doesn't really
look too good uh if you do too much

1586
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,120
look too good uh if you do too much
 

1587
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,789
look too good uh if you do too much
building you got nothing functional in

1588
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799
building you got nothing functional in
 

1589
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,310
building you got nothing functional in
your world it's not

1590
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,320
your world it's not
 

1591
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,310
your world it's not
not all that great either right if you

1592
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320
not all that great either right if you
 

1593
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,909
not all that great either right if you
do just farm building

1594
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
do just farm building
 

1595
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,269
do just farm building
it's like you got all these farms and

1596
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:51,279
it's like you got all these farms and
 

1597
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,110
it's like you got all these farms and
you never use the resources on on

1598
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,120
you never use the resources on on
