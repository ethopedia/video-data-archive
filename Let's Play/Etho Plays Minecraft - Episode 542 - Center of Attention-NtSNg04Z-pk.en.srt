Episode five 50 here and in line with
 

45
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,840
Episode five 50 here and in line with
that one of the projects I worked on

46
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:56,850
that one of the projects I worked on
 

47
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,119
that one of the projects I worked on
fixing up it wasn't actually broken but

48
00:00:59,119 --> 00:00:59,129
fixing up it wasn't actually broken but
 

49
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:00,860
fixing up it wasn't actually broken but
I felt like a little bit of work could

50
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:00,870
I felt like a little bit of work could
 

51
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,049
I felt like a little bit of work could
really bring it to the next level here

52
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:03,059
really bring it to the next level here
 

53
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,670
really bring it to the next level here
and I'm actually using this farm quite a

54
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:04,680
and I'm actually using this farm quite a
 

55
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,950
and I'm actually using this farm quite a
bit now this flower farm to grow these

56
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:06,960
bit now this flower farm to grow these
 

57
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,230
bit now this flower farm to grow these
fungi before we would stand here we're

58
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,240
fungi before we would stand here we're
 

59
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,550
fungi before we would stand here we're
told right click and this would bounce

60
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
told right click and this would bounce
 

61
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,490
told right click and this would bounce
back and forth and stuff or pop off now

62
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:13,500
back and forth and stuff or pop off now
 

63
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,499
back and forth and stuff or pop off now
all we got to do is hit start and it's

64
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:15,509
all we got to do is hit start and it's
 

65
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,499
all we got to do is hit start and it's
all automatic so there's a dispenser

66
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:18,509
all automatic so there's a dispenser
 

67
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,060
all automatic so there's a dispenser
with bonemeal underneath there and every

68
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,070
with bonemeal underneath there and every
 

69
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,980
with bonemeal underneath there and every
time the floor shifts they grow some

70
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:21,990
time the floor shifts they grow some
 

71
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,620
time the floor shifts they grow some
grass and then when it chips again it

72
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:24,630
grass and then when it chips again it
 

73
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,620
grass and then when it chips again it
pops off and grows it again we hit stop

74
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,630
pops off and grows it again we hit stop
 

75
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,120
pops off and grows it again we hit stop
whenever we're done when we got enough

76
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,130
whenever we're done when we got enough
 

77
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,580
whenever we're done when we got enough
products then I added another thing up

78
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:31,590
products then I added another thing up
 

79
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,660
products then I added another thing up
here this is the quick collect we used

80
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:35,670
here this is the quick collect we used
 

81
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,010
here this is the quick collect we used
to have a hopper minecart that ran under

82
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:37,020
to have a hopper minecart that ran under
 

83
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,770
to have a hopper minecart that ran under
this and pick stuff up but it was way

84
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:39,780
this and pick stuff up but it was way
 

85
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,780
this and pick stuff up but it was way
too slow wasn't able to pick up

86
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:41,790
too slow wasn't able to pick up
 

87
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,760
too slow wasn't able to pick up
everything I figured why don't we just

88
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:43,770
everything I figured why don't we just
 

89
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,679
everything I figured why don't we just
add some water buckets to bring this

90
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:45,689
add some water buckets to bring this
 

91
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,649
add some water buckets to bring this
stuff to us here there's a composting

92
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:48,659
stuff to us here there's a composting
 

93
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,060
stuff to us here there's a composting
station over here so if we want to break

94
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,070
station over here so if we want to break
 

95
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,800
station over here so if we want to break
stuff down into bone meal if we're not

96
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:51,810
stuff down into bone meal if we're not
 

97
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,990
stuff down into bone meal if we're not
gonna need it for anything like a lot of

98
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
gonna need it for anything like a lot of
 

99
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,910
gonna need it for anything like a lot of
this grass stuff so then we also have

100
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
this grass stuff so then we also have
 

101
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,170
this grass stuff so then we also have
some hoppers that run under this

102
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:57,180
some hoppers that run under this
 

103
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,450
some hoppers that run under this
composter and it delivers the bone meal

104
00:01:59,450 --> 00:01:59,460
composter and it delivers the bone meal
 

105
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,490
composter and it delivers the bone meal
it produces to the dispenser that grows

106
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:01,500
it produces to the dispenser that grows
 

107
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,959
it produces to the dispenser that grows
the grass so that's all kind of

108
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:02,969
the grass so that's all kind of
 

109
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:05,660
the grass so that's all kind of
automatic we manually load bone meal in

110
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:05,670
automatic we manually load bone meal in
 

111
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,029
automatic we manually load bone meal in
over here as well and I'll just show you

112
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:08,039
over here as well and I'll just show you
 

113
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,940
over here as well and I'll just show you
underneath here really quickly so yeah

114
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:10,950
underneath here really quickly so yeah
 

115
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,380
underneath here really quickly so yeah
this is the composter above this hopper

116
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:13,390
this is the composter above this hopper
 

117
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,690
this is the composter above this hopper
and brings the stuff to the dispenser

118
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:15,700
and brings the stuff to the dispenser
 

119
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,940
and brings the stuff to the dispenser
and unfortunately it's a little bit hard

120
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:17,950
and unfortunately it's a little bit hard
 

121
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,260
and unfortunately it's a little bit hard
to see the wiring down here but

122
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,270
to see the wiring down here but
 

123
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,000
to see the wiring down here but
essentially we have two observers on

124
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,010
essentially we have two observers on
 

125
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,220
essentially we have two observers on
each side here they detect when the

126
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,230
each side here they detect when the
 

127
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,559
each side here they detect when the
grass moves this one here this one

128
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:25,569
grass moves this one here this one
 

129
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:27,390
grass moves this one here this one
checks this one and then sends the power

130
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:27,400
checks this one and then sends the power
 

131
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,810
checks this one and then sends the power
outs over here this runs up to one set

132
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:30,820
outs over here this runs up to one set
 

133
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,110
outs over here this runs up to one set
of the Pistons and also to the dispenser

134
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,120
of the Pistons and also to the dispenser
 

135
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,580
of the Pistons and also to the dispenser
with a bone meal and then this one runs

136
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:38,590
with a bone meal and then this one runs
 

137
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:47,340
with a bone meal and then this one runs
to the set of business now last episode

138
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:47,350
to the set of business now last episode
 

139

you guys very much for your help in the
 

163
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,680
you guys very much for your help in the
last episode in the comments I could not

164
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:22,690
last episode in the comments I could not
 

165
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,449
last episode in the comments I could not
figure out why we were only getting like

166
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:24,459
figure out why we were only getting like
 

167
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,699
figure out why we were only getting like
two or three iron golems at a time it

168
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:26,709
two or three iron golems at a time it
 

169
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,130
two or three iron golems at a time it
was driving me crazy

170
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,140
was driving me crazy
 

171
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,240
was driving me crazy
one of the first things that I saw

172
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,250
one of the first things that I saw
 

173
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,830
one of the first things that I saw
suggested and one of the first things I

174
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
suggested and one of the first things I
 

175
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,380
suggested and one of the first things I
tried you guys said get rid of these

176
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,390
tried you guys said get rid of these
 

177
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,110
tried you guys said get rid of these
slabs here so apparently if we do an f3

178
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
slabs here so apparently if we do an f3
 

179
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,759
slabs here so apparently if we do an f3
be you can do it there that blue line in

180
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:41,769
be you can do it there that blue line in
 

181
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,229
be you can do it there that blue line in
front of the villager is where he's

182
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:43,239
front of the villager is where he's
 

183
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,020
front of the villager is where he's
looking and in order to spawn an iron

184
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,030
looking and in order to spawn an iron
 

185
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,789
looking and in order to spawn an iron
golem the villagers need to see the

186
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:47,799
golem the villagers need to see the
 

187
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:50,340
golem the villagers need to see the
zombie here and you can see like where

188
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:50,350
zombie here and you can see like where
 

189
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,750
zombie here and you can see like where
they're looking is in line with these

190
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
they're looking is in line with these
 

191
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,340
they're looking is in line with these
slabs these slabs were blocking out

192
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:53,350
slabs these slabs were blocking out
 

193
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,199
slabs these slabs were blocking out
their vision to the zombie and that's

194
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,209
their vision to the zombie and that's
 

195
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,670
their vision to the zombie and that's
why we weren't really giving any iron

196
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:56,680
why we weren't really giving any iron
 

197
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,440
why we weren't really giving any iron
golem spawning yeah so we've made some

198
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:58,450
golem spawning yeah so we've made some
 

199
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,630
golem spawning yeah so we've made some
pretty big changes to the goon farm here

200
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
pretty big changes to the goon farm here
 

201
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,250
pretty big changes to the goon farm here
since last episode and we're about to

202
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:02,260
since last episode and we're about to
 

203
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,220
since last episode and we're about to
make some more big changes so just

204
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:05,230
make some more big changes so just
 

205
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,750
make some more big changes so just
wanted to show you where we're at before

206
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:06,760
wanted to show you where we're at before
 

207
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,690
wanted to show you where we're at before
things get too crazy so we've added in a

208
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:09,700
things get too crazy so we've added in a
 

209
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,729
things get too crazy so we've added in a
hopper clock here to control the iron

210
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:11,739
hopper clock here to control the iron
 

211
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,000
hopper clock here to control the iron
golem spawning and that goes to each of

212
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,010
golem spawning and that goes to each of
 

213
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,159
golem spawning and that goes to each of
these zombie chambers I got rid of the

214
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:17,169
these zombie chambers I got rid of the
 

215
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,539
these zombie chambers I got rid of the
Pistons that were here and we went with

216
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:18,549
Pistons that were here and we went with
 

217
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,479
Pistons that were here and we went with
trapdoors instead those open up and

218
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:21,489
trapdoors instead those open up and
 

219
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:24,170
trapdoors instead those open up and
allow the villagers to see the zombies

220
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:24,180
allow the villagers to see the zombies
 

221
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,180
allow the villagers to see the zombies
those two all four of these things here

222
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,190
those two all four of these things here
 

223
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,640
those two all four of these things here
before we were using white terracotta

224
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:28,650
before we were using white terracotta
 

225
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,499
before we were using white terracotta
for our spawning platform and I ripped

226
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:30,509
for our spawning platform and I ripped
 

227
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,210
for our spawning platform and I ripped
that all out it's all gone we got it

228
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:32,220
that all out it's all gone we got it
 

229
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,120
that all out it's all gone we got it
replaced with magma blocks now which has

230
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,130
replaced with magma blocks now which has
 

231
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,580
replaced with magma blocks now which has
two advantages it doesn't spawn the pig

232
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:37,590
two advantages it doesn't spawn the pig
 

233
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,520
two advantages it doesn't spawn the pig
lens the guys that steal the gold yeah

234
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:40,530
lens the guys that steal the gold yeah
 

235
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,409
lens the guys that steal the gold yeah
it's pretty nice you don't really want

236
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:42,419
it's pretty nice you don't really want
 

237
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:43,730
it's pretty nice you don't really want
those when you're making a gold farm

238
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:43,740
those when you're making a gold farm
 

239
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,860
those when you're making a gold farm
right so we get more Pigman spawns as

240
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:45,870
right so we get more Pigman spawns as
 

241
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,390
right so we get more Pigman spawns as
well because of that because they're not

242
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:47,400
well because of that because they're not
 

243
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,340
well because of that because they're not
spotting the other thing the magma

244
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:49,350
spotting the other thing the magma
 

245
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,290
spotting the other thing the magma
blocks do is they slowly kill the iron

246
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:51,300
blocks do is they slowly kill the iron
 

247
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,060
blocks do is they slowly kill the iron
golem so if there's ever a situation

248
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,070
golem so if there's ever a situation
 

249
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,159
golem so if there's ever a situation
where there's nothing on the platform no

250
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,169
where there's nothing on the platform no
 

251
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,350
where there's nothing on the platform no
zombie pigmen to kill them they'll still

252
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
zombie pigmen to kill them they'll still
 

253
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,810
zombie pigmen to kill them they'll still
die which is great that gets rid of them

254
00:04:59,810 --> 00:04:59,820
die which is great that gets rid of them
 

255
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,339
die which is great that gets rid of them
keeps the iron flow going today what I'd

256
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:04,349
keeps the iron flow going today what I'd
 

257
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:06,290
keeps the iron flow going today what I'd
like to do with this farm our main goal

258
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,300
like to do with this farm our main goal
 

259
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,779
like to do with this farm our main goal
is to get it working quicker right now

260
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:08,789
is to get it working quicker right now
 

261
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:10,610
is to get it working quicker right now
when we spawn the iron golems like every

262
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:10,620
when we spawn the iron golems like every
 

263
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,589
when we spawn the iron golems like every
two minutes or so we got to wait for

264
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:12,599
two minutes or so we got to wait for
 

265
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:15,080
two minutes or so we got to wait for
them all to die and then 30 seconds

266
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,090
them all to die and then 30 seconds
 

267
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,150
them all to die and then 30 seconds
after that we can spawn in a new set of

268
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,160
after that we can spawn in a new set of
 

269
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,870
after that we can spawn in a new set of
them if we move the iron golems 16

270
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
them if we move the iron golems 16
 

271
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,550
them if we move the iron golems 16
blocks away from the villagers though

272
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
blocks away from the villagers though
 

273
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,640
blocks away from the villagers though
like right away we can spawn the next

274
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:25,650
like right away we can spawn the next
 

275
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,060
like right away we can spawn the next
wave like within 30 seconds of that so

276
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,070
wave like within 30 seconds of that so
 

277
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,399
wave like within 30 seconds of that so
we can go from like 2 minute waves down

278
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:31,409
we can go from like 2 minute waves down
 

279
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:34,189
we can go from like 2 minute waves down
to 40 second waves probably if we can

280
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:34,199
to 40 second waves probably if we can
 

281
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,560
to 40 second waves probably if we can
find some way to drop the iron golems we

282
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:36,570
find some way to drop the iron golems we
 

283
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,180
find some way to drop the iron golems we
can't move them with water though like

284
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,190
can't move them with water though like
 

285
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,339
can't move them with water though like
we do in the overworld we need some

286
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:40,349
we do in the overworld we need some
 

287
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:43,070
we do in the overworld we need some
other sneaky things so I'm planning on

288
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,080
other sneaky things so I'm planning on
 

289
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,939
other sneaky things so I'm planning on
putting a zombie Pigman in the middle

290
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:45,949
putting a zombie Pigman in the middle
 

291
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:48,260
putting a zombie Pigman in the middle
giving him a name tag or something so he

292
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,270
giving him a name tag or something so he
 

293
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,689
giving him a name tag or something so he
doesn't despawn then any iron golems

294
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:50,699
doesn't despawn then any iron golems
 

295
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:53,210
doesn't despawn then any iron golems
that spawn on here will run to the

296
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:53,220
that spawn on here will run to the
 

297
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,279
that spawn on here will run to the
middle and then fall down how to do all

298
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,289
middle and then fall down how to do all
 

299
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,540
middle and then fall down how to do all
of that though is gonna be a bit of work

300
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:56,550
of that though is gonna be a bit of work
 

301
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,040
of that though is gonna be a bit of work
here we pretty much have to build a

302
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,050
here we pretty much have to build a
 

303
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,180
here we pretty much have to build a
second spawning platform to the farm

304
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,190
second spawning platform to the farm
 

305
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,920
second spawning platform to the farm
which is gonna take a lot of glass and a

306
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:03,930
which is gonna take a lot of glass and a
 

307
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,480
which is gonna take a lot of glass and a
lot of other resources so I'm collecting

308
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:05,490
lot of other resources so I'm collecting
 

309
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,930
lot of other resources so I'm collecting
sand at the moment and good stuff all

310
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:08,940
sand at the moment and good stuff all
 

311
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,969
sand at the moment and good stuff all
right so let's melt that into glass over

312
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:10,979
right so let's melt that into glass over
 

313
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,810
right so let's melt that into glass over
at our super smelter wait a minute did I

314
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:14,820
at our super smelter wait a minute did I
 

315
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,779
at our super smelter wait a minute did I
say super smelter I meant our new and

316
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:17,789
say super smelter I meant our new and
 

317
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:21,350
say super smelter I meant our new and
improved and super smelter here yep yep

318
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
improved and super smelter here yep yep
 

319
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,170
improved and super smelter here yep yep
so the other day I ended up absolutely

320
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,180
so the other day I ended up absolutely
 

321
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,870
so the other day I ended up absolutely
gutting the super smelter just ripped

322
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
gutting the super smelter just ripped
 

323
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,200
gutting the super smelter just ripped
out a good 70% of it I would say down to

324
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,210
out a good 70% of it I would say down to
 

325
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,990
out a good 70% of it I would say down to
the bone we got rid of the fuel

326
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,000
the bone we got rid of the fuel
 

327
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,149
the bone we got rid of the fuel
distribution system minutes we were

328
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:35,159
distribution system minutes we were
 

329
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,510
distribution system minutes we were
using copper mine carts before

330
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
using copper mine carts before
 

331
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,879
using copper mine carts before
spruce planks we got rid of all that and

332
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:39,889
spruce planks we got rid of all that and
 

333
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:42,430
spruce planks we got rid of all that and
replaced it with water streams so that

334
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:42,440
replaced it with water streams so that
 

335
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,379
replaced it with water streams so that
we could hook it up to the bamboozler

336
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:44,389
we could hook it up to the bamboozler
 

337
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:48,300
we could hook it up to the bamboozler
and supply it with bamboo fuel instead

338
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,310
and supply it with bamboo fuel instead
 

339
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,070
and supply it with bamboo fuel instead
so we have the bamboo plants down there

340
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,080
so we have the bamboo plants down there
 

341
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,779
so we have the bamboo plants down there
growing in the column and get squished

all the hoppers here that go into the
furnace fuel slots how are we doing how

352
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:05,750
furnace fuel slots how are we doing how
 

353
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,300

far did we get so it goes down the right

354
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:07,310
far did we get so it goes down the right
 

355
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,969

on stacks of bamboo there's still more

364
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,370
on stacks of bamboo there's still more
 

365
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,309
on stacks of bamboo there's still more
bamboo here oh my goodness there's so

depressing queue from all the bamboo

370
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,190
depressing queue from all the bamboo
 

371
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,620
depressing queue from all the bamboo
very good very good so we gotta fire it

372
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:41,630
very good very good so we gotta fire it
 

373
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,270
very good very good so we gotta fire it
up here again that's coming up come down

374
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
up here again that's coming up come down
 

375
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,820
up here again that's coming up come down
goes through change the water stream a

376
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:45,830
goes through change the water stream a
 

377
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,230
goes through change the water stream a
little bit over here I straightened it

378
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,240
little bit over here I straightened it
 

379
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,540
little bit over here I straightened it
out and then I added a ring over here

380
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:49,550
out and then I added a ring over here
 

381
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,110
out and then I added a ring over here
now so that aligns to this side of the

382
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
now so that aligns to this side of the
 

383
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,990
now so that aligns to this side of the
glass instead of a left side against the

384
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
glass instead of a left side against the
 

385
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,480
glass instead of a left side against the
trap doors here that way it won't fall

386
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:58,490
trap doors here that way it won't fall
 

387
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,999
trap doors here that way it won't fall
into the hopper spot so it goes down the

388
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:01,009
into the hopper spot so it goes down the
 

389
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:07,260
into the hopper spot so it goes down the
stream here to underneath the slab and

390
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,270
stream here to underneath the slab and
 

391
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,659
stream here to underneath the slab and
then goes over this set of hoppers into

392
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:10,669
then goes over this set of hoppers into
 

393
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:13,120
then goes over this set of hoppers into
these furnaces and we got redstone in

394
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,130
these furnaces and we got redstone in
 

395
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,559
these furnaces and we got redstone in
our way we jump over top of it like a

396
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:14,569
our way we jump over top of it like a
 

397
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:17,070
our way we jump over top of it like a
ninja we go over we keep going forward

398
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,080
ninja we go over we keep going forward
 

399
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,469
ninja we go over we keep going forward
it goes to the left aligns against these

400
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
it goes to the left aligns against these
 

401
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:27,670
it goes to the left aligns against these
trap doors oh no it's not a trap door

402
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
trap doors oh no it's not a trap door
 

403
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,439
trap doors oh no it's not a trap door
thickness here though it aligns right

404
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,449
thickness here though it aligns right
 

405
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:30,580
thickness here though it aligns right
against the edge of the block

406
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:30,590
against the edge of the block
 

407
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,870
against the edge of the block
I was wondering like why doesn't it fall

408
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:31,880
I was wondering like why doesn't it fall
 

409
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,459
I was wondering like why doesn't it fall
in the hoppers here that's because it's

410
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:33,469
in the hoppers here that's because it's
 

411
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:34,930
in the hoppers here that's because it's
it's on the edge of the hopper still

412
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:34,940
it's on the edge of the hopper still
 

413
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,750
it's on the edge of the hopper still
okay so it goes down the middle again so

414
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:37,760
okay so it goes down the middle again so
 

415
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,219
okay so it goes down the middle again so
there's like two separate water streams

416
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:39,229
there's like two separate water streams
 

417
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:42,370
there's like two separate water streams
in the middle here now when it goes down

418
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:42,380
in the middle here now when it goes down
 

419
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,760
in the middle here now when it goes down
this side it falls down here goes

420
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:45,770
this side it falls down here goes
 

421
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,790
this side it falls down here goes
underneath this water stream to the left

422
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:47,800
underneath this water stream to the left
 

423
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,010
underneath this water stream to the left
upper water elevator

424
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:51,020
upper water elevator
 

425
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,329
upper water elevator
looks like it kind of gets stuck on that

426
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:52,339
looks like it kind of gets stuck on that
 

427
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:54,100
looks like it kind of gets stuck on that
slap but it'll go down apparently so

428
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,110
slap but it'll go down apparently so
 

429
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,010
slap but it'll go down apparently so
that's fine and and it goes down this

430
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,020
that's fine and and it goes down this
 

431
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,180
that's fine and and it goes down this
side and we oh we are totally full now

432
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,190
side and we oh we are totally full now
 

433
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,790
side and we oh we are totally full now
it's just I think we just reached full

434
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:03,800
it's just I think we just reached full
 

435
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
it's just I think we just reached full
capacity so now this is supposed to go

436
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:05,810
capacity so now this is supposed to go
 

437
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,510
capacity so now this is supposed to go
back to the bamboozler and I had that up

438
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:07,520
back to the bamboozler and I had that up
 

439
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,150
back to the bamboozler and I had that up
yet so I am gonna shut this off we are

440
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,160
yet so I am gonna shut this off we are
 

441
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,850
yet so I am gonna shut this off we are
full of fuel

442
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:11,860
full of fuel
 

443
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,800
full of fuel
uh-huh so that was quite a big overhaul

444
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:14,810
uh-huh so that was quite a big overhaul
 

445
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,570
uh-huh so that was quite a big overhaul
to our super smelter here guys a big

446
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:16,580
to our super smelter here guys a big
 

447
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,840
to our super smelter here guys a big
project but I am happy it is done again

448
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:19,850
project but I am happy it is done again
 

449
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,610
project but I am happy it is done again
there wasn't anything really broken with

450
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:21,620
there wasn't anything really broken with
 

451
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,130
there wasn't anything really broken with
the super smelter before but the fuel

452
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,140
the super smelter before but the fuel
 

453
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,019
the super smelter before but the fuel
system wasn't really working the best

454
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:26,029
system wasn't really working the best
 

455
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:27,460
system wasn't really working the best
you saw even when we broke some of those

456
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:27,470
you saw even when we broke some of those
 

457
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,220
you saw even when we broke some of those
furnaces they had some unsalted items in

458
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,230
furnaces they had some unsalted items in
 

459
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,250
furnaces they had some unsalted items in
so like The Closer furnaces were getting

460
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:33,260
so like The Closer furnaces were getting
 

461
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,110
so like The Closer furnaces were getting
fuel but the further one further away

462
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
fuel but the further one further away
 

463
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,110
fuel but the further one further away
ones weren't so that was an issue check

464
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,120
ones weren't so that was an issue check
 

465
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,670
ones weren't so that was an issue check
this out this is all the spruce wood we

466
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
this out this is all the spruce wood we
 

467
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,760
this out this is all the spruce wood we
pulled out of there so again I don't

468
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:42,770
pulled out of there so again I don't
 

469
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,980
pulled out of there so again I don't
hope that's not true so I didn't want to

470
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:44,990
hope that's not true so I didn't want to
 

471
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,300
hope that's not true so I didn't want to
keep using spruce wood because that

472
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,310
keep using spruce wood because that
 

473
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,769
keep using spruce wood because that
takes a bit of time to farm out right

474
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:47,779
takes a bit of time to farm out right
 

475
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:49,630
takes a bit of time to farm out right
even though we have a pretty good farm

476
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:49,640
even though we have a pretty good farm
 

477
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,420
even though we have a pretty good farm
for it I would much rather use bamboo

478
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:52,430
for it I would much rather use bamboo
 

479
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,490
for it I would much rather use bamboo
and the only way we could really use

480
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:54,500
and the only way we could really use
 

481
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,780
and the only way we could really use
bamboo is if we redid the distribution

482
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:58,790
bamboo is if we redid the distribution
 

483
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,460
bamboo is if we redid the distribution
system so that's why we did the revamp

484
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:00,470
system so that's why we did the revamp
 

485
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,269
system so that's why we did the revamp
here now check this out oh yeah and

486
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:04,279
here now check this out oh yeah and
 

487
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,470
here now check this out oh yeah and
there used to be a chest here for

488
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:05,480
there used to be a chest here for
 

489
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,120
there used to be a chest here for
putting fuel and obviously that's gone

490
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,130
putting fuel and obviously that's gone
 

491
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,670
putting fuel and obviously that's gone
because it doesn't get supplied here

492
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
because it doesn't get supplied here
 

493
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,370
because it doesn't get supplied here
anymore it comes from the bamboozler

494
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:11,380
anymore it comes from the bamboozler
 

495
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,240
anymore it comes from the bamboozler
yeah let's throw in some sand again we

496
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,250
yeah let's throw in some sand again we
 

497
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,980
yeah let's throw in some sand again we
still have the super quick feed system

498
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:17,990
still have the super quick feed system
 

499
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,220
still have the super quick feed system
to it so that's cool the distribution

500
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,230
to it so that's cool the distribution
 

501
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,960
to it so that's cool the distribution
for the items is exactly the same that's

502
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:22,970
for the items is exactly the same that's
 

503
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,400
for the items is exactly the same that's
the only thing I didn't change about it

504
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,410
the only thing I didn't change about it
 

505
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:29,290
the only thing I didn't change about it
and I also redid the elevator so when I

506
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:29,300
and I also redid the elevator so when I
 

507
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,639
and I also redid the elevator so when I
built this originally we didn't have

508
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:30,649
built this originally we didn't have
 

509
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:34,420
built this originally we didn't have
bubble streams in the game right no no

510
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:34,430
bubble streams in the game right no no
 

511
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,069
bubble streams in the game right no no
water elevators like this so I had a

512
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
water elevators like this so I had a
 

513
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,600
water elevators like this so I had a
quad dropper elevator which was both

514
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:40,610
quad dropper elevator which was both
 

515
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,510
quad dropper elevator which was both
amazing and horrible it made so much

516
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:43,520
amazing and horrible it made so much
 

517
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,100
amazing and horrible it made so much
noise

518
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,110
noise
 

519
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,430
noise
it was so laggy so instead now we just

520
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:48,440
it was so laggy so instead now we just
 

521
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,829
it was so laggy so instead now we just
have a very simple very effective water

522
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:50,839
have a very simple very effective water
 

523
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,160
have a very simple very effective water
elevator here brings items up they get

524
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,170
elevator here brings items up they get
 

525
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,130
elevator here brings items up they get
dropped on top of a minecart here upper

526
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:57,140
dropped on top of a minecart here upper
 

527
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,260
dropped on top of a minecart here upper
minecart this is sitting on top of three

528
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,270
minecart this is sitting on top of three
 

529
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,430
minecart this is sitting on top of three
different hoppers which splits the items

530
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:02,440
different hoppers which splits the items
 

531
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,190
different hoppers which splits the items
evenly

532
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,200
evenly
 

533
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,780
evenly
into three different hoppers and then

534
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:05,790
into three different hoppers and then
 

535
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,790
into three different hoppers and then
that allows them to fill the Shocker box

536
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:07,800
that allows them to fill the Shocker box
 

537
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,980
that allows them to fill the Shocker box
here and three times the normal fill

538
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:09,990
here and three times the normal fill
 

539
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,070
here and three times the normal fill
speed because again with this super

540
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:13,080
speed because again with this super
 

541
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,870
speed because again with this super
smelter I think we're smelting twelve

542
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
smelter I think we're smelting twelve
 

543
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,180
smelter I think we're smelting twelve
stacks per minute with the drew twelve

544
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,190
stacks per minute with the drew twelve
 

545
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,180
stacks per minute with the drew twelve
point eight items a second so it needs

546
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,190
point eight items a second so it needs
 

547
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,340
point eight items a second so it needs
to be able to handle that and even with

548
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,350
to be able to handle that and even with
 

549
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,470
to be able to handle that and even with
the three hopper speed it gets backed up

550
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
the three hopper speed it gets backed up
 

551
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,710
the three hopper speed it gets backed up
a little bit you see this is filling up

552
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:27,720
a little bit you see this is filling up
 

553
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,410
a little bit you see this is filling up
so we kind of need like bore but it's

554
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:30,420
so we kind of need like bore but it's
 

555
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,880
so we kind of need like bore but it's
good enough I think as long as we don't

556
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:31,890
good enough I think as long as we don't
 

557
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,580
good enough I think as long as we don't
run it for too too long

558
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:34,590
run it for too too long
 

559
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,650
run it for too too long
we got a dispenser back here we can put

560
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:36,660
we got a dispenser back here we can put
 

561
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,300
we got a dispenser back here we can put
empty Shanker boxes in and then I just

562
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,310
empty Shanker boxes in and then I just
 

563
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,390
empty Shanker boxes in and then I just
grab these and go I gotta work on an

564
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:41,400
grab these and go I gotta work on an
 

565
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,800
grab these and go I gotta work on an
interface for this thing I wanted to

566
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:42,810
interface for this thing I wanted to
 

567
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,840
interface for this thing I wanted to
show to you guys before I covered

568
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:44,850
show to you guys before I covered
 

569
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,280
show to you guys before I covered
everything up here so you can see how it

570
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,290
everything up here so you can see how it
 

571
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:46,850
everything up here so you can see how it
works

572
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:46,860
works
 

573
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,120
works
we also have a redstone line running up

574
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,130
we also have a redstone line running up
 

575
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,700
we also have a redstone line running up
to a light this tells me when we're low

576
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:52,710
to a light this tells me when we're low
 

577
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,010
to a light this tells me when we're low
on fuel that light will go off when

578
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:55,020
on fuel that light will go off when
 

579
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,740
on fuel that light will go off when
we're down to our final stack of fuel so

580
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:57,750
we're down to our final stack of fuel so
 

581
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,910
we're down to our final stack of fuel so
that's good I don't want to run the

582
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:58,920
that's good I don't want to run the
 

583
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,840
that's good I don't want to run the
bamboozler again and what else oh yeah I

584
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:02,850
bamboozler again and what else oh yeah I
 

585
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,840
bamboozler again and what else oh yeah I
did the mushroom thing here too so

586
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:05,850
did the mushroom thing here too so
 

587
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,500
did the mushroom thing here too so
mushroom is kind of like my go-to wall

588
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:09,510
mushroom is kind of like my go-to wall
 

589
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,270
mushroom is kind of like my go-to wall
material now I think because it's so

590
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:11,280
material now I think because it's so
 

591
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,880
material now I think because it's so
easy to farm I didn't like that it

592
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:13,890
easy to farm I didn't like that it
 

593
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,190
easy to farm I didn't like that it
looked like stone and dirt and stuff

594
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:16,200
looked like stone and dirt and stuff
 

595
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,110
looked like stone and dirt and stuff
mixed in the walls here so I replaced at

596
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,120
mixed in the walls here so I replaced at
 

597
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,570
mixed in the walls here so I replaced at
all with mushroom blocks and same sort

598
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:20,580
all with mushroom blocks and same sort
 

599
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,160
all with mushroom blocks and same sort
of deal with the bamboozler here we had

600
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,170
of deal with the bamboozler here we had
 

601
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,990
of deal with the bamboozler here we had
dirt and stone showing on the wall so I

602
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
dirt and stone showing on the wall so I
 

603
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,580
dirt and stone showing on the wall so I
replaced all the walls here with the

604
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:25,590
replaced all the walls here with the
 

605
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,140
replaced all the walls here with the
mushroom blocks and I think that looks a

606
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,150
mushroom blocks and I think that looks a
 

607
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,210
mushroom blocks and I think that looks a
lot better it's a nice clean look to it

608
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:29,220
lot better it's a nice clean look to it
 

609
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,060
lot better it's a nice clean look to it
now we still got to build some kind of

610
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,070
now we still got to build some kind of
 

611
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,000
now we still got to build some kind of
structure over top of this though I'll

612
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,010
structure over top of this though I'll
 

613
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,980
structure over top of this though I'll
probably keep the glass open like this

614
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:36,990
probably keep the glass open like this
 

615
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,060
probably keep the glass open like this
because I like to how it looks when you

616
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,070
because I like to how it looks when you
 

617
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,010
because I like to how it looks when you
look down here you might notice I'm back

618
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,020
look down here you might notice I'm back
 

619
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,950
look down here you might notice I'm back
to eating fish here again even though he

620
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:42,960
to eating fish here again even though he
 

621
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,390

got the farmer villager that I

622
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:44,400
got the farmer villager that I
 

623
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,180
got the farmer villager that I
desperately wanted we unlocked all his

624
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,190
desperately wanted we unlocked all his
 

625
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,950
desperately wanted we unlocked all his
trades we got the golden carrot trade

626
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:48,960
trades we got the golden carrot trade
 

627
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,650
trades we got the golden carrot trade
and then he wandered out over to here

628
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:53,660
and then he wandered out over to here
 

629
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,180
and then he wandered out over to here
and then you won't restock unless he

630
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,190
and then you won't restock unless he
 

631
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,890
and then you won't restock unless he
goes back to the village I put a path

632
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:57,900
goes back to the village I put a path
 

633
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,190
goes back to the village I put a path
for him to climb back up

634
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:00,200
for him to climb back up
 

635
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,090
for him to climb back up

meal what does that mean I think it's
 

713
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,460
meal what does that mean I think it's
it's like eight per bone meal maybe

it's like eight per bone meal maybe
 

715

to put down a trap door so he can't get
 

793
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,170
to put down a trap door so he can't get
out I think we caught a guy I don't want

794
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:32,180
out I think we caught a guy I don't want
 

795
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,280
out I think we caught a guy I don't want
to do this maybe we'll put some glass

796
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,290
to do this maybe we'll put some glass
 

797
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,410
to do this maybe we'll put some glass
blocks above them yeah I think we got

798
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:35,420
blocks above them yeah I think we got
 

799
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,210
blocks above them yeah I think we got
our guy here so I'm at a name um this is

800
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:37,220
our guy here so I'm at a name um this is
 

801
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,210
our guy here so I'm at a name um this is
our center of attention I'm gonna try to

802
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,220
our center of attention I'm gonna try to
 

803
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,420
our center of attention I'm gonna try to
get this trapdoor right I'm gonna move

804
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:43,430
get this trapdoor right I'm gonna move
 

805
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,830
get this trapdoor right I'm gonna move
that to over here flip that up then

806
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:47,840
that to over here flip that up then
 

807
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,540
that to over here flip that up then
we're free to get rid of this one we got

808
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:49,550
we're free to get rid of this one we got
 

809
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,720
we're free to get rid of this one we got
a glass block above his head so

810
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:52,730
a glass block above his head so
 

811
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,790
a glass block above his head so
hopefully iron golems will be able to

812
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
hopefully iron golems will be able to
 

813
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,380
hopefully iron golems will be able to
see them when they spawn on the platform

814
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:56,390
see them when they spawn on the platform
 

815
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,600
see them when they spawn on the platform
around them but then we have enough of a

816
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:58,610
around them but then we have enough of a
 

817
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,130
around them but then we have enough of a
gap here where they shouldn't be able to

818
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,140
gap here where they shouldn't be able to
 

819
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,270
gap here where they shouldn't be able to
hit them I think it's one two four do we

820
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,280
hit them I think it's one two four do we
 

821
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,740
hit them I think it's one two four do we
need a three block gap I'm not sure

822
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:05,750
need a three block gap I'm not sure
 

823
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,210
need a three block gap I'm not sure
we'll find out I guess yeah okay good we

824
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:10,220
we'll find out I guess yeah okay good we
 

825
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,150
we'll find out I guess yeah okay good we
got some iron golems so the next part of

826
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,160
got some iron golems so the next part of
 

827
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,070
got some iron golems so the next part of
this is we don't want zombie Pigman to

828
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:15,080
this is we don't want zombie Pigman to
 

829
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,050
this is we don't want zombie Pigman to
spawn on this layer actually we only

830
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,060
spawn on this layer actually we only
 

831
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,160
spawn on this layer actually we only
want iron golems too and we want them to

832
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,170
want iron golems too and we want them to
 

833
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,520
want iron golems too and we want them to
fall down to the Pigman below

834
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:23,530
fall down to the Pigman below
 

835
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:26,400
fall down to the Pigman below
so the that layer down there is where we

836
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,410
so the that layer down there is where we
 

837
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,990
so the that layer down there is where we
want the Pigman in the spawn and iron

838
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
want the Pigman in the spawn and iron
 

839
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,950
want the Pigman in the spawn and iron
golems up here here we go again

840
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
golems up here here we go again
 

841
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,120
golems up here here we go again
so I kind of want to watch this and see

842
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,130
so I kind of want to watch this and see
 

843
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,810
so I kind of want to watch this and see
if they can hit this guy in the middle

844
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:35,820
if they can hit this guy in the middle
 

845
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,160
if they can hit this guy in the middle
no they weren't able to okay good so

846
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,170
no they weren't able to okay good so
 

847
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,340
no they weren't able to okay good so
they're gonna fall down looks like they

848
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:41,350
they're gonna fall down looks like they
 

849
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,410
they're gonna fall down looks like they
can't reach they'll fall down they'll

850
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:43,420
can't reach they'll fall down they'll
 

851
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,180
can't reach they'll fall down they'll
get out of the way of these villagers 16

852
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,190
get out of the way of these villagers 16
 

853
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,210
get out of the way of these villagers 16
blocks away from them pretty quickly and

854
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:48,220
blocks away from them pretty quickly and
 

855
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,350
blocks away from them pretty quickly and
then they'll do their fighting down

856
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,360
then they'll do their fighting down
 

857
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,780
then they'll do their fighting down
below there instead of up high here we

858
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:51,790
below there instead of up high here we
 

859
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,700
below there instead of up high here we
got to pay a visit to our bulk storage

860
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:53,710
got to pay a visit to our bulk storage
 

861
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,460
got to pay a visit to our bulk storage
here our old bulk storage which is like

862
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,470
here our old bulk storage which is like
 

863
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,560
here our old bulk storage which is like
out of space that's why we need a new

864
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:58,570
out of space that's why we need a new
 

865
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,410
out of space that's why we need a new
one yeah this is where I keep a lot of

866
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:01,420
one yeah this is where I keep a lot of
 

867
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,130
one yeah this is where I keep a lot of
stuff mostly just cobblestone and stone

868
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:05,140
stuff mostly just cobblestone and stone
 

869
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,930
stuff mostly just cobblestone and stone
and stuff but I know we got some wool

870
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:06,940
and stuff but I know we got some wool
 

871
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,410
and stuff but I know we got some wool
here too don't we a lot of cobblestone

872
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:10,420
here too don't we a lot of cobblestone
 

873
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,970
here too don't we a lot of cobblestone
yeah there we go that's what I'm looking

874
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:11,980
yeah there we go that's what I'm looking
 

875
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,620
yeah there we go that's what I'm looking
for we want some whoa we got to make a

876
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:13,630
for we want some whoa we got to make a
 

877
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:18,150
for we want some whoa we got to make a
bunch carpet yeah they're not spotting

878
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
bunch carpet yeah they're not spotting
 

879
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,980
bunch carpet yeah they're not spotting
on the carpet I thought iron golems good

880
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:19,990
on the carpet I thought iron golems good
 

881
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,870
on the carpet I thought iron golems good
ah can you tell I don't do much with

882
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
ah can you tell I don't do much with
 

883
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,170
ah can you tell I don't do much with
iron golems alright we gotta get rid of

884
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:28,180
iron golems alright we gotta get rid of
 

885
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:35,540
iron golems alright we gotta get rid of
the carpet now it's not gonna work

886
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:35,550

 

887
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,940

so I read something or I heard something

888
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:38,950
so I read something or I heard something
 

889
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,130
so I read something or I heard something
before that iron golems could spawn on

890
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:41,140
before that iron golems could spawn on
 

891
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,710
before that iron golems could spawn on
glass if there was a block below that's

892
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:43,720
glass if there was a block below that's
 

893
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,150
glass if there was a block below that's
why I thought it would work with carpets

894
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,160
why I thought it would work with carpets
 

895
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,970
why I thought it would work with carpets
as well but apparently both those things

896
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:47,980
as well but apparently both those things
 

897
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,550
as well but apparently both those things
aren't true oh no I can't get them to

898
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:50,560
aren't true oh no I can't get them to
 

899
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,760
aren't true oh no I can't get them to
spawn glass so I think I might have been

900
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:53,770
spawn glass so I think I might have been
 

901
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,950
spawn glass so I think I might have been
duped the other problem with this is if

902
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:55,960
duped the other problem with this is if
 

903
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,900
duped the other problem with this is if
they target this guy and they fall down

904
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:57,910
they target this guy and they fall down
 

905
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,090
they target this guy and they fall down
you see they're surrounded by zombie

906
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:00,100
you see they're surrounded by zombie
 

907
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,560
you see they're surrounded by zombie
Pigman but they won't fight them because

908
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:01,570
Pigman but they won't fight them because
 

909
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:17,950
Pigman but they won't fight them because
they're locked on target with this guy

910
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:17,960

 

911
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,010

hey how's it going things good with you

912
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,020
hey how's it going things good with you
 

913
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,150
hey how's it going things good with you
things are going all right with me

914
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:23,160
things are going all right with me
 

915
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,220
things are going all right with me
things are progressing you know we're

916
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,230
things are progressing you know we're
 

917
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,990
things are progressing you know we're
making some good progress on this build

918
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,000
making some good progress on this build
 

919
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,960
making some good progress on this build
so I'm underneath the spotting platform

920
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:29,970
so I'm underneath the spotting platform
 

921
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,310
so I'm underneath the spotting platform
the new one we're building for the

922
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:31,320
the new one we're building for the
 

923
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,530
the new one we're building for the
zombie pigmen and I got to move the

924
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:33,540
zombie pigmen and I got to move the
 

925
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,660
zombie pigmen and I got to move the
collection system so I'm tearing it out

926
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:35,670
collection system so I'm tearing it out
 

927
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,240
collection system so I'm tearing it out
up above and we're building it down

928
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,250
up above and we're building it down
 

929
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,030
up above and we're building it down
below here I put in a layer of the salts

930
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,040
below here I put in a layer of the salts
 

931
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,920
below here I put in a layer of the salts
we got shroom lights surrounding us

932
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:42,930
we got shroom lights surrounding us
 

933
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,830
we got shroom lights surrounding us
magma blocks above us and now I got to

934
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
magma blocks above us and now I got to
 

935
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,650
magma blocks above us and now I got to
go through here put down the rails for

936
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:48,660
go through here put down the rails for
 

937
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:54,140
go through here put down the rails for
the Mahavir minecart this every so often

938
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:54,150
the Mahavir minecart this every so often
 

939
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,440
the Mahavir minecart this every so often
we got to put some power rails in if you

940
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,450
we got to put some power rails in if you
 

941
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,300
we got to put some power rails in if you
find yourself in an odd situation like

942
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,310
find yourself in an odd situation like
 

943
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,550
find yourself in an odd situation like
this I've kind of learned a couple

944
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:00,560
this I've kind of learned a couple
 

945
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,710
this I've kind of learned a couple
couple little tricks with it so if you

946
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:03,720
couple little tricks with it so if you
 

947
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,590
couple little tricks with it so if you
want to move quickly you gotta light

948
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:06,600
want to move quickly you gotta light
 

949
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,570
want to move quickly you gotta light
your wings you got you got a jump if you

950
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:08,580
your wings you got you got a jump if you
 

951
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,100
your wings you got you got a jump if you
jump you can kind of move a little a

952
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,110
jump you can kind of move a little a
 

953
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,930
jump you can kind of move a little a
little faster you can't also enderpearl

954
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:11,940
little faster you can't also enderpearl
 

955
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,610
little faster you can't also enderpearl
when you're when you're like this it's

956
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:13,620
when you're when you're like this it's
 

957
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,570
when you're when you're like this it's
kind of nice you know

958
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:14,580
kind of nice you know
 

959
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,820
kind of nice you know
all right everybody so check it out I

960
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:16,830
all right everybody so check it out I
 

961
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,680
all right everybody so check it out I
think we've got the goon firm pretty

962
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:18,690
think we've got the goon firm pretty
 

963
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:23,210
think we've got the goon firm pretty
much all built for today anyways oh yeah

964
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:23,220
much all built for today anyways oh yeah
 

965
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,800
much all built for today anyways oh yeah
there we go we got some iron golems we

966
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:24,810
there we go we got some iron golems we
 

967
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,870
there we go we got some iron golems we
got I think seven that time so it's not

968
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
got I think seven that time so it's not
 

969
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,180
got I think seven that time so it's not
always eight but usually it's it's

970
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,190
always eight but usually it's it's
 

971
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,320
always eight but usually it's it's
pretty good um yeah I think it's pretty

972
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,330
pretty good um yeah I think it's pretty
 

973
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,580
pretty good um yeah I think it's pretty
much all built but we might need to do

974
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:34,590
much all built but we might need to do
 

975
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,960
much all built but we might need to do
some fine-tuning with it I'm still

976
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:35,970
some fine-tuning with it I'm still
 

977
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,010
some fine-tuning with it I'm still
messing with a few things so one thing

978
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,020
messing with a few things so one thing
 

979
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,110
messing with a few things so one thing
you'll notice first off here is I shrunk

980
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,120
you'll notice first off here is I shrunk
 

981
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
you'll notice first off here is I shrunk
the platform at the top here it used to

982
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,130
the platform at the top here it used to
 

983
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,950
the platform at the top here it used to
stick out all the way up to that edge Oh

984
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:45,960
stick out all the way up to that edge Oh
 

985
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,380
stick out all the way up to that edge Oh
down below there and I think I shaved

986
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,390
down below there and I think I shaved
 

987
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,030
down below there and I think I shaved
off three or four blocks all around the

988
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,040
off three or four blocks all around the
 

989
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,770
off three or four blocks all around the
perimeter that is so that when iron

990
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:51,780
perimeter that is so that when iron
 

991
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,320
perimeter that is so that when iron
golems spawn up here they will see the

992
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,330
golems spawn up here they will see the
 

993
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,900
golems spawn up here they will see the
center of attention right away if they

994
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:56,910
center of attention right away if they
 

995
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,910
center of attention right away if they
are beyond this border here sometimes

996
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:58,920
are beyond this border here sometimes
 

997
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,560
are beyond this border here sometimes
they couldn't see him and they would

998
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:00,570
they couldn't see him and they would
 

999
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,930
they couldn't see him and they would
just wander around this way they see him

1000
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:02,940
just wander around this way they see him
 

1001
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,520
just wander around this way they see him
they get off the platform as quick as

1002
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:04,530
they get off the platform as quick as
 

1003
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,190
they get off the platform as quick as
possible now we also had an issue where

1004
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
possible now we also had an issue where
 

1005
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,020
possible now we also had an issue where
the iron golems would see the center of

1006
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,030
the iron golems would see the center of
 

1007
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,910
the iron golems would see the center of
attention they would fall down there and

1008
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:10,920
attention they would fall down there and
 

1009
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,440
attention they would fall down there and
then they would still want to attack

1010
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:12,450
then they would still want to attack
 

1011
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,750
then they would still want to attack
that guy the way I solved that was by

1012
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:14,760
that guy the way I solved that was by
 

1013
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,220
that guy the way I solved that was by
lowering that platform down there

1014
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:16,230
lowering that platform down there
 

1015
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,840
lowering that platform down there
another two blocks down you see like

1016
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:20,850
another two blocks down you see like
 

1017
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,430
another two blocks down you see like
they went to that guy but now they're

1018
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:22,440
they went to that guy but now they're
 

1019
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,529
they went to that guy but now they're
fighting the guys down there

1020
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:23,539
fighting the guys down there
 

1021
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:25,960
fighting the guys down there
it's okay that's because they fall over

1022
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:25,970
it's okay that's because they fall over
 

1023
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,359
it's okay that's because they fall over
16 blocks away from the center of

1024
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:28,369
16 blocks away from the center of
 

1025
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:28,930
16 blocks away from the center of
attention

1026
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:28,940
attention
 

1027
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,389
attention
that means he's outside of their target

1028
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:31,399
that means he's outside of their target
 

1029
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:32,769
that means he's outside of their target
range and then they find a new target

1030
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:32,779
range and then they find a new target
 

1031
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:35,950
range and then they find a new target
that way so unfortunately we did not get

1032
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:35,960
that way so unfortunately we did not get
 

1033
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,749
that way so unfortunately we did not get
this down to 42nd waves though like I

1034
00:21:37,749 --> 00:21:37,759
this down to 42nd waves though like I
 

1035
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,029
this down to 42nd waves though like I
wanted I think it's that 55 second waves

1036
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:40,039
wanted I think it's that 55 second waves
 

1037
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,419
wanted I think it's that 55 second waves
at the moment we got 68 items in the

1038
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:43,429
at the moment we got 68 items in the
 

1039
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:45,820
at the moment we got 68 items in the
hopper clock but this might be something

1040
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:45,830
hopper clock but this might be something
 

1041
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,159
hopper clock but this might be something
I find tuned a little bit better might

1042
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:48,169
I find tuned a little bit better might
 

1043
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:51,159
I find tuned a little bit better might
be making some adjustments on that but

1044
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:51,169
be making some adjustments on that but
 

1045
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:52,659
be making some adjustments on that but
as it is right now it's pretty good I

1046
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:52,669
as it is right now it's pretty good I
 

1047
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:54,519
as it is right now it's pretty good I
think it's about twice as quick as what

1048
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:54,529
think it's about twice as quick as what
 

1049
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:57,039
think it's about twice as quick as what
we had originally so that's cool that's

1050
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:57,049
we had originally so that's cool that's
 

1051
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:57,549
we had originally so that's cool that's
cool

1052
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:57,559
cool
 

1053
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,200
cool
let's go take a look from over here and

1054
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,210
let's go take a look from over here and
 

1055
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,499
let's go take a look from over here and
get an idea what the farm looks like so

1056
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:02,509
get an idea what the farm looks like so
 

1057
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:04,299
get an idea what the farm looks like so
yeah the top layers for the iron golems

1058
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:04,309
yeah the top layers for the iron golems
 

1059
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:06,129
yeah the top layers for the iron golems
bottom layers for the zombie pigmen and

1060
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:06,139
bottom layers for the zombie pigmen and
 

1061
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:10,690
bottom layers for the zombie pigmen and
the gas and stuff the iron golems they

1062
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:10,700
the gas and stuff the iron golems they
 

1063
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,019
the gas and stuff the iron golems they
definitely could be ramped up like if

1064
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:14,029
definitely could be ramped up like if
 

1065
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:15,249
definitely could be ramped up like if
you wanted to make this farm a lot

1066
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:15,259
you wanted to make this farm a lot
 

1067
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,289
you wanted to make this farm a lot
better double the number of villagers

1068
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:17,299
better double the number of villagers
 

1069
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:19,029
better double the number of villagers
double the number of iron golems look

1070
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,039
double the number of iron golems look
 

1071
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,359
double the number of iron golems look
you can get 16 per wave oh man that's

1072
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:22,369
you can get 16 per wave oh man that's
 

1073
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:24,940
you can get 16 per wave oh man that's
this thing would be crazy yeah check

1074
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:24,950
this thing would be crazy yeah check
 

1075
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,560
this thing would be crazy yeah check
that out looks good

1076
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:26,570
that out looks good
 

1077
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,359
that out looks good
go to the center of attention they fall

1078
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:28,369
go to the center of attention they fall
 

1079
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:31,149
go to the center of attention they fall
down they find a new target all the

1080
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:31,159
down they find a new target all the
 

1081
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:34,599
down they find a new target all the
zombie pigmen rush to the middle if they

1082
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:34,609
zombie pigmen rush to the middle if they
 

1083
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:38,200
zombie pigmen rush to the middle if they
get scattered and like as soon as they

1084
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,210
get scattered and like as soon as they
 

1085
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,909
get scattered and like as soon as they
fall down they're 30 seconds after that

1086
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:39,919
fall down they're 30 seconds after that
 

1087
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,859
fall down they're 30 seconds after that
then we can spawn a new wave of iron

1088
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:41,869
then we can spawn a new wave of iron
 

1089
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:44,469
then we can spawn a new wave of iron
golem so that's pretty cool and you see

1090
00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:44,479
golem so that's pretty cool and you see
 

1091
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:46,899
golem so that's pretty cool and you see
we got a hopper minecart system running

1092
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:46,909
we got a hopper minecart system running
 

1093
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:49,690
we got a hopper minecart system running
right now so that just picked up a bunch

1094
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:49,700
right now so that just picked up a bunch
 

1095
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,289
right now so that just picked up a bunch
of stuff we got item filters here so

1096
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:53,299
of stuff we got item filters here so
 

1097
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:55,599
of stuff we got item filters here so
when this hopper minecart takes off it

1098
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:55,609
when this hopper minecart takes off it
 

1099
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:57,519
when this hopper minecart takes off it
passes by these five hoppers this one

1100
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:57,529
passes by these five hoppers this one
 

1101
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:59,830
passes by these five hoppers this one
puts a one piece of gold in this one put

1102
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840

automatically unloads once it's done it

1116
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:17,869
automatically unloads once it's done it
 

1117

takes off we also have a second hopper

1118
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:19,669
takes off we also have a second hopper
 

1119
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:24,099

minecart going this one as it arrives it

1120
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:24,109
minecart going this one as it arrives it
 

1121
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:26,200
minecart going this one as it arrives it
sends a pulse to this thing so if the

1122
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,210
sends a pulse to this thing so if the
 

1123
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,269
sends a pulse to this thing so if the
other one is sitting here it gets out of

1124
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:28,279
other one is sitting here it gets out of
 

1125
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,769
other one is sitting here it gets out of
the way and then this one takes its

1126
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:29,779
the way and then this one takes its
 

1127
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:31,330
the way and then this one takes its
place yeah so this is what it looks like

1128
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:31,340
place yeah so this is what it looks like
 

1129
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,950
place yeah so this is what it looks like

pick up the items through the magma box
 

1135
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,270

here

1136
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,280
here
 

1137
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,980
here
according to their filter that we set

1138
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:38,990
according to their filter that we set
 

1139
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,680
according to their filter that we set
with these hoppers as they each put one

1140
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:41,690
with these hoppers as they each put one
 

1141
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,190
with these hoppers as they each put one
item in um and then on the return trip I

1142
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,200
item in um and then on the return trip I
 

1143
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,530
item in um and then on the return trip I
made it so that the hopper minecart

1144
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:47,540
made it so that the hopper minecart
 

1145
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,390
made it so that the hopper minecart
passes over top of these filters so that

1146
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
passes over top of these filters so that
 

1147
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,340
passes over top of these filters so that
drops off at least one item back into

1148
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:54,350
drops off at least one item back into
 

1149
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,690
drops off at least one item back into
here and that way we never need to

1150
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:55,700
here and that way we never need to
 

1151
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,670
here and that way we never need to
refill these it's all automatic now

1152
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:57,680
refill these it's all automatic now
 

1153
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,360
refill these it's all automatic now

too so I used basalt and shroom lights
 

1175
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,160
too so I used basalt and shroom lights
and magma blocks I like it I think that

1176
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,170
and magma blocks I like it I think that
 

1177
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,320
and magma blocks I like it I think that
looks way cooler than it used to

1178

with this farm it doesn't work optimally

1210
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:21,410
with this farm it doesn't work optimally
 

1211
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:24,550
with this farm it doesn't work optimally
if I'm down here or if I'm on the

1212
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:24,560
if I'm down here or if I'm on the

platform on the side they're observing
 

1215
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,680
platform on the side they're observing
it we actually have to stand over here

1216
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:28,690
it we actually have to stand over here
 

1217
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,690
it we actually have to stand over here
because otherwise we get the odd zombie

1218

then when the iron golems spawn they'll

1222
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:35,810
then when the iron golems spawn they'll
 

1223
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,260
then when the iron golems spawn they'll
want to fight these guys up here instead

so because that carpet trick didn't work
 

1229
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,100
so because that carpet trick didn't work
or putting glass overtop we I don't know

1230
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,110
or putting glass overtop we I don't know
 

1231
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,690
or putting glass overtop we I don't know
how to stop these guys from spawning

1232
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:46,700
how to stop these guys from spawning
 

1233
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,860
how to stop these guys from spawning
besides just standing here

1234
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:48,870
besides just standing here
 

1235
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,350
besides just standing here
if we stand here they won't spawn but

1236
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
if we stand here they won't spawn but
 

1237
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,990
if we stand here they won't spawn but
iron golem still will and I think with

1238
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,000
iron golem still will and I think with
 

1239
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,430
iron golem still will and I think with
that guys it's about time we wrap up

that guys it's about time we wrap up
this episode for today which is a bit

1242
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:57,510
this episode for today which is a bit
 

1243
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,510
this episode for today which is a bit
unfortunate because I had some big plans

for the Crimson keep I thought we would
 

1247
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,350
for the Crimson keep I thought we would
get today but that'll have to wait until

1248
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,360
get today but that'll have to wait until
 

1249
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,880
get today but that'll have to wait until
next time we'll probably get a lot done

1250

redstone devices and that sort of thing
 

1287
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,940
redstone devices and that sort of thing
and that that stuff takes forever like

1288
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:55,950
and that that stuff takes forever like
 

1289
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,080
and that that stuff takes forever like
so much time

1290
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,090
so much time
 

1291
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,480
so much time
you gotta come up with an idea you got a

1292
00:26:59,480 --> 00:26:59,490
you gotta come up with an idea you got a
 

1293
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,580
you gotta come up with an idea you got a
you got to build it and test it and then

1294
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:01,590
you got to build it and test it and then
 

1295
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,310
you got to build it and test it and then
optimize it and then you experience

1296
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
optimize it and then you experience
 

1297
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,740
optimize it and then you experience
twenty other problems on the way you got

1298
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:06,750
twenty other problems on the way you got
 

1299
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,200
twenty other problems on the way you got
to fix all those and then you gotta

1300
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,210
to fix all those and then you gotta
 

1301
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,090
to fix all those and then you gotta
collect the resources to build it so

1302
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:11,100
collect the resources to build it so
 

1303
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,130
collect the resources to build it so
that's another that's probably second

1304
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:13,140
that's another that's probably second
 

1305
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,590
that's another that's probably second
most time-consuming thing and then comes

1306
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
most time-consuming thing and then comes
 

1307
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,419
most time-consuming thing and then comes
the building then comes filming then

1308
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:17,429
the building then comes filming then
 

1309
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,130
the building then comes filming then
comes editing in that order I would say

1310
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:19,140
comes editing in that order I would say
 

1311
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,230
comes editing in that order I would say
editing is still probably the quickest

1312
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:21,240
editing is still probably the quickest
 

1313
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,649
editing is still probably the quickest
part of making my episodes our episodes

1314
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:24,659
part of making my episodes our episodes
 

1315
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,630
part of making my episodes our episodes
only ever a day of playing they used to

1316
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:26,640
only ever a day of playing they used to
 

1317
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,250
only ever a day of playing they used to
be like in the past I used to record

1318
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:28,260

like two or three in a day sometimes
 

1321
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:31,850

even it depends a lot on the series

1322
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:31,860
even it depends a lot on the series
 

1323
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,080
even it depends a lot on the series

punk or enigmatic on number two i can
 

1327
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,100
punk or enigmatic on number two i can
almost always record an episode of that

1328
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,110
almost always record an episode of that
 

1329
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,620
almost always record an episode of that
in a single day but like the let's play

00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:39,630
in a single day but like the let's play
 

1331
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,600
in a single day but like the let's play
series here it's very rare that i get it

1332
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:41,610
series here it's very rare that i get it
 

1333
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,840
series here it's very rare that i get it
done in a day it's usually at least two

1334
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:43,850
done in a day it's usually at least two
 

1335
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,399

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:46,409
in this case i've been recording this
 

1337
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:48,019
in this case i've been recording this
episode over four or five days now i

1379
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,860
others I'll usually try to record it a
