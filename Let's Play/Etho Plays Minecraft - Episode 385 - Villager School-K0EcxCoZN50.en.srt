looking at it you probably don't like it
 

161
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:33,870
looking at it you probably don't like it
because as it is right now this village

162
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:33,880
because as it is right now this village
 

163
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,269
because as it is right now this village
there's a lot of like plain empty spots

164
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:36,279
there's a lot of like plain empty spots
 

165
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,640
there's a lot of like plain empty spots
that look pretty clean and the path

166
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:38,650
that look pretty clean and the path
 

167
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,080
that look pretty clean and the path
looks really rough right but as as I

168
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,090
looks really rough right but as as I
 

169
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,390
looks really rough right but as as I
polish this it's it seems weird saying

170
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:45,400
polish this it's it seems weird saying
 

171
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,769
polish this it's it seems weird saying
polish because I'm actually making it

172
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:46,779
polish because I'm actually making it
 

173
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:50,640
polish because I'm actually making it
look more messy but as I add more mess

174
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:50,650
look more messy but as I add more mess
 

175
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,769
look more messy but as I add more mess
to the village I think this path will

176
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:52,779
to the village I think this path will
 

177
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:55,370
to the village I think this path will
suit it better than it looks right now

178
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:55,380
suit it better than it looks right now
 

179
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,930
suit it better than it looks right now
but if not I'll change it okay so second

180
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:00,940
but if not I'll change it okay so second
 

181
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,209
but if not I'll change it okay so second
thing we're going to do we got all these

182
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:03,219
thing we're going to do we got all these
 

183
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,310
thing we're going to do we got all these
flower boxes by the houses like these

184
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,320
flower boxes by the houses like these
 

185
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,219
flower boxes by the houses like these
here I think it's time we update these

186
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:08,229
here I think it's time we update these
 

187
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:11,730
here I think it's time we update these
so we have coarse dirts nowadays we

188
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:11,740
so we have coarse dirts nowadays we
 

189
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,490
so we have coarse dirts nowadays we
don't have to use regular dirts because

190
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:14,500
don't have to use regular dirts because
 

191
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,129
don't have to use regular dirts because
it keeps getting grass grown on it so

192
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:17,139
it keeps getting grass grown on it so
 

193
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,260
it keeps getting grass grown on it so
we'll change that out I'm also not a

194
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,270
we'll change that out I'm also not a
 

195
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,810
we'll change that out I'm also not a
huge fan of the yellow and red flowers

196
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:21,820
huge fan of the yellow and red flowers
 

197
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,980
huge fan of the yellow and red flowers

199
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,350
anymore never really really like them
either like in the past but it's all we

200
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:28,360
either like in the past but it's all we
 

201
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,879
either like in the past but it's all we
had but now we have all these nice new

202
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:29,889
had but now we have all these nice new
 

203
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,570
had but now we have all these nice new
flowers and probably my favorite are the

204
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:33,580
flowers and probably my favorite are the
 

205
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,959
flowers and probably my favorite are the
pink and white tulips and the oxide

206
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:36,969
pink and white tulips and the oxide
 

207
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:41,129
pink and white tulips and the oxide
daisies in areas like this so where we

208
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:41,139
daisies in areas like this so where we
 

209
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:43,800
daisies in areas like this so where we
have the desert grass I find the orange

210
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:43,810
have the desert grass I find the orange
 

211
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,010
have the desert grass I find the orange
flowers look really good and maybe red

212
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,020
flowers look really good and maybe red
 

213
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,420
flowers look really good and maybe red
ones so we'll probably do that but then

214
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:51,430
ones so we'll probably do that but then
 

215
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,629
ones so we'll probably do that but then
these areas like over here I'm going to

216
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
these areas like over here I'm going to
 

217
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,439
these areas like over here I'm going to
put the pink in why

218
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:55,449
put the pink in why
 

219
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:59,429
put the pink in why
once I decided it probably makes more

220
00:05:59,429 --> 00:05:59,439
once I decided it probably makes more
 

221
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,499
once I decided it probably makes more
sense to match the flowers to the

222
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:01,509
sense to match the flowers to the
 

223
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:02,939
sense to match the flowers to the
building so we kind of got reddish

224
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:02,949
building so we kind of got reddish
 

225
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:05,459
building so we kind of got reddish
flowers by the red building blue flowers

226
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:05,469
flowers by the red building blue flowers
 

227
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:09,059
flowers by the red building blue flowers

by the blue one and green stems by the
 

229
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,899
by the blue one and green stems by the
green building sure okay next thing

230
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:12,909
green building sure okay next thing
 

231
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:16,049
green building sure okay next thing
we're going to do they use the orange

232
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:16,059
we're going to do they use the orange
 

233
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:18,629
we're going to do they use the orange
building actually like they're able to

234
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
building actually like they're able to
 

235
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,040
building actually like they're able to
find their way up this tiny little

236
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,050
find their way up this tiny little
 

237
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,820
find their way up this tiny little
walkway look we're going to change the

238
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:23,830
walkway look we're going to change the
 

239
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,640
walkway look we're going to change the
layout a little bit here let's move this

240
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:26,650
layout a little bit here let's move this
 

241
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:32,670
layout a little bit here let's move this
back one block I think yeah let's have

242
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:32,680
back one block I think yeah let's have
 

243
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,070
back one block I think yeah let's have
like a two wide walkway here and then

244
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,080
like a two wide walkway here and then
 

245
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,100
like a two wide walkway here and then
we'll let's use dark oak dark oak over

246
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,110
we'll let's use dark oak dark oak over
 

247
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,420
we'll let's use dark oak dark oak over
here originally I had like carrots and

248
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:42,430
here originally I had like carrots and
 

249
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,589
here originally I had like carrots and
stuff growing here but they always

250
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:43,599
stuff growing here but they always
 

251
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,070
stuff growing here but they always
trampled those so no point really

252
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,080
trampled those so no point really
 

253
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,170
trampled those so no point really
keeping them there we should set up a

254
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:49,180
keeping them there we should set up a
 

255
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:56,480
keeping them there we should set up a
proper farm somewhere else oh oh okay I

256
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,490
proper farm somewhere else oh oh okay I
 

257
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,179
proper farm somewhere else oh oh okay I
hit some water apparently oh and there

258
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:00,189
hit some water apparently oh and there
 

259
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:01,679
hit some water apparently oh and there
goes all the torches I'll have to fix

260
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:01,689
goes all the torches I'll have to fix
 

261
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:07,589
goes all the torches I'll have to fix
that but here let's maybe position this

262
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
that but here let's maybe position this
 

263
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:30,070
that but here let's maybe position this
like that

264
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080

 

265
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,540

cool so check this out guys we got a

266
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:32,550
cool so check this out guys we got a
 

267
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,730
cool so check this out guys we got a
much nicer way of getting to the orange

268
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:34,740
much nicer way of getting to the orange
 

269
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,510
much nicer way of getting to the orange
building now nice walkway here and if we

270
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:38,520
building now nice walkway here and if we
 

271
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,219
building now nice walkway here and if we
want to expand the village this is a

272
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:40,229
want to expand the village this is a
 

273
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:42,110
want to expand the village this is a
perfect spot I think we'll take out this

274
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,120
perfect spot I think we'll take out this
 

275
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,050
perfect spot I think we'll take out this
wall and there's even some cave back

276
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,060
wall and there's even some cave back
 

277
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,080
wall and there's even some cave back
here so we'll expand out that way so

278
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,090
here so we'll expand out that way so
 

279
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,409
here so we'll expand out that way so
that gives us over this way that that

280
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:51,419
that gives us over this way that that
 

281
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,019
that gives us over this way that that
wall there we could expand out and maybe

282
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:54,029
wall there we could expand out and maybe
 

283
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:57,379
wall there we could expand out and maybe
I think we'll move mr. villager chief

284
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:57,389
I think we'll move mr. villager chief
 

285
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,360
I think we'll move mr. villager chief
here we're not going to get rid of him

286
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,370
here we're not going to get rid of him
 

287
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,339
here we're not going to get rid of him
but we'll move him I want to put him in

288
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:01,349
but we'll move him I want to put him in
 

289
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:04,279
but we'll move him I want to put him in
the ceiling and he'll look down on the

290
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:04,289
the ceiling and he'll look down on the
 

291
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:07,429
the ceiling and he'll look down on the
village I think I think that's a better

292
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:07,439
village I think I think that's a better
 

293
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,990
village I think I think that's a better
spot because he's kind of in the way

294
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,000
spot because he's kind of in the way
 

295
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,019
spot because he's kind of in the way
here actually because we can't really go

296
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:12,029
here actually because we can't really go
 

297
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:14,149
here actually because we can't really go
out any further he takes up the whole

298
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:14,159
out any further he takes up the whole
 

299
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:17,719
out any further he takes up the whole
wall all right well this is what it

300
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:17,729
wall all right well this is what it
 

301
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,230
wall all right well this is what it
looks like now he's a little bit creepy

302
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,240
looks like now he's a little bit creepy
 

303
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,649
looks like now he's a little bit creepy
up there but I think it's pretty good

304
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:23,659
up there but I think it's pretty good
 

305
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:26,420
up there but I think it's pretty good
what I should probably do though is

306
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:26,430
what I should probably do though is
 

307
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,929
what I should probably do though is
maybe raise them up very creepy indeed

308
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:29,939
maybe raise them up very creepy indeed
 

309
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:32,089
maybe raise them up very creepy indeed
maybe raise them two or three more

310
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:32,099
maybe raise them two or three more
 

311
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,430
maybe raise them two or three more
blocks higher I don't like how you can

312
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:34,440
blocks higher I don't like how you can
 

313
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,159
blocks higher I don't like how you can

them a little bit higher and then I'll I

318
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:43,589
them a little bit higher and then I'll I
 

319
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,949
them a little bit higher and then I'll I
think it will make a dome ceiling and

320
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:45,959
think it will make a dome ceiling and
 

321
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,650
think it will make a dome ceiling and
really highlight them and make this a

322
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:48,660
really highlight them and make this a
 

323
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,829
really highlight them and make this a
pretty big intersection type of thing

324
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:50,839
pretty big intersection type of thing
 

325
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,769
pretty big intersection type of thing
would be cool but not today what we'll

326
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:54,779
would be cool but not today what we'll
 

327
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,130
would be cool but not today what we'll
do next we got all these baby villagers

328
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:58,140
do next we got all these baby villagers
 

329
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,069
do next we got all these baby villagers
running around what we did

330
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:01,079
running around what we did
 

331
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:04,790
running around what we did
I think they grew up oh there's one

332
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
I think they grew up oh there's one
 

333
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,870
I think they grew up oh there's one
I want to make like a school for them

334
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:07,880
I want to make like a school for them
 

335
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,560
I want to make like a school for them
basically a special house just for them

336
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:11,570
basically a special house just for them
 

337
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,910
basically a special house just for them
that only they can enter and I'm think I

338
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:16,920
that only they can enter and I'm think I
 

339
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,530
that only they can enter and I'm think I
want them to get trapped in it so I know

340
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:18,540
want them to get trapped in it so I know
 

341
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,689
want them to get trapped in it so I know
what the new villagers are when they

342
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:20,699
what the new villagers are when they
 

343
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:23,720
what the new villagers are when they
grow up because they mix up with the

344
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:23,730
grow up because they mix up with the
 

345
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,040
grow up because they mix up with the
other ones and then I have a hard time

346
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,050
other ones and then I have a hard time
 

347
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,720
other ones and then I have a hard time
finding the new guys so let's hop into

348
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:28,730
finding the new guys so let's hop into
 

349
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,189
finding the new guys so let's hop into
creative world and we'll just experiment

350
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:31,199
creative world and we'll just experiment
 

351
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:34,939
creative world and we'll just experiment
with that idea yeah okay so I just want

352
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:34,949
with that idea yeah okay so I just want
 

353
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,630
with that idea yeah okay so I just want
to try test something with their AI I'm

354
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
to try test something with their AI I'm
 

355
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,150
to try test something with their AI I'm
not sure if this will work or not we're

356
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,160
not sure if this will work or not we're
 

357
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,020
not sure if this will work or not we're
going to make a

358
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,030
going to make a
 

359
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,960
going to make a
fake villager house here then hopefully

360
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:44,970
fake villager house here then hopefully
 

361
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,510
fake villager house here then hopefully
they go into and I think that's probably

362
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:50,520
they go into and I think that's probably
 

363
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,870
they go into and I think that's probably
big enough right so let's try this out

364
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:53,880
big enough right so let's try this out
 

365
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,690
big enough right so let's try this out
first I'm going to set up a villager

366
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:55,700
first I'm going to set up a villager
 

367
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,090

Phil ledger and we'll make it nighttime

368
00:09:59,090 --> 00:09:59,100
Phil ledger and we'll make it nighttime
 

369

there we go and we'll block the front
with one block and I want to see if

380
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
with one block and I want to see if
 

381
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,850
with one block and I want to see if
they'll go through that door still

382
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:24,860

 

383
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,740

alright time to go inside oh come on

384
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:30,750
alright time to go inside oh come on
 

385
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,230
alright time to go inside oh come on
guys get inside the building it looks

386
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
guys get inside the building it looks
 

387
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,230
guys get inside the building it looks
like it's not going to work come on if I

388
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
like it's not going to work come on if I
 

389
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,640
like it's not going to work come on if I
remove the block or they all are going

390
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:43,650
remove the block or they all are going
 

391
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,280
remove the block or they all are going
to run in then where are they going

392
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,290
to run in then where are they going
 

393
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,240
to run in then where are they going
they're trying to go somewhere

394
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,250
they're trying to go somewhere
 

395
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,380
they're trying to go somewhere
oh they see the house I think but they

396
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:51,390
oh they see the house I think but they
 

397
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,600
oh they see the house I think but they
can't figure out how to get inside I

398
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:55,610

 

399
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:04,040

remove it nope I think maybe the

400
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,050
remove it nope I think maybe the
 

401
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,750
remove it nope I think maybe the
building is just too small because even

402
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
building is just too small because even
 

403
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,980
building is just too small because even
without the block there they're not

404
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:06,990
without the block there they're not
 

405
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,460
without the block there they're not
going inside they keep running to the

406
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:10,470
going inside they keep running to the
 

407
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:15,820
going inside they keep running to the
back ok I'll make it bigger

408
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:15,830
back ok I'll make it bigger
 

409
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,800
back ok I'll make it bigger
ok let's try it again times it's

410
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:18,810
ok let's try it again times it's
 

411
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,720
ok let's try it again times it's
nighttime everybody inside

412
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:22,730
nighttime everybody inside
 

413
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,600
nighttime everybody inside
ok the little guy got in yeah it does

414
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:26,610
ok the little guy got in yeah it does
 

415
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,870
ok the little guy got in yeah it does
work ok cool the big guy can't get in as

416
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:29,880
work ok cool the big guy can't get in as
 

417
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,280
work ok cool the big guy can't get in as
much as he tries well it's still a work

418
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,290
much as he tries well it's still a work
 

419
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,740
much as he tries well it's still a work
in progress guys but our village now has

420
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:36,750
in progress guys but our village now has
 

421
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,100
in progress guys but our village now has
a school somewhere for the little guys

422
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,110
a school somewhere for the little guys
 

423
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,520
a school somewhere for the little guys
to be bored during the day that's right

424
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:42,530
to be bored during the day that's right
 

425
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,960
to be bored during the day that's right
so this is the front of it not totally

426
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:44,970
so this is the front of it not totally
 

427
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,580
so this is the front of it not totally
happy with this front I'll probably

428
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:46,590
happy with this front I'll probably
 

429
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,680
happy with this front I'll probably
change it but I I do like the little

430
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:48,690
change it but I I do like the little
 

431
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,740
change it but I I do like the little
door currently there's only one way in

432
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:51,750
door currently there's only one way in
 

433
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,840
door currently there's only one way in
and out and I have to use enderpearls

434
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:55,850
and out and I have to use enderpearls
 

435
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,800
and out and I have to use enderpearls
but inside we have a classroom with the

436
00:11:59,800 --> 00:11:59,810
but inside we have a classroom with the
 

437
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,340
but inside we have a classroom with the
blackboard or the or the green board or

438
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,350
blackboard or the or the green board or
 

439
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,780
blackboard or the or the green board or
whatever board the board that makes you

440
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:04,790
whatever board the board that makes you
 

441
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,439
whatever board the board that makes you
bored at school a couple bookshelves in

442
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:08,449
bored at school a couple bookshelves in
 

443
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:11,230
bored at school a couple bookshelves in
here and I think all along the top I'm

444
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,240
here and I think all along the top I'm
 

445
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,030
here and I think all along the top I'm
going to put wood okay so the plan with

446
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,040
going to put wood okay so the plan with
 

447
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,340
going to put wood okay so the plan with
the school here like the little guys

448
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,350
the school here like the little guys
 

449
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,660
the school here like the little guys
will run in here and then there's a

450
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:19,670
will run in here and then there's a
 

451
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,639
will run in here and then there's a
chance they're gonna grow up and then

452
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:21,649
chance they're gonna grow up and then
 

453
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:25,090
chance they're gonna grow up and then
they'll be stuck in here so we have to

454
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,100
they'll be stuck in here so we have to
 

455
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,189
they'll be stuck in here so we have to
think of something to do with them right

456
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:27,199
think of something to do with them right
 

457
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:30,220
think of something to do with them right
how do we get them out so we'll probably

458
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,230
how do we get them out so we'll probably
 

459
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,910
how do we get them out so we'll probably
have one water elevator if they did did

460
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
have one water elevator if they did did
 

461
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,460
have one water elevator if they did did
well in school and they learn how to do

462
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,470
well in school and they learn how to do
 

463
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,610
well in school and they learn how to do
good trades they'll probably go on to a

464
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:39,620
good trades they'll probably go on to a
 

465
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,639
good trades they'll probably go on to a
good life back in the village if they

466
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:42,649
good life back in the village if they
 

467
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:44,680
good life back in the village if they
were bad at school and they learnt bad

468
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:44,690
were bad at school and they learnt bad
 

469
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,199
were bad at school and they learnt bad
trades there'll be another water

470
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:47,209
trades there'll be another water
 

471
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,790
trades there'll be another water
elevator that'll probably take them up

472
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
elevator that'll probably take them up
 

473
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,590
elevator that'll probably take them up
to the surface and they'll have to fend

474
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:50,600
to the surface and they'll have to fend
 

475
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,889
to the surface and they'll have to fend
for themselves out in the hostile world

it might be a shorter episode I have not
 

535
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,500
it might be a shorter episode I have not
figured out this new schedule too well

536
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:18,510
figured out this new schedule too well
 

537
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,740
figured out this new schedule too well
all right so let's move on to something

538
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:22,750
all right so let's move on to something
 

539
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,290
all right so let's move on to something
else and try get something else going

540
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:25,300
else and try get something else going
 

541
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,970
else and try get something else going
here I want to have a rail cart system

542
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:28,980
here I want to have a rail cart system
 

543
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,500
here I want to have a rail cart system
that hopefully these guys will use so

544
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:31,510
that hopefully these guys will use so
 

545
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,940
that hopefully these guys will use so
they'll hop in a minecart it'll take

546
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:32,950
they'll hop in a minecart it'll take
 

547
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,890
they'll hop in a minecart it'll take
them to like the other end of the

548
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:34,900
them to like the other end of the
 

549
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,120
them to like the other end of the
village and then they'll hop out

550
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,130
village and then they'll hop out
 

551
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,450
village and then they'll hop out
automatically would be ideal that way I

552
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:39,460
automatically would be ideal that way I
 

553
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,310
automatically would be ideal that way I
think they'll be more likely to use

554
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:41,320
think they'll be more likely to use
 

555
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,430
think they'll be more likely to use
other houses too you know this is like

556
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:44,440
other houses too you know this is like
 

557
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,800
other houses too you know this is like
the first time I've seen a villager in

558
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:46,810
the first time I've seen a villager in
 

559
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,840
the first time I've seen a villager in
this one oh oh please don't be in the

560
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:51,850
this one oh oh please don't be in the
 

561
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,540
this one oh oh please don't be in the
village he's behind the wall we're good

562
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:54,550
village he's behind the wall we're good
 

563
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,530
village he's behind the wall we're good
he's like back there somewhere the

564
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:58,540
he's like back there somewhere the
 

565
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,420
he's like back there somewhere the
village seems to have grown a lot like

566
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:00,430
village seems to have grown a lot like
 

567
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,570
village seems to have grown a lot like
they're using the yellow and pink house

568
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:02,580
they're using the yellow and pink house
 

569
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,020
they're using the yellow and pink house
normally they stay up at that into the

570
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,030
normally they stay up at that into the
 

571
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:12,230
normally they stay up at that into the
village all right so anyway I think

572
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
village all right so anyway I think
 

573
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,280
village all right so anyway I think
could either put a track spot here or

574
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,290
could either put a track spot here or
 

575
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,660
could either put a track spot here or
maybe on this side of the yellow house

576
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:18,670
maybe on this side of the yellow house
 

577
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:24,840
maybe on this side of the yellow house
and the other end let's put it maybe

578
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:24,850
and the other end let's put it maybe
 

579
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,050
and the other end let's put it maybe
over here this is mostly just for show

580
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,060
over here this is mostly just for show
 

581
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,620
over here this is mostly just for show
like something fun to to watch right to

582
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:31,630
like something fun to to watch right to
 

583
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,940
like something fun to to watch right to
see them go on a minecart and move

584
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:32,950
see them go on a minecart and move
 

585
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:38,010
see them go on a minecart and move
around okay so here is what I got done

586
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:38,020
around okay so here is what I got done
 

587
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,610
around okay so here is what I got done
so far with this track idea this is a

588
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:41,620
so far with this track idea this is a
 

589
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,320
so far with this track idea this is a
popular end of the village right so if

590
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,330
popular end of the village right so if
 

591
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,570
popular end of the village right so if
we're only doing a one-way thing we want

592
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:45,580
we're only doing a one-way thing we want
 

593
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,660
we're only doing a one-way thing we want
them to start here and end on that end

594
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:48,670
them to start here and end on that end
 

595
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,390
them to start here and end on that end
of the village and then return like an

596
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:51,400
of the village and then return like an
 

597
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,940
of the village and then return like an
empty carts but we might try set up so

598
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:53,950
empty carts but we might try set up so
 

599
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,200
empty carts but we might try set up so
it works both ways but anyway no

600
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,210
it works both ways but anyway no
 

601
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,930
it works both ways but anyway no
volunteers everybody went inside darn it

602
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:00,940
volunteers everybody went inside darn it
 

603
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,120
volunteers everybody went inside darn it
must be nighttime okay so basically I

604
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,130
must be nighttime okay so basically I
 

605
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,360
must be nighttime okay so basically I
guess I'll go on it this is the layouts

606
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,370
guess I'll go on it this is the layouts
 

607
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,450
guess I'll go on it this is the layouts
we go over top the red building then got

608
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:12,460
we go over top the red building then got
 

609
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,180
we go over top the red building then got
over top the orange one then the yellow

610
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,190
over top the orange one then the yellow
 

611
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,570
over top the orange one then the yellow
one and we end up here there's an

612
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:18,580
one and we end up here there's an
 

613
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,990
one and we end up here there's an
activator rail that makes us get off

614
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,000
activator rail that makes us get off
 

615
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,460
activator rail that makes us get off
automatically and then it bounces back

616
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:23,470
automatically and then it bounces back
 

617
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,970
automatically and then it bounces back
the empty carts and it should make it

618
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:26,980
the empty carts and it should make it
 

619
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,950
the empty carts and it should make it
all the way there right yeah and since

620
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:31,960
all the way there right yeah and since
 

621
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,130
all the way there right yeah and since
this is this is a stair it stops at it

622
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:35,140
this is this is a stair it stops at it
 

623
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,340
this is this is a stair it stops at it
right and I'm using slabs to prevent the

624
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,350
right and I'm using slabs to prevent the
 

625
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,230
right and I'm using slabs to prevent the
villagers from walking that way but they

626
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
villagers from walking that way but they
 

627
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,870
villagers from walking that way but they
won't suffocate them where I could use

628
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
won't suffocate them where I could use
 

629
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,480
won't suffocate them where I could use
glass or something like that now we need

630
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:45,490
glass or something like that now we need
 

631
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,470
glass or something like that now we need
to find a way to incentive incentivize

632
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
to find a way to incentive incentivize
 

633
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,660
to find a way to incentive incentivize
yeah that's a word get them to go into

634
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:51,670
yeah that's a word get them to go into
 

635
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,510
yeah that's a word get them to go into
the minecart so we may try to like make

636
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:54,520
the minecart so we may try to like make
 

637
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,950
the minecart so we may try to like make
a door here like a fake house don't know

638
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:58,960
a door here like a fake house don't know
 

639
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,830
a door here like a fake house don't know
if I left enough space to do that though

640
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:00,840
if I left enough space to do that though
 

641
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,830
if I left enough space to do that though
because the track is where's the track

642
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:03,840
because the track is where's the track
 

643
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,220
because the track is where's the track
track goes up over there can I do it

644
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,230
track goes up over there can I do it
 

645
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:14,070
track goes up over there can I do it
here track is there if we had a door

646
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,080
here track is there if we had a door
 

647
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,010
here track is there if we had a door
right here oh but you know what they

648
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:17,020
right here oh but you know what they
 

649
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,870
right here oh but you know what they
don't try to cross tracks oh I forgot

650
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:21,880
don't try to cross tracks oh I forgot
 

651
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,440
don't try to cross tracks oh I forgot
about that

652
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:22,450
about that
 

653
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,720
about that
yeah villagers are like zombies like

654
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:24,730
yeah villagers are like zombies like
 

655
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,130
yeah villagers are like zombies like
they won't cross tracks I don't think

656
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,140
they won't cross tracks I don't think
 

657
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:34,770
they won't cross tracks I don't think
hmm that could be a problem how do I get

658
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:34,780
hmm that could be a problem how do I get
 

659
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,460
hmm that could be a problem how do I get
them in the minecart if they won't hmm

660
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:38,470
them in the minecart if they won't hmm
 

661
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,740
them in the minecart if they won't hmm
unless I set up a piston thing to push

662
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:40,750
unless I set up a piston thing to push
 

663
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,350
unless I set up a piston thing to push
them I didn't think this through very

664
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
them I didn't think this through very
 

665
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,040
them I didn't think this through very
well did I

666
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,050

 

667
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,020

okay let's his experiment to make sure

668
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,030
okay let's his experiment to make sure
 

669
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,720
okay let's his experiment to make sure
but I kind of doubt they're gonna try

670
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:51,730
but I kind of doubt they're gonna try
 

671
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:57,600
but I kind of doubt they're gonna try
enter the house sometime set 1,500 rawr

672
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:57,610
enter the house sometime set 1,500 rawr
 

673
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,640
enter the house sometime set 1,500 rawr
I'm a zombie I'm gonna eat you

674
00:17:59,640 --> 00:17:59,650
I'm a zombie I'm gonna eat you
 

675
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:06,800
I'm a zombie I'm gonna eat you
oh he's even oh well whoa kind of worked

676
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:06,810
oh he's even oh well whoa kind of worked
 

677
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,000
oh he's even oh well whoa kind of worked
that was weird

678
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,010
that was weird
 

679
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,730
that was weird
it's like they flew over the door yeah

680
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:11,740
it's like they flew over the door yeah
 

681
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,410
it's like they flew over the door yeah
look at that they're like flying up here

682
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:13,420
look at that they're like flying up here
 

683
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,170
look at that they're like flying up here
and then going down on it here let's

684
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:16,180
and then going down on it here let's
 

685
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,600
and then going down on it here let's
maybe block this totally alright let's

686
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:21,610
maybe block this totally alright let's
 

687
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,480
maybe block this totally alright let's
try that again that was a little strange

688
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:23,490
try that again that was a little strange
 

689
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:31,700
try that again that was a little strange
J test number two rawr I'm a zombie nope

690
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:31,710
J test number two rawr I'm a zombie nope
 

691
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,620
J test number two rawr I'm a zombie nope
so they see this as it an actual block

692
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:34,630
so they see this as it an actual block
 

693
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:42,919
so they see this as it an actual block
like they don't Oh hmm why did he go I

694
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:42,929

 

695
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,270

think it was this a coincidence I think

696
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
think it was this a coincidence I think
 

697
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,370
think it was this a coincidence I think
he was in this block here and he he

698
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:47,380
he was in this block here and he he
 

699
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,240
he was in this block here and he he
brushed against the minecart maybe I

700
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,250
brushed against the minecart maybe I
 

701
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,560
brushed against the minecart maybe I
don't think he actually tried to go

702
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:52,570
don't think he actually tried to go
 

703
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,430
don't think he actually tried to go
through the door though yeah they seemed

704
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:56,440
through the door though yeah they seemed
 

705
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,960
through the door though yeah they seemed
to hover around the door so if they

706
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:57,970
to hover around the door so if they
 

707
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,320
to hover around the door so if they
happen to end up by the minecart they'll

708
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,330
happen to end up by the minecart they'll
 

709
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,610
happen to end up by the minecart they'll
go in it so that might be a little bit

710
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:05,620
go in it so that might be a little bit
 

711
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,830
go in it so that might be a little bit
difficult to get set up today totally

712
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:07,840
difficult to get set up today totally
 

713
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,110
difficult to get set up today totally
I'll try finish some of that stuff off

714
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,120
I'll try finish some of that stuff off
 

715
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,830
I'll try finish some of that stuff off
camera and show you it next time Oh

716
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:12,840
camera and show you it next time Oh
 

717
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,560
camera and show you it next time Oh
zombie zombie there must be a dark spot

718
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:16,570
zombie zombie there must be a dark spot
 

719
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:26,010
zombie zombie there must be a dark spot

in here right light 9 that's fine over
 

721
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:33,600
in here right light 9 that's fine over
here 9 9 everything is 9 808 that might

722
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:33,610
here 9 9 everything is 9 808 that might
 

723
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,960
here 9 9 everything is 9 808 that might
be it I always have mob spawning in here

724
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:36,970
be it I always have mob spawning in here
 

725
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,640

728
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:43,179
there's a few eight spots so they're
 

729
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:46,799
there's a few eight spots so they're
probably seven at the floor okay I'll

730
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:46,809
probably seven at the floor okay I'll
 

731
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:51,120
probably seven at the floor okay I'll
have to keep that in mind but yeah maybe

732
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,130
have to keep that in mind but yeah maybe
 

733
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,850
have to keep that in mind but yeah maybe
something we can do to end this episode

734
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:52,860
something we can do to end this episode
 

735
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,330
something we can do to end this episode
just really quickly here I would finish

736
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:57,340
just really quickly here I would finish
 

737
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,270
just really quickly here I would finish
that but if you want a video today not

738
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:00,280
that but if you want a video today not
 

739
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,810
that but if you want a video today not
gonna happen so maybe we will just go

740
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:03,820
gonna happen so maybe we will just go
 

741
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,210
gonna happen so maybe we will just go
check around the place we have these

742
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:06,220
check around the place we have these
 

743
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,860
check around the place we have these
farms running all the time right and

744
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:07,870
farms running all the time right and
 

745
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,130
farms running all the time right and
quite often I forget to empty them of

746
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:11,140
quite often I forget to empty them of
 

747
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,560
quite often I forget to empty them of
the resources so one of those is the

748
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:13,570
the resources so one of those is the
 

749
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,030
the resources so one of those is the
slime farm I haven't checked this for

750
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,040
slime farm I haven't checked this for
 

751
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,520
slime farm I haven't checked this for
months Oh

752
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,530
months Oh
 

753
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,690
months Oh
basically we got a three by three thing

754
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:21,700
basically we got a three by three thing
 

755
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,480
basically we got a three by three thing
of hoppers here I don't know which way

756
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:24,490
of hoppers here I don't know which way
 

757
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,100
of hoppers here I don't know which way
they're pointing actually mmm maybe

758
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,110
they're pointing actually mmm maybe
 

759
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,680
they're pointing actually mmm maybe
we'll take out this one it's been too

760
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:31,690
we'll take out this one it's been too
 

761
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,060
we'll take out this one it's been too
long oh that is that's where the test is

762
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,070
long oh that is that's where the test is
 

763
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,280
long oh that is that's where the test is
okay and there's still a little bit of

764
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,290
okay and there's still a little bit of
 

765
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,580
okay and there's still a little bit of
space but it's good we looked at it so

766
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:40,590
space but it's good we looked at it so
 

767
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:45,320
space but it's good we looked at it so
I'll have to empty that oh oh drowning

768
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,330
I'll have to empty that oh oh drowning
 

769
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,410
I'll have to empty that oh oh drowning
or drowning there's one more over here

770
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:48,420
or drowning there's one more over here
 

771
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:53,540
or drowning there's one more over here
to which which side was that was that

772
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:53,550
to which which side was that was that
 

773
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,570
to which which side was that was that
here yeah there is oh I'm very

774
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:56,580
here yeah there is oh I'm very
 

775
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,680
here yeah there is oh I'm very
comparable actually okay so we'll have

776
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:00,690
comparable actually okay so we'll have
 

777
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,350
comparable actually okay so we'll have
to empty those there's one other farm

778
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
to empty those there's one other farm
 

779
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,870
to empty those there's one other farm
oh yeah the spider farm maybe we'll go

780
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:05,880
oh yeah the spider farm maybe we'll go
 

781
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,670
oh yeah the spider farm maybe we'll go
check out the cactus farm too I'm

782
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:09,680
check out the cactus farm too I'm
 

783
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,640
check out the cactus farm too I'm
wondering if there's mobs stuck in there

784
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:12,650
wondering if there's mobs stuck in there
 

785
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,230
wondering if there's mobs stuck in there
because they'll pick up the cactus and

786
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,240
because they'll pick up the cactus and
 

787
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,920
because they'll pick up the cactus and
open traps to pick up the cactus and get

788
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:18,930
open traps to pick up the cactus and get
 

789
