00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:31,650
so what have I been up to here I've been
 

21
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,910
so what have I been up to here I've been
working on this llama Vader that we

22
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:34,920
working on this llama Vader that we
 

23
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,470
working on this llama Vader that we
worked on last time didn't quite finish

24
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
worked on last time didn't quite finish
 

25
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,299
worked on last time didn't quite finish
it then but I think it's about good now

26
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:38,309
it then but I think it's about good now
 

27
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,240
it then but I think it's about good now
changed all the stone out there to red

28
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,250
changed all the stone out there to red
 

29
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,130
changed all the stone out there to red
clay just so it looks maybe a little bit

30
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:43,140
clay just so it looks maybe a little bit
 

31
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,000
clay just so it looks maybe a little bit
nicer and I had this thing here but I

32
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,010
nicer and I had this thing here but I
 

33
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,950
nicer and I had this thing here but I
think I'm going to change it so one

34
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
think I'm going to change it so one
 

35
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,680
think I'm going to change it so one
thing with this elevator is I wanted a

36
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:51,690
thing with this elevator is I wanted a
 

37
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,860
thing with this elevator is I wanted a
way to call the llama up here so I'd

38
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:54,870
way to call the llama up here so I'd
 

39
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,950
way to call the llama up here so I'd
like a trapdoor thing so if we want to

40
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:57,960
like a trapdoor thing so if we want to
 

41
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,979
like a trapdoor thing so if we want to
ride the elevator down we can basically

42
00:00:59,979 --> 00:00:59,989
ride the elevator down we can basically
 

43
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:05,210
ride the elevator down we can basically
up comes a llama you hop on it's a

44
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:05,220
up comes a llama you hop on it's a
 

45
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,390
up comes a llama you hop on it's a
little bit glitchy but not too bad and

46
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
little bit glitchy but not too bad and
 

47
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,490
little bit glitchy but not too bad and
then we're down here and then if we want

48
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:10,500
then we're down here and then if we want
 

49
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,899
then we're down here and then if we want
to go up it's working pretty good

50
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:13,909
to go up it's working pretty good
 

51
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,219
to go up it's working pretty good
somebody said this is going to break in

52
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:16,229
somebody said this is going to break in
 

53
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:17,929
somebody said this is going to break in
the next patch though and I don't know

54
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:17,939
the next patch though and I don't know
 

55
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,170
the next patch though and I don't know
if there's a specific reason for that or

56
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:21,180
if there's a specific reason for that or
 

57
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,179
if there's a specific reason for that or
it's just because elevators tend to

58
00:01:23,179 --> 00:01:23,189
it's just because elevators tend to
 

59
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,039
it's just because elevators tend to
always break every update I'm not sure

60
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,049
always break every update I'm not sure
 

61
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,380
always break every update I'm not sure
hopefully it doesn't break so I kind of

62
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:27,390
hopefully it doesn't break so I kind of
 

63
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,859
hopefully it doesn't break so I kind of
like this thing okay okay what should we

64
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:30,869
like this thing okay okay what should we
 

65
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,890
like this thing okay okay what should we
do here instead of doing the trapdoor

66
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:33,900
do here instead of doing the trapdoor
 

67
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,780
do here instead of doing the trapdoor
thing we'll do something maybe a little

68
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:35,790
thing we'll do something maybe a little
 

69
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,870
thing we'll do something maybe a little
bit more automatic yeah I think we'll do

70
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
bit more automatic yeah I think we'll do
 

71
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,130
bit more automatic yeah I think we'll do
it like this guys so we're going to have

72
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:40,140
it like this guys so we're going to have
 

73
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,480
it like this guys so we're going to have
a button in the corner here that

74
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:41,490
a button in the corner here that
 

75
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,910
a button in the corner here that
activates the redstone shoots an item

76
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
activates the redstone shoots an item
 

77
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,499
activates the redstone shoots an item
out of the dropper falls down the hole

78
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:45,509
out of the dropper falls down the hole
 

79
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,719
out of the dropper falls down the hole
here and that triggers the llama Vader

80
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:49,729
here and that triggers the llama Vader
 

81
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:52,550
here and that triggers the llama Vader
we could just jump down here too if we

82
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
we could just jump down here too if we
 

83
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,010
we could just jump down here too if we
want it's not that far of a fall won't

84
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,020
want it's not that far of a fall won't
 

85
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,410
want it's not that far of a fall won't
kill us if we have Pez are falling

86
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:56,420
kill us if we have Pez are falling
 

87
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,700
kill us if we have Pez are falling
there's a little bit fancier all right

88
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:58,710
there's a little bit fancier all right
 

89
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,300
there's a little bit fancier all right
except for for that part of it

90
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,310
except for for that part of it
 

91
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,179
except for for that part of it
one thing I did down here too is like

92
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:05,189
one thing I did down here too is like
 

93
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,219
one thing I did down here too is like
when we hop on the llama we go where the

94
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:07,229
when we hop on the llama we go where the
 

95
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,499
when we hop on the llama we go where the
tripwire is here that that activates the

96
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:09,509
tripwire is here that that activates the
 

97
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,010
tripwire is here that that activates the
thing but on the way down we won't don't

98
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,020
thing but on the way down we won't don't
 

99
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,000
thing but on the way down we won't don't
want the llama

100
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,010
want the llama
 

101
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,710
want the llama
again otherwise it will just go into an

102
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:15,720
again otherwise it will just go into an
 

103
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,259
again otherwise it will just go into an
endless loop of getting launched here so

104
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:18,269
endless loop of getting launched here so
 

105
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,809
endless loop of getting launched here so
I put in a t flip-flop so it only

106
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:20,819
I put in a t flip-flop so it only
 

107
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,089
I put in a t flip-flop so it only
activates once but not the second time

108
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:23,099
activates once but not the second time
 

109
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,390
activates once but not the second time
on the way down so let's just look at

110
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
on the way down so let's just look at
 

111
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,860
on the way down so let's just look at
the stuff here real quick

112
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:27,870
the stuff here real quick
 

113
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,860
the stuff here real quick
oh we activated it so yeah this is where

114
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:30,870
oh we activated it so yeah this is where
 

115
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,680
oh we activated it so yeah this is where
the item falls down into the hopper that

116
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:32,690
the item falls down into the hopper that
 

117
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:38,240
the item falls down into the hopper that
gets detected and sends a signal over

118
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,250
gets detected and sends a signal over
 

119
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,690
gets detected and sends a signal over
here

120
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:38,700
here
 

121
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,059
here
I heard the lump get hurt there I think

122
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:41,069
I heard the lump get hurt there I think
 

123
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,530
I heard the lump get hurt there I think
he's okay though like I've been watching

124
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:42,540
he's okay though like I've been watching
 

125
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,860
he's okay though like I've been watching
itself and he wasn't dying yet the

126
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:45,870
itself and he wasn't dying yet the
 

127
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,650
itself and he wasn't dying yet the
tripwire starts here activates a piece

128
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:48,660
tripwire starts here activates a piece
 

129
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,920
tripwire starts here activates a piece
of redstone into a monostable circuit

130
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:50,930
of redstone into a monostable circuit
 

131
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,369
of redstone into a monostable circuit
into the T flip-flop and this has to be

132
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:55,379
into the T flip-flop and this has to be
 

133
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,800
into the T flip-flop and this has to be
set at one goes down the piston that

134
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:57,810
set at one goes down the piston that
 

135
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,890
set at one goes down the piston that
launches it so yeah kind of a mess but

136
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:00,900
launches it so yeah kind of a mess but
 

137
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,280
launches it so yeah kind of a mess but
it's pretty simple actually alright

138
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,290
it's pretty simple actually alright
 

139
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,440
it's pretty simple actually alright
everybody so for today's episode I think

140
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:06,450
everybody so for today's episode I think
 

141
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,970
everybody so for today's episode I think
we're just going to do maybe some random

142
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:07,980
we're just going to do maybe some random
 

143
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,289
we're just going to do maybe some random
things around the place maybe some

144
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:09,299
things around the place maybe some
 

145
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,650
things around the place maybe some
building projects stuff like that we

146
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:12,660
building projects stuff like that we
 

147
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,979
building projects stuff like that we
recently refined this area here but it

148
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:15,989
recently refined this area here but it
 

149
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,370
recently refined this area here but it
kind of stops like here so I would like

150
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:19,380
kind of stops like here so I would like
 

151
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,580
kind of stops like here so I would like
to make this area polished up a bit more

152
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:22,590
to make this area polished up a bit more
 

153
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,710
to make this area polished up a bit more
we got the Simon game I don't know if

154
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
we got the Simon game I don't know if
 

155
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,870
we got the Simon game I don't know if
we'll get to that today that needs to be

156
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:26,880
we'll get to that today that needs to be
 

157
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,920
we'll get to that today that needs to be
finished still and then there's a tunnel

158
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:30,930
finished still and then there's a tunnel
 

159
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,150
finished still and then there's a tunnel
here this is I think what we're going to

160
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,160
here this is I think what we're going to
 

161
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,059
here this is I think what we're going to
focus on let's see let's count it here

162
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:35,069
focus on let's see let's count it here
 

163
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:40,009
focus on let's see let's count it here
one two three four five six seven let's

164
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:40,019
one two three four five six seven let's
 

165
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,809
one two three four five six seven let's
work with odd numbers always I let God

166
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:41,819
work with odd numbers always I let God
 

167
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,080
work with odd numbers always I let God
numbers yes that would go over here this

168
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,090
numbers yes that would go over here this
 

169
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,819
numbers yes that would go over here this
will be like the divider for the room

170
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:46,829
will be like the divider for the room
 

171
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,289
will be like the divider for the room
and then we're probably going to have a

172
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:48,299
and then we're probably going to have a
 

173
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,110
and then we're probably going to have a
tunnel of some sort have a little idea

174
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
tunnel of some sort have a little idea
 

175
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,180
tunnel of some sort have a little idea
here I wanted a trial we really haven't

176
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:53,190
here I wanted a trial we really haven't
 

177
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,740
here I wanted a trial we really haven't
done anything with the concrete blocks

178
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:54,750
done anything with the concrete blocks
 

179
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,900
done anything with the concrete blocks
or powder yet and I thought it's

180
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:56,910
or powder yet and I thought it's
 

181
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,750
or powder yet and I thought it's
something fun we could try I want to try

182
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
something fun we could try I want to try
 

183
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,319
something fun we could try I want to try
make like a changing tunnel here that

184
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:02,329
make like a changing tunnel here that
 

185
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:05,659
make like a changing tunnel here that
keeps changing the walls so they don't

186
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:05,669
keeps changing the walls so they don't
 

187
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:08,750
keeps changing the walls so they don't
always look the same and might be

188
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:08,760
always look the same and might be
 

189
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,309
always look the same and might be
possible with concrete powder might be

190
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
possible with concrete powder might be
 

191
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,819
possible with concrete powder might be
really easy to do actually so yeah this

192
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:13,829
really easy to do actually so yeah this
 

193
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:16,849
really easy to do actually so yeah this
leads over to the village if we go far

194
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:16,859
leads over to the village if we go far
 

195
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:18,469
leads over to the village if we go far
enough here don't want to make this

196
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
enough here don't want to make this
 

197
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,879
enough here don't want to make this
totally straight though because I've

198
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:19,889
totally straight though because I've
 

199
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:22,360
totally straight though because I've
learned that's a really bad thing to do

200
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,370
learned that's a really bad thing to do
 

201
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,800
learned that's a really bad thing to do
you want to break it up otherwise it's

202
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:24,810
you want to break it up otherwise it's
 

203
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,500
you want to break it up otherwise it's
it feels really bad or

204
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:27,510
it feels really bad or
 

205
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,180
it feels really bad or
so we'll probably go about like halfway

206
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,190
so we'll probably go about like halfway
 

207
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,130
so we'll probably go about like halfway
and then they'll be a t-intersection

208
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:31,140
and then they'll be a t-intersection
 

209
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:40,150
and then they'll be a t-intersection
and then we'll go the rest of the way

210
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160

 

211
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,450

that's door ever I think I had to

212
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:44,460
that's door ever I think I had to
 

213
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,550
that's door ever I think I had to
sacrifice the wiring because I got too

214
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
sacrifice the wiring because I got too
 

215
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,990
sacrifice the wiring because I got too
close to to it or something there

216
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
close to to it or something there
 

217
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,530
close to to it or something there
anyways so cleared out a little bit of

218
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:51,540
anyways so cleared out a little bit of
 

219
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,390
anyways so cleared out a little bit of
area here for a see it started on the

220
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:53,400
area here for a see it started on the
 

221
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,890
area here for a see it started on the
idea we're going to have our

222
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:54,900
idea we're going to have our
 

223
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,630
idea we're going to have our
intersection room here right and then

224
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:56,640
intersection room here right and then
 

225
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,030
intersection room here right and then
this is going to be the tunnel so let's

226
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
this is going to be the tunnel so let's
 

227
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,250
this is going to be the tunnel so let's
just play around with this first and see

228
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:01,260
just play around with this first and see
 

229
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,260
just play around with this first and see
we got to figure out the function before

230
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:03,270
we got to figure out the function before
 

231
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,210
we got to figure out the function before
the beauty right that's that's always

232
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:05,220
the beauty right that's that's always
 

233
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,380
the beauty right that's that's always
the key when you're doing a redstone

234
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:06,390
the key when you're doing a redstone
 

235
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,810
the key when you're doing a redstone
project try to get it working first and

236
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:08,820
project try to get it working first and
 

237
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,540
project try to get it working first and
then make it look nice afterwards so I'm

238
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:11,550
then make it look nice afterwards so I'm
 

239
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,340
then make it look nice afterwards so I'm
thinking on the left and the right here

240
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,350
thinking on the left and the right here
 

241
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,440
thinking on the left and the right here
will have a will have walls made out of

242
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,450
will have a will have walls made out of
 

243
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,320
will have a will have walls made out of
concrete powder all right those will be

244
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,330
concrete powder all right those will be
 

245
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,140
concrete powder all right those will be
on top of pistons and we want to be able

246
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,150
on top of pistons and we want to be able
 

247
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,280
on top of pistons and we want to be able
to change the pattern probably using a

248
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,290
to change the pattern probably using a
 

249
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,140
to change the pattern probably using a
hopper clock or something every so often

250
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,150
hopper clock or something every so often
 

251
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,130
hopper clock or something every so often
will change it'll move the blocks here

252
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,140
will change it'll move the blocks here
 

253
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,220
will change it'll move the blocks here
so I think all we got to do really if we

254
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,230
so I think all we got to do really if we
 

255
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,690
so I think all we got to do really if we
want to keep this really simple is just

256
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:35,700
want to keep this really simple is just
 

257
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,520
want to keep this really simple is just
push the concrete powder up here and

258
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:39,530
push the concrete powder up here and
 

259
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,730
push the concrete powder up here and
then at the top of the stack have

260
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:43,740
then at the top of the stack have
 

261
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,090
then at the top of the stack have
Pistons pushing this way and I made some

262
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,100
Pistons pushing this way and I made some
 

263
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,640
Pistons pushing this way and I made some
levers yeah okay let's try this out

264
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:52,650
levers yeah okay let's try this out
 

265
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,760
levers yeah okay let's try this out
we'll do one piston at a time here so

266
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:55,770
we'll do one piston at a time here so
 

267
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,550
we'll do one piston at a time here so
that is over there so this will get

268
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
that is over there so this will get
 

269
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,860
that is over there so this will get
triggered push up this will push

270
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:00,870
triggered push up this will push
 

271
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:08,990
triggered push up this will push
sideways go fall down and then I guess

272
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,000
sideways go fall down and then I guess
 

273
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,180
sideways go fall down and then I guess
we need Pistons here if we want to keep

274
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,190
we need Pistons here if we want to keep
 

275
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,160
we need Pistons here if we want to keep
it really small could just have a piston

276
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,170
it really small could just have a piston
 

277
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,520
it really small could just have a piston
there to push it sideways again I guess

278
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:16,530
there to push it sideways again I guess
 

279
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,810
there to push it sideways again I guess
we're going to have to activate this

280
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:17,820
we're going to have to activate this
 

281
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,170
we're going to have to activate this
piston first and then like two tix later

282
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:20,180
piston first and then like two tix later
 

283
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,090
piston first and then like two tix later
this one so it'll it'll raise the block

284
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,100
this one so it'll it'll raise the block
 

285
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,950
this one so it'll it'll raise the block
and then sneak one in underneath before

286
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
and then sneak one in underneath before
 

287
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,830
and then sneak one in underneath before
these start falling down right so I

288
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
these start falling down right so I
 

289
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,770
these start falling down right so I
think we're going to go in here to

290
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:29,780
think we're going to go in here to
 

291
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,270
think we're going to go in here to
activate this piston first and two ticks

292
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,280
activate this piston first and two ticks
 

293
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,190
activate this piston first and two ticks
later one two we will have to run power

294
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,200
later one two we will have to run power
 

295
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,340
later one two we will have to run power
up to this piston somehow maybe go

296
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:41,350
up to this piston somehow maybe go
 

297
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,120
up to this piston somehow maybe go
run it along like this it doesn't really

298
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,130
run it along like this it doesn't really
 

299
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,800
run it along like this it doesn't really
matter how we do it with our test

300
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:46,810
matter how we do it with our test
 

301
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,350
matter how we do it with our test
testing here though so we'll just do

302
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
testing here though so we'll just do
 

303
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,790
testing here though so we'll just do
that okay so let's put down a buttons

304
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:53,800
that okay so let's put down a buttons
 

305
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,050
that okay so let's put down a buttons
and just see what happens we probably

306
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,060
and just see what happens we probably
 

307
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,150
and just see what happens we probably
need a monostable circuit before this

308
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,160
need a monostable circuit before this
 

309
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,300
need a monostable circuit before this
though

310
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,310
though
 

311
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,410
though
yeah we need a monostable circuit

312
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:01,420
yeah we need a monostable circuit
 

313
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,830
yeah we need a monostable circuit
otherwise it just does that okay let's

314
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:04,840
otherwise it just does that okay let's
 

315
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,940
otherwise it just does that okay let's
get that in here too

316
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:05,950
get that in here too
 

317
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,950
get that in here too
I will just try it out with a piston

318
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:07,960
I will just try it out with a piston
 

319
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,770
I will just try it out with a piston
thing here first okay and redstone dust

320
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:13,780
thing here first okay and redstone dust
 

321
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,310
thing here first okay and redstone dust
there put a button on top of that this

322
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:17,320
there put a button on top of that this
 

323
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,430
there put a button on top of that this
is really messy I know I'm sorry but

324
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:20,440
is really messy I know I'm sorry but
 

325
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,110
is really messy I know I'm sorry but
we're doing it together this is how I

326
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,120
we're doing it together this is how I
 

327
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,190
we're doing it together this is how I
work okay that didn't quite work that

328
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,200
work okay that didn't quite work that
 

329
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,160
work okay that didn't quite work that
didn't quite work why would it shove it

330
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,170
didn't quite work why would it shove it
 

331
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,390
didn't quite work why would it shove it
off okay let's try a different timing

332
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:33,400
off okay let's try a different timing
 

333
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,540
off okay let's try a different timing
here what if this is at one I probably

334
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:36,550
here what if this is at one I probably
 

335
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,750
here what if this is at one I probably
it probably needs to be three that's no

336
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:39,760
it probably needs to be three that's no
 

337
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,230
it probably needs to be three that's no
good

338
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
good
 

339
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:51,330
good
one two three no still no good oh okay I

340
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:51,340
one two three no still no good oh okay I
 

341
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,530
one two three no still no good oh okay I
just we're going to have to do it like

342
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:52,540
just we're going to have to do it like
 

343
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,540
just we're going to have to do it like
this guys I put a sticky piston here

344
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:54,550
this guys I put a sticky piston here
 

345
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,940
this guys I put a sticky piston here
instead it's going to retract and pull

346
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:56,950
instead it's going to retract and pull
 

347
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,940
instead it's going to retract and pull
the concrete powder back here but this

348
00:07:59,940 --> 00:07:59,950
the concrete powder back here but this
 

349
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,740
the concrete powder back here but this
piston will still be powered so as soon

350
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:01,750
piston will still be powered so as soon
 

351
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,930
piston will still be powered so as soon
as this retracts it updates this piston

352
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:03,940
as this retracts it updates this piston
 

353
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,420
as this retracts it updates this piston
causing it to extend with like no delay

354
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:06,430
causing it to extend with like no delay
 

355
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,450
causing it to extend with like no delay
between the two and that'll push a

356
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:09,460
between the two and that'll push a
 

357
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,160
between the two and that'll push a
concrete powder out so it's going to do

358
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,170
concrete powder out so it's going to do
 

359
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,350
concrete powder out so it's going to do
this basically that's how you do it and

360
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
this basically that's how you do it and
 

361
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,750
this basically that's how you do it and
this is set at two we have have to use a

362
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:18,760
this is set at two we have have to use a
 

363
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,690
this is set at two we have have to use a
redstone torch I think so here uh-huh

364
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:21,700
redstone torch I think so here uh-huh
 

365
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,940
redstone torch I think so here uh-huh
monostable circuit here and I ran a wire

366
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:23,950
monostable circuit here and I ran a wire
 

367
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,890
monostable circuit here and I ran a wire
up to this piston just so we can try

368
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:25,900
up to this piston just so we can try
 

369
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,930
up to this piston just so we can try
like doing a loop here to see if it

370
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:27,940
like doing a loop here to see if it
 

371
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,470
like doing a loop here to see if it
works so for example we could have

372
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:30,480
works so for example we could have
 

373
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,029
works so for example we could have
gravel on one side and concrete powder

374
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
gravel on one side and concrete powder
 

375
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,290
gravel on one side and concrete powder
on the other would look pretty ugly but

376
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:36,300
on the other would look pretty ugly but
 

377
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,950
on the other would look pretty ugly but
hopefully we'll come up with a

378
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:37,960
hopefully we'll come up with a
 

379
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,070
hopefully we'll come up with a
cool-looking pattern but this should be

380
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,080
cool-looking pattern but this should be
 

381
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,930
cool-looking pattern but this should be
able to switch between a white concrete

382
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:42,940
able to switch between a white concrete
 

383
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,100
able to switch between a white concrete
wall in the gravel wall

384
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,110
wall in the gravel wall
 

385
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,720
wall in the gravel wall
ah something like that that's idea I

386
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:49,730
ah something like that that's idea I
 

387
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,670
ah something like that that's idea I
just hopped over to the zombie pigmen

388
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:52,680
just hopped over to the zombie pigmen
 

389
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,950
just hopped over to the zombie pigmen
farm guys got to do a tool repair here I

390
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:54,960
farm guys got to do a tool repair here I
 

391
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,900
farm guys got to do a tool repair here I
don't carry the bow with me anymore

392
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:56,910
don't carry the bow with me anymore
 

393
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,530
don't carry the bow with me anymore
right for flying so I need a pigment in

394
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:00,540
right for flying so I need a pigment in
 

395
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,420
right for flying so I need a pigment in
the middle here I can just smack but

396
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:02,430
the middle here I can just smack but
 

397
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,580
the middle here I can just smack but
this is what I've been doing until I get

398
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:04,590
this is what I've been doing until I get
 

399
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,920
this is what I've been doing until I get
that here anyways I just throw it ender

400
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:06,930
that here anyways I just throw it ender
 

401
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,650
that here anyways I just throw it ender
pearl up in the middle and I enter pearl

402
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:09,660
pearl up in the middle and I enter pearl
 

403
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,500
pearl up in the middle and I enter pearl
and hit one of these guys and then I

404
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:12,510
and hit one of these guys and then I
 

405
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,980
and hit one of these guys and then I
land over here my lazy way of activating

406
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:15,990
land over here my lazy way of activating
 

407
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,450
land over here my lazy way of activating
the farm seems to work pretty good

408
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:17,460
the farm seems to work pretty good
 

409
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,100
the farm seems to work pretty good
actually

410
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,110
actually
 

411
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,350
actually
wahoo alright so I've been making some

412
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
wahoo alright so I've been making some
 

413
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,270
wahoo alright so I've been making some
good progress here guys just about got

414
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:23,280
good progress here guys just about got
 

415
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,360
good progress here guys just about got
this all done got the redstone stuff to

416
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,370
this all done got the redstone stuff to
 

417
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,550
this all done got the redstone stuff to
mostly figure it out and it's it looks

418
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
mostly figure it out and it's it looks
 

419
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,020
mostly figure it out and it's it looks
really nasty right now I just want to

420
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,030
really nasty right now I just want to
 

421
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,430
really nasty right now I just want to
show it to you before we cover it up

422
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
show it to you before we cover it up
 

423
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,460
show it to you before we cover it up
though so like in our test example here

424
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:34,470
though so like in our test example here
 

425
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,990
though so like in our test example here
or from before does the same thing

426
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,000
or from before does the same thing
 

427
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,730
or from before does the same thing
except now we have a big line of pistons

428
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:40,740
except now we have a big line of pistons
 

429
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,180
except now we have a big line of pistons
I think I made this 11 blocks long and

430
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:44,190
I think I made this 11 blocks long and
 

431
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,670
I think I made this 11 blocks long and
you know if this is a cool thing we

432
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:46,680
you know if this is a cool thing we
 

433
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,180
you know if this is a cool thing we
might do this more but I'm not sure yet

434
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,190
might do this more but I'm not sure yet
 

435
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,770
might do this more but I'm not sure yet
so it pushes the gravel up and then at

436
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:51,780
so it pushes the gravel up and then at
 

437
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,150
so it pushes the gravel up and then at
the top there there's some Pistons that

438
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,160
the top there there's some Pistons that
 

439
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,050
the top there there's some Pistons that
push it sideways and then it falls down

440
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:56,060
push it sideways and then it falls down
 

441
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,600
push it sideways and then it falls down
so in total that's three pistons per

442
00:09:59,600 --> 00:09:59,610
so in total that's three pistons per
 

443
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,080
so in total that's three pistons per
column and a piston can push up to

444
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,090
column and a piston can push up to
 

445
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,150
column and a piston can push up to
twelve blocks right so I think it pushes

446
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,160
twelve blocks right so I think it pushes
 

447
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,000
twelve blocks right so I think it pushes
twelve blocks up and then double that on

448
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,010
twelve blocks up and then double that on
 

449
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,730
twelve blocks up and then double that on
the other side roughly maybe 23 24

450
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:10,740
the other side roughly maybe 23 24
 

451
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,820
the other side roughly maybe 23 24
blocks in total here we could add more

452
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:13,830
blocks in total here we could add more
 

453
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,370
blocks in total here we could add more
blocks if we add more Pistons but then

454
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:16,380
blocks if we add more Pistons but then
 

455
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,780
blocks if we add more Pistons but then
it gets more complicated so we're going

456
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:17,790
it gets more complicated so we're going
 

457
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,330
it gets more complicated so we're going
to keep it simple here and honestly it's

458
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:20,340
to keep it simple here and honestly it's
 

459
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,500
to keep it simple here and honestly it's
like this doesn't take up much space

460
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,510
like this doesn't take up much space
 

461
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,390
like this doesn't take up much space
because it's only two blocks whine right

462
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:23,400
because it's only two blocks whine right
 

463
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,930
because it's only two blocks whine right
you could easily have moving walls guys

464
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:25,940
you could easily have moving walls guys
 

465
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,150
you could easily have moving walls guys
everybody should do it it's the future I

466
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,160
everybody should do it it's the future I
 

467
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,070
everybody should do it it's the future I
tell you no probably not but it it'll be

468
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,080
tell you no probably not but it it'll be
 

469
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,200
tell you no probably not but it it'll be
a fun little thing here I like to try

470
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,210
a fun little thing here I like to try
 

471
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,210
a fun little thing here I like to try
add something new to each part of the

472
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:38,220
add something new to each part of the
 

473
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,350
add something new to each part of the
man tape here so it doesn't become

474
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
man tape here so it doesn't become
 

475
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,230
man tape here so it doesn't become
repetitive you know so yeah let's just

476
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
repetitive you know so yeah let's just
 

477
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,150
repetitive you know so yeah let's just
check this out real quick so sticky

478
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
check this out real quick so sticky
 

479
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
check this out real quick so sticky
pistons get powered by this line here

480
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,170
pistons get powered by this line here
 

481
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,520
pistons get powered by this line here
this is our redstone torch goes over to

482
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:49,530
this is our redstone torch goes over to
 

483
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,100
this is our redstone torch goes over to
here to a toothpick repeater and then

484
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,110
here to a toothpick repeater and then
 

485
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,500
here to a toothpick repeater and then
that power is this big line of Pistons

486
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:54,510
that power is this big line of Pistons
 

487
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,770
that power is this big line of Pistons
down below here from this let's see

488
00:10:59,770 --> 00:10:59,780
down below here from this let's see
 

489
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,350
down below here from this let's see
there's really not too much to this yeah

490
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:02,360
there's really not too much to this yeah
 

491
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,480
there's really not too much to this yeah
from this this is our monostable circuit

492
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:04,490
from this this is our monostable circuit
 

493
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,130
from this this is our monostable circuit
here that just goes and activates us on

494
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:09,140
here that just goes and activates us on
 

495
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,200
here that just goes and activates us on
both sides so I fall down hole I do that

496
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,210
both sides so I fall down hole I do that
 

497
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,750
both sides so I fall down hole I do that
a lot don't I

498
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
a lot don't I
 

499
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,590
a lot don't I
uh-huh I think I do that every episode

500
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
uh-huh I think I do that every episode
 

501
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,890
uh-huh I think I do that every episode
so just copied it on the other side here

502
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:23,900
so just copied it on the other side here
 

503
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,630
so just copied it on the other side here
and then there's also the line that goes

504
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:25,640
and then there's also the line that goes
 

505
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,520
and then there's also the line that goes
up to the Pistons up above so let's go

506
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:27,530
up to the Pistons up above so let's go
 

507
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,160
up to the Pistons up above so let's go
check those out too just runs up a

508
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,170
check those out too just runs up a
 

509
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,910
check those out too just runs up a
staircase thing here and over to this so

510
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
staircase thing here and over to this so
 

511
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,110
staircase thing here and over to this so
it's not super complicated really mm-hmm

512
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,120
it's not super complicated really mm-hmm
 

513
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,260
it's not super complicated really mm-hmm
so if this is 24 blocks or so right and

514
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,270
so if this is 24 blocks or so right and
 

515
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,100
so if this is 24 blocks or so right and
we have a wall that's five blocks tall

516
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,110
we have a wall that's five blocks tall
 

517
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,230
we have a wall that's five blocks tall
divide that by five you can have four

518
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,240
divide that by five you can have four
 

519
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,420
divide that by five you can have four
completely different walls within our

520
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:49,430
completely different walls within our
 

521
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,430
completely different walls within our
our block limit there right if it's a

522
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
our block limit there right if it's a
 

523
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,140
our block limit there right if it's a
seven block wall seven block tall wall

524
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,150
seven block wall seven block tall wall
 

525
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,380
seven block wall seven block tall wall
we're trying to make then you know 23 or

526
00:11:59,380 --> 00:11:59,390
we're trying to make then you know 23 or
 

527
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,510
we're trying to make then you know 23 or
24 divided by seven you could easily fit

528
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:01,520
24 divided by seven you could easily fit
 

529
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,030
24 divided by seven you could easily fit
three completely different walls within

530
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,040
three completely different walls within
 

531
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,630
three completely different walls within
our blocks here so not quite sure what

532
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:07,640
our blocks here so not quite sure what
 

533
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,520
our blocks here so not quite sure what
we're going to do with it just yet or

534
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:09,530
we're going to do with it just yet or
 

535
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:14,320
we're going to do with it just yet or
how tall our walls going to be um or we

536
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,330
how tall our walls going to be um or we
 

537
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,850
how tall our walls going to be um or we
could just shift the wall so it moves

538
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:15,860
could just shift the wall so it moves
 

539
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,500
could just shift the wall so it moves
one block at a time but I think we'll

540
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:17,510
one block at a time but I think we'll
 

541
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,690
one block at a time but I think we'll
just make it so you and change it into a

542
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:19,700
just make it so you and change it into a
 

543
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,060
just make it so you and change it into a
completely different wall with the push

544
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,070
completely different wall with the push
 

545
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,050
completely different wall with the push
of a button or by a hopper timer running

546
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:25,060
of a button or by a hopper timer running
 

547
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,990
of a button or by a hopper timer running
so yeah we'll probably have some sort of

548
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,000
so yeah we'll probably have some sort of
 

549
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,590
so yeah we'll probably have some sort of
border running along here I made sure we

550
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:32,600
border running along here I made sure we
 

551
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,180
border running along here I made sure we
could keep this all flat if we wanted to

552
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,190
could keep this all flat if we wanted to
 

553
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,890
could keep this all flat if we wanted to
so let's just fill this in with grass

554
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:38,900
so let's just fill this in with grass
 

555
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,480
so let's just fill this in with grass
right now I don't know if that's oh it's

556
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:40,490
right now I don't know if that's oh it's
 

557
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,740
right now I don't know if that's oh it's
going to be in the end of things here

558
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:41,750
going to be in the end of things here
 

559
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,570
going to be in the end of things here
but that'll give us an idea of what the

560
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:43,580
but that'll give us an idea of what the
 

561
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,610
but that'll give us an idea of what the
rooms going to look like in and how tall

562
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:45,620
rooms going to look like in and how tall
 

563
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,200
rooms going to look like in and how tall
we should make the walls and that kind

564
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,210
we should make the walls and that kind
 

565
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:52,840
we should make the walls and that kind
of stuff just tie how it feels so it's a

566
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:52,850
of stuff just tie how it feels so it's a
 

567
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,870
of stuff just tie how it feels so it's a
pretty wide room I did it that way so

568
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
pretty wide room I did it that way so
 

569
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,490
pretty wide room I did it that way so
like the walls can actually be seen like

570
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:57,500
like the walls can actually be seen like
 

571
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,430
like the walls can actually be seen like
if if the roof is really short and the

572
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:00,440
if if the roof is really short and the
 

573
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,110
if if the roof is really short and the
walls are like right in our face like

574
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,120
walls are like right in our face like
 

575
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,840
walls are like right in our face like
over here won't really be able to see

576
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:04,850
over here won't really be able to see
 

577
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,300
over here won't really be able to see
them to you all right so I think this

578
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,310
them to you all right so I think this
 

579
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,820
them to you all right so I think this
will be good and if it's only five

580
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:09,830
will be good and if it's only five
 

581
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,470
will be good and if it's only five
blocks tall one two three four

582
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:13,480
blocks tall one two three four
 

583
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,819
blocks tall one two three four
while five blocks tall is pretty tall

584
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:15,829
while five blocks tall is pretty tall
 

585
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:24,040
while five blocks tall is pretty tall
actually let's see so if we kind of

586
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,050
actually let's see so if we kind of
 

587
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,629
actually let's see so if we kind of
block off that space that's that's a

588
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:25,639
block off that space that's that's a
 

589
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,910
block off that space that's that's a
five block tall look room that's not bad

590
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
five block tall look room that's not bad
 

591
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,439
five block tall look room that's not bad
actually okay so I just framed this in

592
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:32,449
actually okay so I just framed this in
 

593
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:34,300
actually okay so I just framed this in
for right now to give us a better idea

594
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,310
for right now to give us a better idea
 

595
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,819
for right now to give us a better idea
of where are our moving walls going to

596
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:36,829
of where are our moving walls going to
 

597
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:39,490
of where are our moving walls going to
be right and this room feels pretty good

598
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:39,500
be right and this room feels pretty good
 

599
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,990
be right and this room feels pretty good
to me the way it is I don't think we

600
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,000
to me the way it is I don't think we
 

601
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,150
to me the way it is I don't think we
should go any taller like five blocks is

602
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,160
should go any taller like five blocks is
 

603
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,699
should go any taller like five blocks is
quite a bit already don't go to six or

604
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:45,709
quite a bit already don't go to six or
 

605
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:48,310
quite a bit already don't go to six or
seven I don't think I kind of like this

606
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
seven I don't think I kind of like this
 

607
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,800
seven I don't think I kind of like this
too like we have a narrow doorway here

608
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:50,810
too like we have a narrow doorway here
 

609
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,100
too like we have a narrow doorway here
so as we walk forward then the pictures

610
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,110
so as we walk forward then the pictures
 

611
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,300
so as we walk forward then the pictures
on the left and right here will get

612
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:55,310
on the left and right here will get
 

613
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,910
on the left and right here will get
revealed has that reveal feel to it you

614
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:57,920
revealed has that reveal feel to it you
 

615
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,069
revealed has that reveal feel to it you
know reveal feel up and we can see it

616
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:03,079
know reveal feel up and we can see it
 

617
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:05,680
know reveal feel up and we can see it
with our peripheral vision right we

618
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:05,690
with our peripheral vision right we
 

619
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,090
with our peripheral vision right we
don't even have to like turn to the

620
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,100
don't even have to like turn to the
 

621
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,590
don't even have to like turn to the
right or left to see them we'll see them

622
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:08,600
right or left to see them we'll see them
 

623
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,050
right or left to see them we'll see them
as we walk by so now comes the tough

624
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,060
as we walk by so now comes the tough
 

625
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,819
as we walk by so now comes the tough
part we actually have to do some art

626
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:12,829
part we actually have to do some art
 

627
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:15,490
part we actually have to do some art
here or or make some walls that look

628
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:15,500
here or or make some walls that look
 

629
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,519
here or or make some walls that look
cool and I might not know what to do

630
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:18,529
cool and I might not know what to do
 

631
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:23,380
cool and I might not know what to do
here should we try do a mural as one of

632
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:23,390
here should we try do a mural as one of
 

633
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,170
here should we try do a mural as one of
the walls not only do I have to design

634
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:26,180
the walls not only do I have to design
 

635
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,490
the walls not only do I have to design
one wall I have to design like four and

636
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:29,500
one wall I have to design like four and
 

637
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,900
one wall I have to design like four and
possibly four more if we don't keep them

638
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:31,910
possibly four more if we don't keep them
 

639
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,670
possibly four more if we don't keep them
the same on the other side I'm not sure

640
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
the same on the other side I'm not sure
 

641
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,360
the same on the other side I'm not sure
okay let's just copy what we kind of did

642
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,370
okay let's just copy what we kind of did
 

643
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,670
okay let's just copy what we kind of did
in our tree farm no we'll make like

644
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
in our tree farm no we'll make like
 

645
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,710
in our tree farm no we'll make like
grass and sky and see what that looks

646
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:41,720
grass and sky and see what that looks
 

647
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,500
grass and sky and see what that looks
like okay that looks pretty bad yeah

648
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:47,510
like okay that looks pretty bad yeah
 

649
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,170
like okay that looks pretty bad yeah
we're not going to do that

650
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:49,180
we're not going to do that
 

651
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,730
we're not going to do that
the color contrast between the two is

652
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:51,740
the color contrast between the two is
 

653
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,240
the color contrast between the two is
this way too sharp okay I do like the

654
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,250
this way too sharp okay I do like the
 

655
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,350
this way too sharp okay I do like the
blue though I think the blue looks

656
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:56,360
blue though I think the blue looks
 

657
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,210
blue though I think the blue looks
pretty nice maybe we'll just mix in

658
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:58,220
pretty nice maybe we'll just mix in
 

659
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,309
pretty nice maybe we'll just mix in
another blue block with the light blue

660
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:00,319
another blue block with the light blue
 

661
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:03,939
another blue block with the light blue
here mm-hmm so I might need some

662
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:03,949
here mm-hmm so I might need some
 

663
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:06,939
here mm-hmm so I might need some
guidance here guys help me out with what

664
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:06,949
guidance here guys help me out with what
 

665
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,559
guidance here guys help me out with what
colors I should actually be using for

666
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:08,569
colors I should actually be using for
 

667
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:10,000
colors I should actually be using for
this room maybe like I don't know if I

668
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,010
this room maybe like I don't know if I
 

669
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,250
this room maybe like I don't know if I
should keep this as grass and like this

670
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:12,260
should keep this as grass and like this
 

671
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,319
should keep this as grass and like this
wood stuff it feels like it doesn't

672
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:14,329
wood stuff it feels like it doesn't
 

673
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,259
wood stuff it feels like it doesn't
really go with the concrete powder right

674
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:16,269
really go with the concrete powder right
 

675
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:18,430
really go with the concrete powder right
even the different colors will probably

676
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:18,440
even the different colors will probably
 

677
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,130
even the different colors will probably
have trouble but just in a simple

678
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:21,140
have trouble but just in a simple
 

679
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,800
have trouble but just in a simple
pattern here maybe too simple I'm not

680
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:23,810
pattern here maybe too simple I'm not
 

681
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,380
pattern here maybe too simple I'm not
sure I guess like if we're walking by

682
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:26,390
sure I guess like if we're walking by
 

683
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:26,830
sure I guess like if we're walking by
here

684
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:26,840
here
 

685
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,360
here
we're not gonna be staring at it right

686
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:28,370
we're not gonna be staring at it right
 

687
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,280
we're not gonna be staring at it right
where it's gonna be off on the side so

688
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,290
where it's gonna be off on the side so
 

689
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,640
where it's gonna be off on the side so
you don't want too complicated

690
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:32,650
you don't want too complicated
 

691
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,680
you don't want too complicated
otherwise it's it's gonna be disturbing

692
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:35,690
otherwise it's it's gonna be disturbing
 

693
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,120
otherwise it's it's gonna be disturbing
as we walk by maybe I really know what

694
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,130
as we walk by maybe I really know what
 

695
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,940
as we walk by maybe I really know what
I'm talking about okay I guess I'll try

696
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:42,950
I'm talking about okay I guess I'll try
 

697
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,650
I'm talking about okay I guess I'll try
this do four simple patterns like this

698
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:44,660
this do four simple patterns like this
 

699
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,010
this do four simple patterns like this
and see what it's like so I'm gonna do

700
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:47,020
and see what it's like so I'm gonna do
 

701
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,980
and see what it's like so I'm gonna do
like a yellowish one maybe a grayish

702
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:50,990
like a yellowish one maybe a grayish
 

703
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,210
like a yellowish one maybe a grayish
color one and or a brown and maybe a

704
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:55,220
color one and or a brown and maybe a
 

705
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,090
color one and or a brown and maybe a
purple one and just see what that's like

706
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:57,100
purple one and just see what that's like
 

707
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,100
purple one and just see what that's like
all right are you ready for this here we

708
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,110
all right are you ready for this here we
 

709
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:05,050
all right are you ready for this here we
go so I got four different patterns here

710
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:05,060
go so I got four different patterns here
 

711
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,720
go so I got four different patterns here
and ideally we want to set this up so

712
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:07,730
and ideally we want to set this up so
 

713
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,730
and ideally we want to set this up so
this gets pressed like five times in a

714
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:09,740
this gets pressed like five times in a
 

715
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,970
this gets pressed like five times in a
row automatically without us doing it

716
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:12,980
row automatically without us doing it
 

717
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,180
row automatically without us doing it
right set that up on a hopper timer that

718
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,190
right set that up on a hopper timer that
 

719
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,880
right set that up on a hopper timer that
activates randomly so maybe today's a

720
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:18,890
activates randomly so maybe today's a
 

721
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,860
activates randomly so maybe today's a
blue day when we walk down the tunnel or

722
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:20,870
blue day when we walk down the tunnel or
 

723
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,950
blue day when we walk down the tunnel or
maybe it's a gray day just try it a

724
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:23,960
maybe it's a gray day just try it a
 

725
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,840
maybe it's a gray day just try it a
couple random patterns here this one's

726
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:25,850
couple random patterns here this one's
 

727
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,700
couple random patterns here this one's
not too bad either

728
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:26,710
not too bad either
 

729
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,460
not too bad either
it's okay there is one that I don't

730
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:30,470
it's okay there is one that I don't
 

731
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,800
it's okay there is one that I don't
don't really like so I did a yellow an

732
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:32,810
don't really like so I did a yellow an
 

733
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,690
don't really like so I did a yellow an
orange one here kind of a stripy thing I

734
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:36,700
orange one here kind of a stripy thing I
 

735
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,550
orange one here kind of a stripy thing I
think this one's pretty good to you I'm

736
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:39,560
think this one's pretty good to you I'm
 

737
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,320
think this one's pretty good to you I'm
happy with that but then I did a perform

738
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,330
happy with that but then I did a perform
 

739
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:48,370
happy with that but then I did a perform
this one maybe you should be changed the

740
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:48,380
this one maybe you should be changed the
 

741
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,710
this one maybe you should be changed the
colors are if if we keep this grass

742
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
colors are if if we keep this grass
 

743
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,300
colors are if if we keep this grass
anyways something about these colors

744
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,310
anyways something about these colors
 

745
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,860
anyways something about these colors
it's just not right uh-huh anyways it's

746
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:56,870
it's just not right uh-huh anyways it's
 

747
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,470
it's just not right uh-huh anyways it's
it's kind of a goopy random idea thought

748
00:16:59,470 --> 00:16:59,480
it's kind of a goopy random idea thought
 

749
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,290
it's kind of a goopy random idea thought
you guys might like it though and it'll

750
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:02,300
you guys might like it though and it'll
 

751
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,550
you guys might like it though and it'll
make our tunnel a little bit more

752
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:03,560
make our tunnel a little bit more
 

753
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,740
make our tunnel a little bit more
interesting here AHA anyways so this

754
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:08,750
interesting here AHA anyways so this
 

755
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,130
interesting here AHA anyways so this
goes to over here this is our pixel I

756
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:12,140
goes to over here this is our pixel I
 

757
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,500
goes to over here this is our pixel I
think we'll put in a window where we can

758
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:14,510
think we'll put in a window where we can
 

759
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,140
think we'll put in a window where we can
view the redstone wiring and then

760
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,150
view the redstone wiring and then
 

761
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,420
view the redstone wiring and then
they'll probably be the like a big room

762
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:19,430
they'll probably be the like a big room
 

763
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,830
they'll probably be the like a big room
over here right so it's not not a total

764
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:23,840
over here right so it's not not a total
 

765
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,650
over here right so it's not not a total
straight straight area yeah so we'll

766
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:26,660
straight straight area yeah so we'll
 

767
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,060
straight straight area yeah so we'll
have the window on this side they'll be

768
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,070
have the window on this side they'll be
 

769
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,130
have the window on this side they'll be
like at an intersection that goes this

770
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:30,140
like at an intersection that goes this
 

771
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,840
like at an intersection that goes this
way and then probably not straight

772
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:34,850
way and then probably not straight
 

773
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,700
way and then probably not straight
through here we'll go over a few blocks

774
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:36,710
through here we'll go over a few blocks
 

775
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,350
through here we'll go over a few blocks
and then start going straight this way

776
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:38,360
and then start going straight this way
 

777
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,420
and then start going straight this way
again towards the village

778
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:40,430
again towards the village
 

779
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,120
again towards the village
is the plan I think we'll do something

780
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,130
is the plan I think we'll do something
 

781
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,670
is the plan I think we'll do something
else here for today's episode and break

782
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:45,680
else here for today's episode and break
 

783
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,270
else here for today's episode and break
things up a bit okay so I just checked

784
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
things up a bit okay so I just checked
 

785
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,590
things up a bit okay so I just checked
in we don't have a whole lot of time

786
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:50,600
in we don't have a whole lot of time
 

787
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,940
in we don't have a whole lot of time
left this episode but we're going to try

788
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:51,950
left this episode but we're going to try
 

789
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,800
left this episode but we're going to try
to do a quick project before we finish

790
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:53,810
to do a quick project before we finish
 

791
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,020
to do a quick project before we finish
it first I want to show you the mushroom

792
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,030
it first I want to show you the mushroom
 

793
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,640
it first I want to show you the mushroom
farm though so I have been working on

794
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:57,650
farm though so I have been working on
 

795
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,040
farm though so I have been working on
this I finish building the Sun shield

796
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,050
this I finish building the Sun shield
 

797
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,860
this I finish building the Sun shield
over top the mushrooms I decided to do

798
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:02,870
over top the mushrooms I decided to do
 

799
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,960
over top the mushrooms I decided to do
that instead of using just string like

800
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:04,970
that instead of using just string like
 

801
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,600
that instead of using just string like
we have the Basel here right so we can

802
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:07,610
we have the Basel here right so we can
 

803
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,160
we have the Basel here right so we can
just put string above the mushrooms

804
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,170
just put string above the mushrooms
 

805
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,830
just put string above the mushrooms
without blocking out the light but we're

806
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
without blocking out the light but we're
 

807
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,660
without blocking out the light but we're
going to do the Sun shield just because

808
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:13,670
going to do the Sun shield just because
 

809
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,260
going to do the Sun shield just because
it's going to make it a lot easier to

810
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,270
it's going to make it a lot easier to
 

811
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,760
it's going to make it a lot easier to
put in the water streams here I'm going

812
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:18,770
put in the water streams here I'm going
 

813
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,610
put in the water streams here I'm going
to put dispensers on top of this with

814
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:21,620
to put dispensers on top of this with
 

815
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,590
to put dispensers on top of this with
water buckets in and we just have to run

816
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,600
water buckets in and we just have to run
 

817
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,810
water buckets in and we just have to run
a wire down the middle here to activate

818
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:25,820
a wire down the middle here to activate
 

819
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,940
a wire down the middle here to activate
them all and then that will flush all

820
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:27,950
them all and then that will flush all
 

821
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,710
them all and then that will flush all
the mushroom drops towards these holes

822
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:29,720
the mushroom drops towards these holes
 

823
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,810
the mushroom drops towards these holes
and they'll get picked up so that's

824
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:31,820
and they'll get picked up so that's
 

825
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,280
and they'll get picked up so that's
going to be a nice simple way of doing

826
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,290
going to be a nice simple way of doing
 

827
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,130
going to be a nice simple way of doing
that we need more orange sand to finish

828
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:36,140
that we need more orange sand to finish
 

829
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,900
that we need more orange sand to finish
this build though so that's what we're

830
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:37,910
this build though so that's what we're
 

831
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,820
this build though so that's what we're
going to do here we're going to make one

832
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:39,830
going to do here we're going to make one
 

833
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,350
going to do here we're going to make one
of these at once and make arewe machines

834
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
of these at once and make arewe machines
 

835
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,480
of these at once and make arewe machines
and try to semi automate it so this

836
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:46,490
and try to semi automate it so this
 

837
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,320
and try to semi automate it so this
turns this yellow sand into oranges and

838
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,330
turns this yellow sand into oranges and
 

839
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,660
turns this yellow sand into oranges and
kind of a glitch in the game but I'm

840
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:52,670
kind of a glitch in the game but I'm
 

841
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,330
kind of a glitch in the game but I'm
okay with it and I think we're going to

842
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:55,340
okay with it and I think we're going to
 

843
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,340
okay with it and I think we're going to
go ahead and do it but not over here

844
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:57,350
go ahead and do it but not over here
 

845
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,950
go ahead and do it but not over here
we're going to build it at kind of in

846
00:18:59,950 --> 00:18:59,960
we're going to build it at kind of in
 

847
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,630
we're going to build it at kind of in
the Sandy City area I think a sense

848
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:01,640
the Sandy City area I think a sense
 

849
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,730
the Sandy City area I think a sense
because sandy city sand you know so

850
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:06,740
because sandy city sand you know so
 

851
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,490
because sandy city sand you know so
let's head over there I picked out a

852
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:09,500
let's head over there I picked out a
 

853
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,550
let's head over there I picked out a
spot already you guys might have noticed

854
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:12,560
spot already you guys might have noticed
 

855
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,860
spot already you guys might have noticed
I have I have done a little something

856
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:14,870
I have I have done a little something
 

857
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,220
I have I have done a little something
here too so I extended this hat a little

858
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,230
here too so I extended this hat a little
 

859
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,980
here too so I extended this hat a little
bit a while ago and I've started

860
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:20,990
bit a while ago and I've started
 

861
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,950
bit a while ago and I've started
building like random stairs and stuff in

862
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:23,960
building like random stairs and stuff in
 

863
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,510
building like random stairs and stuff in
this mountain here we have these really

864
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
this mountain here we have these really
 

865
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,100
this mountain here we have these really
cool mountains and they're not really

866
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,110
cool mountains and they're not really
 

867
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:31,270
cool mountains and they're not really
being being used so what I would like to

868
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
being being used so what I would like to
 

869
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,610
being being used so what I would like to
do is maybe make a cool-looking bridge

870
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:33,620
do is maybe make a cool-looking bridge
 

871
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,860
do is maybe make a cool-looking bridge
here eventually they'll go through a

872
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:35,870
here eventually they'll go through a
 

873
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,510
here eventually they'll go through a
tunnel here and then if we want to build

874
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
tunnel here and then if we want to build
 

875
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,910
tunnel here and then if we want to build
like in a snowy area that's that's

876
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:39,920
like in a snowy area that's that's
 

877
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,140
like in a snowy area that's that's
what's going to be over here we'll go up

878
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,150
what's going to be over here we'll go up
 

879
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,050
what's going to be over here we'll go up
on top of mountains and and we do some

880
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,060
on top of mountains and and we do some
 

881
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,420
on top of mountains and and we do some
snow things for ice themed things and

882
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:46,430
snow things for ice themed things and
 

883
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,090
snow things for ice themed things and
just put some some random things here to

884
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:49,100
just put some some random things here to
 

885
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,850
just put some some random things here to
see how they look but yeah I think we're

886
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:51,860
see how they look but yeah I think we're
 

887
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,470
see how they look but yeah I think we're
going to put our red sand maker machine

888
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:53,480
going to put our red sand maker machine
 

889
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,250
going to put our red sand maker machine
just over

890
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:54,260
just over
 

891
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,680
just over
they're in this little area don't have a

892
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:56,690
they're in this little area don't have a
 

893
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,270
they're in this little area don't have a
lot of space here but it's also not

894
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:58,280
lot of space here but it's also not
 

895
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,340
lot of space here but it's also not
going to take up a lot of space I don't

896
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:00,350
going to take up a lot of space I don't
 

897
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,320
going to take up a lot of space I don't
think so this will this will be good and

898
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,330
think so this will this will be good and
 

899
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,330
think so this will this will be good and
then we can connect the path to this and

900
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:04,340
then we can connect the path to this and
 

901
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,860
then we can connect the path to this and
hopefully make it look like a little

902
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:05,870
hopefully make it look like a little
 

903
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,700
hopefully make it look like a little
shack or something but we'll see so I

904
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:09,710
shack or something but we'll see so I
 

905
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,950
shack or something but we'll see so I
decided I want to put the Pistons at eye

906
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:11,960
decided I want to put the Pistons at eye
 

907
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,960
decided I want to put the Pistons at eye
level here so it's going to be easier to

908
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:13,970
level here so it's going to be easier to
 

909
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,410
level here so it's going to be easier to
place the sand inside this thing and

910
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:16,420
place the sand inside this thing and
 

911
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,060
place the sand inside this thing and
then we have to have two sticky pistons

912
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,070
then we have to have two sticky pistons
 

913
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,420
then we have to have two sticky pistons
here - sand blocks above this I don't

914
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:22,430
here - sand blocks above this I don't
 

915
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,220
here - sand blocks above this I don't
know I think you can just use any sand

916
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,230
know I think you can just use any sand
 

917
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,720
know I think you can just use any sand
block I don't think it matters or any

918
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:25,730
block I don't think it matters or any
 

919
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,260
block I don't think it matters or any
blocks with gravity and above these

920
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:29,270
blocks with gravity and above these
 

921
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,540
blocks with gravity and above these
pistons you definitely need to use slabs

922
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:31,550
pistons you definitely need to use slabs
 

923
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,360
pistons you definitely need to use slabs
you can't use full blocks and on top of

924
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:34,370
you can't use full blocks and on top of
 

925
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:39,160
you can't use full blocks and on top of
those redstone okay and now I think all

926
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,170
those redstone okay and now I think all
 

927
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,070
those redstone okay and now I think all
we got to do is have repeaters over

928
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
we got to do is have repeaters over
 

929
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,910
we got to do is have repeaters over
there let's go up so we can actually see

930
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:44,920
there let's go up so we can actually see
 

931
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,140
there let's go up so we can actually see
one of these has to be set at two and

932
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,150
one of these has to be set at two and
 

933
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,800
one of these has to be set at two and
one of them at one oh I don't know I

934
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:50,810
one of them at one oh I don't know I
 

935
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,850
one of them at one oh I don't know I
changed that oh and I fall down again

936
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:53,860
changed that oh and I fall down again
 

937
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,230
changed that oh and I fall down again
okay we're going to try seek this into

938
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,240
okay we're going to try seek this into
 

939
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,600
okay we're going to try seek this into
the ground a little bit so doesn't pick

940
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:58,610
the ground a little bit so doesn't pick
 

941
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,940
the ground a little bit so doesn't pick
those up as much vertical space either

942
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:00,950
those up as much vertical space either
 

943
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,280
those up as much vertical space either
and then over here we need a monostable

944
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,290
and then over here we need a monostable
 

945
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,380
and then over here we need a monostable
to start it so just the sticky piston

946
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:05,390
to start it so just the sticky piston
 

947
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,730
to start it so just the sticky piston
with a block on it okay now to activate

948
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:09,740
with a block on it okay now to activate
 

949
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,800
with a block on it okay now to activate
this we're probably going to use an

950
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:11,810
this we're probably going to use an
 

951
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,200
this we're probably going to use an
observer block so every time we place a

952
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,210
observer block so every time we place a
 

953
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,180
observer block so every time we place a
sand block it will trigger um so maybe

954
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,190
sand block it will trigger um so maybe
 

955
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,100
sand block it will trigger um so maybe
let's test this first to see how it

956
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,110
let's test this first to see how it
 

957
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,550
let's test this first to see how it
works

958
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:21,560
works
 

959
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,250
works
so think we might put the orange sand

960
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:27,260
so think we might put the orange sand
 

961
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,350
so think we might put the orange sand
block on that side and yellow on this

962
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
block on that side and yellow on this
 

963
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,020
block on that side and yellow on this
side and let's just set this up so we

964
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,030
side and let's just set this up so we
 

965
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:36,100
side and let's just set this up so we
can trigger it okay do that and then a

966
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,110
can trigger it okay do that and then a
 

967
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,930
can trigger it okay do that and then a
repeater or something or duff's would

968
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:37,940
repeater or something or duff's would
 

969
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,930
repeater or something or duff's would
work even and do we have a button let's

970
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:40,940
work even and do we have a button let's
 

971
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,600
work even and do we have a button let's
make a button put that on here so will

972
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,610
make a button put that on here so will
 

973
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,840
make a button put that on here so will
this make orange or yellow sand let's

974
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:46,850
this make orange or yellow sand let's
 

975
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:51,130
this make orange or yellow sand let's
find out okay yellow sand turned into

976
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:51,140
find out okay yellow sand turned into
 

977
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,810
find out okay yellow sand turned into
orange spam that's what we want so this

978
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:52,820
orange spam that's what we want so this
 

979
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,360
orange spam that's what we want so this
is where we're going to be using it so

980
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,370
is where we're going to be using it so
 

981
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,830
is where we're going to be using it so
I'm just going to put the observer block

982
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840
I'm just going to put the observer block
 

983
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,840
I'm just going to put the observer block
like facing us here other way like over

984
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:01,850
like facing us here other way like over
 

985
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,650
like facing us here other way like over
here that will probably point into a

986
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:05,660
here that will probably point into a
 

987
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,690
here that will probably point into a
block and then go up to here so

988
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:07,700
block and then go up to here so
 

989
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,759
block and then go up to here so
break this again right and maybe put a

990
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:12,769
break this again right and maybe put a
 

991
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:15,269
break this again right and maybe put a
repeater here so this isn't connects

992
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:15,279
repeater here so this isn't connects
 

993
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:17,769
repeater here so this isn't connects
trying to build this with you so you can

994
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:17,779
trying to build this with you so you can
 

995
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:20,070
trying to build this with you so you can
see how to do it if you want copy it

996
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,080
see how to do it if you want copy it
 

997
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,970
see how to do it if you want copy it
okay something like that so I think

998
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:21,980
okay something like that so I think
 

999
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,860
okay something like that so I think
every time we place this block here now

1000
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:23,870
every time we place this block here now
 

1001
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,850
every time we place this block here now
it'll trigger

1002
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:24,860
it'll trigger
 

1003
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,029
it'll trigger
whoa that was weird oh I just pushed it

1004
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:28,039
whoa that was weird oh I just pushed it
 

1005
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,700
whoa that was weird oh I just pushed it
and then this pulled it it's like how

1006
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:30,710
and then this pulled it it's like how
 

1007
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,350
and then this pulled it it's like how
did that move it two blocks that's the

1008
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:32,360
did that move it two blocks that's the
 

1009
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:38,350
did that move it two blocks that's the
same okay so let's try this yeah that's

1010
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:38,360
same okay so let's try this yeah that's
 

1011
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,850
same okay so let's try this yeah that's
what we want so then we're going to want

1012
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:39,860
what we want so then we're going to want
 

1013
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,460
what we want so then we're going to want
the sand to fall and break right so this

1014
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:45,470
the sand to fall and break right so this
 

1015
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,149
the sand to fall and break right so this
is going to be our Center and I want a

1016
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:49,159
is going to be our Center and I want a
 

1017
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,129
is going to be our Center and I want a
bunch of storage for all the sand so we

1018
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:51,139
bunch of storage for all the sand so we
 

1019
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:53,440
bunch of storage for all the sand so we
can hopefully afk here for a while and

1020
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,450
can hopefully afk here for a while and
 

1021
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,190
can hopefully afk here for a while and
collect a bunch so probably gonna do one

1022
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,200
collect a bunch so probably gonna do one
 

1023
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,620
collect a bunch so probably gonna do one
two actually three double chests

1024
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:02,630
two actually three double chests
 

1025
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,000
two actually three double chests
probably fine we'll break the bottom one

1026
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,010
probably fine we'll break the bottom one
 

1027
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:09,070
probably fine we'll break the bottom one
here don't need that much storage even

1028
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,080
here don't need that much storage even
 

1029
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,629
here don't need that much storage even
three might be overkill I'm not sure

1030
00:23:10,629 --> 00:23:10,639
three might be overkill I'm not sure
 

1031
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,610
three might be overkill I'm not sure
then we'll have a hopper going into

1032
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:12,620
then we'll have a hopper going into
 

1033
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:18,399
then we'll have a hopper going into
these so I'm flying do something like

1034
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:18,409
these so I'm flying do something like
 

1035
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:21,460
these so I'm flying do something like
that did you guys see they announced on

1036
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:21,470
that did you guys see they announced on
 

1037
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,370
that did you guys see they announced on
the on Twitter that they're adding

1038
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:24,380
the on Twitter that they're adding
 

1039
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,169
the on Twitter that they're adding
parents to the game we're finally

1040
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:26,179
parents to the game we're finally
 

1041
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:28,980
parents to the game we're finally
getting Birds it's going to be so cool

1042
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:28,990
getting Birds it's going to be so cool
 

1043
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,889
getting Birds it's going to be so cool
that that spawn in the jungle apparently

1044
00:23:31,889 --> 00:23:31,899
that that spawn in the jungle apparently
 

1045
00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:34,560
that that spawn in the jungle apparently
so really looking forward to that

1046
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:34,570
so really looking forward to that
 

1047
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,789
so really looking forward to that
hopefully it'll be easy to get them to

1048
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:36,799
hopefully it'll be easy to get them to
 

1049
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,649
hopefully it'll be easy to get them to
spawn in and we don't have to travel

1050
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:38,659
spawn in and we don't have to travel
 

1051
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:42,490
spawn in and we don't have to travel
super far to get up oh that has to go

1052
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:42,500
super far to get up oh that has to go
 

1053
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,970
super far to get up oh that has to go
down one more block OOP okay we had it

1054
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:45,980
down one more block OOP okay we had it
 

1055
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,350
down one more block OOP okay we had it
right the first time let's see if we can

1056
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,360
right the first time let's see if we can
 

1057
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,940
right the first time let's see if we can
reach that bottom chest from up here

1058
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:48,950
reach that bottom chest from up here
 

1059
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,950
reach that bottom chest from up here
though doesn't look like this we can

1060
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:50,960
though doesn't look like this we can
 

1061
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,180
though doesn't look like this we can
reach we reach this one maybe we'll just

1062
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,190
reach we reach this one maybe we'll just
 

1063
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,279
reach we reach this one maybe we'll just
do two double chests and and call it

1064
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:57,289
do two double chests and and call it
 

1065
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:01,029
do two double chests and and call it
good that way this gets a lot simpler

1066
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:01,039
good that way this gets a lot simpler
 

1067
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,379
good that way this gets a lot simpler
and put this over here good got two

1068
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:05,389
and put this over here good got two
 

1069
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:06,700
and put this over here good got two
double chests of storage is probably

1070
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:06,710
double chests of storage is probably
 

1071
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,720
double chests of storage is probably
plenty plenty of sand and now what do we

1072
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:10,730
plenty plenty of sand and now what do we
 

1073
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,730
plenty plenty of sand and now what do we
want to do we want to be able to afk

1074
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:12,740
want to do we want to be able to afk
 

1075
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,210
want to do we want to be able to afk
here alright so our one stack of fan is

1076
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:16,220
here alright so our one stack of fan is
 

1077
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,039
here alright so our one stack of fan is
going to run out really quick here we

1078
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,049
going to run out really quick here we
 

1079
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:19,810
going to run out really quick here we
want to be able to feed ourselves more

1080
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:19,820
want to be able to feed ourselves more
 

1081
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,890
want to be able to feed ourselves more
yellow sand as

1082
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:20,900
yellow sand as
 

1083
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,180
yellow sand as
we use this so let's put in a dropper

1084
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,190
we use this so let's put in a dropper
 

1085
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,850
we use this so let's put in a dropper
maybe facing that way so they'll shoot

1086
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:27,860
maybe facing that way so they'll shoot
 

1087
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,300
maybe facing that way so they'll shoot
the sand at us and I guess let's get

1088
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:31,310
the sand at us and I guess let's get
 

1089
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,540
the sand at us and I guess let's get
some trapdoors too because we'll

1090
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:34,550
some trapdoors too because we'll
 

1091
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,920
some trapdoors too because we'll
probably have to stand on those or I

1092
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:35,930
probably have to stand on those or I
 

1093
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,020
probably have to stand on those or I
just so you'd use slabs and still be

1094
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,030
just so you'd use slabs and still be
 

1095
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,020
just so you'd use slabs and still be
able to open the chests here right yeah

1096
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,030
able to open the chests here right yeah
 

1097
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,930
able to open the chests here right yeah
that'll work too okay good

1098
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:43,940
that'll work too okay good
 

1099
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,610
that'll work too okay good
so inside here we're going to have our

1100
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:45,620
so inside here we're going to have our
 

1101
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,440
so inside here we're going to have our
sand to get sand into there or to

1102
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:50,450
sand to get sand into there or to
 

1103
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,350
sand to get sand into there or to
activate it first let's see the observer

1104
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,360
activate it first let's see the observer
 

1105
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
activate it first let's see the observer
goes into this block so then all we got

1106
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:55,370
goes into this block so then all we got
 

1107
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:00,130
goes into this block so then all we got
to do is like something like this

1108
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:00,140
to do is like something like this
 

1109
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,580
to do is like something like this
even put a block there or actually it

1110
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:03,590
even put a block there or actually it
 

1111
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,380
even put a block there or actually it
probably needs some sort of delay too so

1112
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:05,390
probably needs some sort of delay too so
 

1113
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,990
probably needs some sort of delay too so
let's let's try this first redstone dust

1114
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
let's let's try this first redstone dust
 

1115
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,480
let's let's try this first redstone dust
into it like that so now if we put down

1116
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:10,490
into it like that so now if we put down
 

1117
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,680
into it like that so now if we put down
sand what happens yeah it shoots two of

1118
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:14,690
sand what happens yeah it shoots two of
 

1119
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,180
sand what happens yeah it shoots two of
them we only want it to shoot one so

1120
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,190
them we only want it to shoot one so
 

1121
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,600
them we only want it to shoot one so
we're going to use a repeater so it will

1122
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:19,610
we're going to use a repeater so it will
 

1123
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:23,080
we're going to use a repeater so it will
hopefully only trigger once that will

1124
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,090
hopefully only trigger once that will
 

1125
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,610
hopefully only trigger once that will
probably have to be said it's like three

1126
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:24,620
probably have to be said it's like three
 

1127
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,920
probably have to be said it's like three
or four let's try it one it at one first

1128
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:28,930
or four let's try it one it at one first
 

1129
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:34,480
or four let's try it one it at one first
okay still shot twice

1130
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:34,490
okay still shot twice
 

1131
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:39,850
okay still shot twice
let's switch at two to three there we go

1132
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:39,860
let's switch at two to three there we go
 

1133
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,520
let's switch at two to three there we go
that's what we want qo so that seems to

1134
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:42,530
that's what we want qo so that seems to
 

1135
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,380
that's what we want qo so that seems to
be pretty good you get once and every

1136
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:44,390
be pretty good you get once and every
 

1137
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,050
be pretty good you get once and every
time we place the sand for extra storage

1138
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:47,060
time we place the sand for extra storage
 

1139
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,080
time we place the sand for extra storage
I'm just going to run a dropper into the

1140
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,090
I'm just going to run a dropper into the
 

1141
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,180
I'm just going to run a dropper into the
side here and then probably put like a

1142
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:52,190
side here and then probably put like a
 

1143
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,400
side here and then probably put like a
chest above that or two two double

1144
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:54,410
chest above that or two two double
 

1145
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,220
chest above that or two two double
chests here we can put another one like

1146
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,230
chests here we can put another one like
 

1147
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,340
chests here we can put another one like
this if we want all right and then fill

1148
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:00,350
this if we want all right and then fill
 

1149
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,380
this if we want all right and then fill
this up a bit for the yellow sand so to

1150
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:02,390
this up a bit for the yellow sand so to
 

1151
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,440
this up a bit for the yellow sand so to
auto-feed into us what else we got to do

1152
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,450
auto-feed into us what else we got to do
 

1153
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,770
auto-feed into us what else we got to do
here there was a problem like if we try

1154
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:08,780
here there was a problem like if we try
 

1155
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,590
here there was a problem like if we try
to hold right click here if we replace

1156
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
to hold right click here if we replace
 

1157
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,590
to hold right click here if we replace
two blocks and then it blocks the view

1158
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:13,600
two blocks and then it blocks the view
 

1159
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,120
two blocks and then it blocks the view
so if we put a sign or something here if

1160
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,130
so if we put a sign or something here if
 

1161
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,710
so if we put a sign or something here if
we build this up and then put a sign

1162
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:20,720
we build this up and then put a sign
 

1163
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,710
we build this up and then put a sign
over here then if we hold right click

1164
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:25,720
over here then if we hold right click
 

1165
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,240
over here then if we hold right click
it'll never replace an extra block

1166
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,250

 

1167
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,130

I think that's that's what we're going

1168
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:32,140
I think that's that's what we're going
 

1169
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,710
I think that's that's what we're going
to do and kind of frame this in a little

1170
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:34,720
to do and kind of frame this in a little
 

1171
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,800
to do and kind of frame this in a little
bit and probably cover this up if we

1172
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:37,810
bit and probably cover this up if we
 

1173
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,710
bit and probably cover this up if we
want and I think we're just about done

1174
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:40,720
want and I think we're just about done
 

1175
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,840
want and I think we're just about done
with this what else could we do to it I

1176
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:42,850
with this what else could we do to it I
 

1177
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,190
with this what else could we do to it I
guess we're going to want to add or

1178
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:44,200
guess we're going to want to add or
 

1179
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,870
guess we're going to want to add or
something so the mobs don't come kill us

1180
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:45,880
something so the mobs don't come kill us
 

1181
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,290
something so the mobs don't come kill us
while we're using it to and some way of

1182
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:49,300
while we're using it to and some way of
 

1183
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,910
while we're using it to and some way of
getting to our chests here so maybe a

1184
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:50,920
getting to our chests here so maybe a
 

1185
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,360
getting to our chests here so maybe a
trapdoor will work here and then do

1186
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:54,370
trapdoor will work here and then do
 

1187
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,740
trapdoor will work here and then do
something like that so we just open this

1188
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:55,750
something like that so we just open this
 

1189
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,640
something like that so we just open this
to get our stuff and close it well

1190
00:26:59,640 --> 00:26:59,650
to get our stuff and close it well
 

1191
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,320
to get our stuff and close it well
anyways guys I think we'll wrap up here

1192
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,330
anyways guys I think we'll wrap up here
 

1193
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,210
anyways guys I think we'll wrap up here
for today and we'll try decorate that

1194
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:03,220
for today and we'll try decorate that
 

1195
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,700
for today and we'll try decorate that
next episode or I'll do it off camera

1196
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:04,710
next episode or I'll do it off camera
 

1197
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,920
next episode or I'll do it off camera
but here is the comments I picked out it

1198
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:07,930
but here is the comments I picked out it
 

1199
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,290
but here is the comments I picked out it
says hey Ito have you ever thought about

1200
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:10,300
says hey Ito have you ever thought about
 

1201
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,050
says hey Ito have you ever thought about
doing a factorial let's play it's

1202
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:13,060
doing a factorial let's play it's
 

1203
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,430
doing a factorial let's play it's
definitely the kind of game you would be

1204
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:14,440
definitely the kind of game you would be
 

1205
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,900
definitely the kind of game you would be
good at and I think it would be really

1206
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:15,910
good at and I think it would be really
 

1207
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:19,230
good at and I think it would be really
interesting to watch so I have played

1208
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:19,240
interesting to watch so I have played
 

1209
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,240
interesting to watch so I have played
factorial I love the game it's a great

1210
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,250
factorial I love the game it's a great
 

1211
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,060
factorial I love the game it's a great
game I don't I don't think I'm very good

1212
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,070
game I don't I don't think I'm very good
 

1213
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,490
game I don't I don't think I'm very good
at it so like I'm not I'm not V still

1214
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:26,500
at it so like I'm not I'm not V still
 

1215
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,660
at it so like I'm not I'm not V still
level expert or anything like that so I

1216
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:30,670
level expert or anything like that so I
 

1217
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,100
level expert or anything like that so I
don't know how how good of a series I

1218
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,110
don't know how how good of a series I
 

1219
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,990
don't know how how good of a series I
could actually do on it I would struggle

1220
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,000
could actually do on it I would struggle
 

1221
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,250
could actually do on it I would struggle
quite a bit kind of like as a more of a

1222
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:38,260
quite a bit kind of like as a more of a
 

1223
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,840
quite a bit kind of like as a more of a
learning series than me telling you how

1224
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:39,850
learning series than me telling you how
 

1225
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,820
learning series than me telling you how
to play the game really well or anything

1226
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:41,830
to play the game really well or anything
 

1227
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,320
to play the game really well or anything
like that

1228
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:43,330
like that
 

1229
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,540
like that
a lot of people have asked for a series

1230
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:45,550
a lot of people have asked for a series
 

1231
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,510
a lot of people have asked for a series
on it but yeah I'm not sure not sure

1232
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:48,520
on it but yeah I'm not sure not sure
 

1233
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,660
on it but yeah I'm not sure not sure
about that I have considered playing

1234
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:50,670
about that I have considered playing
 

1235
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,830
about that I have considered playing
rimworld though that's a game I'm

1236
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:52,840
rimworld though that's a game I'm
 

1237
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,180
rimworld though that's a game I'm
actually good at and it's very

1238
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:54,190
actually good at and it's very
 

1239
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,870
actually good at and it's very
complicated kind of like factorial also

1240
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:57,880
complicated kind of like factorial also
 

1241
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,120
complicated kind of like factorial also
oxygen not included just came out

1242
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,130
oxygen not included just came out
 

1243
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,010
oxygen not included just came out
recently too so I might do a series on

1244
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:02,020
recently too so I might do a series on
 

1245
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,500
recently too so I might do a series on
that like a short one it's a little bit

1246
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:04,510
that like a short one it's a little bit
 

1247
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,630
that like a short one it's a little bit
simpler than rimworld but a similar kind

1248
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:06,640
simpler than rimworld but a similar kind
 

1249
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,880
simpler than rimworld but a similar kind
of game uh-huh

1250
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:08,890
of game uh-huh
 

1251
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,740
of game uh-huh
