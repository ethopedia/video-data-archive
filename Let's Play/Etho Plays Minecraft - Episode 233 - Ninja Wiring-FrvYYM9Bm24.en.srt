00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:12,499
our lamps I also removed a whole bunch
 

163
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:17,919
our lamps I also removed a whole bunch
of the torches already so I don't know I

164
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:17,929
of the torches already so I don't know I
 

165
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:20,019
of the torches already so I don't know I
maybe went a little overboard with the

166
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:20,029
maybe went a little overboard with the
 

167
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:23,499
maybe went a little overboard with the
lights but you need them like you gotta

168
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:23,509
lights but you need them like you gotta
 

169
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,659
lights but you need them like you gotta
light the place up so they kind of have

170
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:25,669
light the place up so they kind of have
 

171
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:34,479
light the place up so they kind of have
to be fairly close to each other and the

172
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:34,489
to be fairly close to each other and the
 

173
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:36,729
to be fairly close to each other and the
general rule is like it I got like a

174
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:36,739
general rule is like it I got like a
 

175
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:38,049
general rule is like it I got like a
little spacing leaf there's a house

176
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:38,059
little spacing leaf there's a house
 

177
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:39,100
little spacing leaf there's a house
there's going to be at least two one

178
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,110
there's going to be at least two one
 

179
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,809
there's going to be at least two one
block spacing usually and between the

180
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:42,819
block spacing usually and between the
 

181
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:48,129
block spacing usually and between the
the lamps here there there's six blocks

182
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:48,139
the lamps here there there's six blocks
 

183
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:50,379
the lamps here there there's six blocks
of parts while there's a five block gap

184
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:50,389
of parts while there's a five block gap
 

185
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:54,609
of parts while there's a five block gap
between one two three four five there's

186
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:54,619
between one two three four five there's
 

187
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:56,589
between one two three four five there's
ever a cross section with a walkway I

188
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:56,599
ever a cross section with a walkway I
 

189
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:03,239
ever a cross section with a walkway I
got it aligned diagonally one block out

190
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:03,249
got it aligned diagonally one block out
 

191
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:06,009
got it aligned diagonally one block out
except over here this is a little bit of

192
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:06,019
except over here this is a little bit of
 

193
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:10,179
except over here this is a little bit of
a problem there overall I think it's

194
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:10,189
a problem there overall I think it's
 

195
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:18,999
a problem there overall I think it's
okay how's that looking so I did bring I

196
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:19,009
okay how's that looking so I did bring I
 

197
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,049
okay how's that looking so I did bring I
brought a whole bunch of different half

198
00:07:20,049 --> 00:07:20,059
brought a whole bunch of different half
 

199
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:21,819
brought a whole bunch of different half
slabs I want to try out I figure we're

200
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:21,829
slabs I want to try out I figure we're
 

201
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:24,009
slabs I want to try out I figure we're
most likely going to go with the stone

202
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:24,019
most likely going to go with the stone
 

203
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:25,779
most likely going to go with the stone
ones but doesn't hurt to try other

204
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:25,789
ones but doesn't hurt to try other
 

205
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:31,600
ones but doesn't hurt to try other
things and sandstone so let's go with

206
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:31,610
things and sandstone so let's go with
 

207
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:39,159
things and sandstone so let's go with
regular wood first okay those are kind

208
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,169
regular wood first okay those are kind
 

209
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:44,129
regular wood first okay those are kind
of cool actually I kind of like that

00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,110

 

215
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:59,059

that's kind of cool to know and still

216
00:07:59,059 --> 00:07:59,069

yeah we got two dispensers this thing is
 

291
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,300
yeah we got two dispensers this thing is
for the furnace minecarts there's a

292
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,310
for the furnace minecarts there's a
 

293
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,060
for the furnace minecarts there's a
button here send them out

294
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,070
button here send them out
 

295
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,530
button here send them out
oh you know what we could do we could

296
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:30,540
oh you know what we could do we could
 

297
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,050
oh you know what we could do we could
have coal in this one

298
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,060
have coal in this one
 

299
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,079
have coal in this one
yeah because we'll need coal somewhere a

300
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,089
yeah because we'll need coal somewhere a
 

301
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:38,569
yeah because we'll need coal somewhere a
lot of this is over the top and really

302
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:38,579
lot of this is over the top and really
 

303
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:42,050
lot of this is over the top and really
unnecessary but that's why I liked it so

304
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:42,060
unnecessary but that's why I liked it so
 

305
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,579
unnecessary but that's why I liked it so
yeah we'll have a coal dispenser and

weakness dispensers underground
 

331
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:28,590
weakness dispensers underground
somewhere we're kind of limited because

332
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:28,600
somewhere we're kind of limited because
 

333
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,819
somewhere we're kind of limited because
there's already a lot of wiring around

lighting glitch unless we remove the
 

397
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:45,600
lighting glitch unless we remove the
blocks above it - mm we'll try that out

398
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:45,610
blocks above it - mm we'll try that out
 

399
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,920
blocks above it - mm we'll try that out
I'll work on that and also here maybe

400
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:49,930
I'll work on that and also here maybe
 

401
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,769
I'll work on that and also here maybe
we'll do a really sloped staircase to go

402

we'll do a really sloped staircase to go
 

403
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:57,389
we'll do a really sloped staircase to go
up so again we'll try the same thing

404
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:57,399
up so again we'll try the same thing
 

405
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,590
up so again we'll try the same thing

you know it feels like an instant to you

430
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:02,139
you know it feels like an instant to you

437
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,960
I'd say at least two hours a ridiculous
amount of time trying to wire this thing

438
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:12,970
amount of time trying to wire this thing
 

439
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,189
amount of time trying to wire this thing
and got it done really happy with how it

440
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
and got it done really happy with how it
 

441
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,900
and got it done really happy with how it
turned out it was really tough to do

turned out it was really tough to do
 

443
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,199
turned out it was really tough to do
because there's so much stuff like a lot

444
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:22,209
because there's so much stuff like a lot
 

445
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,000
because there's so much stuff like a lot
of things to take into consideration we

446
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,010
of things to take into consideration we
 

447
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,850
of things to take into consideration we
got to we got to power this we got to

448
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:26,860
got to we got to power this we got to
 

449
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,980

455
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,850
independently we got wiring for these
trip wires we got a piston thing above

456
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:35,860
trip wires we got a piston thing above
 

457
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,720
trip wires we got a piston thing above
here so there's a lot to each of these

you it actually let's go let's go here
 

469
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,980
you it actually let's go let's go here
first so this is the master panel

470
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:00,990
first so this is the master panel
 

471
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,199
first so this is the master panel
there's two options we've added here the

472

481
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:16,410
potions to the zombie villagers that's
going to be in these dispensers here I

482
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:16,420
going to be in these dispensers here I
 

483
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,750
going to be in these dispensers here I
did manage to get at work with a second

484
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:18,760
did manage to get at work with a second
 

485
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,590
did manage to get at work with a second
dispenser there

486
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:20,600
dispenser there
 

487
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,990
dispenser there
and so we gotta fill those up with

488
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,000
and so we gotta fill those up with
 

489
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,910
and so we gotta fill those up with
weakness potions if we press this it'll

490
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
weakness potions if we press this it'll
 

491
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,370
weakness potions if we press this it'll
shoot out weakness potions only if

492
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:30,380
shoot out weakness potions only if
 

493
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,700
shoot out weakness potions only if
there's a mob in this area if this trip

494
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:33,710
there's a mob in this area if this trip
 

495
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:39,160
there's a mob in this area if this trip
wires down or active or whatever so it's

496
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,170
wires down or active or whatever so it's
 

497
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,360
wires down or active or whatever so it's
like a sort of self intelligent system

498
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,370
like a sort of self intelligent system
 

499
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:48,460
like a sort of self intelligent system
thanks to the wiring so this this button

500
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,470
thanks to the wiring so this this button
 

501
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,830
thanks to the wiring so this this button
I decide I would run the redstone wiring

502
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:50,840
I decide I would run the redstone wiring
 

503
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,680
I decide I would run the redstone wiring
around the outside of all of this so

504
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:53,690
around the outside of all of this so
 

505
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:59,800
around the outside of all of this so
let's go check that out oh please don't

506
00:16:59,800 --> 00:16:59,810
let's go check that out oh please don't
 

507
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,770
let's go check that out oh please don't
be any creepers I had one down here

508
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:02,780
be any creepers I had one down here
 

509
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,060
be any creepers I had one down here
already yeah so this is running all

510
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,070
already yeah so this is running all
 

511
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,460
already yeah so this is running all
around the outside let's just start from

512
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:09,470
around the outside let's just start from
 

513
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,800
around the outside let's just start from
the beginning oh and thank goodness we

514
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:14,810
the beginning oh and thank goodness we
 

515
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,199
the beginning oh and thank goodness we
did all that redstone harvesting today

516
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:17,209
did all that redstone harvesting today
 

517
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,130
did all that redstone harvesting today
because I used a ton on this alright the

518
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:21,140
because I used a ton on this alright the
 

519
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,439
because I used a ton on this alright the
other buttons right above there goes to

520
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:23,449
other buttons right above there goes to
 

521
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:26,410
other buttons right above there goes to
this wire and it goes down here runs

522
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:26,420
this wire and it goes down here runs
 

523
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,480
this wire and it goes down here runs
along and then it branches off to this

524
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:31,490
along and then it branches off to this
 

525
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:37,810
along and then it branches off to this
redstone torch and this redstone here is

526
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:37,820
redstone torch and this redstone here is
 

527
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,350
redstone torch and this redstone here is
connected to the tripwire stuff so if

528
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
connected to the tripwire stuff so if
 

529
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,320
connected to the tripwire stuff so if
the trip wires active this redstone is

530
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,330
the trip wires active this redstone is
 

531
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,970
the trip wires active this redstone is
active and it goes to this redstone

532
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:45,980
active and it goes to this redstone
 

533
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,510
active and it goes to this redstone
torch and these two make a NAND gate

534
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
torch and these two make a NAND gate
 

535
00:17:49,520 --> 00:18:00,430
torch and these two make a NAND gate
that goes up here and then I gotta get

536
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:00,440
that goes up here and then I gotta get
 

537
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,580
that goes up here and then I gotta get
up there I guess we'll just use that

538
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:02,590
up there I guess we'll just use that
 

539
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,860
up there I guess we'll just use that
that torch goes up to this redstone wire

540
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:05,870
that torch goes up to this redstone wire
 

541
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,860
that torch goes up to this redstone wire
this repeater and this is I have to be

542
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:08,870
this repeater and this is I have to be
 

543
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,280
this repeater and this is I have to be
very careful how I do this here because

544
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,290
very careful how I do this here because
 

545
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,260
very careful how I do this here because
this is the dispenser the weakness

546
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:14,270
this is the dispenser the weakness
 

547
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,900
this is the dispenser the weakness
potions are going to be in but over here

548
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:16,910
potions are going to be in but over here
 

549
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,410
potions are going to be in but over here
is also minecart one and dispensers are

550
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:20,420
is also minecart one and dispensers are
 

551
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,300
is also minecart one and dispensers are
very picky how you power them if you

552
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:22,310
very picky how you power them if you
 

553
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,660
very picky how you power them if you
don't do it right they'll shoot on

554
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:24,670
don't do it right they'll shoot on
 

555
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:29,260
don't do it right they'll shoot on
redstone updates so with the way that

556
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,270
redstone updates so with the way that
 

557
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,540
redstone updates so with the way that
goes it goes through a block to the

558
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:31,550
goes it goes through a block to the
 

559
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,090
goes it goes through a block to the
dispenser if I had the repeater right up

560
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:34,100
dispenser if I had the repeater right up
 

561
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,649
dispenser if I had the repeater right up
against

562
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:34,659
against
 

563
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:36,960
against
it would activate both of them which

564
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:36,970
it would activate both of them which
 

565
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,089
it would activate both of them which
would be it a no-no this also though I

566
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:41,099
would be it a no-no this also though I
 

567
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,560
would be it a no-no this also though I
don't really want this but it powers

568
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:43,570
don't really want this but it powers
 

569
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,599
don't really want this but it powers
this piston above which we don't really

570
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:48,609
this piston above which we don't really
 

571
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,489
this piston above which we don't really
want but it doesn't matter thankfully

572
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:50,499
want but it doesn't matter thankfully
 

573
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:53,609
want but it doesn't matter thankfully
because that this piston will be

574
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:53,619
because that this piston will be
 

575
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:56,509
because that this piston will be
extended if there's a mob in there so it

576
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:56,519
extended if there's a mob in there so it
 

577
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,830
extended if there's a mob in there so it
so it'll send power to it while it's

578
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:58,840
so it'll send power to it while it's
 

579
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,659
so it'll send power to it while it's
already extended and won't really do

580
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:00,669
already extended and won't really do
 

581
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:04,619
already extended and won't really do
anything thankfully so yeah that runs

582
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:04,629
anything thankfully so yeah that runs
 

583
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:09,869
anything thankfully so yeah that runs
all along here all those and it's a long

584
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:09,879
all along here all those and it's a long
 

585
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:14,940
all along here all those and it's a long
wire very long wire because it's running

586
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:14,950
wire very long wire because it's running
 

587
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:20,190
wire very long wire because it's running
on the outside and it ends right here so

588
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:20,200
on the outside and it ends right here so
 

589
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,139
on the outside and it ends right here so
there's six of these units that we have

590
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:22,149
there's six of these units that we have
 

591
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:29,909
there's six of these units that we have
to take care of did some framedrops okay

592
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919
to take care of did some framedrops okay
 

593
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,969
to take care of did some framedrops okay
now the other one is the villager

594
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:31,979
now the other one is the villager
 

595
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:34,710
now the other one is the villager
transports and this will send a minecart

596
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
transports and this will send a minecart
 

597
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,889
transports and this will send a minecart
out of the bottom dispenser and it also

598
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:39,899
out of the bottom dispenser and it also
 

599
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:43,049
out of the bottom dispenser and it also
will power this track for a little while

600
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:43,059
will power this track for a little while
 

601
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,930
will power this track for a little while
so that the minecart will go forward and

602
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:45,940
so that the minecart will go forward and
 

603
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,330
so that the minecart will go forward and
pick up the villager and then go down

604
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:48,340
pick up the villager and then go down
 

605
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,519
pick up the villager and then go down
the track so we have to power two

606
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:50,529
the track so we have to power two
 

607
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:52,889
the track so we have to power two
different things with this button and we

608
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:52,899
different things with this button and we
 

609
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:56,369
different things with this button and we
also have to do a check if there's a

610
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:56,379
also have to do a check if there's a
 

611
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:58,169
also have to do a check if there's a
villager in there so we don't send out a

612
00:19:58,169 --> 00:19:58,179
villager in there so we don't send out a
 

613
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:02,249
villager in there so we don't send out a
minecarts if there isn't so that gets

614
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:02,259
minecarts if there isn't so that gets
 

615
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:05,849
minecarts if there isn't so that gets
pretty complicated also so the buttons

616
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:05,859
pretty complicated also so the buttons
 

617
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:08,789
pretty complicated also so the buttons
right above here goes this redstone it's

618
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:08,799
right above here goes this redstone it's
 

619
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,009
right above here goes this redstone it's
stone torch and then there's this stuff

620
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:14,019
stone torch and then there's this stuff
 

621
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:16,589
stone torch and then there's this stuff
here this was the toughest part to

622
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:16,599
here this was the toughest part to
 

623
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,589
here this was the toughest part to
figure out but it's really really nice

624
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:19,599
figure out but it's really really nice
 

625
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,940
figure out but it's really really nice
how I got it

626
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:20,950
how I got it
 

627
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:28,099
how I got it
so this let's see where do we start from

628
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:28,109

 

629
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:31,289

this is the wire for the tripwire right

630
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:31,299
this is the wire for the tripwire right
 

631
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:33,509
this is the wire for the tripwire right
here you got going through some

632
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:33,519
here you got going through some
 

633
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,969
here you got going through some
repeaters these torches are for the

634
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:38,979
repeaters these torches are for the
 

635
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:43,619
repeaters these torches are for the
glowstone lamps above so goes to that

636
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:43,629
glowstone lamps above so goes to that
 

637
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:47,009
glowstone lamps above so goes to that
also sends power down here and then into

638
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:47,019

figure out is where I'm gonna put some

682
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:06,820
figure out is where I'm gonna put some
 

683
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,970

chests in this place and I just came up

684
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:08,980
chests in this place and I just came up
 

685
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,440
chests in this place and I just came up
with an idea I think what we should do

686
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,450
with an idea I think what we should do
 

687
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,040
with an idea I think what we should do
if he hits me in the back I'm gonna mad

688
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,050
if he hits me in the back I'm gonna mad
 

689
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:25,490
if he hits me in the back I'm gonna mad
so mad I say we need more we need more

690
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:25,500

 

691
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,799

gonna have for chess

692
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:29,809

 

693
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:32,799

and maybe the crafting table over there

694
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:32,809
and maybe the crafting table over there
 

695
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,409
and maybe the crafting table over there
too I think it would be good a good spot

696
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:35,419
too I think it would be good a good spot
 

697
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:39,219
too I think it would be good a good spot
over here I put these this these iron

698
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:39,229
over here I put these this these iron
 

699
00:22:39,229 --> 00:22:41,649
over here I put these this these iron
bars here to kind of match this but you

700
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:41,659
bars here to kind of match this but you
 

701
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:45,399
bars here to kind of match this but you
know we don't need them really it's not

702
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:45,409
know we don't need them really it's not
 

703
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:50,259
know we don't need them really it's not
like you're going to fall off here yeah

704
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:50,269
like you're going to fall off here yeah
 

705
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:52,779
like you're going to fall off here yeah
let's try chess here and see what that

706
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:52,789
let's try chess here and see what that
 

707
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,200
let's try chess here and see what that
looks like

708
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,210

 

709
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,680

then we could either connect this with

710
00:22:59,680 --> 00:22:59,690
then we could either connect this with
 

711
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:07,229
then we could either connect this with
that that would probably look better or

712
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:07,239
that that would probably look better or
 

713
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:11,200
that that would probably look better or
put a crafting table here because we

714
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,210
put a crafting table here because we
 

715
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,959
put a crafting table here because we
don't have any of those anywhere either

716
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:15,969

 

717
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:20,289

yeah then we can use this for storing

718
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:20,299
yeah then we can use this for storing
 

719
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,599
yeah then we can use this for storing
potions or apples or anything we need

720
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:22,609
potions or apples or anything we need
 

721
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:34,829
potions or apples or anything we need
down here minecarts Yahoo nice cool

722
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:34,839

 

723
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:37,269

things about up and running I don't

724
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:37,279
things about up and running I don't
 

725
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,810
things about up and running I don't
think we have time to try it out today I

726
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:39,820
think we have time to try it out today I
 

727
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,609
think we have time to try it out today I
still got to get a whole bunch of stuff

728
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:42,619
still got to get a whole bunch of stuff
 

729
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:45,549
still got to get a whole bunch of stuff
here I got it yet mine carts and

730
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:45,559
here I got it yet mine carts and
 

731

might put like an item frame here coal

738
00:23:57,129 --> 00:23:57,139
might put like an item frame here coal
 

739
00:23:57,139 --> 00:24:00,310
might put like an item frame here coal
got your coal here so work on that and

got your coal here so work on that and
 

741
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,039
got your coal here so work on that and
then next time we'll probably be able to

742
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:03,049
then next time we'll probably be able to
 

743
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:09,239
then next time we'll probably be able to
see this working zombie or zombie

744
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:09,249
see this working zombie or zombie
 

745
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:14,409
see this working zombie or zombie
villagers they all go underneath and fix

746
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:14,419
villagers they all go underneath and fix
 

747
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,119

sec let me get stone brick they convert

752
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:24,469
sec let me get stone brick they convert
 

753
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:27,609

in three to five minutes I'm fairly

754
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:27,619
in three to five minutes I'm fairly
 

755
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:30,070
in three to five minutes I'm fairly
certain it that's what it is random time

756
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
certain it that's what it is random time
 

757
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,070
certain it that's what it is random time
between three and five minutes I'm host

found out something really cool though

760
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:34,549
found out something really cool though
 

761
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:36,399
found out something really cool though
that the other day looking at the game

762
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:36,409
that the other day looking at the game
 

763
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:42,759
that the other day looking at the game
code that there isn't

764
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:42,769
code that there isn't
 

765
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:47,299
code that there isn't
speak speak they can convert faster they

766
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:47,309
speak speak they can convert faster they
 

767
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:49,129
speak speak they can convert faster they
have a chance of converting faster if

768
00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:49,139
have a chance of converting faster if
 

769
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:54,769
have a chance of converting faster if
there's there's iron bars or beds around

770
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:54,779
there's there's iron bars or beds around
 

771
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:57,590

the zombie villager can shave some time

772
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600
the zombie villager can shave some time
 

773
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,759
the zombie villager can shave some time
off the conversion speed so if I want to

774
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:01,769
off the conversion speed so if I want to
 

775
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:04,490
off the conversion speed so if I want to
optimize this even more I can put some

776
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:04,500
optimize this even more I can put some
 

777
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,820
optimize this even more I can put some
iron bars around those holding areas and

778
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:07,830
iron bars around those holding areas and
 

779
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,129
iron bars around those holding areas and
they'll convert richer which might be

780
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:10,139
they'll convert richer which might be
 

781
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:13,460
they'll convert richer which might be
cool don't know if I'll do it but that's

782
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:13,470
cool don't know if I'll do it but that's
 

783
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,629
cool don't know if I'll do it but that's
something else we could do

784
00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:16,639

 

785
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:18,980

don't I think that's what's causing it

796
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,450
don't I think that's what's causing it
 

797
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,970
don't I think that's what's causing it
basically I can't watch youtube videos

798
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:37,980

YouTube has always been more about the

960
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,210
YouTube has always been more about the
 

961
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,070
YouTube has always been more about the
game and not about me so you should be

962
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,080
game and not about me so you should be
 

963
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,570
game and not about me so you should be
looking at what I'm doing in the game

964
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:03,580
looking at what I'm doing in the game
 

965
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:10,680
looking at what I'm doing in the game
not at me and yeah so no real need to do

966
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:10,690
not at me and yeah so no real need to do
 

967
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,210
not at me and yeah so no real need to do

it in my opinion not that I really care
 

969
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,769
it in my opinion not that I really care
although I do somewhat now the thing is

970
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:19,779
although I do somewhat now the thing is
 

971
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:21,509
although I do somewhat now the thing is
a lot of people have said they don't

972
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:21,519
a lot of people have said they don't
 

973
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,029

want to see it some don't so it kind of
 

977
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,789
want to see it some don't so it kind of
cancels out the whole request because I

978
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:29,799
cancels out the whole request because I
 

979
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:32,610
cancels out the whole request because I
don't want to have some people see it if

980
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:32,620
don't want to have some people see it if
 

981
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,060
don't want to have some people see it if
they don't want to and yeah I could hide

982
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,070
they don't want to and yeah I could hide
 

983
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,190
they don't want to and yeah I could hide
it somewhere or warn them that I'm

984
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:38,200

00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,080
showing it but you know they're going to
 

987
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,980
