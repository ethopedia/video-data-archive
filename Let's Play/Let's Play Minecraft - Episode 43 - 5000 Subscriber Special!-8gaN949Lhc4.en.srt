um other issue I wanted to talk about
 

95
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,660
um other issue I wanted to talk about
was I asked you guys his opinion on the

96
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:38,670
was I asked you guys his opinion on the
 

97
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,680

versus the chandelier type things I'm
 

101
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,820
versus the chandelier type things I'm
about 50/50 on them I could go either

102
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:49,830
about 50/50 on them I could go either
 

103
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,050

left it with you guys and you guys
 

107
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,680
left it with you guys and you guys
pretty much won 50/50 - I think a few

108
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:00,690
pretty much won 50/50 - I think a few
 

109
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,600
pretty much won 50/50 - I think a few
more of you preferred the chandeliers

110
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:02,610
more of you preferred the chandeliers
 

111
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:10,100
more of you preferred the chandeliers
but it was pretty close and so since it

112
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,110
but it was pretty close and so since it
 

113
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,180
but it was pretty close and so since it
was so close rather than making a choice

114
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,190
was so close rather than making a choice
 

115

we are going to leave it up to chance

118
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:19,829
we are going to leave it up to chance
 

119
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,080
we are going to leave it up to chance
and I'm giving chandeliers odds so

120
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,090
and I'm giving chandeliers odds so
 

121
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,800
and I'm giving chandeliers odds so
because I think more people prefer them

122
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:26,810
because I think more people prefer them
 

123
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,690
because I think more people prefer them
so five out of nine chances we're going

124
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:29,700
so five out of nine chances we're going
 

125
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,520
so five out of nine chances we're going
with chandeliers here four out of nine

126
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:31,530
with chandeliers here four out of nine
 

127
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:37,310
with chandeliers here four out of nine
that we're going with the torches here

128
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,320
that we're going with the torches here
 

129
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,870
that we're going with the torches here
we go torches win we're going with

130
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:41,880
we go torches win we're going with
 

131
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:51,610
we go torches win we're going with
torches and that's all there is to that

132
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:51,620
torches and that's all there is to that

probably shouldn't leave it up to chance

136
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,050
probably shouldn't leave it up to chance
 

137
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,909
probably shouldn't leave it up to chance

00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
underneath the cannons which is close to
 

323
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,470
underneath the cannons which is close to
another thousand so altogether this was

324
00:12:59,470 --> 00:12:59,480
another thousand so altogether this was
 

325
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,030
another thousand so altogether this was
about 2,000 redstone it's my biggest

326
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,040
about 2,000 redstone it's my biggest
 

327
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,460
about 2,000 redstone it's my biggest
redstone project yet this is all made

328
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:06,470
redstone project yet this is all made
 

329
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,480
redstone project yet this is all made
legitimately now embed it or mcedit or

330
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:10,490
legitimately now embed it or mcedit or
 

331
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:16,800
legitimately now embed it or mcedit or
anything like that took several hours

332
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:16,810

 

333
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,740

takes 185 tnt to load all the cannons

334
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:20,750
takes 185 tnt to load all the cannons
 

335
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:32,100
takes 185 tnt to load all the cannons
five each let's go check the mounts

336
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,110

 

337
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,990

actually what I'm going to set them up

338
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,000
actually what I'm going to set them up
 

339
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,610
actually what I'm going to set them up
first finish setting them up and then

340
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:36,620
first finish setting them up and then
 

341
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,720
first finish setting them up and then
we'll check them out and all alright

342
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:40,730
we'll check them out and all alright
 

343
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,179
we'll check them out and all alright
guys we are back and ready to roll here

344
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:45,189
guys we are back and ready to roll here
 

345
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:47,530
guys we are back and ready to roll here
if you're wondering what I was doing I

346
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:47,540
if you're wondering what I was doing I
 

347
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,030
if you're wondering what I was doing I
was doing a couple things I'm going to

348
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,040
was doing a couple things I'm going to
 

349
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,290
was doing a couple things I'm going to
show you something with these cannons so

350
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:56,300
show you something with these cannons so
 

351
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,619
show you something with these cannons so
every cannon has four boosters and a

352
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:02,629
every cannon has four boosters and a
 

353
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:05,139
every cannon has four boosters and a
projectile which goes in the middle here

354
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:05,149
projectile which goes in the middle here
 

355
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:16,600
projectile which goes in the middle here
I am gonna demonstrate one

356
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:16,610

 

357
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,700

this is like the most efficient design I

358
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:19,710
this is like the most efficient design I
 

359
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,240
this is like the most efficient design I
could come up with and it's not really

360
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,250
could come up with and it's not really
 

361
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,150
could come up with and it's not really
my design I'm sure this has been done

362
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
my design I'm sure this has been done
 

363
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:35,620
my design I'm sure this has been done
before but yeah you load it like this

364
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:35,630

 

365
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,170

those are the boosters then you post put

366
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:39,180
those are the boosters then you post put
 

367
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,100
those are the boosters then you post put
the projectile here and it's ready to

368
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,110
the projectile here and it's ready to
 

369
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,680
the projectile here and it's ready to
roll every cannon has its own button

370
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:45,690
roll every cannon has its own button
 

371
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,500
roll every cannon has its own button
they can each one to be individually

372
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:48,510
they can each one to be individually
 

373
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,170
they can each one to be individually
fired because each one has its own

374
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:51,180
fired because each one has its own
 

375
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,000
fired because each one has its own
timing system as well over here six

376
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,010
timing system as well over here six
 

377
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:02,450
timing system as well over here six
repeaters every cannon sends its this

378
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:02,460
repeaters every cannon sends its this
 

379
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,030
repeaters every cannon sends its this
wire here which transfers power through

380
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
wire here which transfers power through
 

381
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,880
wire here which transfers power through
this block to the TNT when I originally

382
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:07,890
this block to the TNT when I originally
 

383
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,070
this block to the TNT when I originally
made these I had four glass blocks all

384
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,080
made these I had four glass blocks all
 

385
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,579
made these I had four glass blocks all
around and I found out that to power

386
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:13,589
around and I found out that to power
 

387
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:16,670
around and I found out that to power
doesn't transmit through glass blocks to

388
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:16,680
doesn't transmit through glass blocks to
 

389
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,360
doesn't transmit through glass blocks to
the TNT so I had to change every single

390
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,370
the TNT so I had to change every single
 

391
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,430
the TNT so I had to change every single
cannon but yeah so what I was doing is I

392
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
cannon but yeah so what I was doing is I
 

393
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,949
cannon but yeah so what I was doing is I
was randomizing all these times here I

394
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:27,959
was randomizing all these times here I
 

395
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:32,050
was randomizing all these times here I
tried to give each one kind of a random

396
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,060
tried to give each one kind of a random
 

397
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,870
tried to give each one kind of a random
time and also as randomizing the timer's

398
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
time and also as randomizing the timer's
 

399
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,980
time and also as randomizing the timer's
below the cannons which you will see

400
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:42,990
below the cannons which you will see
 

401
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:53,510
below the cannons which you will see
soon this is what it can does pretty

402
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:53,520
soon this is what it can does pretty
 

403
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,290
soon this is what it can does pretty
cool so we're going to walk through the

404
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:57,300
cool so we're going to walk through the
 

405
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:57,890
cool so we're going to walk through the
cannons

406
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:57,900
cannons
 

407
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,460
cannons
I've also I was also backing up the

408
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:01,470
I've also I was also backing up the
 

409
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,230
I've also I was also backing up the
world because as soon as we're done here

410
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:03,240
world because as soon as we're done here
 

411
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,010
world because as soon as we're done here
I'm going to reload it so that I get all

412
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,020
I'm going to reload it so that I get all
 

413
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,550
I'm going to reload it so that I get all
the TNT back and you might say that's

414
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
the TNT back and you might say that's
 

415
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
the TNT back and you might say that's
cheating but I don't think it is because

416
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:12,810
cheating but I don't think it is because
 

417
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,949
cheating but I don't think it is because
we're doing this for fun if I was for

418
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:15,959
we're doing this for fun if I was for
 

419
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,310
we're doing this for fun if I was for
example using TNT to haul out a big

420
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:19,320
example using TNT to haul out a big
 

421
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,010
example using TNT to haul out a big
cavern to save time on the ground

422
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,020
cavern to save time on the ground
 

423
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,820
cavern to save time on the ground
if I backed up my world after doing that

424
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:24,830
if I backed up my world after doing that
 

425
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,860
if I backed up my world after doing that
I would get the TNT back but none of the

426
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:27,870
I would get the TNT back but none of the
 

427
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,019
I would get the TNT back but none of the
work none of the work would be done so

428
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:30,029
work none of the work would be done so
 

429
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:33,829
work none of the work would be done so
if the TNT is actually being used for

430
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:33,839
if the TNT is actually being used for
 

431
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,030
if the TNT is actually being used for
something useful I can't go back but

432
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,040
something useful I can't go back but
 

433
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,010
something useful I can't go back but
this is just for fun it's we're not

434
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,020
this is just for fun it's we're not
 

435
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,870
this is just for fun it's we're not
doing anything useful so I don't think

436
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:41,880
doing anything useful so I don't think
 

437
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,090
doing anything useful so I don't think
there's anything wrong with reverting

438
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:44,100
there's anything wrong with reverting
 

439
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,610
there's anything wrong with reverting
back so we're just going to load up all

440
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:49,620
back so we're just going to load up all
 

441
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,610
back so we're just going to load up all
the cannons and then I'll go through and

442
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:54,620
the cannons and then I'll go through and
 

443
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,790
the cannons and then I'll go through and
I didn't want to reveal your names

444
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
I didn't want to reveal your names
 

445
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,740
I didn't want to reveal your names
because I'm sure not everybody wants

446
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:00,750
because I'm sure not everybody wants
 

447
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,819
because I'm sure not everybody wants
their name posted on the internet so

448
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:04,829
their name posted on the internet so
 

449
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:07,069
their name posted on the internet so
I've just put your initials your first

450
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,079
I've just put your initials your first
 

451
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:12,260
I've just put your initials your first
name last name so you know what you can

452
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,270
name last name so you know what you can
 

453
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,569
name last name so you know what you can
then is yours and I tried to make all

454
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:17,579
then is yours and I tried to make all
 

455
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,829
then is yours and I tried to make all
the cannons because someone asked that I

456
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
the cannons because someone asked that I
 

457
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,679
the cannons because someone asked that I
make them a wool cannon and I thought

458
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:24,689
make them a wool cannon and I thought
 

459
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:26,360
make them a wool cannon and I thought
that was kind of a funny idea so I'd

460
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:26,370
that was kind of a funny idea so I'd
 

461
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,060
that was kind of a funny idea so I'd
wait I tried to make every single one

462
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,070
wait I tried to make every single one
 

463
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:38,580
wait I tried to make every single one
unique

464
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:38,590

 

465
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,320

and originally I wanted to make every

466
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:43,330
and originally I wanted to make every
 

467
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,860
and originally I wanted to make every
candidate a different design but that

468
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:45,870
candidate a different design but that
 

469
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,330
candidate a different design but that
would have been way too hard because

470
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:48,340
would have been way too hard because
 

471
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,909
would have been way too hard because
just doing every single one the same was

472
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:50,919
just doing every single one the same was
 

473
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,239
just doing every single one the same was
pretty hard and I didn't have enough

474
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:54,249
pretty hard and I didn't have enough
 

475
00:17:54,249 --> 00:18:01,379
pretty hard and I didn't have enough
redstone to be messing around I actually

476
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:01,389
redstone to be messing around I actually
 

477
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:03,899
redstone to be messing around I actually
only have I have less than 2 stacks the

478
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:03,909
only have I have less than 2 stacks the
 

479
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:06,149
only have I have less than 2 stacks the
redstone left I use my whole supply on

480
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:06,159
redstone left I use my whole supply on
 

481
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:24,070
redstone left I use my whole supply on

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,279
it yeah I would had to clear out the
area which we were taking forever the

648
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:58,289
area which we were taking forever the
 

649
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:00,529
area which we were taking forever the
other thing is it was 20 blocks or so

650
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:00,539
other thing is it was 20 blocks or so
 

651
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:04,340
other thing is it was 20 blocks or so
below sea level so most of the height

652
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:04,350
below sea level so most of the height
 

653
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,279
below sea level so most of the height
was lost it was only shooting like ten

654
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:07,289
was lost it was only shooting like ten
 

655
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:12,019
was lost it was only shooting like ten
blocks out of the water at best I think

656
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:12,029
blocks out of the water at best I think
 

657
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:17,419
blocks out of the water at best I think
you know why you get the redstone so

658
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:17,429
you know why you get the redstone so
 

659
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:18,980
you know why you get the redstone so
that was one reason another reason was

660
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:18,990
that was one reason another reason was
 

661
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:23,299
that was one reason another reason was
uh since there's like 2,000 redstone in

662
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:23,309
uh since there's like 2,000 redstone in
 

663
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:25,909
uh since there's like 2,000 redstone in
this project I didn't want that quite

664
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
this project I didn't want that quite
 

665
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,250
this project I didn't want that quite
that close to my base because probably

666
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:28,260
that close to my base because probably
 

667
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,419
that close to my base because probably
with the light my base even more here we

668
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:32,429
with the light my base even more here we
 

669
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:38,330
with the light my base even more here we
are pretty far away we're close to 300

670
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:38,340
are pretty far away we're close to 300
 

671
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:46,669
are pretty far away we're close to 300
or so blocks away from base I'm not sure

672
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:46,679
or so blocks away from base I'm not sure
 

673
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,180
or so blocks away from base I'm not sure
if we should do a nighttime launch or

674
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,190
if we should do a nighttime launch or
 

675
00:26:50,190 --> 00:27:00,500
if we should do a nighttime launch or
daytime launch oh let's do both I'm

676
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:00,510
daytime launch oh let's do both I'm
 

677
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,289
daytime launch oh let's do both I'm
going to make another backup and I'll be

678
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:03,299
going to make another backup and I'll be
 

679
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:07,820
going to make another backup and I'll be
your back all right we are set ready to

680
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:07,830
your back all right we are set ready to
 

681
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,930
your back all right we are set ready to
go backups are made I think all the

682
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:11,940
go backups are made I think all the
 

683
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,440
go backups are made I think all the
timers are set there's a slim chance

684
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,450
timers are set there's a slim chance
 

685
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,930
timers are set there's a slim chance
some of the cannons might blow up or

686
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:17,940
some of the cannons might blow up or
 

687
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,860
some of the cannons might blow up or
something terrible might happen let's

688
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:21,870
something terrible might happen let's
 

689
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,879
something terrible might happen let's
hope for the best

690
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:22,889
hope for the best
 

691
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:26,130
hope for the best
it's never been tested yet

692
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,140
it's never been tested yet
 

693
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,930
it's never been tested yet
um another thing ideally I would like

694
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:30,940
um another thing ideally I would like
 

695
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,770
um another thing ideally I would like
you to go one blowing up here here there

696
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:34,780
you to go one blowing up here here there
 

697
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,780
you to go one blowing up here here there
they're kind of like a random order

698
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:38,790
they're kind of like a random order
 

699
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,640
they're kind of like a random order
fortunately that is extremely hard to do

700
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:41,650
fortunately that is extremely hard to do
 

701
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,039
fortunately that is extremely hard to do
so it's going to be more like a snake

702
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:44,049
so it's going to be more like a snake
 

703
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:48,660
so it's going to be more like a snake
pattern but I tried to make it so it

704
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:48,670
pattern but I tried to make it so it
 

705
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:54,870
pattern but I tried to make it so it
want to be just like did you know like a

706
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:54,880
want to be just like did you know like a
 

707
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,740
want to be just like did you know like a
sequence that's very lame I tried to

708
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:58,750
sequence that's very lame I tried to
 

709
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:04,350
sequence that's very lame I tried to
make it as random as I could uh I don't

710
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:04,360
make it as random as I could uh I don't
 

711
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,030
make it as random as I could uh I don't
really have the redstone to do anything

712
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,040
really have the redstone to do anything
 

713
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,980
really have the redstone to do anything
else

714
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:06,990
else
 

715
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:11,370
else
also um we're going to shoot this off

716
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:11,380
also um we're going to shoot this off
 

717
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,799
also um we're going to shoot this off
again when we hit a million subscribers

718
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:12,809
again when we hit a million subscribers
 

719
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:19,250
again when we hit a million subscribers
and not not a no no no a million views

720
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:19,260
and not not a no no no a million views
 

721
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,780
and not not a no no no a million views
we're going to shoot this off again so

722
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:21,790
we're going to shoot this off again so
 

723
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,200
we're going to shoot this off again so
as we get more donors the number of

724
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,210
as we get more donors the number of
 

725
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,260
as we get more donors the number of
cannons is going to increase

726
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,270
cannons is going to increase
 

727
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:30,539
cannons is going to increase
eventually I want to make some cannons

728
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:30,549
eventually I want to make some cannons
 

729
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:34,140
eventually I want to make some cannons
shooting horizontally and a few other

730
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,150
shooting horizontally and a few other
 

731
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:38,940
shooting horizontally and a few other
crazy things might be set up as I get

732
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:38,950
crazy things might be set up as I get
 

733
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,850
crazy things might be set up as I get
more time but I've been working on this

734
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:41,860
more time but I've been working on this
 

735
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,440
more time but I've been working on this
forever so I didn't really want to do

736
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:43,450
forever so I didn't really want to do
 

737
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,450
forever so I didn't really want to do
anything or fancy than what I have here

753
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:58,829

alright let's do a daytime launch now I

754
00:29:58,829 --> 00:29:58,839
alright let's do a daytime launch now I
 

755
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,019
alright let's do a daytime launch now I
think I want to speed up the timing a

756
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:01,029
think I want to speed up the timing a
 

757
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:08,310
think I want to speed up the timing a
bit too I'll see you guys in a bit and K

758
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,320
bit too I'll see you guys in a bit and K
 

759
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,499
bit too I'll see you guys in a bit and K

I think we're about ready here
 

761
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:17,969
I think we're about ready here
so I sped up all the cannons by about 4

762
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:17,979
so I sped up all the cannons by about 4
 

763
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:24,539
so I sped up all the cannons by about 4
torches so or about like 1.6 seconds so

764
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:24,549
torches so or about like 1.6 seconds so
 

765
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:27,739
torches so or about like 1.6 seconds so
it should be quite a bit different now

766
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:27,749
it should be quite a bit different now
 

767
00:30:27,749 --> 00:30:34,199
it should be quite a bit different now
be much faster so I want you guys to

768
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:34,209
be much faster so I want you guys to
 

769
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:39,859
be much faster so I want you guys to
tell me if you prefer it slow or fast

770
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:39,869

 

771
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:46,229

you think about putting flames on all
 

781
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:08,839
you think about putting flames on all
the cannons or if that's a bad idea

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:11,529
I'd have to have redstone on top of all
 

785
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:17,249
I'd have to have redstone on top of all
of them them or not redstone netherrack

00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:03,170

that would up oh it's still blast I

808
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:03,180

 

809
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,730

don't know why it doesn't transfer

810
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:05,740
don't know why it doesn't transfer
 

811
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:12,810
don't know why it doesn't transfer
through glass that's weird your cannon

812
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:12,820
through glass that's weird your cannon
 

813
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,760
through glass that's weird your cannon
gets to blow up again don't worry this

814
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:17,770
gets to blow up again don't worry this
 

815
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:26,670
gets to blow up again don't worry this
is a backup let's check if any of them

816
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:26,680
is a backup let's check if any of them
 

817
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:36,300
is a backup let's check if any of them
if any more like that I think they

818
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,310
if any more like that I think they
 

819
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,750
if any more like that I think they
pretty much all launched probably just

820
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:39,760
pretty much all launched probably just
 

821
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,870
pretty much all launched probably just
that one because I redid it at the last

822
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:41,880
that one because I redid it at the last
 

823
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:52,380
that one because I redid it at the last
minute

824
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:52,390

 

825
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:57,060

yeah all is good so I'll fix that for

826
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:57,070
yeah all is good so I'll fix that for
 

827
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:04,289
yeah all is good so I'll fix that for
next time and I wanted to show you how

828
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:04,299
next time and I wanted to show you how
 

829
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:11,940
next time and I wanted to show you how
the underground wiring works the other

830
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:11,950
the underground wiring works the other
 

831
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,899
the underground wiring works the other
thousand redstone or whatever so this is

832
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:15,909
thousand redstone or whatever so this is
 

833
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:18,000
thousand redstone or whatever so this is
a sandstone block that the buttons

834
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,010
a sandstone block that the buttons
 

835
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,690
a sandstone block that the buttons
connect to on the other side wire runs

836
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:21,700
connect to on the other side wire runs
 

837
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:33,389
connect to on the other side wire runs
down here repeater another repeater this

838
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:33,399
down here repeater another repeater this
 

839
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:36,710
down here repeater another repeater this
is a little tunneling I made underground

840
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:36,720
is a little tunneling I made underground
 

841
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:44,550
is a little tunneling I made underground
and let's just follow the wire so every

842
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
and let's just follow the wire so every
 

843
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,180
and let's just follow the wire so every
cannon has these two redstone torches

844
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:48,190
cannon has these two redstone torches
 

845
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,270
cannon has these two redstone torches
the vertical wiring and that's how the

846
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:51,280
the vertical wiring and that's how the
 

847
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,000
the vertical wiring and that's how the
signal gets from down here to up to the

848
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,010
signal gets from down here to up to the
 

849
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:59,910
signal gets from down here to up to the
cannon and every cannon has at least two

850
00:34:59,910 --> 00:34:59,920
cannon and every cannon has at least two
 

851
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:09,180
cannon and every cannon has at least two
repeaters some have three and so it

852
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,190
repeaters some have three and so it
 

853
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,010
repeaters some have three and so it
always branches off to the cannon and

854
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,020
always branches off to the cannon and
 

855
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,359
always branches off to the cannon and
then either goes this way this way this

856
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:15,369
then either goes this way this way this
 

857
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:22,920
then either goes this way this way this
way or this way and I planned it out on

858
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:22,930
way or this way and I planned it out on
 

859
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:26,010
way or this way and I planned it out on
paper the pattern I wanted to take

860
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:26,020
paper the pattern I wanted to take
 

861
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,359
paper the pattern I wanted to take
otherwise I would have just got lost

862
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:27,369
otherwise I would have just got lost
 

863
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:36,920
otherwise I would have just got lost
down here

864
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:36,930

 

865
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:42,090

because I tried to do it random and it's

866
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:42,100
because I tried to do it random and it's
 

867
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:54,720
because I tried to do it random and it's
pretty random ran into like a couple

868
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:54,730
pretty random ran into like a couple
 

869
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,630
pretty random ran into like a couple
underwater pools so I had to do some

870
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:57,640
underwater pools so I had to do some
 

871
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:14,390
underwater pools so I had to do some
terraforming around here so much wiring

872
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:14,400

 

873
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,250

also some of the cannons are higher than

874
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:17,260
also some of the cannons are higher than
 

875
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,070
also some of the cannons are higher than
others so I have to adjust the height

876
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,080
others so I have to adjust the height
 

877
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,410
others so I have to adjust the height
with blocks or whatever to make it work

878
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:24,420

 

879
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,700

because the ground is not completely

880
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:26,710
because the ground is not completely
 

881
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:42,810
because the ground is not completely
flat above us that's it that's the whole

882
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:42,820
flat above us that's it that's the whole
 

883
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:48,480
flat above us that's it that's the whole
path so pretty crazy pretty long lots of

884
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:48,490
path so pretty crazy pretty long lots of
 

885
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:52,680
path so pretty crazy pretty long lots of
work lots of fun hope you guys liked it

886
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:52,690
work lots of fun hope you guys liked it
 

887
00:36:52,690 --> 00:37:04,560
work lots of fun hope you guys liked it
I did leave your ideas and are supposed

888
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,570
I did leave your ideas and are supposed
 

889
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:12,420
I did leave your ideas and are supposed
to be one more thing

890
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:12,430

 

891
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,730

well I forgot what it is so thank you

892
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:14,740
well I forgot what it is so thank you
 

893
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,370
well I forgot what it is so thank you
