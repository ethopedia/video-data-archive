00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:49,229
this very big square area and I felt I
 

59
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,109
this very big square area and I felt I
needed to build something here but I

60
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
needed to build something here but I
 

61
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,330

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,250
area to hold them and the other one was
 

71
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,330
area to hold them and the other one was
to make a wheat farm so today we're

72
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:08,340
to make a wheat farm so today we're
 

73
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,100
to make a wheat farm so today we're
going to build both of them here in the

74
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,110
going to build both of them here in the
 

75
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,420
going to build both of them here in the
same area I have

76
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:12,430
same area I have
 

77
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,539

a fun idea for an animal farm I want to

78
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:15,549
a fun idea for an animal farm I want to
 

79
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:17,039
a fun idea for an animal farm I want to
try out it's not going to be super

80
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,049
try out it's not going to be super
 

81
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,500
try out it's not going to be super
efficient or anything and not quite

82
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:19,510
efficient or anything and not quite
 

83
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,349
efficient or anything and not quite
automatic but it'll be a good first farm

84
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:22,359
automatic but it'll be a good first farm
 

85
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:25,559
automatic but it'll be a good first farm
and it should be fun something I want to

86
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:25,569
and it should be fun something I want to
 

87
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,830
and it should be fun something I want to
try build and we'll also build a wheat

88
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:28,840
try build and we'll also build a wheat
 

89
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,530
try build and we'll also build a wheat
farm so let's get to work here okay so

90
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:34,540
farm so let's get to work here okay so
 

91
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,679
farm so let's get to work here okay so
the dimensions I'm looking for are 13 by

92
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:37,689
the dimensions I'm looking for are 13 by
 

93
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:40,979
the dimensions I'm looking for are 13 by
13 for the farm and this thing right now

94
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:40,989
13 for the farm and this thing right now
 

95
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:49,140
13 for the farm and this thing right now
is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 by 3 4 5 6 7

96
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,150
is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 by 3 4 5 6 7
 

97
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,059
is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 by 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 10 11 12

99
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:59,550
8 9 10 11 12
that's odd it's not a square so 11 by 12

100
00:02:59,550 --> 00:02:59,560
that's odd it's not a square so 11 by 12
 

101
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,750
that's odd it's not a square so 11 by 12
I need to make it 13 by 13 and the other

102
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:02,760
I need to make it 13 by 13 and the other
 

103
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,819
I need to make it 13 by 13 and the other
thing I want to do is do it a little bit

104
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:05,829
thing I want to do is do it a little bit
 

105
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:07,589
thing I want to do is do it a little bit
deeper will probably go five or six

106
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
deeper will probably go five or six
 

107
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,459
deeper will probably go five or six
blocks down as well so I'm going to work

157
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,790
I believe it or not I've never made an
automated wheat farm before I've always

158
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
automated wheat farm before I've always
 

159
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,189
automated wheat farm before I've always
just done the standard harvest it

160
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
just done the standard harvest it
 

161
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:45,820
just done the standard harvest it
yourself

162
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:45,830
yourself
 

163
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,830
yourself
plant it yourself deal even in the last

164
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:50,840
plant it yourself deal even in the last
 

165
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,689
plant it yourself deal even in the last
world I never made one I never got

166
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:52,699
world I never made one I never got
 

167
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:55,510
world I never made one I never got
around to it so it's kind of new to me

168
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
around to it so it's kind of new to me
 

169
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,820
around to it so it's kind of new to me
the one we're going to make here is not

170
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:57,830
the one we're going to make here is not
 

171
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,749
the one we're going to make here is not
going to be overly complex it's just

172
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
going to be overly complex it's just
 

173
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,050
going to be overly complex it's just
going to be push a button releases water

174
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,060
going to be push a button releases water
 

175
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,209
going to be push a button releases water
to harvest the wheat and delivers it to

176
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:07,219
to harvest the wheat and delivers it to
 

177
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:11,050
to harvest the wheat and delivers it to
us and that's about it we could make

178
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:11,060
us and that's about it we could make
 

179
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,029
us and that's about it we could make
something more complicated if we use a

180
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
something more complicated if we use a
 

181
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,260
something more complicated if we use a
bud switch to detect the wheat growth

182
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,270
bud switch to detect the wheat growth
 

183
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:22,649
bud switch to detect the wheat growth
but I should brought more water with me

184
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:22,659
but I should brought more water with me
 

185
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:24,820
but I should brought more water with me
but we're not going to do anything like

186
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:24,830
but we're not going to do anything like
 

187
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,029
but we're not going to do anything like
that now what I want to check out first

188
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:28,039
that now what I want to check out first

00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,279
that now what I want to check out first
here is if water will destroy farmland

190
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:33,289
here is if water will destroy farmland
 

191
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:35,350
here is if water will destroy farmland
because I'm going to use it to harvest

192
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
because I'm going to use it to harvest
 

193
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,019
because I'm going to use it to harvest
the wheat and it'll be a big problem if

194
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:38,029
the wheat and it'll be a big problem if
 

195
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:41,850
the wheat and it'll be a big problem if
I have to refill the soil every time and

196
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:41,860
I have to refill the soil every time and
 

197
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,559
I have to refill the soil every time and
this is probably common knowledge but I

198
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:44,569
this is probably common knowledge but I
 

199
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:46,240
this is probably common knowledge but I
just want to see it for my own eyes

200
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,250
just want to see it for my own eyes
 

201
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,760
just want to see it for my own eyes
I checked the wiki on information on

00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:48,770
I checked the wiki on information on
 

203
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,269
I checked the wiki on information on
wheat farming some things I need to keep

204
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:52,279
wheat farming some things I need to keep
 

205
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,730
wheat farming some things I need to keep
in mind we needs to be light level 9 or

206
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:54,740
in mind we needs to be light level 9 or
 

207
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,679
in mind we needs to be light level 9 or
higher to grow farmland to be destroyed

208
00:05:59,679 --> 00:05:59,689
higher to grow farmland to be destroyed
 

209

higher to grow farmland to be destroyed
in four ways and water was not listed as

210
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,089
in four ways and water was not listed as
 

211
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:04,959
in four ways and water was not listed as
one of them so I'm guessing it will not

212
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:04,969
one of them so I'm guessing it will not
 

213
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:08,379
one of them so I'm guessing it will not
get destroyed here so I'm going to watch

214
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:08,389
get destroyed here so I'm going to watch
 

215
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:14,249
get destroyed here so I'm going to watch
it for a sec though just to make sure

216
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:14,259

 

217
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,439

it's just looking like this and then I

218
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:17,449
it's just looking like this and then I
 

219
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:21,129
it's just looking like this and then I
looked up

220
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:21,139

 

221
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:28,059

oh man I was close this guy use a sneaky
one so glad I looked up okay so the

224
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:35,300
one so glad I looked up okay so the
 

225
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,149
one so glad I looked up okay so the
water flowing over the farm line did not

water flowing over the farm line did not
 

227
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:40,330
water flowing over the farm line did not
seem to wreck it it's perfect I'll

so you guys suggested I use this area to

250

so you guys suggested I use this area to
 

251
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,740
so you guys suggested I use this area to
either make a wheat farm or passive mob

to put them the two together so people
would normally call me an idiot for that

264
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,020
would normally call me an idiot for that

it might get patched eventually though
 

289

it might get patched eventually though
we'll see but I will abuse it for now

290
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:19,849
we'll see but I will abuse it for now
 

291
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:23,320
we'll see but I will abuse it for now
because I like it and you see if you get

292
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,330
because I like it and you see if you get
 

293
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:29,670
because I like it and you see if you get
rid of one of these fences

294
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680

 

295
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,930

you know it doesn't take long for it to

296
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:31,940
you know it doesn't take long for it to
 

297
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:37,990
you know it doesn't take long for it to
get destroyed usually there it goes so

298
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
get destroyed usually there it goes so
 

299
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,870

301
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,610
it does work he said it does not work
with the nether fences though so keep

302
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:42,620
with the nether fences though so keep
 

303
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,260
with the nether fences though so keep
that in mind if you do it I'm not really

304
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,270
that in mind if you do it I'm not really
 

305
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,630
that in mind if you do it I'm not really
recommending you do it but I just want

306

309
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,370

okay and this farm is going to be mostly

310
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:57,380
okay and this farm is going to be mostly
 

311
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,960
okay and this farm is going to be mostly
for cows that's the main crop I want to

for cows that's the main crop I want to
 

313
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,670
for cows that's the main crop I want to
grow here cows and wheat so we got

314
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:06,680
grow here cows and wheat so we got
 

315
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,180
grow here cows and wheat so we got
everything figured out pretty much we

316
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,190
everything figured out pretty much we
 

317
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,140
everything figured out pretty much we
shall get started the first thing I'm

318
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,150
shall get started the first thing I'm
 

319
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,400
shall get started the first thing I'm
going to do here is I'm going to use all

320
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:15,410
going to do here is I'm going to use all
 

321
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,260
going to do here is I'm going to use all
the fences I got from the Bandon

322
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:17,270
the fences I got from the Bandon
 

323
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,760
the fences I got from the Bandon
mineshaft and I'm going to lay them down

324
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:20,770
mineshaft and I'm going to lay them down
 

325
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,760
mineshaft and I'm going to lay them down
this area on both sides here I'll leave

326
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:24,770
this area on both sides here I'll leave
 

327
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,530
this area on both sides here I'll leave
this middle clear though that's where

328
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:26,540
this middle clear though that's where
 

329
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,260
this middle clear though that's where
our water stream is going to be where

330
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,270
our water stream is going to be where
 

331
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,370
our water stream is going to be where
they join together so I'll do this and

332
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:33,380
they join together so I'll do this and
 

333
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,640
they join together so I'll do this and
I'll see you in a second

334
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:35,650
I'll see you in a second
 

335
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,870
I'll see you in a second
good good very good okay some reason I

336
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
good good very good okay some reason I
 

337
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,579
good good very good okay some reason I
feels like I'm pouring concrete here or

338
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:42,589
feels like I'm pouring concrete here or
 

339
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:45,120
feels like I'm pouring concrete here or
something and I just set up all my rebar

340
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,130
something and I just set up all my rebar
 

341
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,990
something and I just set up all my rebar
so it reminds me of okay anyway so we

342
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
so it reminds me of okay anyway so we
 

343
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,600
so it reminds me of okay anyway so we
get the fences down I never really

344
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:52,610
get the fences down I never really
 

345
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,660
get the fences down I never really
explained why that trick works basically

346
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:55,670
explained why that trick works basically
 

347
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,600
explained why that trick works basically
fences count as one and a half blocks as

348
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:58,610
fences count as one and a half blocks as
 

349
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,560
fences count as one and a half blocks as
I'm sure you know so if we're on the

350
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:02,570
I'm sure you know so if we're on the
 

351
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,060
I'm sure you know so if we're on the
stone here you can see our y-coordinate

352
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,070
stone here you can see our y-coordinate
 

353
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,840
stone here you can see our y-coordinate
is thirty point six two or so if we go

354
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:07,850
is thirty point six two or so if we go
 

355
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,449
is thirty point six two or so if we go
up on the fence it raises to thirty one

356
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:10,459
up on the fence it raises to thirty one
 

357
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,730
up on the fence it raises to thirty one
point one two so that's a block and a

358
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:12,740
point one two so that's a block and a
 

359
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,190
point one two so that's a block and a
half and I believe I'm not entirely sure

360
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:18,200
half and I believe I'm not entirely sure
 

361
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,430
half and I believe I'm not entirely sure
but I believe tilled soil is lower than

362
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
but I believe tilled soil is lower than
 

363
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,150
but I believe tilled soil is lower than
one block I think it's like a 7/8 or

364
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,160
one block I think it's like a 7/8 or
 

365
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,220
one block I think it's like a 7/8 or
fifteen sixteenths of a block or

366
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:27,230
fifteen sixteenths of a block or
 

367
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,140
fifteen sixteenths of a block or
something so it's lower too and somehow

368
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,150
something so it's lower too and somehow
 

369
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,550
something so it's lower too and somehow
instead of walking on the block you're

370
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:33,560
instead of walking on the block you're
 

371
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,699
instead of walking on the block you're
kind of walking on the fence instead of

372
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:36,709
kind of walking on the fence instead of
 

373
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:38,319
kind of walking on the fence instead of
on the tilled soil so that's why it

374
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:38,329
on the tilled soil so that's why it
 

375
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:41,290
on the tilled soil so that's why it
doesn't get destroyed is my theory I

376
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:41,300
doesn't get destroyed is my theory I
 

377
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,900
doesn't get destroyed is my theory I
don't know if

378
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:41,910
don't know if
 

379
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,630
don't know if
sure anyway next thing I'm going to do

380
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
sure anyway next thing I'm going to do
 

381
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,280
sure anyway next thing I'm going to do
is place down soil fill it in till it's

382
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,290
is place down soil fill it in till it's
 

383
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,870
is place down soil fill it in till it's
I'll have to hide water somewhere to

384
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:53,880
I'll have to hide water somewhere to
 

385
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,350
I'll have to hide water somewhere to
dehydrate it I could probably do that

386
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
dehydrate it I could probably do that
 

387
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,540
dehydrate it I could probably do that
underneath the fences or on the sides

388
00:10:59,540 --> 00:10:59,550
underneath the fences or on the sides
 

389
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,430
underneath the fences or on the sides
I'll probably do the sides yeah and also

390
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:04,440
I'll probably do the sides yeah and also
 

391
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,170
I'll probably do the sides yeah and also
if we have water in the middle here

392
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:06,180
if we have water in the middle here
 

393
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,800
if we have water in the middle here
it'll help hydrate the soil as well so

394
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:09,810
it'll help hydrate the soil as well so
 

395
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,690
it'll help hydrate the soil as well so
I'll do that and we will be back

396
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:13,700

 

397
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,730

actually looking at my y-coordinate here

398
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:16,740
actually looking at my y-coordinate here
 

399
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,360
actually looking at my y-coordinate here
it seems tilled soil is no different in

400
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,370
it seems tilled soil is no different in
 

401
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,570
it seems tilled soil is no different in
height than regular blocks you see it

402
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:23,580
height than regular blocks you see it
 

403
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,180
height than regular blocks you see it
doesn't change when I walk on this stone

404
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,190

 

405
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,650

uh-huh okay soils down next thing we got

406
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:33,660
uh-huh okay soils down next thing we got
 

407
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,500
uh-huh okay soils down next thing we got
to do got to get away for the animals to

408
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:36,510
to do got to get away for the animals to
 

409
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,610
to do got to get away for the animals to
come down here from the surface so I'm

410
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:40,620
come down here from the surface so I'm
 

411
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,970
come down here from the surface so I'm
calling this the front this is left

412
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:43,980
calling this the front this is left
 

413
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,790
calling this the front this is left
right and we'll call this the back I'm

414
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
right and we'll call this the back I'm
 

415
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,030
right and we'll call this the back I'm
going to rig up a thing for the animals

416
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,040
going to rig up a thing for the animals
 

417
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,310
going to rig up a thing for the animals
come down from the surface we'll just

418
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
come down from the surface we'll just
 

419
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:01,970
come down from the surface we'll just
have a how should we do it well we could

420
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:01,980
have a how should we do it well we could
 

421
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,830
have a how should we do it well we could
probably just punch a hole through here

422
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:03,840
probably just punch a hole through here
 

423
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,350
probably just punch a hole through here
there goes my pick found some iron sweet

424
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
there goes my pick found some iron sweet
 

425
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,320
there goes my pick found some iron sweet
and we'll just dig a hole straight up to

426
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,330
and we'll just dig a hole straight up to
 

427
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,290
and we'll just dig a hole straight up to
the surface we'll put a water break in

428
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:15,300
the surface we'll put a water break in
 

429
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,410
the surface we'll put a water break in
here so the animals can fall down safely

430
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:18,420
here so the animals can fall down safely
 

431
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,930
here so the animals can fall down safely
and then they'll be in our farm yeah so

432
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:23,940
and then they'll be in our farm yeah so
 

433
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,390
and then they'll be in our farm yeah so
I'll work on that just give me a minute

434
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:26,400
I'll work on that just give me a minute
 

435
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,770
I'll work on that just give me a minute
again okay I think I mean a little head

436
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:30,780
again okay I think I mean a little head
 

437
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,750
again okay I think I mean a little head
of myself I should probably figure out

438
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:32,760
of myself I should probably figure out
 

439
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,090
of myself I should probably figure out
the water currents for the wheat farm

440
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:35,100
the water currents for the wheat farm
 

441
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,050
the water currents for the wheat farm
first so to hydrate the thing I believe

442
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:39,060
first so to hydrate the thing I believe
 

443
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,690
first so to hydrate the thing I believe
I can do it with just four water source

444
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:41,700
I can do it with just four water source
 

445
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,980
I can do it with just four water source
blocks so I'm going to stick them down

446
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:42,990
blocks so I'm going to stick them down
 

447
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:48,770
blocks so I'm going to stick them down
here underneath the fences out of sight

448
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:48,780

 

449
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:54,950

and that should work on I'm hoping that

450
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:54,960
and that should work on I'm hoping that
 

451
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,390
and that should work on I'm hoping that
works

452
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:58,400

 

453
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,680

let's see please get hydrated it's been

454
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:03,690
let's see please get hydrated it's been
 

455
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,480
let's see please get hydrated it's been
a while it's been a long time since I

456
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:05,490
a while it's been a long time since I
 

457
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:13,100
a while it's been a long time since I
made a wheat farm the ones hydrated that

458
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,110
made a wheat farm the ones hydrated that
 

459
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:23,690
made a wheat farm the ones hydrated that
might be from here though yeah I messed

460
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:23,700
might be from here though yeah I messed
 

461
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,740
might be from here though yeah I messed
up a bit here

462
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:24,750
up a bit here
 

463
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,210
up a bit here
I guess the water will hydrate basically

464
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:29,220
I guess the water will hydrate basically
 

465
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,270
I guess the water will hydrate basically
a nine by nine square or four blocks

466
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:32,280
a nine by nine square or four blocks
 

467
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,700
a nine by nine square or four blocks
away from itself so one two three four

468
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:34,710
away from itself so one two three four
 

469
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:39,230
away from itself so one two three four
and also diagonally one two three four

470
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:39,240
and also diagonally one two three four
 

471
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,240
and also diagonally one two three four
so up to here for this one block but it

472
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,250
so up to here for this one block but it
 

473
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,870
so up to here for this one block but it
only will hydrates if it's on the same

474
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:47,880
only will hydrates if it's on the same
 

475
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,600
only will hydrates if it's on the same
level like these distilled soils on the

476
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:50,610
level like these distilled soils on the
 

477
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,120
level like these distilled soils on the
same level as this water block or if the

478
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,130
same level as this water block or if the
 

479
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,240
same level as this water block or if the
water block is one higher than it

480
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,250
water block is one higher than it
 

481
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,829
water block is one higher than it
doesn't seem to work if it's lower or if

482
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839
doesn't seem to work if it's lower or if
 

483
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,270
doesn't seem to work if it's lower or if
it's two blocks high or it doesn't work

484
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:02,280
it's two blocks high or it doesn't work
 

485
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,720
it's two blocks high or it doesn't work
either

486
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:02,730
either
 

487
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,910
either
so that's going to change things a

488
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
so that's going to change things a
 

489
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,940
so that's going to change things a
little bit here it means I'll have to

490
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:10,950
little bit here it means I'll have to
 

491
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,610
little bit here it means I'll have to
have water my water stream here going

492
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:13,620
have water my water stream here going
 

493
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,930
have water my water stream here going
all the time I wanted to check to shut

494
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:17,940
all the time I wanted to check to shut
 

495
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,360
all the time I wanted to check to shut
that off with pistons but I just I have

496
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,370
that off with pistons but I just I have
 

497
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,579
that off with pistons but I just I have
to have it going all the time now and it

498
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:22,589
to have it going all the time now and it
 

499
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:28,820
to have it going all the time now and it
will go down here oh and we have our

500
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:28,830
will go down here oh and we have our
 

501
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:35,110
will go down here oh and we have our
fences there too darn

502
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120

 

503
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,440

hmm well that water there will hydrate

504
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,450
hmm well that water there will hydrate
 

505
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,310
hmm well that water there will hydrate
your Center no problem and we'll have

506
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:43,320
your Center no problem and we'll have
 

507
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,100
your Center no problem and we'll have
water on the outside take care of the

508
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,110
water on the outside take care of the
 

509
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:54,019
water on the outside take care of the
rest like these should be fine I'm just

510
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:54,029
rest like these should be fine I'm just
 

511
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:57,700
rest like these should be fine I'm just
worried if I have a water stream here

512
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:57,710
worried if I have a water stream here
 

513
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,360
worried if I have a water stream here
that drops might get lost in the fences

514
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,370
that drops might get lost in the fences
 

515
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,519
that drops might get lost in the fences
below there that's my only concern right

516
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:04,529
below there that's my only concern right
 

517
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:18,470
below there that's my only concern right
now ah it's okay we'll make it work that

518
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
now ah it's okay we'll make it work that
 

519
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,590
now ah it's okay we'll make it work that
flows there we throw items in course

520
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:24,600
flows there we throw items in course
 

521
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,010
flows there we throw items in course
that's messing up the stream the plan

522
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,020
that's messing up the stream the plan
 

523
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,960
that's messing up the stream the plan
will be I'll have to have a separator

524
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:29,970
will be I'll have to have a separator
 

525
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,420
will be I'll have to have a separator
between these two so that the cows don't

526
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:32,430
between these two so that the cows don't
 

527
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,900
between these two so that the cows don't
fall down I'll either use fences glass

528
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:35,910
fall down I'll either use fences glass
 

529
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,579
fall down I'll either use fences glass
panes or the iron bars probably I'm

530
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:40,589
panes or the iron bars probably I'm
 

531
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:42,829
panes or the iron bars probably I'm
thinking glass panes will probably look

532
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:42,839
thinking glass panes will probably look
 

533
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:50,540
thinking glass panes will probably look
the best oops so this will allow items

534
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:50,550
the best oops so this will allow items
 

535
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,490
the best oops so this will allow items
to fall down to the stream below without

536
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:52,500
to fall down to the stream below without
 

537
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,440
to fall down to the stream below without
the mobs falling through and it seems

538
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:57,450
the mobs falling through and it seems
 

539
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:02,499
the mobs falling through and it seems
like

540
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:02,509

 

541
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:09,939

seems to be fine that should work should

542
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:09,949
seems to be fine that should work should
 

543
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:18,369
seems to be fine that should work should
work okay so last pains down the middle

544
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:18,379
work okay so last pains down the middle
 

545
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,739
work okay so last pains down the middle
the advantage of using in the pains or

546
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:20,749
the advantage of using in the pains or
 

547
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:22,989
the advantage of using in the pains or
the bars iron bars is you'll be able to

548
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:22,999
the bars iron bars is you'll be able to
 

549
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:26,199
the bars iron bars is you'll be able to
jump over it and so little mobs fences

550
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:26,209
jump over it and so little mobs fences
 

551
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:29,849
jump over it and so little mobs fences
you can't unless you do a shift jump

552
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:29,859
you can't unless you do a shift jump
 

553
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:40,539
you can't unless you do a shift jump
well that might not work anymore huh so

554
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:40,549
well that might not work anymore huh so
 

555
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:43,629
well that might not work anymore huh so
you could ship jump maybe I'm doing it

556
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:43,639
you could ship jump maybe I'm doing it
 

557
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:56,139
you could ship jump maybe I'm doing it
wrong anyway so I'll clean this up a bit

558
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:56,149
wrong anyway so I'll clean this up a bit
 

559
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:00,970
wrong anyway so I'll clean this up a bit
and then that will be back alright let's

560
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:00,980
and then that will be back alright let's
 

561
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,489
and then that will be back alright let's
decide glass panes or iron bars which

562
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:03,499
decide glass panes or iron bars which
 

563
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:14,679
decide glass panes or iron bars which
looks better iron and jump over it not

564
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:14,689
looks better iron and jump over it not
 

565
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:21,279
looks better iron and jump over it not
too bad or glass panes I guess they

566
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:21,289
too bad or glass panes I guess they
 

567
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:32,070
too bad or glass panes I guess they
don't join together hmm

568
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080

 

569
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,499

I like them both but I think I'll go

570
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:37,509
I like them both but I think I'll go
 

571
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:39,479
I like them both but I think I'll go
with iron bars unless you guys have a

572
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:39,489
with iron bars unless you guys have a
 

573
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:44,369
with iron bars unless you guys have a
preference yeah okay I'll do iron bars

574
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:44,379
preference yeah okay I'll do iron bars
 

575
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:49,340
preference yeah okay I'll do iron bars
for now yeah

576
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:49,350

 

577
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,080

okay so drops should be fine like this

578
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,090
okay so drops should be fine like this
 

579
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,529
okay so drops should be fine like this
collection point will be down there

580
00:17:57,529 --> 00:17:57,539
collection point will be down there
 

581
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:01,200
collection point will be down there
I'll have lighting in the sides sorry in

582
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,210
I'll have lighting in the sides sorry in
 

583
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,349
I'll have lighting in the sides sorry in
the sides I'll try to use lava if I can

584
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:04,359
the sides I'll try to use lava if I can
 

585
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:09,599
the sides I'll try to use lava if I can
for lighting I never figured out the

586
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:09,609
for lighting I never figured out the
 

587
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:16,799
for lighting I never figured out the
lighting if I have lava over here let's

588
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:16,809
lighting if I have lava over here let's
 

589
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,060
lighting if I have lava over here let's
say we have lab over here

590
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,070
say we have lab over here
 

591
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:25,529
say we have lab over here
that's one are now 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8

592
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:25,539
that's one are now 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8
 

593
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:30,779
that's one are now 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8
dance that's not enough so we'll have to

594
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:30,789
dance that's not enough so we'll have to
 

595
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:35,310
dance that's not enough so we'll have to
have see I should have thought this farm

596
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:35,320
have see I should have thought this farm
 

597
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,139
have see I should have thought this farm
out a little bit better before I started

598
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:37,149
out a little bit better before I started
 

599
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,729
out a little bit better before I started
it is now we're running into all these

600
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:38,739
it is now we're running into all these
 

601
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:47,430
it is now we're running into all these
problems hmm well I don't know what to

602
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
problems hmm well I don't know what to
 

603
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,690
problems hmm well I don't know what to
do we'll figure it out

604
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:54,700

 

605
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,470

well one thing I could do is use a fence

606
00:18:59,470 --> 00:18:59,480
well one thing I could do is use a fence
 

607
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,780
well one thing I could do is use a fence
and then place torches on top of it and

608
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:01,790
and then place torches on top of it and
 

609
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,400
and then place torches on top of it and
it would light up the center pretty good

610
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,410
it would light up the center pretty good
 

611
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,910
it would light up the center pretty good
but I don't want to use torches really

612
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:09,920
but I don't want to use torches really
 

613
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,830
but I don't want to use torches really
because one of my goals down here was to

614
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840
because one of my goals down here was to
 

615
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,080
because one of my goals down here was to
eventually replace all these torches

616
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,090
eventually replace all these torches
 

617
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:20,250
eventually replace all these torches
with lava or some other cool lighting

618
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:20,260

 

619
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,810

yeah so I was thinking one thing I could

620
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:22,820
yeah so I was thinking one thing I could
 

621
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,630
yeah so I was thinking one thing I could
do is put a fence down the middle here

622
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:25,640
do is put a fence down the middle here
 

623
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,350
do is put a fence down the middle here
instead and place torches all along it

624
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:28,360
instead and place torches all along it
 

625
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,550
instead and place torches all along it
and that would take care of the lighting

626
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:30,560
and that would take care of the lighting
 

627
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,670
and that would take care of the lighting
for the middle but I don't really want

628
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:33,680
for the middle but I don't really want
 

629
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,230
for the middle but I don't really want
to do that because one of my goals down

630
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,240
to do that because one of my goals down
 

631
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,690
to do that because one of my goals down
in this cave system is eventually to use

632
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:37,700
in this cave system is eventually to use
 

633
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,990
in this cave system is eventually to use
only lava for lighting lava maybe

634
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,000
only lava for lighting lava maybe
 

635
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,140
only lava for lighting lava maybe
glowstone and the the pumpkins but no

636
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,150
glowstone and the the pumpkins but no
 

637
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,120
glowstone and the the pumpkins but no
torches is my ultimate goal in the end

638
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,130
torches is my ultimate goal in the end
 

639
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:55,270
torches is my ultimate goal in the end
so probably won't do that another thing

640
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,280
so probably won't do that another thing
 

641
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,300
so probably won't do that another thing
I could do is like punch a hole down

642
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,310
I could do is like punch a hole down
 

643
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:03,100
I could do is like punch a hole down
here place lava then glass above or

644
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,110
here place lava then glass above or
 

645
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,410
here place lava then glass above or
something and that would light up an

646
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:05,420
something and that would light up an
 

647
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:12,160
something and that would light up an
area of about 5 by 5 that's a

648
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,170
area of about 5 by 5 that's a
 

649
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,800
area of about 5 by 5 that's a
possibility ah I don't know I'll think

650
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:17,810
possibility ah I don't know I'll think
 

651
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,750
possibility ah I don't know I'll think
about it some more I'm working on the

652
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
about it some more I'm working on the
 

653
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,530
about it some more I'm working on the
water flood system right now and as

654
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:23,540
water flood system right now and as
 

655
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,690
water flood system right now and as
always if you guys have suggestions let

656
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:25,700
always if you guys have suggestions let
 

657
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,740
always if you guys have suggestions let
me know I'm thinking for the water

658
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:29,750
me know I'm thinking for the water
 

659
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,560
me know I'm thinking for the water
I'll have Pistons on their side like

660
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:32,570
I'll have Pistons on their side like
 

661
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:42,220
I'll have Pistons on their side like
this ok and then water all along here

662
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:42,230
this ok and then water all along here
 

663
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,150
this ok and then water all along here
above the arms so that when they're

664
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:46,160
above the arms so that when they're
 

665
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,330
above the arms so that when they're
extended the water will be sitting still

666
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:49,340
extended the water will be sitting still
 

667
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,880
extended the water will be sitting still
and when they're open like they're right

668
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:51,890
and when they're open like they're right
 

669
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:55,800
and when they're open like they're right
now it will fall down and flow out

670
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:55,810
now it will fall down and flow out
 

671
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,830
now it will fall down and flow out
towards the fence and I'll have wire

672
00:20:59,830 --> 00:20:59,840
towards the fence and I'll have wire
 

673
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,400
towards the fence and I'll have wire
above the cobble here control that and

674
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,410
above the cobble here control that and
 

675
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,830
above the cobble here control that and
we will need to have a barrier along

676
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:08,840
we will need to have a barrier along
 

677
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,840
we will need to have a barrier along
here I just found out that you can't

678
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:13,850
here I just found out that you can't
 

679
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:18,460
here I just found out that you can't
make the mossy stone bricks anymore they

680
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:18,470
make the mossy stone bricks anymore they
 

681
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,460
make the mossy stone bricks anymore they
took that trick out so there's no way of

682
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:21,470
took that trick out so there's no way of
 

683
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:27,120
took that trick out so there's no way of
producing them only find them

684
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,130
producing them only find them
 

685
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,600
producing them only find them
unfortunately because that's what I

686
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:28,610
unfortunately because that's what I
 

687
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,460
unfortunately because that's what I
wanted to use those the mossy stone

688
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:30,470
wanted to use those the mossy stone
 

689
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,770
wanted to use those the mossy stone
bricks hmm how does I want to see how

690
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:35,780
bricks hmm how does I want to see how
 

691
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:45,040
bricks hmm how does I want to see how
sandstone looked with these things we'll

692
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,050
sandstone looked with these things we'll
 

693
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:53,430
sandstone looked with these things we'll
table that for now okay

694
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440

 

695
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,710

yes this is very good okay do the other

696
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:56,720
yes this is very good okay do the other
 

697
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,400
yes this is very good okay do the other
side

698
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:57,410
side
 

699
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:03,670
side
I'll be back uh-huh okay this is what I

700
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:03,680
I'll be back uh-huh okay this is what I
 

701
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,500
I'll be back uh-huh okay this is what I
did we got lava on the other side of the

702
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:08,510
did we got lava on the other side of the
 

703
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,510
did we got lava on the other side of the
Pistons

704
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520
Pistons
 

705
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,960
Pistons
okay so lay that light through so at the

706
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:13,970
okay so lay that light through so at the
 

707
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:19,170
okay so lay that light through so at the
pistons are 14 then here's 13 12 11 10 9

708
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:19,180
pistons are 14 then here's 13 12 11 10 9
 

709
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,150
pistons are 14 then here's 13 12 11 10 9
so that'll light that will allow the

710
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:22,160
so that'll light that will allow the
 

711
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,630
so that'll light that will allow the
weak to grow up to here and then that

712
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:25,640
weak to grow up to here and then that
 

713
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,490
weak to grow up to here and then that
leaves 1 2 3 blocks yet unlit from the

714
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:30,500
leaves 1 2 3 blocks yet unlit from the
 

715
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,030
leaves 1 2 3 blocks yet unlit from the
sides we can light up most of it except

716
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,040
sides we can light up most of it except
 

717
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,000
sides we can light up most of it except
for maybe it's either 1 or 3 blocks that

718
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,010
for maybe it's either 1 or 3 blocks that
 

719
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,340
for maybe it's either 1 or 3 blocks that
won't be lit unless we put something in

720
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:39,350
won't be lit unless we put something in
 

721
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,070
won't be lit unless we put something in
the middle here

722
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,080
the middle here
 

723
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,870
the middle here
so that's pretty good

724
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:43,880
so that's pretty good
 

725
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,140
so that's pretty good
the other thing I've done underneath the

726
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,150
the other thing I've done underneath the
 

727
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:52,840
the other thing I've done underneath the
pistons I got water all along and that

728
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:52,850
pistons I got water all along and that
 

729
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,450
pistons I got water all along and that
will hydrate these last two blocks that

730
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:55,460
will hydrate these last two blocks that
 

731
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,680
will hydrate these last two blocks that
weren't hydrated before that that this

732
00:22:59,680 --> 00:22:59,690
weren't hydrated before that that this
 

733
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,950
weren't hydrated before that that this
doesn't take care of so that'll pretty

734
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,960
doesn't take care of so that'll pretty
 

735
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,960
doesn't take care of so that'll pretty
much take care of although the hydrating

736
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:04,970
much take care of although the hydrating
 

737
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:10,360
much take care of although the hydrating
for us and the other thing I need to do

738
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,370
for us and the other thing I need to do
 

739
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:17,550
for us and the other thing I need to do
yet is add put this back

740
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:17,560

 

741
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,250

and then we'll have water all along here

742
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:21,260
and then we'll have water all along here
 

743
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,140
and then we'll have water all along here
on the piston arms maybe I'll do it

744
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,150
on the piston arms maybe I'll do it
 

745
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:28,180
on the piston arms maybe I'll do it
later though I got creeper just a little

746
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,190
later though I got creeper just a little
 

747
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,470
later though I got creeper just a little
while ago when I blew up like five

748
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:29,480
while ago when I blew up like five
 

749
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,170
while ago when I blew up like five
Pistons a little upset about that

750
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:32,180
Pistons a little upset about that
 

751
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,090
Pistons a little upset about that
because I lost five redstone from that

752
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:34,100
because I lost five redstone from that
 

753
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:41,230
because I lost five redstone from that
and five iron oh well okay

754
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,240
and five iron oh well okay

we'll finish this up next time hopefully
 

763
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,750
we'll finish this up next time hopefully
because it's getting late here again I'm

764
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:04,760
because it's getting late here again I'm
 

765
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,020
because it's getting late here again I'm
going to start doing my episodes earlier

766
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,030
going to start doing my episodes earlier
 

767
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,580
going to start doing my episodes earlier
so that I don't have this problem always

768
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:09,590
so that I don't have this problem always
 

769
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,510
so that I don't have this problem always
otherwise I start rushing it at the end

770
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:12,520
otherwise I start rushing it at the end
 

771
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,380
otherwise I start rushing it at the end
and then we'll see how this turns out so

772
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:17,390
and then we'll see how this turns out so
