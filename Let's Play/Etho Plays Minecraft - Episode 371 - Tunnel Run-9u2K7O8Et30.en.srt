00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:38,220
adding in something here this would tend
 

89
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,090
adding in something here this would tend
to fall down on the reeds here and then

90
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:40,100
to fall down on the reeds here and then
 

91
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,500
to fall down on the reeds here and then
either the fall kills them or they

92
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:42,510
either the fall kills them or they
 

93
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,390
either the fall kills them or they
suffocate because they they don't bounce

94
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
suffocate because they they don't bounce

I'm going to just set up a rail cart

100
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm going to just set up a rail cart
 

101
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,070
I'm going to just set up a rail cart
line to pick that up because I'm not

102
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
line to pick that up because I'm not
 

103
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,840
line to pick that up because I'm not
really getting any of it so just got it

104
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:56,850
really getting any of it so just got it
 

105
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,430
really getting any of it so just got it
running underneath the reeds and then

106
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:58,440
running underneath the reeds and then
 

107
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,199
running underneath the reeds and then
we're going to have hopper into the

108
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:00,209
we're going to have hopper into the
 

109
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:06,860
we're going to have hopper into the
chest like that and see comparator next

110
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:06,870
chest like that and see comparator next
 

111
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,930
chest like that and see comparator next
to the hopper then redstone torch goes

112
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:11,940
to the hopper then redstone torch goes
 

113
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,140
to the hopper then redstone torch goes
up to there and then over like this and

114
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,150
up to there and then over like this and
 

115
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,830
up to there and then over like this and
that powers the rail all right so then

116
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
that powers the rail all right so then
 

117
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,570
that powers the rail all right so then
get a hopper minecart and that should be

118
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:20,580
get a hopper minecart and that should be
 

119
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,180
get a hopper minecart and that should be
it so when it gets to here it'll stop

120
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,190
it so when it gets to here it'll stop
 

121
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,620
it so when it gets to here it'll stop
and unload and then when it's finished

122
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:24,630
and unload and then when it's finished
 

123
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,970
and unload and then when it's finished
unloading it will take off again it just

124
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:28,980
unloading it will take off again it just
 

125
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,259
unloading it will take off again it just
made two other end and it's bouncing

126
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:30,269
made two other end and it's bouncing
 

127
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:37,490
made two other end and it's bouncing
back and there we go we got five okay

128
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:37,500
back and there we go we got five okay
 

129
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,740
back and there we go we got five okay

was chasing me I should plan to do that
 

177
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,390
was chasing me I should plan to do that
instead but that I didn't have a tunnel

178
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,400
instead but that I didn't have a tunnel
 

179
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,970
instead but that I didn't have a tunnel
big enough oh yes

180
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:06,980
big enough oh yes
 

181

all right man nothing's okay spider
 

183
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,930
all right man nothing's okay spider
why was there tape spider there

184
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:13,940
why was there tape spider there
 

185
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,500
why was there tape spider there
interesting ooh and it stopped okay

186
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:18,510
interesting ooh and it stopped okay
 

187
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,220
interesting ooh and it stopped okay
let's get it going again how far are we

188
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,230
let's get it going again how far are we
 

189
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,450
let's get it going again how far are we
we have to go now man it's 500 more

190
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:26,460
we have to go now man it's 500 more
 

191
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,180
we have to go now man it's 500 more
blocks yet this might take too long to

192
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,190
blocks yet this might take too long to
 

193
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,000
blocks yet this might take too long to
record I don't know if it's entertaining

194
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,010
record I don't know if it's entertaining
 

195
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,620
record I don't know if it's entertaining
enough it is TNT but it's it's pretty

196
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:36,630
enough it is TNT but it's it's pretty
 

197
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:42,010
enough it is TNT but it's it's pretty
repetitive alright let's keep going

198
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,020
repetitive alright let's keep going
 

199
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,450
repetitive alright let's keep going
look nope

200
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:46,460

 

201
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,620

all right guys yeah so I'm going to be

202
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:48,630
all right guys yeah so I'm going to be
 

203
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,260
all right guys yeah so I'm going to be
putting down ice we're gonna make a nice

204
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,270
putting down ice we're gonna make a nice
 

205
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,360
putting down ice we're gonna make a nice
thing where you jump and you get the

206
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,370
thing where you jump and you get the
 

207
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,439
thing where you jump and you get the
speed boost that those are usually

208
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:57,449
speed boost that those are usually
 

209
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,390
speed boost that those are usually
pretty quick we might put trapdoors down

210
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,400
pretty quick we might put trapdoors down
 

211
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,480
pretty quick we might put trapdoors down
to to make it even quicker it's going to

212
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,490
to to make it even quicker it's going to
 

213
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,189
to to make it even quicker it's going to
be a pretty big project because this is

214
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:04,199
be a pretty big project because this is
 

215
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:11,030
be a pretty big project because this is
a very far tunnel oh we're here we're

216
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,040
a very far tunnel oh we're here we're
 

217
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,719
a very far tunnel oh we're here we're
finally here

218
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:11,729
finally here
 

219
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,310
finally here
oh no silverfish it goes through the

220
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:16,320
oh no silverfish it goes through the
 

221
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,550
oh no silverfish it goes through the
stronghold and that's the end finally

222
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:19,560
stronghold and that's the end finally
 

223
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,629
stronghold and that's the end finally
and then the end portal is just over

224
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:23,639
and then the end portal is just over
 

225
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:30,290
and then the end portal is just over
here poof okay got that done now gonna

226
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:30,300
here poof okay got that done now gonna
 

227
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,690
here poof okay got that done now gonna
place ice and sort of polish it up a bit

228
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:32,700
place ice and sort of polish it up a bit
 

229
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:40,700
place ice and sort of polish it up a bit
ah there's nothing more annoying then it

230
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:40,710
ah there's nothing more annoying then it
 

231
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,480
ah there's nothing more annoying then it
bunched to skeleton when I have no bow

232
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:44,490
bunched to skeleton when I have no bow
 

233
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,719
bunched to skeleton when I have no bow
in a narrow Hall hallway alright this is

234
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:47,729
in a narrow Hall hallway alright this is
 

235
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:51,610
in a narrow Hall hallway alright this is
not happening there we go

236
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:51,620
not happening there we go
 

237
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,440
not happening there we go
yeah so we're we're doing the ice thing

238
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,450
yeah so we're we're doing the ice thing
 

239
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,500
yeah so we're we're doing the ice thing
now I'm going to use bat dice because

240
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:57,510
now I'm going to use bat dice because
 

241
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,170
now I'm going to use bat dice because
probably want to light it up to later

242
00:06:59,170 --> 00:06:59,180
probably want to light it up to later
 

243
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:15,929
probably want to light it up to later
and this way it will not melt on us

244
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:15,939

 

245
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:19,749

somebody stole my portal well that's why

246
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
somebody stole my portal well that's why
 

247
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,169
somebody stole my portal well that's why
we have to i am worried to see what's

248
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:23,179
we have to i am worried to see what's
 

249
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:25,079
we have to i am worried to see what's
going on my

250
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:25,089
going on my
 

251
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:27,459
going on my
there's potentially lots of these

252
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:27,469
there's potentially lots of these
 

253
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:31,509
there's potentially lots of these
Guardians around oh just one okay that's

254
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:31,519
Guardians around oh just one okay that's
 

255
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:31,979
Guardians around oh just one okay that's
not bad

256
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:31,989
not bad
 

257
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:41,559
not bad
we're safe ah I remember one day many

258
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:41,569
we're safe ah I remember one day many
 

259
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,899
we're safe ah I remember one day many
many years ago before I started this

260
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:43,909
many years ago before I started this
 

261
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:50,169
many years ago before I started this
project how good my life was ah we're

262
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:50,179
project how good my life was ah we're
 

263
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:53,229
project how good my life was ah we're
almost done we're almost done it this is

264
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:53,239
almost done we're almost done it this is
 

265
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,829
almost done we're almost done it this is
one of those really long grindy projects

266
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:55,839
one of those really long grindy projects
 

267
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,299
one of those really long grindy projects
that doesn't really look all that fancy

268
00:07:58,299 --> 00:07:58,309
that doesn't really look all that fancy
 

269
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:59,919
that doesn't really look all that fancy
when you're done but it's going to be

270
00:07:59,919 --> 00:07:59,929
when you're done but it's going to be
 

271
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:02,139
when you're done but it's going to be
nice to have throughout the life of the

272
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:02,149
nice to have throughout the life of the
 

273
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,449
nice to have throughout the life of the
world here I should have done this a

274
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:04,459
world here I should have done this a
 

275
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:05,109
world here I should have done this a
long time ago

276
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:05,119
long time ago
 

277
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:10,209
long time ago
oh man I got it done it is done it is

278
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:10,219
oh man I got it done it is done it is
 

279
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:15,159
oh man I got it done it is done it is
finished never to be done again uh so

280
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:15,169
finished never to be done again uh so
 

281
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:16,569
finished never to be done again uh so
let's go for a little ride in the shall

282
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:16,579
let's go for a little ride in the shall
 

283
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,239
let's go for a little ride in the shall
we yeah so yeah so this is what it ended

284
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:19,249
we yeah so yeah so this is what it ended
 

285
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,100
we yeah so yeah so this is what it ended
up being pat dice on the floor

286
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,110
up being pat dice on the floor
 

287
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,369
up being pat dice on the floor
we got stairs on the walls and i got

288
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:24,379
we got stairs on the walls and i got
 

289
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,499
we got stairs on the walls and i got
these little vertical columns every five

290
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:26,509
these little vertical columns every five
 

291
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:29,079
these little vertical columns every five
blocks i did it every five blocks so

292
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:29,089
blocks i did it every five blocks so
 

293
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:30,699
blocks i did it every five blocks so
it's easy for me like I can just look at

294
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:30,709
it's easy for me like I can just look at
 

295
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:33,129
it's easy for me like I can just look at
the coordinates here and every time it

296
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:33,139
the coordinates here and every time it
 

297
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:35,439
the coordinates here and every time it
was at five and zero that's when I knew

298
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:35,449
was at five and zero that's when I knew
 

299
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:38,019
was at five and zero that's when I knew
I needed to put a column so even if I

300
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:38,029
I needed to put a column so even if I
 

301
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:40,779
I needed to put a column so even if I
didn't know like how it lined up with

302
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:40,789
didn't know like how it lined up with
 

303
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,399
didn't know like how it lined up with
the rest of it I could just look at the

304
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:42,409
the rest of it I could just look at the
 

305
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,160
the rest of it I could just look at the
coordinates and figure it out which is

306
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,170
coordinates and figure it out which is
 

307
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,759
coordinates and figure it out which is
nice if you go by tens trap trap doors

308
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:48,769
nice if you go by tens trap trap doors
 

309
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,920
nice if you go by tens trap trap doors
on the top this is so you can't can't

310
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:50,930
on the top this is so you can't can't
 

311
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,329
on the top this is so you can't can't
really jump it gives you a little bit

312
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:52,339
really jump it gives you a little bit
 

313
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,119
really jump it gives you a little bit
more of a speed boost when you go and

314
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:55,129
more of a speed boost when you go and
 

315
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:57,400
more of a speed boost when you go and
every ten blocks there is a piece of

316
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:57,410
every ten blocks there is a piece of
 

317
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,389
every ten blocks there is a piece of
glowstone to light up the path and that

318
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:01,399
glowstone to light up the path and that
 

319
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,879
glowstone to light up the path and that

quicker I'm not sure if they actually do

330
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:19,260
quicker I'm not sure if they actually do
 

331
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,800
quicker I'm not sure if they actually do
these these things are really common on

00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:21,810
these these things are really common on
 

333
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,430
these these things are really common on
servers but in my single-player I've

334
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
servers but in my single-player I've
 

335
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,500
servers but in my single-player I've
never had to do something like this it

336
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:27,510
never had to do something like this it
 

337
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,570

looks like we got a stop to eat once on

338
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:29,580
looks like we got a stop to eat once on
 

339
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:36,530

the way at least and it is really far I

340
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:36,540
the way at least and it is really far I
 

341
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,510
the way at least and it is really far I
was hoping it would be a little quicker

342
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:38,520
was hoping it would be a little quicker
 

343
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,870
was hoping it would be a little quicker
honestly but it's just so far so it's

344
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:41,880
honestly but it's just so far so it's
 

345
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,390
honestly but it's just so far so it's
like a thousand blocks I was hoping it

346
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:44,400
like a thousand blocks I was hoping it
 

347
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,190
like a thousand blocks I was hoping it
would be like a twenty second 30 second

348
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:46,200
would be like a twenty second 30 second
 

349
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,360
would be like a twenty second 30 second

isn't a second time yeah it's pretty

352
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:55,500
isn't a second time yeah it's pretty
 

353
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,720
isn't a second time yeah it's pretty
pretty crazy but I think it might still

354
00:09:59,720 --> 00:09:59,730
pretty crazy but I think it might still
 

355
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,220
pretty crazy but I think it might still
be quicker than going through portals I

356
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,230
be quicker than going through portals I
 

357
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:07,340
be quicker than going through portals I
hope okay here we go round two this time

358
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:07,350
hope okay here we go round two this time
 

359
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,060
hope okay here we go round two this time
with a speed tube potion and we'll see

360
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,070
with a speed tube potion and we'll see
 

361
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,970
with a speed tube potion and we'll see
which one is quicker it definitely feels

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,200
there we go
 

407
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,170
there we go
it's struggling so yeah

408
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:19,180
it's struggling so yeah
 

409
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,120
it's struggling so yeah
that takes us to the end it also takes

410
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,130
that takes us to the end it also takes
 

411
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,980
that takes us to the end it also takes
us to the stronghold base if we want to

412
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:22,990
us to the stronghold base if we want to
 

413
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,020
us to the stronghold base if we want to
go there the nice thing about having

414
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,030
go there the nice thing about having
 

415
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,910
go there the nice thing about having
that is sometimes like when I'm doing

416
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:26,920
that is sometimes like when I'm doing
 

417
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,120
that is sometimes like when I'm doing
work on the on the nether my portals go

418
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,130
work on the on the nether my portals go
 

419
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,030
work on the on the nether my portals go
down and then it's like I can't use them

420
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
down and then it's like I can't use them
 

421
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,820
down and then it's like I can't use them
for transportation while I'm doing weird

422
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:35,830
for transportation while I'm doing weird
 

423
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,780
for transportation while I'm doing weird
stuff I guess so this is just another

424
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:39,790
stuff I guess so this is just another
 

425
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,310
stuff I guess so this is just another
way of getting there too and I think it

426
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:41,320
way of getting there too and I think it
 

427
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,950
way of getting there too and I think it
is quicker than going through the nether

428
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:43,960
is quicker than going through the nether
 

429
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,640
is quicker than going through the nether
and here are the results everyone the

430
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:47,650
and here are the results everyone the
 

431
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,100
and here are the results everyone the
first rounds without the speed potion

432
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,110
first rounds without the speed potion
 

433
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,320
first rounds without the speed potion
took fifty seven point two seconds set

434
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,330
took fifty seven point two seconds set
 

435
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,290
took fifty seven point two seconds set
and round with the speed two potion he

436
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:58,300
and round with the speed two potion he
 

437
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,130
and round with the speed two potion he
goes quicker do you think it was quicker

438
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:01,140
goes quicker do you think it was quicker
 

439
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,330
goes quicker do you think it was quicker
fifty six point four seconds so yes it

440
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:06,340
fifty six point four seconds so yes it
 

441
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,420
fifty six point four seconds so yes it
was quicker but probably not really by

442
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:09,430
was quicker but probably not really by
 

443
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,470
was quicker but probably not really by
much if anything it probably just

444
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:13,480
much if anything it probably just
 

445
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,420
much if anything it probably just
factored in some air there I don't know

446
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:15,430
factored in some air there I don't know
 

447
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,280
factored in some air there I don't know
it might be a little bit quicker but

448
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,290
it might be a little bit quicker but
 

449
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,240
it might be a little bit quicker but
it's not worth it alright everybody so

450
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,250
it's not worth it alright everybody so
 

451
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,160
it's not worth it alright everybody so
moving on here let's do a bit of a horse

452
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,170
moving on here let's do a bit of a horse
 

453
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,780
moving on here let's do a bit of a horse
update shall we it's been a long time

454
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:24,790
update shall we it's been a long time
 

455
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,300
update shall we it's been a long time
since we like tried to get any better

456
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,310
since we like tried to get any better
 

457
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,270
since we like tried to get any better
horses so I moved that our best jumping

458
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:30,280
horses so I moved that our best jumping
 

459
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,340
horses so I moved that our best jumping
horses to this been here we only had two

460
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:32,350
horses to this been here we only had two
 

461
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,840
horses to this been here we only had two
here and I've been breeding them and

462
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:33,850
here and I've been breeding them and
 

463
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,220
here and I've been breeding them and
these are all there

464
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:35,230
these are all there
 

465
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,160
these are all there
their offspring basically you'll notice

466
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,170
their offspring basically you'll notice
 

467
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,920
their offspring basically you'll notice
there's something something not quite

468
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:40,930
there's something something not quite
 

469
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,190
there's something something not quite
right in this scene something doesn't

470
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:44,200
right in this scene something doesn't
 

471
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:51,410
right in this scene something doesn't
quite belong right you see what I mean

472
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:51,420

 

473
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,010

that's right there's a read back there

474
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,020
that's right there's a read back there
 

475
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,020
that's right there's a read back there
that's four blocks tall reads can only

476
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,030
that's four blocks tall reads can only
 

477

one here so we got to try move it so
 

637
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,420
one here so we got to try move it so
that it still works the way we

638
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:18,430
that it still works the way we
 

639
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,040
that it still works the way we
originally intended where it splits

640
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,050
originally intended where it splits
 

641
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:26,880
originally intended where it splits
between those two and those two um so

642
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:26,890
between those two and those two um so
 

643
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,510
between those two and those two um so
I'm gonna try possibly moving this let's

644
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:30,520
I'm gonna try possibly moving this let's
 

645
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,330
I'm gonna try possibly moving this let's
not worry about this for right now I say

646
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:33,340
not worry about this for right now I say
 

647
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,650
not worry about this for right now I say
that now then I'm going to find out it's

648
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:34,660
that now then I'm going to find out it's
 

649
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,200
that now then I'm going to find out it's
impossible to do it when I actually try

650
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,210
impossible to do it when I actually try
 

651
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,570
impossible to do it when I actually try
to work it out but maybe if we move it

652
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:39,580
to work it out but maybe if we move it
 

653
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,630
to work it out but maybe if we move it
over one so it's not below the redstone

654
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
over one so it's not below the redstone
 

655
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:50,720
over one so it's not below the redstone
torch put that there oops

656
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:50,730
torch put that there oops
 

657
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,970
torch put that there oops
let's see so when this when this is here

658
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:53,980
let's see so when this when this is here
 

659
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,500
let's see so when this when this is here
it'll power those two that's fine but

660
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:55,510
it'll power those two that's fine but
 

661
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,180
it'll power those two that's fine but
when it extends it'll be here and it

662
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,190
when it extends it'll be here and it
 

663
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,670
when it extends it'll be here and it
doesn't power these two

664
00:17:59,670 --> 00:17:59,680
doesn't power these two
 

665
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,720
doesn't power these two
what do we do oops this pic is too good

666
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:05,730
what do we do oops this pic is too good
 

667
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,220
what do we do oops this pic is too good
all right I think we have to have like

668
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,230
all right I think we have to have like
 

669
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:15,330
all right I think we have to have like
these as repeaters somehow I don't know

670
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:15,340
these as repeaters somehow I don't know
 

671
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,640
these as repeaters somehow I don't know
if that's going to work though and this

672
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:17,650
if that's going to work though and this
 

673
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,350
if that's going to work though and this
is regular wire so that when this

674
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
is regular wire so that when this
 

675
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,800
is regular wire so that when this
extends here all this is confusing

676
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:27,810
extends here all this is confusing
 

677
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,590
extends here all this is confusing
that's no good did this have to do away

678
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
that's no good did this have to do away
 

679
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,230
that's no good did this have to do away
with that can we get this to work off of

680
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
with that can we get this to work off of
 

681
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,670
with that can we get this to work off of
just one repeater is that possible

682
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:37,680
just one repeater is that possible
 

683
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,200
just one repeater is that possible
all right so if the block is here it'll

684
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,210
all right so if the block is here it'll
 

685
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,000
all right so if the block is here it'll
go to these two on the left but it'll

686
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,010
go to these two on the left but it'll
 

687
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,790
go to these two on the left but it'll
also go to this we need to stop that is

688
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:44,800
also go to this we need to stop that is
 

689
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,210
also go to this we need to stop that is
it possible to stop it doesn't look like

690
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:51,220
it possible to stop it doesn't look like
 

691
00:18:51,220 --> 00:19:00,240
it possible to stop it doesn't look like
it this is tricky um we could if the

692
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,250
it this is tricky um we could if the
 

693
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,520
it this is tricky um we could if the
power didn't go through here then we

694
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:05,530
power didn't go through here then we
 

695
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,890
power didn't go through here then we
could have like now now this just isn't

696
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:07,900
could have like now now this just isn't
 

697
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,370
could have like now now this just isn't
working I got one solution to the puzzle

698
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:11,380
working I got one solution to the puzzle
 

699
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,680
working I got one solution to the puzzle
here it's not as clean as what we had

700
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:13,690
here it's not as clean as what we had
 

701
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,210
here it's not as clean as what we had
originally but it'll work basically send

702
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:18,220
originally but it'll work basically send
 

703
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,710
originally but it'll work basically send
power to these two repeaters if the

704
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:19,720
power to these two repeaters if the
 

705
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,960
power to these two repeaters if the
block is here it goes through and it

706
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:21,970
block is here it goes through and it
 

707
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,680
block is here it goes through and it
goes to the two like we want and it

708
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:25,690
goes to the two like we want and it
 

709
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,750
goes to the two like we want and it
doesn't go to the left side if the block

710
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:27,760
doesn't go to the left side if the block
 

711
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,450
doesn't go to the left side if the block
is here it doesn't go here anymore

712
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:30,460
is here it doesn't go here anymore
 

713
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,730
is here it doesn't go here anymore
because I lower it at one so the power

714
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:32,740
because I lower it at one so the power
 

715
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,260
because I lower it at one so the power
doesn't go through to the right side but

716
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,270
doesn't go through to the right side but
 

717
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,030
doesn't go through to the right side but
it goes to the left side here if we have

718
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,040
it goes to the left side here if we have
 

719
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,840
it goes to the left side here if we have
blocks here and here and that should all

720
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:39,850
blocks here and here and that should all
 

721
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,820
blocks here and here and that should all
work out okay oh this is very quickly

722
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:44,830
work out okay oh this is very quickly
 

723
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,310
work out okay oh this is very quickly
turning into quite the nightmare it's

724
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:47,320
turning into quite the nightmare it's
 

725
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,600
turning into quite the nightmare it's
like wiring a circuit board almost so I

726
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:50,610
like wiring a circuit board almost so I
 

727
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,430
like wiring a circuit board almost so I
got the I got these Pistons controlled

728
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,440
got the I got these Pistons controlled
 

729
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,830
got the I got these Pistons controlled
again that works out just fine like it

730
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:55,840
again that works out just fine like it
 

731
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,550
again that works out just fine like it
did before with no interference from the

732
00:19:59,550 --> 00:19:59,560
did before with no interference from the
 

733
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,650
did before with no interference from the
torches above now which is good so

734
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:01,660
torches above now which is good so
 

735
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,160
torches above now which is good so
basically this second bit runs through

736
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,170
basically this second bit runs through
 

737
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:05,760
basically this second bit runs through
here

738
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:05,770
here
 

739
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,490
here
it's regular wire does not interfere

740
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:08,500
it's regular wire does not interfere
 

741
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,550
it's regular wire does not interfere
going this way because this is a a dust

742
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:11,560
going this way because this is a a dust
 

743
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
going this way because this is a a dust
but it goes through to the repeater

744
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:13,570
but it goes through to the repeater
 

745
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,990
but it goes through to the repeater
repeaters power the piston above through

746
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
repeaters power the piston above through
 

747
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,120
repeaters power the piston above through
this block and the pattern kind of just

748
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,130
this block and the pattern kind of just
 

749
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,279
this block and the pattern kind of just
repeats as far as I can tell there's no

750
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:20,289
repeats as far as I can tell there's no
 

751
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:23,909
repeats as far as I can tell there's no
interference at all which is good now

752
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
interference at all which is good now
 

753
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,120
interference at all which is good now
I'm starting on the third bit and for

754
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,130
I'm starting on the third bit and for
 

755
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,380
I'm starting on the third bit and for
some reason I thought it was going to

756
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,390
some reason I thought it was going to
 

757
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,690
some reason I thought it was going to
get like way easier as we made our way

758
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:30,700
get like way easier as we made our way
 

759
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,389
get like way easier as we made our way
down but we still need just as much wire

760
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:33,399
down but we still need just as much wire
 

761
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:39,630
down but we still need just as much wire
pretty much for every one of these so I

762
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:39,640
pretty much for every one of these so I
 

763
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,570
pretty much for every one of these so I
might do something like this like send a

764
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:42,580
might do something like this like send a
 

765
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,500
might do something like this like send a
pulse to the third bit here and either

766
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:46,510
pulse to the third bit here and either
 

767
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,169
pulse to the third bit here and either
goes to the left and to this one or if

768
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:49,179
goes to the left and to this one or if
 

769
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:52,860
goes to the left and to this one or if
it goes to the right it goes down and to

770
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:52,870
it goes to the right it goes down and to
 

771
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:59,100
it goes to the right it goes down and to
here and through this way it's getting

772
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,110
here and through this way it's getting
 

773
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,080
here and through this way it's getting
complicated though because I also need

774
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,090
complicated though because I also need
 

775
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,519
complicated though because I also need
some way of controlling this these

776
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:02,529
some way of controlling this these
 

777
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,440
some way of controlling this these
Pistons so I'll probably go above like

778
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:04,450
Pistons so I'll probably go above like
 

779
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:09,930
Pistons so I'll probably go above like
this the main challenge though I do this

780
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:09,940
this the main challenge though I do this
 

781
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,909
this the main challenge though I do this
if I had all the space in the world but

782
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:11,919
if I had all the space in the world but
 

783
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,789
if I had all the space in the world but
I'm trying to do it as compact as

784
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:14,799
I'm trying to do it as compact as
 

785
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,980
I'm trying to do it as compact as
possible ideally I didn't want to go

786
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:16,990
possible ideally I didn't want to go
 

787
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,360
possible ideally I didn't want to go
past this is like the last block I'm

788
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,370
past this is like the last block I'm
 

789
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:26,760
past this is like the last block I'm
willing to go horizontally and the lower

790
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:26,770
willing to go horizontally and the lower
 

791
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,070
willing to go horizontally and the lower
or the less we have to go downward the

792
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,080
or the less we have to go downward the
 

793
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,570
or the less we have to go downward the
better because if we're going to stack

794
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:30,580
better because if we're going to stack
 

795
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,190
better because if we're going to stack
these units on top of each other like

796
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,200
these units on top of each other like
 

797
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,810
these units on top of each other like
I'm planning

798
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:33,820
I'm planning
 

799
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,700
I'm planning
we'll have to stack them higher up if

800
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:35,710
we'll have to stack them higher up if
 

801
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,639
we'll have to stack them higher up if
they take more space vertically so

802
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:38,649
they take more space vertically so
 

803
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:41,570
they take more space vertically so
basically I was trying to fit it into

804
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:41,580
basically I was trying to fit it into
 

805
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:47,190
basically I was trying to fit it into
this which is not going to happen hey

806
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,200
this which is not going to happen hey
 

807
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,630
this which is not going to happen hey
Stu and mining fatigue 3 oh man the

808
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:51,640
Stu and mining fatigue 3 oh man the
 

809
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,860
Stu and mining fatigue 3 oh man the
mining fatigue winds though

810
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:52,870
mining fatigue winds though
 

811
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:57,090
mining fatigue winds though
unfortunately oh there it goes so maybe

812
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:57,100
unfortunately oh there it goes so maybe
 

813
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,000
unfortunately oh there it goes so maybe
one more thing we'll try here I wasn't

814
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,010
one more thing we'll try here I wasn't
 

815
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,120
one more thing we'll try here I wasn't
100% happy with the quartz and stained

816
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,130
100% happy with the quartz and stained
 

817
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,529
100% happy with the quartz and stained
clay thing we tried the other day so

818
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:04,539
clay thing we tried the other day so
 

819
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,630
clay thing we tried the other day so
just out of curiosity I'm not saying

820
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
just out of curiosity I'm not saying
 

821
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,220
just out of curiosity I'm not saying
we're going to go with it but I want to

822
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,230
we're going to go with it but I want to
 

823
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,840
we're going to go with it but I want to
try the nether brick and prismarine

824
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:12,850
try the nether brick and prismarine
 

825
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,519
try the nether brick and prismarine
combo that we did in in the nether there

826
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:16,529
combo that we did in in the nether there
 

827
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:20,909
combo that we did in in the nether there
so if we do this let's just play around

828
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:20,919
so if we do this let's just play around
 

829
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:23,100
so if we do this let's just play around
with it a little bit one possibility is

830
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,110
with it a little bit one possibility is
 

831
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,300
with it a little bit one possibility is
to have

832
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:24,310
to have
 

833
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:30,060
to have
break here like this I do kind of want

834
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,070
break here like this I do kind of want
 

835
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:34,140
break here like this I do kind of want
some stairs going across here but we

836
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,150
some stairs going across here but we
 

837
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,820
some stairs going across here but we
have to be careful not to use too much

838
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:35,830
have to be careful not to use too much
 

839
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,390
have to be careful not to use too much
nether brick which I kind of feel we

840
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:39,400
nether brick which I kind of feel we
 

841
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,900
nether brick which I kind of feel we
have done already the ground would

842
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:42,910
have done already the ground would
 

843
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,200
have done already the ground would
probably be the prismarine stuff the the

844
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,210
probably be the prismarine stuff the the
 

845
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:52,860
probably be the prismarine stuff the the
dark one all right and possibly then we

846
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:52,870
dark one all right and possibly then we
 

847
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:57,000
dark one all right and possibly then we
would do let's see what let's do one

848
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,010
would do let's see what let's do one
 

849
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,620
would do let's see what let's do one
more row and then what's this is this

850
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:01,630
more row and then what's this is this
 

851
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:07,410
more row and then what's this is this
needed for something oh it is mm okay I

852
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:07,420
needed for something oh it is mm okay I
 

853
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,510
needed for something oh it is mm okay I
can't remember did we use polish dye

854
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
can't remember did we use polish dye
 

855
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,100
can't remember did we use polish dye
right when we did it before let me try

856
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,110
right when we did it before let me try
 

857
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,110
right when we did it before let me try
that I think it was polished actually

858
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
that I think it was polished actually
 

859
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,800
that I think it was polished actually
not that we have to do it again but

860
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:18,810
not that we have to do it again but
 

861
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:23,760
not that we have to do it again but
let's try polished diorite maybe we'll

862
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:23,770
let's try polished diorite maybe we'll
 

863
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:30,180
let's try polished diorite maybe we'll
make it go around just like this yeah it

864
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,190
make it go around just like this yeah it
 

865
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,430
make it go around just like this yeah it
doesn't look right you only have two

866
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:32,440
doesn't look right you only have two
 

867
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,930
doesn't look right you only have two
blocks of the dark stuff here I don't

868
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:33,940
blocks of the dark stuff here I don't
 

869
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,420
blocks of the dark stuff here I don't
think it's going to look too good so we

870
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:36,430
think it's going to look too good so we
 

871
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:40,350
think it's going to look too good so we
would we would want at least four so

872
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:40,360
would we would want at least four so
 

873
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:48,660
would we would want at least four so
let's do this um lanterns let's get some

let's do this um lanterns let's get some
 

875
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,410
let's do this um lanterns let's get some
lanterns here and here I think we'll

876
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:52,420
lanterns here and here I think we'll
 

877
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,940
lanterns here and here I think we'll
have to get rid of the nether brick if

878
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:53,950
have to get rid of the nether brick if
 

879
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,280
have to get rid of the nether brick if
we do this and use this type of brick

880
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,290
we do this and use this type of brick
 

881
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,450
we do this and use this type of brick
yay mmm

882
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:00,460

888
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:17,940
here how else can we do this stairs
 

889
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:26,640
here how else can we do this stairs
maybe now ah well we gave it a try here

890
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:26,650
maybe now ah well we gave it a try here
 

891
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,980
maybe now ah well we gave it a try here
the problem I'm having is that there's

892
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:28,990
the problem I'm having is that there's
 

893
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,930
the problem I'm having is that there's
just not enough wall space to do what I

894
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:30,940
just not enough wall space to do what I
 

895
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,910
just not enough wall space to do what I
want to do it's only three blocks wide

896
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:32,920
want to do it's only three blocks wide
 

897
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,580
want to do it's only three blocks wide
and with all these different types of

898
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:35,590
and with all these different types of
 

899
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,670
and with all these different types of
blocks we're not going to make it work

900
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:37,680
blocks we're not going to make it work
 

901
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,440
blocks we're not going to make it work
um so yeah well we should probably wrap
