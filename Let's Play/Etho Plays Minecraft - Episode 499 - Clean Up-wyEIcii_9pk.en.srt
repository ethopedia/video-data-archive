most of anything I think we're gonna go
to the library today guys I know we

166
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:51,060
to the library today guys I know we
 

167
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,280
to the library today guys I know we
won't be able to finish it we're just

168
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,290
won't be able to finish it we're just

this is the exact same as last time you
know we might have worked on it since

180
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:03,540
know we might have worked on it since
 

181
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,089
know we might have worked on it since
last time I can't remember but for sure

182
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:05,099
last time I can't remember but for sure

185
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,020
I want to try to get like a roof on top
of it today if we can over this main

186
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,030
of it today if we can over this main
 

187
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,770
of it today if we can over this main
area to be fair though guys this is like

188
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:12,780
area to be fair though guys this is like
 

189
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,500
area to be fair though guys this is like
the biggest structure I've ever built in

190
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:15,510
the biggest structure I've ever built in
 

191
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,810
the biggest structure I've ever built in
Minecraft actually now that I think of

192
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:17,820
Minecraft actually now that I think of
 

193
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,610
Minecraft actually now that I think of
it like if you look at the man cave

194
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:19,620
it like if you look at the man cave
 

195
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,860
it like if you look at the man cave
everything is like six blocks tall at

196
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:21,870
everything is like six blocks tall at
 

197
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,770
everything is like six blocks tall at
most and it's just a bunch of little

198
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:24,780
most and it's just a bunch of little
 

199
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,440
most and it's just a bunch of little
things compiled together this is like

200
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,450
things compiled together this is like
 

201
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,160
things compiled together this is like
one being

202
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,170
one being
 

203
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,080
one being
giant structure and I'm not really good

204
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,090
giant structure and I'm not really good
 

205
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,080
giant structure and I'm not really good
at building those as you can tell so

206
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,090
at building those as you can tell so
 

207
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,730
at building those as you can tell so
yeah we'll see what happens with it here

208
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:37,740
yeah we'll see what happens with it here
 

209
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,200
yeah we'll see what happens with it here
today

210
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,210
today
 

211
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,570
today
I have decided a couple things with it

212
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:41,580
I have decided a couple things with it
 

213
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,190
I have decided a couple things with it
like guys looking at it here trying to

214
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:43,200
like guys looking at it here trying to
 

215
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,800
like guys looking at it here trying to
figure out what to do and I think we're

216
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:45,810
figure out what to do and I think we're
 

217
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,570
figure out what to do and I think we're
gonna put a glass roof on it so that it

218
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:47,580
gonna put a glass roof on it so that it
 

219
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,110
gonna put a glass roof on it so that it
stays Bright's inside during the day and

220
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
stays Bright's inside during the day and
 

221
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,110
stays Bright's inside during the day and
also I'm gonna try include another block

222
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,120
also I'm gonna try include another block
 

223
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,660
also I'm gonna try include another block
type in the build here because right now

224
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:56,670
type in the build here because right now
 

225
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,290
type in the build here because right now
it's like all wood you can't hardly tell

226
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:00,300
it's like all wood you can't hardly tell
 

227
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,370
it's like all wood you can't hardly tell
the difference between those colors

228
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:01,380
the difference between those colors
 

229
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,310
the difference between those colors
actually cuz a little lighting glitch

230
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:03,320
actually cuz a little lighting glitch
 

231
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,310
actually cuz a little lighting glitch
alright I may be a little bit actually

232
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:09,320

 

233
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,300

yeah we're gonna try to mix in some

234
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:11,310
yeah we're gonna try to mix in some
 

235
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,370
yeah we're gonna try to mix in some
orange clay in this build because right

236
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:13,380
orange clay in this build because right
 

237
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,860
orange clay in this build because right
now it's like all wood and there's not a

238
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:15,870
now it's like all wood and there's not a
 

239
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,420
now it's like all wood and there's not a
lot of color besides like the

240
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:17,430
lot of color besides like the
 

241
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,820
lot of color besides like the
bookshelves and and this middle area

242
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:19,830
bookshelves and and this middle area
 

243
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,360
bookshelves and and this middle area
here so we tried a bunch of different

244
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,370
here so we tried a bunch of different
 

245
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,790
here so we tried a bunch of different
clay colors when we were doing the

246
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:25,800
clay colors when we were doing the
 

247
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,760
clay colors when we were doing the
windows we tried like red and green now

248
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:28,770
windows we tried like red and green now
 

249
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,400
windows we tried like red and green now
usually when I do clay in Minecraft I go

250
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,410
usually when I do clay in Minecraft I go
 

251
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,650
usually when I do clay in Minecraft I go
for red or blue those are my two

252
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:33,660
for red or blue those are my two
 

253
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,770
for red or blue those are my two
preferred but lately I have found out

254
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:35,780
preferred but lately I have found out
 

255
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,770
preferred but lately I have found out
orange clay is really good with dark oak

256
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:39,780
orange clay is really good with dark oak
 

257
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,250
orange clay is really good with dark oak
and like regular oak and spruce it's a

258
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:43,260
and like regular oak and spruce it's a
 

259
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,320
and like regular oak and spruce it's a
really good mix when you have these

260
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:45,330
really good mix when you have these
 

261
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,760
really good mix when you have these
together so I'm gonna change out the

262
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:46,770
together so I'm gonna change out the
 

263
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,850
together so I'm gonna change out the
windows to orange clay and that way we

264
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:49,860
windows to orange clay and that way we
 

265
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,410
windows to orange clay and that way we
have a little bit more variation in the

266
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:51,420
have a little bit more variation in the
 

267
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:58,100
have a little bit more variation in the
build here that's impossible

268
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,110
build here that's impossible
 

269
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,350
build here that's impossible
it can't be done I'm telling you there's

270
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,360
it can't be done I'm telling you there's
 

271
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,410
it can't be done I'm telling you there's
no way guys can you jump four blocks in

272
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:03,420
no way guys can you jump four blocks in
 

273
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,850
no way guys can you jump four blocks in
Minecraft I don't know actually I've

274
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:04,860
Minecraft I don't know actually I've
 

275
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,060
Minecraft I don't know actually I've
never like gotten good at parkour I

276
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,070
never like gotten good at parkour I
 

277
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,920
never like gotten good at parkour I
can't make this jump though I feel like

278
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:09,930
can't make this jump though I feel like
 

279
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,660
can't make this jump though I feel like
I should be able to one two three four I

280
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:13,670
I should be able to one two three four I
 

281
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,820
I should be able to one two three four I
don't know I don't know I know I can't

282
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:16,830
don't know I don't know I know I can't
 

283
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,630
don't know I don't know I know I can't
if I do that that's kind of cheating

284
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:19,640
if I do that that's kind of cheating
 

285
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,890
if I do that that's kind of cheating
that's trying to save an ender pearl you

286
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:21,900
that's trying to save an ender pearl you
 

287
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,840
that's trying to save an ender pearl you
know they're so valuable

288
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:23,850
know they're so valuable
 

289
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,960
know they're so valuable
I still slipped off oh my goodness I'm

290
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:26,970
I still slipped off oh my goodness I'm
 

291
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:32,570
I still slipped off oh my goodness I'm
trying to get up here and I get

292
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:32,580
trying to get up here and I get
 

293
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,610
trying to get up here and I get
distracted easy okay we're gonna go up

294
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:34,620
distracted easy okay we're gonna go up
 

295
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,260
distracted easy okay we're gonna go up
here we're gonna see a comparison of

296
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,270
here we're gonna see a comparison of
 

297
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,040
here we're gonna see a comparison of
orange and and just oak so that's that's

298
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,050
orange and and just oak so that's that's
 

299
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,540
orange and and just oak so that's that's
the new window that's the old one I

300
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:41,550
the new window that's the old one I
 

301
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,119
the new window that's the old one I
think this

302
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:42,129
think this
 

303
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:44,189
think this
a lot better right so we're gonna change

304
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:44,199
a lot better right so we're gonna change
 

305
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,010
a lot better right so we're gonna change
out those ones as well and let's add a

306
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,020
out those ones as well and let's add a
 

307
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,999
out those ones as well and let's add a
ring of slabs on top of here and Bob

308
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:51,009
ring of slabs on top of here and Bob
 

309
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,229
ring of slabs on top of here and Bob
would make lots of little changes around

310
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:52,239
would make lots of little changes around
 

311
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,269
would make lots of little changes around
this building to add a bit of variation

312
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:54,279
this building to add a bit of variation
 

313
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,639
this building to add a bit of variation
to it one of my design flaws with this

314
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:56,649
to it one of my design flaws with this
 

315
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,519
to it one of my design flaws with this
when you center of the buildings here

316
00:06:59,519 --> 00:06:59,529
when you center of the buildings here
 

317
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:02,189
when you center of the buildings here
right and if you walk in usually when

318
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:02,199
right and if you walk in usually when
 

319
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,329
right and if you walk in usually when
you walk into the building you want to

320
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:03,339
you walk into the building you want to
 

321
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,949
you walk into the building you want to
see a nice open view of the building and

322
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:04,959
see a nice open view of the building and
 

323
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,049
see a nice open view of the building and
we're gonna walk in right into a wall

324
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:07,059
we're gonna walk in right into a wall
 

325
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,899
we're gonna walk in right into a wall
basically so we might put like two doors

326
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:09,909
basically so we might put like two doors
 

327
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:13,290
basically so we might put like two doors
on it's like one here one over there I'm

328
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:13,300
on it's like one here one over there I'm
 

329
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,659
on it's like one here one over there I'm
not sure yet though all right let's put

330
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:15,669
not sure yet though all right let's put

I like that all right this is it guys I
hate working on roofs but I've put it

338
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:33,399
hate working on roofs but I've put it
 

339
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,759
hate working on roofs but I've put it
off too long now this is my plan we're

340
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:35,769
off too long now this is my plan we're
 

341
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:38,129
off too long now this is my plan we're
gonna try to do like a dome ceiling made

342
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:38,139
gonna try to do like a dome ceiling made
 

343
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,040
gonna try to do like a dome ceiling made
out of glass so it's gonna go like and

344
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,050
out of glass so it's gonna go like and
 

345
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,779
out of glass so it's gonna go like and
then back down to the other side and

346
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:42,789
then back down to the other side and
 

347
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:45,659
then back down to the other side and
we're gonna try connect that to a wood

348
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:45,669
we're gonna try connect that to a wood
 

349
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:47,369
we're gonna try connect that to a wood
beam that runs along here it's gonna be

350
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:47,379
beam that runs along here it's gonna be
 

351
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:49,769
beam that runs along here it's gonna be
like just a long cylinder that runs down

352
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:49,779
like just a long cylinder that runs down
 

353
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:50,850
like just a long cylinder that runs down
the building here it's gonna be pretty

354
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:50,860
the building here it's gonna be pretty
 

355
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,369
the building here it's gonna be pretty
simple because like I said I don't I

356
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:53,379
simple because like I said I don't I
 

357
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,019
simple because like I said I don't I
don't really like making grooves I'm not

358
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:55,029
don't really like making grooves I'm not
 

359
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:57,169
don't really like making grooves I'm not
good at it don't really know what to do

360
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:57,179
good at it don't really know what to do
 

361
00:07:57,179 --> 00:08:01,139
good at it don't really know what to do
let's let's connect it to this log here

362
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:01,149
let's let's connect it to this log here
 

363
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,509
let's let's connect it to this log here
so this is gonna run down the length of

364
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:03,519
so this is gonna run down the length of
 

365
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,869
so this is gonna run down the length of
the building and I matched up work next

366
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
the building and I matched up work next
 

367
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,009
the building and I matched up work next
to it's actually probably easier just to

368
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:11,019
to it's actually probably easier just to
 

369
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:13,529
to it's actually probably easier just to
go on top of it yeah let's go on top I

370
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:13,539
go on top of it yeah let's go on top I
 

371
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:16,230
go on top of it yeah let's go on top I
think it should connect to that post

372
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
think it should connect to that post
 

373
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,040
think it should connect to that post
over there let's just make sure okay

374
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,050
over there let's just make sure okay
 

375
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,230
over there let's just make sure okay
yeah here we are so now if we go down

376
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
yeah here we are so now if we go down
 

377
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,029
yeah here we are so now if we go down
here and connect this up that should be

378
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
here and connect this up that should be
 

379
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,850
here and connect this up that should be
our dome brace or whatever so for this

380
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:32,860
our dome brace or whatever so for this
 

381
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,469
our dome brace or whatever so for this
entire distance here it's gonna be like

382
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
entire distance here it's gonna be like
 

383
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,230
entire distance here it's gonna be like
a cylinder dome that runs along the

384
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,240
a cylinder dome that runs along the
 

385
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,589
a cylinder dome that runs along the
building is the plan whoa okay so now we

386
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:40,599
building is the plan whoa okay so now we
 

387
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,809
building is the plan whoa okay so now we
got to like create the dome I'm gonna

388
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:42,819
got to like create the dome I'm gonna
 

389
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:46,740
got to like create the dome I'm gonna
try let's try come out here and kind of

390
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:46,750
try let's try come out here and kind of
 

391
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,269
try let's try come out here and kind of
line it up with the window here I guess

392
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:48,279
line it up with the window here I guess
 

393
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,019
line it up with the window here I guess
and let's grab some garbage blocks that

394
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:52,029
and let's grab some garbage blocks that
 

395
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:54,060
and let's grab some garbage blocks that
we can delete

396
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,070
we can delete
 

397
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,259
we can delete
let's see let's go up like so now we'll

398
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:58,269
let's see let's go up like so now we'll
 

399
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:00,230
let's see let's go up like so now we'll
start curving it a bit more we'll go to

400
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
start curving it a bit more we'll go to
 

401
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,420
start curving it a bit more we'll go to
and fill up here and we'll go another

402
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:06,430
and fill up here and we'll go another
 

403
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,030
and fill up here and we'll go another
two and then probably yeah we can do the

404
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
two and then probably yeah we can do the
 

405
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,569
two and then probably yeah we can do the
center now I think so then we'll go

406
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:11,579
center now I think so then we'll go
 

407
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:14,610
center now I think so then we'll go
three or five or something I guess three

408
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:14,620
three or five or something I guess three
 

409
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,430
three or five or something I guess three
and then it'll start going down let's

410
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
and then it'll start going down let's
 

411
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,530
and then it'll start going down let's
just check out that shape see what it

412
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:19,540
just check out that shape see what it
 

413
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,350
just check out that shape see what it
looks like

414
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
looks like
 

415
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,129
looks like
alright to run over here can't really

416
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:26,139
alright to run over here can't really
 

417
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:27,180
alright to run over here can't really
tell let's go to the middle of the

418
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,190
tell let's go to the middle of the
 

419
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,100
tell let's go to the middle of the
building I think that'll work right so

420
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,110
building I think that'll work right so
 

421
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,949
building I think that'll work right so
that I'll connect to the other side

422
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959

 

423
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,180

alright guys so this is gonna be really

424
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,190
alright guys so this is gonna be really
 

425
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,360
alright guys so this is gonna be really
simple like I said basically I copied

426
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,370
simple like I said basically I copied
 

427
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,759
simple like I said basically I copied
that curve or that wooden arch over here

428
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:44,769
that curve or that wooden arch over here
 

429
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:46,740
that curve or that wooden arch over here
to the other side connected it to that

430
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:46,750
to the other side connected it to that
 

431
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,309
to the other side connected it to that
post

432
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:47,319
post
 

433
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:50,040
post
and then added some wood slabs and

434
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,050
and then added some wood slabs and
 

435
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,680
and then added some wood slabs and
stairs and stuff here just to add a bit

436
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:52,690
stairs and stuff here just to add a bit
 

437
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,720
stairs and stuff here just to add a bit
of variation to it also kind of makes it

438
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:54,730
of variation to it also kind of makes it
 

439
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,129
of variation to it also kind of makes it
look like the glass is being supported

440
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:56,139
look like the glass is being supported
 

441
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:59,280
look like the glass is being supported
by something and now we just gotta fill

442
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,290
by something and now we just gotta fill
 

443
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,829
by something and now we just gotta fill
this all in nice and simple and since

444
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
this all in nice and simple and since
 

445
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,329
this all in nice and simple and since
it's a glass roof it's gonna let a lot

446
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:03,339
it's a glass roof it's gonna let a lot
 

447
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:05,100
it's a glass roof it's gonna let a lot
of light in down below and hopefully the

448
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,110
of light in down below and hopefully the
 

449
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,500
of light in down below and hopefully the
building will look pretty good we'll

450
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:07,510
building will look pretty good we'll
 

451
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,920
building will look pretty good we'll
have to add torches everywhere ah yeah

452
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:10,930
have to add torches everywhere ah yeah
 

453
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,660
have to add torches everywhere ah yeah
yeah so check it out so that is a pretty

454
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:12,670
yeah so check it out so that is a pretty
 

455
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,400
yeah so check it out so that is a pretty
big chunk of the roof finish just like

456
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,410
big chunk of the roof finish just like
 

457
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,100
big chunk of the roof finish just like
that kind of cheesed it a little bit but

458
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,110
that kind of cheesed it a little bit but
 

459
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,069
that kind of cheesed it a little bit but
I don't think it looks too bad alright

460
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:19,079
I don't think it looks too bad alright
 

461
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:20,519
I don't think it looks too bad alright
it'll be good

462
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:20,529
it'll be good
 

463
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:22,530
it'll be good
now these are other sections like over

464
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:22,540
now these are other sections like over
 

465
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,879
now these are other sections like over
here we'll do something different like

466
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:23,889
here we'll do something different like
 

467
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,220
here we'll do something different like
these side areas they still need a roof

468
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,230
these side areas they still need a roof
 

469
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,340
these side areas they still need a roof
- I don't want to do the same exact same

470
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:29,350
- I don't want to do the same exact same
 

471
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,860
- I don't want to do the same exact same
thing their exact same thing same there

472
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:31,870
thing their exact same thing same there
 

473
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:38,129
thing their exact same thing same there
is that what I said uh-huh anyways so

474
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:38,139

let's try to connect this open area to
 

477
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:42,360
let's try to connect this open area to
the this portion - I just will just go

478

the this portion - I just will just go
 

479
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,350
the this portion - I just will just go
up with this see how that goes up over

480
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:46,360
up with this see how that goes up over
 

481
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,980
up with this see how that goes up over
here boop-boop-boop and I think oops I

482
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:51,990
here boop-boop-boop and I think oops I
 

483

think what we'll do is extend the window

484
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:54,639
think what we'll do is extend the window
 

485
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,100
think what we'll do is extend the window
up a little bit - let's do like this

486
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,110
up a little bit - let's do like this
 

487
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,389
up a little bit - let's do like this
so that'll come over and just kind of

488
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:03,399
so that'll come over and just kind of
 

489
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,200
so that'll come over and just kind of
fill this all in all right oops

490
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,210

okay that goes there let's punch this
 

493
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,580
okay that goes there let's punch this
out to that and that and then we'll fill

494
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:11,590
out to that and that and then we'll fill
 

495
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,910
out to that and that and then we'll fill
that in with glass too

496
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
that in with glass too
 

497
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,410
that in with glass too

all right so I think that wall is all
finished up the only thing that might

500
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:18,670
finished up the only thing that might
 

501
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,400
finished up the only thing that might
change is the villager head there a lot

502
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,410
change is the villager head there a lot
 

503

506
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:25,630
villager I know I have not figured out
 

507
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,210
villager I know I have not figured out
what to put there instead though so it's

508
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:27,220
what to put there instead though so it's
 

509
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,160
what to put there instead though so it's
it's gonna stay there for for now

510
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,170
it's gonna stay there for for now
 

511
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,330
it's gonna stay there for for now
anyways until I think is something else

512
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:32,340
anyways until I think is something else
 

513
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,560
anyways until I think is something else
one thing though that I've kind of

514
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:34,570
one thing though that I've kind of
 

515
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,230
one thing though that I've kind of
realized is we have to do something

516
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,240
realized is we have to do something
 

517
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,050
realized is we have to do something
about these little pillars or whatever

518
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,060
about these little pillars or whatever
 

519
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,580
about these little pillars or whatever
so we should probably extend them to the

520
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:41,590
so we should probably extend them to the
 

521
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,130
so we should probably extend them to the
roof as well right now they're just like

522
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,140
roof as well right now they're just like
 

523
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,360
roof as well right now they're just like
chopped off and it doesn't look quite

524
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:45,370
chopped off and it doesn't look quite
 

525
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,800
chopped off and it doesn't look quite
right so let's let's hop up on these and

526
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:49,810
right so let's let's hop up on these and
 

527
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,130
right so let's let's hop up on these and
try to do something with them my plan is

528
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,140
try to do something with them my plan is
 

529
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,410
try to do something with them my plan is
to like put some bookshelves in here -

530
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:57,420
to like put some bookshelves in here -
 

531
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,670
to like put some bookshelves in here -
all right so this will go up to the

532
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
all right so this will go up to the
 

533
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,250
all right so this will go up to the
glass oh I am stuck here okay move over

534
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,260
glass oh I am stuck here okay move over
 

535
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,980
glass oh I am stuck here okay move over
yeah that goes up there and like this

536
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:07,990
yeah that goes up there and like this
 

537
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,820
yeah that goes up there and like this
alright and then how do we do this let's

538
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:11,830
alright and then how do we do this let's
 

539
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,550
alright and then how do we do this let's
I want to replace these with oak just

540
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
I want to replace these with oak just
 

541
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,600
I want to replace these with oak just
for a little bit more color they're just

542
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:18,610
for a little bit more color they're just
 

543
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,460
for a little bit more color they're just
kind of there for decoration and - to

544
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:20,470
kind of there for decoration and - to
 

545
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,370
kind of there for decoration and - to
stop mobs from spawning - and then I

546
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:23,380
stop mobs from spawning - and then I
 

547
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,380
stop mobs from spawning - and then I
think we'll hook some bookshelves in

548
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,390
think we'll hook some bookshelves in
 

549
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,610
think we'll hook some bookshelves in
between here and make it go all the way

550
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:29,620
between here and make it go all the way
 

551
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,480
between here and make it go all the way
up to the top probably hmmm that doesn't

552
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:33,490
up to the top probably hmmm that doesn't
 

553
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,520
up to the top probably hmmm that doesn't
look quite right does it it looks weird

554
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:35,530
look quite right does it it looks weird
 

555
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,220
look quite right does it it looks weird
just like the glass sitting on top of it

556
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,230
just like the glass sitting on top of it
 

557
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,460
just like the glass sitting on top of it
to me what do we do what do we do and

558
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:41,470
to me what do we do what do we do and
 

559
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,230
to me what do we do what do we do and
the bookshelves are a little bit weird

560
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,240
the bookshelves are a little bit weird
 

561
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,680
the bookshelves are a little bit weird
too

562
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:43,690
too
 

563
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,430
too
especially on this side cuz it's not 3d

564
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:46,440
especially on this side cuz it's not 3d
 

565
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,900
especially on this side cuz it's not 3d
so I'm thinking we also add arches from

566
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:51,910
so I'm thinking we also add arches from
 

567
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,220
so I'm thinking we also add arches from
this side to the other side maybe we'll

568
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,230
this side to the other side maybe we'll
 

569
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,790
this side to the other side maybe we'll
try it out alright everybody so I don't

570
00:12:59,790 --> 00:12:59,800
try it out alright everybody so I don't
 

571
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,290
try it out alright everybody so I don't
want to spend the whole episode building

572
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:01,300
want to spend the whole episode building
 

573
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,000
want to spend the whole episode building
here at the library we'll try to do some

574
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,010
here at the library we'll try to do some
 

575
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,950
here at the library we'll try to do some
other stuff even though I got nothing

576
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:04,960
other stuff even though I got nothing
 

577
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,380
other stuff even though I got nothing
planned right now but I'll just show you

578
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:07,390
planned right now but I'll just show you
 

579
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,390
planned right now but I'll just show you
the the final results of the building

580
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:09,400
the the final results of the building
 

581
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,190
the the final results of the building
here I did a little bit more so we got

582
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
here I did a little bit more so we got
 

583
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,690
here I did a little bit more so we got
the arches I think that looks a lot

584
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:12,700
the arches I think that looks a lot
 

585
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,210
the arches I think that looks a lot
better now and that is actually the very

586
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:15,220
better now and that is actually the very
 

587
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,530
better now and that is actually the very
center of the building so it kind of

588
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:16,540
center of the building so it kind of
 

589
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,840
center of the building so it kind of
works out it's like 10 blocks of glass

590
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:18,850
works out it's like 10 blocks of glass
 

591
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,120
works out it's like 10 blocks of glass
on that side and 10 blocks on that side

592
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,130
on that side and 10 blocks on that side
 

593
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,410
on that side and 10 blocks on that side
so that's cool and then just to break

594
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:25,420
so that's cool and then just to break
 

595
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,330
so that's cool and then just to break
the break up the bookshelves a bit more

596
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:27,340
the break up the bookshelves a bit more
 

597
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,480
the break up the bookshelves a bit more
I added some trapdoors here tried to

598
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:30,490
I added some trapdoors here tried to
 

599
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,940
I added some trapdoors here tried to
make it look like it connects with the

600
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:31,950
make it look like it connects with the
 

601
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,290
make it look like it connects with the
wooden stairs and stuff up there and

602
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:34,300
wooden stairs and stuff up there and
 

603
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,720
wooden stairs and stuff up there and
then I also worked at fiddling around

604
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:36,730
then I also worked at fiddling around
 

605
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,760
then I also worked at fiddling around
with this area so we did like an orange

606
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:38,770
with this area so we did like an orange
 

607
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,160
with this area so we did like an orange
sky lights I think it looks pretty good

608
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,170
sky lights I think it looks pretty good
 

609
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,870
sky lights I think it looks pretty good
I'm happy with that flower pots for

610
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
I'm happy with that flower pots for
 

611
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,990
I'm happy with that flower pots for
decoration and stuff connected all these

612
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
decoration and stuff connected all these
 

613
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,260
decoration and stuff connected all these
beams up to this part here and I think

614
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:49,270
beams up to this part here and I think
 

615
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,820
beams up to this part here and I think
that should be good for now I think

616
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:50,830
that should be good for now I think
 

617
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,990
that should be good for now I think
that's all we're gonna do on the library

618
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
that's all we're gonna do on the library
 

619
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,230
that's all we're gonna do on the library
for today so we still got this big big

620
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:55,240
for today so we still got this big big
 

621
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,000
for today so we still got this big big
area here to work out and we're not

622
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,010
area here to work out and we're not
 

623
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,640
area here to work out and we're not
gonna extend that roof don't marry it

624
00:13:59,640 --> 00:13:59,650
gonna extend that roof don't marry it
 

625
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,500
gonna extend that roof don't marry it
anymore we'll probably change this up

626
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:01,510
anymore we'll probably change this up
 

627
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,930
anymore we'll probably change this up
and turn into a semicircle or something

628
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:03,940
and turn into a semicircle or something
 

629
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,020
and turn into a semicircle or something
I don't know exactly what we're doing

630
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,030
