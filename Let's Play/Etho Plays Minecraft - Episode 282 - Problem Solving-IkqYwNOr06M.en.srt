so somebody on reddit they had like
quartz pillars and the walls were blue

186
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,410
quartz pillars and the walls were blue
 

187
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:28,010
quartz pillars and the walls were blue
it looked really really nice so we might

188
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,020
it looked really really nice so we might
 

189
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,140
it looked really really nice so we might
try to adopt that look for this it was

190
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,150
try to adopt that look for this it was
 

191
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,300
try to adopt that look for this it was
kind of like this except they use actual

192
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,310
kind of like this except they use actual
 

193
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,480
kind of like this except they use actual
quartz pillar blocks but those two

194
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:35,490
quartz pillar blocks but those two
 

195
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:41,180
quartz pillar blocks but those two
colors together pretty cool there

196
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,190
colors together pretty cool there
 

197
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,590
colors together pretty cool there
example looked a lot better than mine

198
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:42,600
example looked a lot better than mine
 

199
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,080
example looked a lot better than mine
here just cuz I put this together real

200
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,090
here just cuz I put this together real
 

201
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,860
here just cuz I put this together real
quick but maybe for the floor like we

202
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:48,870
quick but maybe for the floor like we
 

203
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,140
quick but maybe for the floor like we
got this five block wide floor we want

204
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,150
got this five block wide floor we want
 

205
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,040
got this five block wide floor we want
to work with maybe let's I got two

206
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,050
to work with maybe let's I got two
 

207
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,899
to work with maybe let's I got two
suggestions really like two main

208
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:56,909
suggestions really like two main
 

209
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,870
suggestions really like two main
suggestions use clay on the floor or

210
00:05:59,870 --> 00:05:59,880
suggestions use clay on the floor or
 

211
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,570
suggestions use clay on the floor or
else

212
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:00,580
else
 

213
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,469
else
maybe color-code each station here with

214
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
maybe color-code each station here with
 

215
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,560
maybe color-code each station here with
the specific color for the potion like I

216
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:07,570
the specific color for the potion like I
 

217
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,719
the specific color for the potion like I
did my other potion room like maybe for

218
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:09,729
did my other potion room like maybe for
 

219
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:12,270
did my other potion room like maybe for
healing potions have red on the side if

220
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:12,280
healing potions have red on the side if
 

221
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,710
healing potions have red on the side if
this was the side that made healing

222
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:13,720
this was the side that made healing
 

223
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,260
this was the side that made healing
potions and if this was speed potions

224
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,270
potions and if this was speed potions
 

225
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,960
potions and if this was speed potions
use light blue stripe like all the way

226
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:18,970
use light blue stripe like all the way
 

227
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,450
use light blue stripe like all the way
along here so we might do it that way or

228
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:21,460
along here so we might do it that way or
 

229
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,900
along here so we might do it that way or
we might just keep a blue theme

230
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,910
we might just keep a blue theme
 

231
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:30,629
we might just keep a blue theme
throughout the whole lab let's just try

232
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
throughout the whole lab let's just try
 

233
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,860
throughout the whole lab let's just try
this out did I make the deep blue I did

234
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:34,870
this out did I make the deep blue I did
 

235
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:44,659
this out did I make the deep blue I did
okay I do like those two colors together

236
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:44,669

 

237
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:49,350

yeah okay another idea is to have ice in

238
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
yeah okay another idea is to have ice in
 

239
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,560
yeah okay another idea is to have ice in
the middle could be cool you could put

240
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:52,570
the middle could be cool you could put
 

241
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,120
the middle could be cool you could put
something underneath the ground that way

242
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,130
something underneath the ground that way
 

243
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,070
something underneath the ground that way
something to look at and also you could

244
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
something to look at and also you could
 

245
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,430
something to look at and also you could
run and jump on it quickly let's try

246
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
run and jump on it quickly let's try
 

247
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:09,659
run and jump on it quickly let's try
blue here what do we think of that that

248
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:09,669
blue here what do we think of that that
 

249
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,100
blue here what do we think of that that
is pretty cool I'm guessing I should

250
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,110
is pretty cool I'm guessing I should
 

251
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,000
is pretty cool I'm guessing I should
maybe put the dark on the edges so

252
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,010
maybe put the dark on the edges so
 

253
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:19,159
maybe put the dark on the edges so
instead of in the middle the hunter

254
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:19,169
instead of in the middle the hunter
 

255
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:22,649
instead of in the middle the hunter
becomes the hunted in this exciting

256
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:22,659
becomes the hunted in this exciting
 

257
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:26,629
becomes the hunted in this exciting
conclusion - there is that creeper

258
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
conclusion - there is that creeper
 

259
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,610
conclusion - there is that creeper
because running away did you see that

260
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:29,620
because running away did you see that
 

261
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,379
because running away did you see that
you knew it was coming um I do like this

262
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:34,389
you knew it was coming um I do like this
 

263
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,210
you knew it was coming um I do like this
quite a bit we're gonna try a few

264
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:36,220
quite a bit we're gonna try a few
 

265
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,620
quite a bit we're gonna try a few
different things so I'm gonna clip or

266
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:37,630
different things so I'm gonna clip or
 

267
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,550
different things so I'm gonna clip or
cut away and try with ice and with wool

268
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:41,560
cut away and try with ice and with wool
 

269
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,800
cut away and try with ice and with wool
and with different colors and stuff

270
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:43,810
and with different colors and stuff
 

271
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,379
and with different colors and stuff
we'll figure out what we like the most

272
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:45,389
we'll figure out what we like the most
 

273
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:47,640
we'll figure out what we like the most
one thing you will notice though it is a

274
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:47,650
one thing you will notice though it is a
 

275
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,490
one thing you will notice though it is a
little dark in the middle goes down to

276
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:50,500
little dark in the middle goes down to
 

277
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,550
little dark in the middle goes down to
block lighting eight and I think that's

278
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:53,560
block lighting eight and I think that's
 

279
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,110
block lighting eight and I think that's
coming from a block up so it's actually

280
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
coming from a block up so it's actually
 

281
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,930
coming from a block up so it's actually
seven so in the middle stuff could

282
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:57,940
seven so in the middle stuff could
 

283
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,029
seven so in the middle stuff could
probably spawn so we want to get more

284
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:00,039
probably spawn so we want to get more
 

285
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,969
probably spawn so we want to get more
lighting in here and with my design I

286
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:04,979
lighting in here and with my design I
 

287
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:08,459
lighting in here and with my design I
think there's a room for one block we

288
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:08,469
think there's a room for one block we
 

289
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:10,350
think there's a room for one block we
can hide there so let's put a piece of

290
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:10,360
can hide there so let's put a piece of
 

291
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,170
can hide there so let's put a piece of
glowstone that will increase the

292
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:13,180
glowstone that will increase the
 

293
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,159
glowstone that will increase the
lighting around here

294
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:14,169
lighting around here
 

295
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:19,320
lighting around here
just a little bit if we do that for all

296
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,330
just a little bit if we do that for all
 

297
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,589
just a little bit if we do that for all
of these course want to cover it up it's

298
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:22,599
of these course want to cover it up it's
 

299
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:28,550
of these course want to cover it up it's
a little darker I think oh maybe not I

300
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
a little darker I think oh maybe not I
 

301
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,860
a little darker I think oh maybe not I
thought it would wait a second nine

302
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:34,870
thought it would wait a second nine
 

303
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:47,250
thought it would wait a second nine
eight nine mmm it's the same 14 13 12 15

304
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,260
eight nine mmm it's the same 14 13 12 15
 

305
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,750
eight nine mmm it's the same 14 13 12 15
14 should be to lighter shouldn't it

306
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760

 

307
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,069

I'll work on this for just a sec I'll

308
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:56,079
I'll work on this for just a sec I'll
 

309
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:59,910
I'll work on this for just a sec I'll
figure out the lighting all right so I

310
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
figure out the lighting all right so I
 

311
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,470
figure out the lighting all right so I
was able to get the light level one

312
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:01,480
was able to get the light level one
 

313
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,319
was able to get the light level one
higher it turns out I had torches behind

314
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:04,329
higher it turns out I had torches behind
 

315
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:05,850
higher it turns out I had torches behind
the broom stand there so I just replaced

316
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:05,860
the broom stand there so I just replaced
 

317
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,180
the broom stand there so I just replaced
the torches with glowstone glow stones

318
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,190
the torches with glowstone glow stones
 

319
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,329
the torches with glowstone glow stones
one light level higher than the torch so

320
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:11,339
one light level higher than the torch so
 

321
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,620
one light level higher than the torch so
that's about as best as we can do

322
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:13,630
that's about as best as we can do
 

323
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,290
that's about as best as we can do
because all this stuff here is critical

324
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:16,300
because all this stuff here is critical
 

325
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,960
because all this stuff here is critical
we can't move that we could hide it in

326
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:18,970
we can't move that we could hide it in
 

327
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,759
we can't move that we could hide it in
the floor if we wanted more lighting or

328
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:20,769
the floor if we wanted more lighting or
 

329
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,430
the floor if we wanted more lighting or
in the ceiling but that's I think this

330
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
in the ceiling but that's I think this
 

331
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,030
in the ceiling but that's I think this
is OK mobs won't spawn at this level so

332
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
is OK mobs won't spawn at this level so
 

333
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,810
is OK mobs won't spawn at this level so
that's good with these with these like

334
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:30,820
that's good with these with these like
 

335
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,079
that's good with these with these like
panels these quartz panels they are a

336
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:34,089
panels these quartz panels they are a
 

337
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:36,569
panels these quartz panels they are a
little plain I find so I was messing

338
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:36,579
little plain I find so I was messing
 

339
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:41,160
little plain I find so I was messing
around with maybe changing the bottom I

340
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,170
around with maybe changing the bottom I
 

341
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,170
around with maybe changing the bottom I
have chiseled quartz at the bottom on

342
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:43,180
have chiseled quartz at the bottom on
 

343
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,199
have chiseled quartz at the bottom on
this one I got the pillars facing

344
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:46,209
this one I got the pillars facing
 

345
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:50,400
this one I got the pillars facing
towards us on this one just trying to

346
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:50,410
towards us on this one just trying to
 

347
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,990
towards us on this one just trying to
add a little more texture to it

348
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
add a little more texture to it
 

349
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,689
add a little more texture to it
and this is a sideways pillar could also

350
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:54,699
and this is a sideways pillar could also
 

351
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:59,939
and this is a sideways pillar could also
do a vertical pillar I guess where did

352
00:09:59,939 --> 00:09:59,949
do a vertical pillar I guess where did
 

353
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:03,550
do a vertical pillar I guess where did
that go

354
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:03,560

 

355
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,460

it's actually not bad I think either

356
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:07,470
it's actually not bad I think either
 

357
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,820
it's actually not bad I think either
this vertical or the chiseled is the

358
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:10,830
this vertical or the chiseled is the
 

359
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,360
this vertical or the chiseled is the
best

360
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,370
best
 

361
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,310
best
I almost feel I need some of that on the

362
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
I almost feel I need some of that on the
 

363
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,870
I almost feel I need some of that on the
top part of this to bounce out the look

364
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:17,880
top part of this to bounce out the look
 

365
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,389
top part of this to bounce out the look
though but what we won't worry about it

366
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
though but what we won't worry about it
 

367
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,730
though but what we won't worry about it
too much I'm going to mess with the the

368
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:22,740
too much I'm going to mess with the the
 

369
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,680
too much I'm going to mess with the the
floor a bit here show you a few

370
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:24,690
floor a bit here show you a few
 

371
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,990
floor a bit here show you a few
different things I try first step let's

372
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,000
different things I try first step let's
 

373
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,420
different things I try first step let's
switch the dark to the outside the light

374
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:29,430
switch the dark to the outside the light
 

375
00:10:29,430 --> 00:11:07,569
switch the dark to the outside the light
to the inside uh-huh-huh-huh

376
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:07,579

 

377
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,519

alright so after much careful

378
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:10,529
alright so after much careful
 

379
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,730
alright so after much careful
deliberation with my highly trained team

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:13,740
deliberation with my highly trained team

of villager decorators we have decided

382
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:16,649
of villager decorators we have decided
 

383
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:20,710
of villager decorators we have decided
this is the look to go with yep very

384
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
this is the look to go with yep very
 

385
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,949
this is the look to go with yep very
wise choice I'm going to get the

386
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
wise choice I'm going to get the
 

387
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,019
wise choice I'm going to get the
redstone on some of this stuff working

388
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,029
redstone on some of this stuff working
 

389
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:29,630
redstone on some of this stuff working
so I can show you how the potion brewing

390
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:29,640
so I can show you how the potion brewing
 

391
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,230
so I can show you how the potion brewing
is going to work - and as far as the

392
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,240
is going to work - and as far as the
 

393
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,300
is going to work - and as far as the
color coding idea goes it's a nice idea

394
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:35,310
color coding idea goes it's a nice idea
 

395
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,600
color coding idea goes it's a nice idea
but I'm going to use item frames with

396
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:38,610
but I'm going to use item frames with
 

397
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,940
but I'm going to use item frames with
the proper potion type in them to

398
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:40,950
the proper potion type in them to
 

399
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,069
the proper potion type in them to
identify what potion gets made where and

400
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:43,079
identify what potion gets made where and
 

401
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,470
identify what potion gets made where and
we might also use signs so it'll be

402
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:45,480
we might also use signs so it'll be
 

403
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,990
we might also use signs so it'll be
clearly labeled and easy to figure out

404
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
clearly labeled and easy to figure out
 

405
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,620
clearly labeled and easy to figure out
what's what's what around here alright

406
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:54,630
what's what's what around here alright
 

407
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,439
what's what's what around here alright
everyone well things are going well I've

408
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:57,449
everyone well things are going well I've
 

409
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:00,740
everyone well things are going well I've
been working on the redstone and at this

410
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:00,750
been working on the redstone and at this
 

411
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,569
been working on the redstone and at this
point in the project I'm just winging it

412
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:02,579
point in the project I'm just winging it
 

413
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,060
point in the project I'm just winging it
I haven't figured it out to this point

414
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,070
I haven't figured it out to this point
 

415
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,310
I haven't figured it out to this point
so from here out things can go wrong and

416
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:09,320
so from here out things can go wrong and
 

417
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,389
so from here out things can go wrong and
they probably will but I'll run you

418
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
they probably will but I'll run you
 

419
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,100
they probably will but I'll run you
through what we got

420
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,110
through what we got
 

421
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,910
through what we got
so I've added this little device here

422
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
so I've added this little device here
 

423
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,950
so I've added this little device here
these lights tell me if we are out of

424
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:23,960
these lights tell me if we are out of
 

425
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,010
these lights tell me if we are out of
water bottles in the system and I've

426
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:28,020
water bottles in the system and I've
 

427
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,400
water bottles in the system and I've
also added a bunch of like buffer chests

428
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,410
also added a bunch of like buffer chests
 

429
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,260
also added a bunch of like buffer chests
at the top here to hold water bottles I

430
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,270
at the top here to hold water bottles I
 

431
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,190
at the top here to hold water bottles I
knew you were around here

432
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
knew you were around here
 

433
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:44,870
knew you were around here
I heard you wait is there another one I

434
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
I heard you wait is there another one I
 

435
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,920
I heard you wait is there another one I
heard the arrow fall no okay we have

436
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:51,930
heard the arrow fall no okay we have
 

437
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,930
heard the arrow fall no okay we have
three double chests to hold water

438
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:53,940
three double chests to hold water
 

439
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,090
three double chests to hold water
bottles so that's that's going to make

440
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,100
bottles so that's that's going to make
 

441
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,060
bottles so that's that's going to make
quite a few potions we could go as as

442
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,070
quite a few potions we could go as as
 

443
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,190
quite a few potions we could go as as
many as we want but I think that's good

444
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
many as we want but I think that's good
 

445
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,700
many as we want but I think that's good
and I have them sort of sneaking around

446
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:04,710
and I have them sort of sneaking around
 

447
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,970
and I have them sort of sneaking around
in such a way that they have very little

448
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:07,980
in such a way that they have very little
 

449
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,800
in such a way that they have very little
space wasted here and I'm even using

450
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:09,810
space wasted here and I'm even using
 

451
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,680
space wasted here and I'm even using
trap chests for some of them so that I

452
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:12,690
trap chests for some of them so that I
 

453
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,910
trap chests for some of them so that I
can jam it all in so if we run out of

454
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:16,920
can jam it all in so if we run out of
 

455
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,890
can jam it all in so if we run out of
water bottles these lights turn on

456
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:18,900
water bottles these lights turn on
 

457
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,660
water bottles these lights turn on
there's none in the system at the moment

458
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:20,670
there's none in the system at the moment
 

459
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:26,210
there's none in the system at the moment
and what it is maybe let's take these

460
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:26,220
and what it is maybe let's take these
 

461
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,250
and what it is maybe let's take these
out I want that quartz back though thank

462
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:31,260
out I want that quartz back though thank
 

463
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,510
out I want that quartz back though thank
you

464
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:32,520
you
 

465
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,110
you
what it is you see there's a comparator

466
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,120
what it is you see there's a comparator
 

467
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,380
what it is you see there's a comparator
next to the hopper and that goes

468
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:39,390
next to the hopper and that goes
 

469
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,820
next to the hopper and that goes
directly to the brewing stand so water

470
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:40,830
directly to the brewing stand so water
 

471
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,530
directly to the brewing stand so water
bottles go in here and then they wait to

472
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:42,540
bottles go in here and then they wait to
 

473
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,240
bottles go in here and then they wait to
get put into the brewing stand if we're

474
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,250
get put into the brewing stand if we're
 

475
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,740
get put into the brewing stand if we're
out of water bottles this hopper is

476
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:45,750
out of water bottles this hopper is
 

477
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,810
out of water bottles this hopper is
going to be empty this comparator is

478
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:47,820
going to be empty this comparator is
 

479
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,890
going to be empty this comparator is
going to be off oh and I have a I have

480
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:51,900
going to be off oh and I have a I have
 

481
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,160
going to be off oh and I have a I have
an override switch there what I say if

482
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,170
an override switch there what I say if
 

483
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,150
an override switch there what I say if
these lights turn off and then then

484
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,160
these lights turn off and then then
 

485
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,340
these lights turn off and then then
we're out of water bottles that's that's

486
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,350
we're out of water bottles that's that's
 

487
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,280
we're out of water bottles that's that's
what I meant to say so we can

488
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,290
what I meant to say so we can
 

489
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,320
what I meant to say so we can
demonstrate this pretend we put a water

490
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,330
demonstrate this pretend we put a water
 

491
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,930
demonstrate this pretend we put a water
bottle in the system that light turned

492
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:08,940
bottle in the system that light turned
 

493
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,340
bottle in the system that light turned
on and that makes these Pistons to go

494
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:13,350
on and that makes these Pistons to go
 

495
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,260
on and that makes these Pistons to go
down as well

496
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,270
down as well
 

497
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,490
down as well
from this comparator or powers the

498
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:16,500
from this comparator or powers the
 

499
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,970
from this comparator or powers the
Pistons and that pushes this block into

500
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:19,980
Pistons and that pushes this block into
 

501
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,150
Pistons and that pushes this block into
place so that's power from this line can

502
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,160
place so that's power from this line can
 

503
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,970
place so that's power from this line can
pass through and that goes to the

504
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:25,980
pass through and that goes to the
 

505
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,390
pass through and that goes to the
droppers then for the left side I don't

506
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:29,400
droppers then for the left side I don't
 

507
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,110
droppers then for the left side I don't
really need to

508
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,120
really need to
 

509
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,160
really need to
do this like this is a gate to let the

510
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,170
do this like this is a gate to let the
 

511
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,019
do this like this is a gate to let the
redstone signal go through or not I

512
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:36,029
redstone signal go through or not I
 

513
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,410
redstone signal go through or not I
don't really need to do this the reason

514
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:39,420
don't really need to do this the reason
 

515
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,470
don't really need to do this the reason
I'm doing it though is because if we're

516
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
I'm doing it though is because if we're
 

517
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,030
I'm doing it though is because if we're
out of water bottles we don't need to

518
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,040
out of water bottles we don't need to
 

519
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,090
out of water bottles we don't need to
brew any potions anymore we don't need

520
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:47,100
brew any potions anymore we don't need
 

521
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,430
brew any potions anymore we don't need
to tell the system to to change your

522
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,440
to tell the system to to change your
 

523
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,570
to tell the system to to change your
redstone so that it's brewing potions it

524
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:53,580
redstone so that it's brewing potions it
 

525
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,940
redstone so that it's brewing potions it
won't cause any problems if it does that

526
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:55,950
won't cause any problems if it does that
 

527
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,950
won't cause any problems if it does that
but it does cause unnecessary leg

528
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:57,960
but it does cause unnecessary leg
 

529
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,870
but it does cause unnecessary leg
because it's activating all these

530
00:14:59,870 --> 00:14:59,880
because it's activating all these
 

531
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,870
because it's activating all these
repeaters and and redstone torches every

532
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
repeaters and and redstone torches every
 

533
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,329
repeaters and and redstone torches every
cycle and if we're having like 10 of

534
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:05,339
cycle and if we're having like 10 of
 

535
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,490
cycle and if we're having like 10 of
these things or or I think it's even

536
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:07,500
these things or or I think it's even
 

537
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,130
these things or or I think it's even
more than 10 and you can imagine that's

538
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:10,140
more than 10 and you can imagine that's
 

539
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,190
more than 10 and you can imagine that's
a lot of unnecessary redstone updates

540
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,200
a lot of unnecessary redstone updates
 

541
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,620
a lot of unnecessary redstone updates
happening if we don't control things a

542
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:15,630
happening if we don't control things a
 

543
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,170
happening if we don't control things a
little bit and there's a manual override

544
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:18,180
little bit and there's a manual override
 

545
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,420
little bit and there's a manual override
here oh that didn't make that go down

546
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:22,430
here oh that didn't make that go down
 

547
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:29,780
here oh that didn't make that go down
that's not good okay um I'll have to

548
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:29,790
that's not good okay um I'll have to
 

549
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,760
that's not good okay um I'll have to
make a note of that so yeah if we one

550
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:34,770
make a note of that so yeah if we one
 

551
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,620
make a note of that so yeah if we one
way we're going to be able to refill the

552
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:36,630
way we're going to be able to refill the
 

553
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,540
way we're going to be able to refill the
water bottles for this is we could just

554
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:38,550
water bottles for this is we could just
 

555
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,370
water bottles for this is we could just
access this double chests and drop them

556
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:40,380
access this double chests and drop them
 

557
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:52,160
access this double chests and drop them
in here if we want that is not what it's

558
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,170
in here if we want that is not what it's
 

559
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,570
in here if we want that is not what it's
getting power from somewhere it's not

560
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:53,580
getting power from somewhere it's not
 

561
00:15:53,580 --> 00:16:03,309
getting power from somewhere it's not
supposed to do

562
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:03,319

 

563
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:08,030

mmm-hmm slight technical problem like I

564
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,040
mmm-hmm slight technical problem like I
 

565
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,350
mmm-hmm slight technical problem like I
said things are going to go wrong for

566
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
said things are going to go wrong for
 

567
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,419
said things are going to go wrong for
some reason this chest it's supposed to

568
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:17,429
some reason this chest it's supposed to
 

569
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:21,590
some reason this chest it's supposed to
be dropping my floors all torn up I

570
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
be dropping my floors all torn up I
 

571
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,059
be dropping my floors all torn up I
can't really access things properly

572
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:23,069
can't really access things properly
 

573
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,220
can't really access things properly
let's rip this out this chest is

574
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,230
let's rip this out this chest is
 

575
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,150
let's rip this out this chest is
supposed to be dropping cobble or water

576
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,160
supposed to be dropping cobble or water
 

577
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,979
supposed to be dropping cobble or water
bottles into this hopper but it's being

578
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:30,989
bottles into this hopper but it's being
 

579
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:41,229
bottles into this hopper but it's being
powered Oh from that torch there okay

580
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:41,239

 

581
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:47,299

how big of an issue is that one moment

582
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:47,309
how big of an issue is that one moment
 

583
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:47,840
how big of an issue is that one moment
please

584
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:47,850
please
 

585
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,759
please
I diagnose the problem here this isn't

586
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:52,769
I diagnose the problem here this isn't
 

587
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:54,979
I diagnose the problem here this isn't
going to be an issue because the clock

588
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:54,989
going to be an issue because the clock
 

589
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:56,600
going to be an issue because the clock
is supposed to be running so it's going

590
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:56,610
is supposed to be running so it's going
 

591
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,269
is supposed to be running so it's going
to be switching on and off every 20

592
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
to be switching on and off every 20
 

593
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,609
to be switching on and off every 20
seconds where it will allow the water

594
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:01,619
seconds where it will allow the water
 

595
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:05,899
seconds where it will allow the water
bottles to pass through one problem I do

596
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:05,909
bottles to pass through one problem I do
 

597
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:08,510
bottles to pass through one problem I do
have here though is my data's reversed

598
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:08,520
have here though is my data's reversed
 

599
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,750
have here though is my data's reversed
here for some reason I messed that up

600
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
here for some reason I messed that up
 

601
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,569
here for some reason I messed that up
this is supposed to stop brewing potions

602
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:14,579
this is supposed to stop brewing potions
 

603
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,199
this is supposed to stop brewing potions
when I power it and it's it's allowing

604
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:18,209
when I power it and it's it's allowing
 

605
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,579
when I power it and it's it's allowing
potions be brewed when I power it so

606
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:21,589
potions be brewed when I power it so
 

607
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,949
potions be brewed when I power it so
I'll have to fix that but with the way

608
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
I'll have to fix that but with the way
 

609
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,179
I'll have to fix that but with the way
it is right now I can actually

610
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:26,189
it is right now I can actually
 

611
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:28,700
it is right now I can actually
demonstrate how it's going to work I

612
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:28,710
demonstrate how it's going to work I
 

613
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:33,110
demonstrate how it's going to work I
think let's see let's let's get it ready

614
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
think let's see let's let's get it ready
 

615
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,500
think let's see let's let's get it ready
let's fire it up take this one out okay

616
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:38,510

 

617
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:43,909

so the way I want to do this oh and

618
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
so the way I want to do this oh and
 

619
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,120
so the way I want to do this oh and
first of all I'm going to be rambling a

620
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,130
first of all I'm going to be rambling a
 

621
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,909
first of all I'm going to be rambling a
bit here just to warn you first of all I

622
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
bit here just to warn you first of all I
 

623
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,230
bit here just to warn you first of all I
just want to show you this this is

624
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:51,240
just want to show you this this is
 

625
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,639
just want to show you this this is
something I didn't know until just the

626
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:52,649
something I didn't know until just the
 

627
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:57,279
something I didn't know until just the
other day actually as you know you can

628
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:57,289
other day actually as you know you can
 

629
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:00,019
other day actually as you know you can
get hot you can get items into a chest

630
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:00,029
get hot you can get items into a chest
 

631
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:04,039
get hot you can get items into a chest
using a hopper no little problem but if

632
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:04,049
using a hopper no little problem but if
 

633
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,409
using a hopper no little problem but if
you have the chest blocks like where you

634
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:06,419
you have the chest blocks like where you
 

635
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,380
you have the chest blocks like where you
can't open it then the hopper also won't

636
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:11,390

00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:25,180
stuff going
 

719
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,020
stuff going
on here all right this for right now I'm

720

on here all right this for right now I'm
 

721
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,950
on here all right this for right now I'm
going to switch this normally the clock

722
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:31,960
going to switch this normally the clock
 

723
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,430
going to switch this normally the clock
would allow that to switch on its own

724
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:34,440
would allow that to switch on its own
 

725
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,780
would allow that to switch on its own
alright so that opened up the gate so

726
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:36,790
alright so that opened up the gate so
 

727
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,330
alright so that opened up the gate so
that these water bottles and flow

728
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:39,340
that these water bottles and flow
 

729
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,010
that these water bottles and flow
through into the brewing stands and

730
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,020
through into the brewing stands and
 

731
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,640
through into the brewing stands and
they're being held there at the moment

732
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:43,650
they're being held there at the moment
 

733
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:50,130
they're being held there at the moment
all is good let's get a few more potions

734
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:50,140
all is good let's get a few more potions
 

735
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,470

which one I want them in we're only
 

749
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,850
which one I want them in we're only
going to turn one of these on not both

750
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:17,860
going to turn one of these on not both
 

751
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,260
going to turn one of these on not both
of them alright that's how you fill it

752
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,270
of them alright that's how you fill it
 

753
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,520
of them alright that's how you fill it
nice and simple nice and quick

754
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:25,530
nice and simple nice and quick
 

755
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,580
nice and simple nice and quick
won't have to be filled all that often

756
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:28,590
won't have to be filled all that often
 

757
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,960
won't have to be filled all that often
yeah I did drop cobble okay so down here

758
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:33,970
yeah I did drop cobble okay so down here
 

759
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,220
yeah I did drop cobble okay so down here
I have a clock that we're going to run

760
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,230
I have a clock that we're going to run
 

761
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,690
I have a clock that we're going to run
maybe we can disable this for just

762
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:39,700
maybe we can disable this for just
 

763
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,680
maybe we can disable this for just
straight now show you how it runs this

764
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:43,690
straight now show you how it runs this
 

765
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,680
straight now show you how it runs this
is a hopper timer it does two things it

766
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:46,690
is a hopper timer it does two things it
 

767
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,370
is a hopper timer it does two things it
sends one signal here that will go to

768
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:50,380
sends one signal here that will go to
 

769
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,140
sends one signal here that will go to
the middle line and that that reverses

770
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,150
the middle line and that that reverses
 

771
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,590
the middle line and that that reverses
the brewing stand so it'll either allow

772
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:58,600
the brewing stand so it'll either allow
 

773
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,930
the brewing stand so it'll either allow
potion bottles to go into the brew stand

774
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:00,940
potion bottles to go into the brew stand
 

775
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,650
potion bottles to go into the brew stand
or it'll take them out from the bottom

776
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:03,660
or it'll take them out from the bottom
 

777
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,320
or it'll take them out from the bottom
and then we have this other line here it

778
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,330
and then we have this other line here it
 

779
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,710
and then we have this other line here it
goes to a pulse extender and a

780
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720
goes to a pulse extender and a
 

781
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,340
goes to a pulse extender and a
monostable circuit here that makes this

782
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,350
monostable circuit here that makes this
 

783
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,220
monostable circuit here that makes this
redstone signal go for exactly eight

784
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:17,230
redstone signal go for exactly eight
 

785
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,240
redstone signal go for exactly eight
ticks is the idea and that goes to this

786
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,250
ticks is the idea and that goes to this
 

787
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,630
ticks is the idea and that goes to this
pulsar which sends out four pulses to

788
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:24,640
pulsar which sends out four pulses to
 

789
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,450
pulsar which sends out four pulses to
the droppers every time this updates

790
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:30,460
the droppers every time this updates
 

791
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,590
the droppers every time this updates
all right lots of stuff going on I'm

792
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:34,600
all right lots of stuff going on I'm
 

793
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,840
all right lots of stuff going on I'm
going to take these out this running so

794
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:39,850
going to take these out this running so
 

795
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,000
going to take these out this running so
the magic number of blocks we want in

796
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,010
the magic number of blocks we want in
 

797
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:50,460
the magic number of blocks we want in
our hopper timer is what is it it's 56

798
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:50,470
our hopper timer is what is it it's 56
 

799
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,710
our hopper timer is what is it it's 56
this will make it run for 20 seconds

800
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
this will make it run for 20 seconds
 

801
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,260
this will make it run for 20 seconds
each interval which is really important

802
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,270

 

803
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:02,420

so get those in I'm going to get my

804
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:02,430
so get those in I'm going to get my
 

805
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,830
so get those in I'm going to get my
brewing ingredients in so first of all

806
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:04,840
brewing ingredients in so first of all
 

807
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,330
brewing ingredients in so first of all
awkward potions then we'll go

808
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:08,340
awkward potions then we'll go
 

809
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,650
awkward potions then we'll go
let's make strength potions we'll put

810
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:10,660
let's make strength potions we'll put
 

811
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,930
let's make strength potions we'll put
that to make it strength and then we'll

812
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:12,940
that to make it strength and then we'll
 

813
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,480
that to make it strength and then we'll
extend them wait

814
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:17,490
extend them wait
 

815
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:25,560
extend them wait
I'm missing another step here awkward

816
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:25,570
I'm missing another step here awkward
 

817
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,480
I'm missing another step here awkward
potion strength extended strength I

818
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:30,490
potion strength extended strength I
 

819
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,190
potion strength extended strength I
guess we could do splash potions for the

820
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:32,200
guess we could do splash potions for the
 

821
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,280
guess we could do splash potions for the
last one anyway so we'll do those three

822
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,290
last one anyway so we'll do those three
 

823
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,400
last one anyway so we'll do those three
and we'll get this up and running should

824
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,410
and we'll get this up and running should
 

825
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,020
and we'll get this up and running should
work the way it is even though I have to

826
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,030
work the way it is even though I have to
 

827
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:49,010
work the way it is even though I have to
fix a few things so let's get this moved

828
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:49,020

 

829
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,520

okay this is really really

830
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:53,530
okay this is really really
 

831
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,010
okay this is really really
nerve-wracking it might break everything

832
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,020
nerve-wracking it might break everything
 

833
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,180
nerve-wracking it might break everything
here we'll find out

834
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,190
here we'll find out
 

835
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:03,350
here we'll find out
so everything's reconnected oh those

836
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
so everything's reconnected oh those
 

837
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,320
so everything's reconnected oh those
potions we had in there are in the

838
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:07,330
potions we had in there are in the
 

839
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,180
potions we had in there are in the
droppers right now so there they're

840
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,190
droppers right now so there they're
 

841
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,040
droppers right now so there they're
being there waiting to go into this

842
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,050
being there waiting to go into this
 

843
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,100
being there waiting to go into this
brewing stand and since I left them in

844
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,110
brewing stand and since I left them in
 

845
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,170
brewing stand and since I left them in
for 20 seconds they should be awkward

846
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:16,180
for 20 seconds they should be awkward
 

847
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:21,170
for 20 seconds they should be awkward
potions so when we fire this up

848
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:21,180
potions so when we fire this up
 

849
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:28,379
potions so when we fire this up
everything should work I think

850
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:28,389

 

851
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:34,659

water bottles waiting to go in do two to

852
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:34,669
water bottles waiting to go in do two to
 

853
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:39,100
water bottles waiting to go in do two to
just give it a little bit of time 20

854
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,110
just give it a little bit of time 20
 

855
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,610
just give it a little bit of time 20
seconds per step takes 40 seconds to

856
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:42,620
seconds per step takes 40 seconds to
 

857
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,470
seconds per step takes 40 seconds to
brew 3 potions with this setup

858
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
brew 3 potions with this setup
 

859
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,600
brew 3 potions with this setup
ok so let's switch Oh where's my other

860
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:49,610
ok so let's switch Oh where's my other
 

861
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:58,299
ok so let's switch Oh where's my other
potions and on the hopper ok they are in

862
00:24:58,299 --> 00:24:58,309
potions and on the hopper ok they are in
 

863
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:06,060
potions and on the hopper ok they are in
there somehow water bottle got through a

864
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,070

 

865
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,009

moment those finish brewing they get

866
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:09,019
moment those finish brewing they get
 

867
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:12,180
moment those finish brewing they get
pulled out they get put in the hopper

868
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,190
pulled out they get put in the hopper
 

869
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,340
pulled out they get put in the hopper
something is I bet you it's my stupid

870
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:15,350
something is I bet you it's my stupid
 

871
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:20,619
something is I bet you it's my stupid
gate here that's broken oh I didn't

872
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:20,629
gate here that's broken oh I didn't
 

873
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:21,820
gate here that's broken oh I didn't
connect this woops

874
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:21,830
connect this woops
 

875
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:28,359
connect this woops
oh no it was it was something's weird

876
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:28,369
oh no it was it was something's weird
 

877
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:28,960
oh no it was it was something's weird
here

878
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:28,970
here
 

879
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,580
here
that's pulsing oh it's because these are

880
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:33,590
that's pulsing oh it's because these are
 

881
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,720
that's pulsing oh it's because these are
torches and they can't handle that speed

882
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:36,730
torches and they can't handle that speed
 

883
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:44,730
torches and they can't handle that speed
that's or could they

884
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:44,740

 

885
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,470

man I thought I had it I thought it was

886
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:49,480
man I thought I had it I thought it was
 

887
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,390
man I thought I had it I thought it was
all good I don't think these torches are

888
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:51,400
all good I don't think these torches are
 

889
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:57,390
all good I don't think these torches are
flickering gotta wait ten more seconds

890
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:57,400
flickering gotta wait ten more seconds
 

891
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:02,580
flickering gotta wait ten more seconds
here let's see if they's nice which ones

892
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:02,590
here let's see if they's nice which ones
 

893
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:08,310
here let's see if they's nice which ones
that pulses next time doo doo doo doo

894
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320
that pulses next time doo doo doo doo
 

895
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,140
that pulses next time doo doo doo doo
doo how's it goin

896
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,150

 

897
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:17,240

come on out did

898
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,250

 

899
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,720

and these aren't getting powered that's

900
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:21,730
and these aren't getting powered that's
 

901
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,280
and these aren't getting powered that's
for sure though why are they not named

902
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,290
for sure though why are they not named
 

903
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,900
for sure though why are they not named
powered shouldn't really have to switch

904
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:30,910
powered shouldn't really have to switch
 

905
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:36,510
powered shouldn't really have to switch
that but maybe it's about the pulse

906
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:36,520
that but maybe it's about the pulse
 

907
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,790
that but maybe it's about the pulse
again something here is not switching

908
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:38,800
again something here is not switching
 

909
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,070
again something here is not switching
this is either staying on or that torch

910
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,080
this is either staying on or that torch
 

911
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,760
this is either staying on or that torch
isn't changing that's what it is okay

912
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:44,770
isn't changing that's what it is okay
 

913
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,770
isn't changing that's what it is okay
this is this is pulsing here but this

914
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:46,780
this is this is pulsing here but this
 

915
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,610
this is this is pulsing here but this
torch is not changing and that's causing

916
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:50,620
torch is not changing and that's causing
 

917
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,910
torch is not changing and that's causing
the problem okay

918
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:55,920
the problem okay
 

919
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,130
the problem okay
usually I don't like my video so sloppy

920
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,140
usually I don't like my video so sloppy
 

921
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,320
usually I don't like my video so sloppy
but I know some of you like to watch me

922
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,330
but I know some of you like to watch me
 

923
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,360
but I know some of you like to watch me
do some problem solving and that when it

924
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:03,370
do some problem solving and that when it
 

925
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:07,610
do some problem solving and that when it
comes to redstone so you saw it today

926
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:07,620
comes to redstone so you saw it today
 

927
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,990
comes to redstone so you saw it today
yeah there's this weird quirk with

928
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,000
yeah there's this weird quirk with
 

929
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,860
yeah there's this weird quirk with
redstone where sometimes if you have a

930
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:13,870
redstone where sometimes if you have a
 

931
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,360
redstone where sometimes if you have a
very quick signal like a one tick signal

932
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:17,370
very quick signal like a one tick signal
 

933
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:21,030
very quick signal like a one tick signal
the redstone torch won't change because

934
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,040
the redstone torch won't change because
 

935
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,580
the redstone torch won't change because
it can't handle at that speed even

936
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:23,590
it can't handle at that speed even
 

937
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,860
it can't handle at that speed even
though the one earlier this one here was

938
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:25,870
though the one earlier this one here was
 

939
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,500
though the one earlier this one here was
changing and there's no difference in

940
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:28,510
changing and there's no difference in
 

941
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:33,450
changing and there's no difference in
delay speed this one wasn't so because

942
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:33,460
delay speed this one wasn't so because
 

943
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,520
delay speed this one wasn't so because
that one's seconds down the line this

944
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:35,530
that one's seconds down the line this
 

945
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,710
that one's seconds down the line this
one's first it can it can do the first

946
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:37,720
one's first it can it can do the first
 

947
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,230
one's first it can it can do the first
one but not the second one or any any

948
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
one but not the second one or any any
 

949
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,120
one but not the second one or any any
further down so yeah

950
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,130
further down so yeah
 

951
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:49,529
further down so yeah
redstone is fun uh my solution to that

952
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:49,539
redstone is fun uh my solution to that
 

953
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:52,470
redstone is fun uh my solution to that
problem is creates twice as long

954
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:52,480
problem is creates twice as long
 

955
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,490
problem is creates twice as long
pulse extension here we still have this

956
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:56,500
pulse extension here we still have this
 

957
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,289
pulse extension here we still have this
pulse ER but I'm using a repeater now to

958
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:01,299
pulse ER but I'm using a repeater now to
 

959
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:04,580
pulse ER but I'm using a repeater now to
take eight pulses from this because we

960
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:04,590
take eight pulses from this because we
 

961
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,260
take eight pulses from this because we
double the length so it's creating twice

962
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:07,270
double the length so it's creating twice
 

963
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,029
double the length so it's creating twice
as many pulses instead of four it's

964
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:09,039
as many pulses instead of four it's
 

965
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,730
as many pulses instead of four it's
doing eight and then this converts it

966
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:11,740
doing eight and then this converts it
 

967
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,029
doing eight and then this converts it
back down to four but they're two ticks

968
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:15,039
back down to four but they're two ticks
 

969
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:22,200
back down to four but they're two ticks
long instead of one tick yeah so now it

970
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,210
long instead of one tick yeah so now it
 

971
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,680
long instead of one tick yeah so now it
should all work

972
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:24,690

 

973
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:30,990

let's hope it's all complicated now but

974
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:31,000
let's hope it's all complicated now but
 

975
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,340
let's hope it's all complicated now but
once it's up and running it's going to

976
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,350
once it's up and running it's going to
 

977
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,360
once it's up and running it's going to
be so sweet

978
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,370
be so sweet
 

979
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,669
be so sweet
look at this we got awkward potions

980
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:35,679
look at this we got awkward potions
 

981
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,460
look at this we got awkward potions
going in they're going to convert to

982
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:38,470
going in they're going to convert to
 

983
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,200
going in they're going to convert to
strength water bottles are getting

984
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,210
strength water bottles are getting
 

985
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,970
strength water bottles are getting
convert to nether or to awkward

986
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:43,980
convert to nether or to awkward
 

987
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,740
convert to nether or to awkward
this goes for just long enough where

988
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:46,750
this goes for just long enough where
 

989
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,320
this goes for just long enough where
they can get converted and then they get

990
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:49,330
they can get converted and then they get
 

991
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:55,140
they can get converted and then they get
pulled out the bottom 20 seconds oh but

992
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,150
pulled out the bottom 20 seconds oh but
 

993
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,539
pulled out the bottom 20 seconds oh but
it's letting one extra through what's

994
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:57,549
it's letting one extra through what's
 

995
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:03,289
it's letting one extra through what's
that about man

996
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:03,299
that about man
 

997
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:08,070
that about man
another problem start it something's

998
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
another problem start it something's
 

999
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,159
another problem start it something's
wrong with my timing or something you

1000
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:11,169
wrong with my timing or something you
 

1001
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:12,870
wrong with my timing or something you
know what it is I had my redstone all

1002
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:12,880
know what it is I had my redstone all
 

1003
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,149
know what it is I had my redstone all
figured out before I started building

1004
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:15,159
figured out before I started building
 

1005
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:17,070
figured out before I started building
then I was like you know what I can make

1006
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,080
then I was like you know what I can make
 

1007
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,320
then I was like you know what I can make
it even thinner you make one block thin

1008
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,330
it even thinner you make one block thin
 

1009
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,409
it even thinner you make one block thin
only and I changed it to use all these

1010
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:22,419
only and I changed it to use all these
 

1011
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:24,360
only and I changed it to use all these
redstone torches and now things are all

1012
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:24,370
redstone torches and now things are all
 

1013
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:32,780
redstone torches and now things are all
messed up

1014
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:32,790

 

1015
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,510

see it's going to give it an extra one

1016
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:36,520
see it's going to give it an extra one
 

1017
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:46,410
see it's going to give it an extra one
isn't it Oh me or not that was fine at

1018
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:46,420
isn't it Oh me or not that was fine at
 

1019
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,270
isn't it Oh me or not that was fine at
sending out an extra awkward potion

1020
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:48,280
sending out an extra awkward potion
 

1021
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,940
sending out an extra awkward potion
every time and water bottles are getting

1022
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:50,950
every time and water bottles are getting
 

1023
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:57,450
every time and water bottles are getting
sent to that one I'll have to keep

1024
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:57,460
sent to that one I'll have to keep
 

1025
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,240
sent to that one I'll have to keep
working at this

1026
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,250
working at this
 

1027
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,540
working at this
the idea is though it's going to fill up

1028
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:03,550
the idea is though it's going to fill up
 

1029
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:07,340
the idea is though it's going to fill up
the chest at the end of the line

1030
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:07,350

 

1031
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,720

nothing's going to happen with this this

1032
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:09,730
nothing's going to happen with this this
 

1033
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:12,150
nothing's going to happen with this this
chest is going to get filled up and that

1034
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:12,160
chest is going to get filled up and that
 

1035
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,680
chest is going to get filled up and that
gets filled up this one's then get

1036
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:13,690
gets filled up this one's then get
 

1037
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,930
gets filled up this one's then get
filled up and that's filled up this will

1038
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:15,940
filled up and that's filled up this will
 

1039
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,030
filled up and that's filled up this will
get filled up and eventually it's going

1040
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,040
get filled up and eventually it's going
 

1041
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,500
get filled up and eventually it's going
to get to the point where no brewing can

1042
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:19,510
to get to the point where no brewing can
 

1043
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,230
to get to the point where no brewing can
happen and we will have each of these

1044
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,240
happen and we will have each of these
 

1045
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,380
happen and we will have each of these
chests full with a different potion that

1046
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:25,390
chests full with a different potion that
 

1047
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,180
chests full with a different potion that
we can take at any time and when we take

1048
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:27,190
we can take at any time and when we take
 

1049
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,000
we can take at any time and when we take
it out then it creates space so that

1050
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,010
it out then it creates space so that
 

1051
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,430
it out then it creates space so that
when we turn this back on it will refill

1052
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:32,440
when we turn this back on it will refill
 

1053
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,830
when we turn this back on it will refill
any empty spaces we create in the

1054
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:34,840
any empty spaces we create in the
 

1055
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:45,810
any empty spaces we create in the
storage engine Tori yeah man I'll fix it

1056
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:45,820
storage engine Tori yeah man I'll fix it
 

1057
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:52,020
storage engine Tori yeah man I'll fix it
don't you worry yeah so part way through

1058
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,030
don't you worry yeah so part way through
 

1059
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,820
don't you worry yeah so part way through
when I was building this I decided I

1060
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:53,830
when I was building this I decided I
 

1061
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,530
when I was building this I decided I
would change my design that I could make

1062
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:55,540
would change my design that I could make
 

1063
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:00,440
would change my design that I could make
it smaller this is my original layout

1064
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:00,450
it smaller this is my original layout
 

1065
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,120
it smaller this is my original layout
for some reason I decided I didn't need

1066
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,130
for some reason I decided I didn't need
 

1067
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,680
for some reason I decided I didn't need
these repeaters anymore that they

1068
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:04,690
these repeaters anymore that they
 

1069
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,380
these repeaters anymore that they
weren't really necessary so I changed it

1070
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:07,390
weren't really necessary so I changed it
 

1071
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,200
weren't really necessary so I changed it
to something like this which takes less

1072
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,210
to something like this which takes less
 

1073
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,890
to something like this which takes less
space but you can see we got five push

1074
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:13,900
space but you can see we got five push
 

1075
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,380
space but you can see we got five push
or five water bottles in there ready to

1076
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:16,390
or five water bottles in there ready to
 

1077
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,130
or five water bottles in there ready to
go into the brewing stand we flip it

1078
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:19,140
go into the brewing stand we flip it
 

1079
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,940
go into the brewing stand we flip it
changes the redstone alright they get

1080
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:23,950
changes the redstone alright they get
 

1081
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,520
changes the redstone alright they get
put in they waits then we when we flip

1082
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:26,530
put in they waits then we when we flip
 

1083
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,410
put in they waits then we when we flip
it again

1084
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:28,420
it again
 

1085
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,590
it again
we see a total of four potions got

1086
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:31,600
we see a total of four potions got
 

1087
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,670
we see a total of four potions got
through instead of just three because a

1088
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:35,680
through instead of just three because a
 

1089
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,920
through instead of just three because a
redstone torch has a one tick delay to

1090
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:37,930
redstone torch has a one tick delay to
 

1091
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:43,140
redstone torch has a one tick delay to
it so it takes one tick for four to

1092
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,150
it so it takes one tick for four to
 

1093
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:48,030
it so it takes one tick for four to
reach the power up to here to compensate

1094
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:48,040
reach the power up to here to compensate
 

1095
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,860
reach the power up to here to compensate
for that delay I was using repeaters

1096
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:49,870
for that delay I was using repeaters
 

1097
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,800
for that delay I was using repeaters
before where it bounced out where this

1098
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:52,810
before where it bounced out where this
 

1099
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,810
before where it bounced out where this
one would be two ticks and then this one

1100
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:54,820
one would be two ticks and then this one
 

1101
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,450
one would be two ticks and then this one
would be one plus one two ticks as well

1102
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:57,460
would be one plus one two ticks as well
 

1103
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,750
would be one plus one two ticks as well
so it would be equal and you can see

1104
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:00,760
so it would be equal and you can see
 

1105
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,050
so it would be equal and you can see
five potions

1106
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:03,060
five potions
 

1107
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,970
five potions
does the same thing fills that up but

1108
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:05,980
does the same thing fills that up but
 

1109
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,580
does the same thing fills that up but
this time only that's 3 potions through

1110
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:10,590
this time only that's 3 potions through
 

1111
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,370
this time only that's 3 potions through
and with my setup now I don't think

1112
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:14,380
and with my setup now I don't think
 

1113
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,910
and with my setup now I don't think
