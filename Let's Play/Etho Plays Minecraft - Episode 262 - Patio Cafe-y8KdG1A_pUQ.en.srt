and from this we'll be able to look down
 

87
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,650
and from this we'll be able to look down
into the library itself and see

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:14,660
into the library itself and see
 

89
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,809

119
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,350
month on this build I did have some
glowstone in that hidden in here but

120
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:08,360
glowstone in that hidden in here but
 

121
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,900
glowstone in that hidden in here but
there's only so many places you can hide

122
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:10,910
there's only so many places you can hide
 

123
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,180
there's only so many places you can hide
that stuff before you run into trouble

124
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,190
that stuff before you run into trouble
 

125
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,610
that stuff before you run into trouble
especially on big builds where you have

126
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:15,620
especially on big builds where you have
 

127
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,280
especially on big builds where you have
a lot of area and not too many places to

128
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,290
a lot of area and not too many places to
 

129
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,229
a lot of area and not too many places to
hide it maybe what we'll do I'm going to

130
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:23,239
hide it maybe what we'll do I'm going to
 

131
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,229
hide it maybe what we'll do I'm going to
try put some stone slabs on top of the

132
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
try put some stone slabs on top of the
 

133
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,819
try put some stone slabs on top of the
corner there and see what that looks

134
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:27,829
corner there and see what that looks
 

135
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:34,300
corner there and see what that looks
like see if it'll highlight things like

136
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,310
like see if it'll highlight things like
 

137
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,250
like see if it'll highlight things like
this I still want to have that library

138
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:36,260
this I still want to have that library
 

139
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,520
this I still want to have that library
sign out on the front I measured it out

140
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:39,530
sign out on the front I measured it out
 

141
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,620
sign out on the front I measured it out
and it actually goes from actually I can

142
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:44,630
and it actually goes from actually I can
 

143
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,610
and it actually goes from actually I can
show you if I do the 3x3 letters it goes

144
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:48,620
show you if I do the 3x3 letters it goes
 

145
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,660
show you if I do the 3x3 letters it goes
from there to there it is what I counted

146
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:54,670
from there to there it is what I counted
 

147
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,690
from there to there it is what I counted
that looks kind of cool okay we'll do

148
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:58,700
that looks kind of cool okay we'll do
 

149
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:58,930
that looks kind of cool okay we'll do
that

150
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:58,940
that
 

151
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,559
that
then maybe we will try to put some well

152
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:02,569
then maybe we will try to put some well
 

153
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:04,150
then maybe we will try to put some well
I guess we could go full blocks then

154
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,160
I guess we could go full blocks then
 

155
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:11,949
I guess we could go full blocks then
write some full blocks here should we

156
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:11,959
write some full blocks here should we
 

157
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,300
write some full blocks here should we
make it go up higher oh man

158
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,310
make it go up higher oh man
 

159
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,400
make it go up higher oh man
see I can layout part of a building but

160
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:18,410
see I can layout part of a building but
 

161
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,009
see I can layout part of a building but
the actual tying it all together is

162
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:21,019
the actual tying it all together is
 

163
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,100
the actual tying it all together is
where stuff gets tough for me it's like

164
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,110
where stuff gets tough for me it's like
 

165
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,290
where stuff gets tough for me it's like
how do we put a roof on this now and how

166
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:26,300
how do we put a roof on this now and how
 

167
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,340
how do we put a roof on this now and how
do we connect it

168
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,350
do we connect it
 

169
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,950
do we connect it
to another part of the build and that

170
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:29,960
to another part of the build and that
 

171
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:43,570
to another part of the build and that
kind of thing yeah mmm yeah I don't know

172
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:43,580
kind of thing yeah mmm yeah I don't know

174
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,080
if I want a tower there I think I might
 

175
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,890
if I want a tower there I think I might
just put another patio up above there

176
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:49,900
just put another patio up above there
 

177
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,190
just put another patio up above there
hmm see what this looks like filled into

178
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,200
hmm see what this looks like filled into
 

179
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:00,970
hmm see what this looks like filled into
this it's been bugging me all right

180
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:00,980
this it's been bugging me all right
 

181
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,820
this it's been bugging me all right
yeah that's that's okay we can probably

182
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:02,830
yeah that's that's okay we can probably
 

183
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,580
yeah that's that's okay we can probably
do something else with that the library

184
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:06,590
do something else with that the library
 

185
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,140
do something else with that the library
sign is going to go like up there I did

186
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,150
sign is going to go like up there I did
 

187
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,620
sign is going to go like up there I did
experiment with making some pillars to

188
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:14,630
experiment with making some pillars to
 

189
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,750
experiment with making some pillars to
sort of rest it on I put them I put two

190
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:16,760
sort of rest it on I put them I put two
 

191
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,420
sort of rest it on I put them I put two
pillars here two by two pillars didn't

192
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,430
pillars here two by two pillars didn't
 

193
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,820
pillars here two by two pillars didn't
really look as good as I hoped so I

194
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:21,830
really look as good as I hoped so I
 

195
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:27,930
really look as good as I hoped so I
don't know what I'll do about that

196
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:27,940

 

197
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,130

actually what we could do if we make

198
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:30,140
actually what we could do if we make
 

199
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,530
actually what we could do if we make
this go up a little bit we'll have a

200
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:32,540
this go up a little bit we'll have a
 

201
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,030
this go up a little bit we'll have a
patio and then we can create a wall if

202
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,040
patio and then we can create a wall if
 

203
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,860
patio and then we can create a wall if
you follow my mouse kind of over here

204
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:38,870
you follow my mouse kind of over here
 

205
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,220
you follow my mouse kind of over here
that connects to this and against that

206
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,230
that connects to this and against that
 

207
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,530
that connects to this and against that
wall we can put our villager and is his

208
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:44,540
wall we can put our villager and is his
 

209
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,170
wall we can put our villager and is his
little shop for up here and that'll be

210
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:47,180
little shop for up here and that'll be
 

211
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,380
little shop for up here and that'll be
good I think

212
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:49,390
good I think
 

213
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,180
good I think
yeah we'll build like a little raised

214
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,190
yeah we'll build like a little raised
 

215
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,280
yeah we'll build like a little raised
section because we got to go over top

216
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,290
section because we got to go over top
 

217
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:00,730
section because we got to go over top
that for sure it's got to be raised and

218
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:00,740
that for sure it's got to be raised and
 

219
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:09,939
that for sure it's got to be raised and
then we can do stairs kind of like that

220
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:09,949

 

221
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:12,559

hmm or we might just do it like that

222
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:12,569
hmm or we might just do it like that
 

223
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,219
hmm or we might just do it like that
that works yeah so I did some more

224
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:16,229
that works yeah so I did some more
 

225
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:18,769
that works yeah so I did some more
shaping up here tried to move things

226
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:18,779
shaping up here tried to move things
 

227
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,170
shaping up here tried to move things
along with this roof you know what I'm

228
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:21,180
along with this roof you know what I'm
 

229
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,790
along with this roof you know what I'm
going to do I don't really know how to

230
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
going to do I don't really know how to
 

231
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,640
going to do I don't really know how to
make peaked roofs you know like roofs

232
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,650
make peaked roofs you know like roofs
 

233
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,920
make peaked roofs you know like roofs
that are slanted and all that especially

234
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:27,930
that are slanted and all that especially
 

235
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,010
that are slanted and all that especially
on a building this size I have not a

236
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,020
on a building this size I have not a
 

237
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,379
on a building this size I have not a
clue so instead we're going to keep it

238
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:33,389
clue so instead we're going to keep it
 

239
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,999
clue so instead we're going to keep it
mostly flat like this and we still need

240
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:38,009
mostly flat like this and we still need
 

241
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,399
mostly flat like this and we still need
a reed farm for this library to get

242
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:40,409
a reed farm for this library to get
 

243
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:42,679
a reed farm for this library to get
paper we're going to put that on the

244
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:42,689
paper we're going to put that on the
 

245
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:46,159
paper we're going to put that on the
roof we need a wheat farm for cows to

246
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,169
roof we need a wheat farm for cows to
 

247
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,029
roof we need a wheat farm for cows to
get leather for the books that kind of

248
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:50,039
get leather for the books that kind of
 

249
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,920
get leather for the books that kind of
thing so we'll put the that stuff on the

250
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:51,930
thing so we'll put the that stuff on the
 

251
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,769
thing so we'll put the that stuff on the
roof and I was also considering having

252
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:54,779
roof and I was also considering having
 

253
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,019
roof and I was also considering having
an each road that comes up to here and

254
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:57,029
an each road that comes up to here and
 

255
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:58,909
an each road that comes up to here and
maybe we'll make that dock on the roof

256
00:06:58,909 --> 00:06:58,919
maybe we'll make that dock on the roof
 

257
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,300
maybe we'll make that dock on the roof
somewhere and if I do that kind of thing

258
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:02,310
somewhere and if I do that kind of thing
 

259
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,980
somewhere and if I do that kind of thing
I think I didn't fill most of space that

260
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:03,990
I think I didn't fill most of space that
 

261
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,219
I think I didn't fill most of space that
I need to on the roof without actually

262
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:07,229
I need to on the roof without actually
 

263
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:10,639
I need to on the roof without actually
having to make a roof yeah so I think

264
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:10,649
having to make a roof yeah so I think
 

265
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:13,610
having to make a roof yeah so I think
that's what we'll do I tried these rails

266
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:13,620
that's what we'll do I tried these rails
 

267
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,920
that's what we'll do I tried these rails
they don't work I don't like them

268
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:15,930
they don't work I don't like them
 

269
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,579
they don't work I don't like them
um I instead of doing that so I think

270
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:19,589
um I instead of doing that so I think
 

271
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:23,300
um I instead of doing that so I think
we'll do the cobble ones like we were or

272
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,310
we'll do the cobble ones like we were or
 

273
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,600
we'll do the cobble ones like we were or
at least try that I went back and I got

274
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:26,610
at least try that I went back and I got
 

275
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,699
at least try that I went back and I got
a whole bunch of this decorative kind of

276
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:28,709
a whole bunch of this decorative kind of
 

277
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:29,149
a whole bunch of this decorative kind of
stuffs

278
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:29,159
stuffs
 

279
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:33,290
stuffs
maybe we can dress this place up a

280
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:33,300
maybe we can dress this place up a
 

281
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,070
maybe we can dress this place up a
little bit

282
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
little bit
 

283
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,249
little bit
these by the stairs here for sure I want

284
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:37,259
these by the stairs here for sure I want
 

285
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,529
these by the stairs here for sure I want
to put something and I thought it would

286
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:39,539
to put something and I thought it would
 

287
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,249
to put something and I thought it would
look good to have a little bush you know

288
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:43,259
look good to have a little bush you know
 

289
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:48,409
look good to have a little bush you know
just the log into the leaf box both

290
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:48,419
just the log into the leaf box both
 

291
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:53,029
just the log into the leaf box both
sides oh and I'm not gonna be able to

292
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
sides oh and I'm not gonna be able to
 

293
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,719

place that unless I do that's okay now

294
00:07:59,719 --> 00:07:59,729
place that unless I do that's okay now
 

295
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,820

we're going to go back up I did work on

296
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:01,830
we're going to go back up I did work on
 

297
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,459
we're going to go back up I did work on
the inside a little like I'm I guess

298
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:04,469
the inside a little like I'm I guess
 

299
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:05,809
the inside a little like I'm I guess
what I'm doing on the inside is just

300
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:05,819
what I'm doing on the inside is just
 

301
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,939
what I'm doing on the inside is just
kind of shaping it so we'll have a half

302
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:07,949
kind of shaping it so we'll have a half
 

303
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:10,670
kind of shaping it so we'll have a half
slab floor like this this this wood

304
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:10,680
slab floor like this this this wood
 

305
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,730
slab floor like this this this wood
block stuff is just placeholder so that

306
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:13,740
block stuff is just placeholder so that
 

307
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,079
block stuff is just placeholder so that
I know the shape of the building and

00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,089
I know the shape of the building and
 

309
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:16,779
I know the shape of the building and
then after that we can choose different

310
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:16,789
then after that we can choose different
 

311
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,839
then after that we can choose different

that where I'm going with this make sure
 

317
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,810
that where I'm going with this make sure
I can shape it properly before I decide

318
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:29,820
I can shape it properly before I decide
 

319
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,670
I can shape it properly before I decide
on how the outside is going to look you

320
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
on how the outside is going to look you
 

321
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,550
on how the outside is going to look you
know because if we just focus on the

322
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:37,560
know because if we just focus on the
 

323
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,709
know because if we just focus on the
outside the inside it's going to look

324
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:39,719
outside the inside it's going to look
 

325
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,410
outside the inside it's going to look
really bad so okay that's kind of cool

326
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:44,420
really bad so okay that's kind of cool
 

327
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,990
really bad so okay that's kind of cool
so we'll have that then up here the

328
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
so we'll have that then up here the
 

329
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,760
so we'll have that then up here the
place I'm going to put the villager a

330
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:49,770
place I'm going to put the villager a
 

331
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,250
place I'm going to put the villager a
little shop like the cookie shop or

332
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:52,260
little shop like the cookie shop or
 

333
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,490
little shop like the cookie shop or
whatever is over here and I don't think

334
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:55,500
whatever is over here and I don't think
 

335
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,240
whatever is over here and I don't think
we need to get too fancy with it just

336
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,250
we need to get too fancy with it just
 

337
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:05,470
we need to get too fancy with it just
like a little counter would counter and

338
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:05,480

 

339
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,150

have a trapdoor in there somewhere

340
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
have a trapdoor in there somewhere
 

341
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,210
have a trapdoor in there somewhere
if I guess the thing is a villager can

342
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:11,220
if I guess the thing is a villager can
 

343
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,010
if I guess the thing is a villager can
jump over that still right so we'll have

344
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,020
jump over that still right so we'll have
 

345
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,560
jump over that still right so we'll have
to lower this half a block so it'll look

346
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:18,570
to lower this half a block so it'll look
 

347
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,320
to lower this half a block so it'll look
like well then he might not look over

348
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,330
like well then he might not look over
 

349
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:28,670
like well then he might not look over
the counter properly hmm oh well well

350
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:28,680
the counter properly hmm oh well well
 

351
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,020
the counter properly hmm oh well well
see what it's like and we can change it

00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,030
see what it's like and we can change it
 

353
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,410
see what it's like and we can change it
later if we don't like it but yeah well

later if we don't like it but yeah well
 

355
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,090
later if we don't like it but yeah well
lower that half a block and then oh man

356
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,100
lower that half a block and then oh man
 

357
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,870
lower that half a block and then oh man
go down go up go down go up over and

I think we're about done here for today
 

393
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,900
I think we're about done here for today
we'll have to do this library in little

394
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:47,910
we'll have to do this library in little
 

395
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,820
we'll have to do this library in little
steps like this because it's such a big

396
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:49,830
steps like this because it's such a big
 

397
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,940
steps like this because it's such a big
project and I am very finicky about

398
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:52,950
project and I am very finicky about
 

399
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,490
project and I am very finicky about
details and takes me forever to get

400
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:55,500
details and takes me forever to get
 

401
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,440
details and takes me forever to get
stuff done

416
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
how do you make a pot for a tree without
 

417
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,510
how do you make a pot for a tree without
it being too big like if we do this it's

418
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:38,520
it being too big like if we do this it's
 

419
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,079
it being too big like if we do this it's
a pretty big pot and doesn't even

420
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:42,089
a pretty big pot and doesn't even
 

421
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:49,040
a pretty big pot and doesn't even
connect to the ground mm okay well what

422
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,050
connect to the ground mm okay well what
 

423
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,240
connect to the ground mm okay well what
we'll do just have a soil block like

424
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,250
we'll do just have a soil block like
 

425
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,090
we'll do just have a soil block like
that we'll put our tree on it will grow

426
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,100
that we'll put our tree on it will grow
 

427
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,570
that we'll put our tree on it will grow
it hopefully we'll get a good tree yeah

428
00:11:59,570 --> 00:11:59,580
it hopefully we'll get a good tree yeah
 

429
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,090
it hopefully we'll get a good tree yeah
a tree and then we could put the brick

430
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,100
a tree and then we could put the brick
 

431
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,199
a tree and then we could put the brick
around here maybe I look okay

432
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:11,209
around here maybe I look okay
 

433
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:17,510
around here maybe I look okay
and it is extremely dark man see if

434
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:17,520
and it is extremely dark man see if
 

435
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,310
and it is extremely dark man see if
that's another reason I want to put the

436
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:19,320
that's another reason I want to put the
 

437
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,720
that's another reason I want to put the
tables up here because we'll be able to

438
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:20,730
tables up here because we'll be able to
 

439
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,710
tables up here because we'll be able to
hide some lights on that and

440
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
hide some lights on that and
 

441
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,240
hide some lights on that and
get some lighting around the place

442
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,250
get some lighting around the place
 

443
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,560
get some lighting around the place
because otherwise it's going to be so

444
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:25,570
because otherwise it's going to be so
 

445
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:32,690
because otherwise it's going to be so
dark yeah we could do that just go down

446
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:32,700
dark yeah we could do that just go down
 

447
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,070
dark yeah we could do that just go down
something like that would be good maybe

448
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,080
something like that would be good maybe
 

449
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,510
something like that would be good maybe
move it a little bit further away from

450
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:36,520
move it a little bit further away from
 

451
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,680
move it a little bit further away from
the rail though huh anyway that's all

452
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:40,690
the rail though huh anyway that's all
 

453

I've always wanted to build a bridge to

474
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:11,620
I've always wanted to build a bridge to
 

475
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,620
I've always wanted to build a bridge to
go across this river so we might do that

476
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:13,630
go across this river so we might do that
 

477
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,220
go across this river so we might do that
at some point too but I got to finish up

478
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,230
at some point too but I got to finish up
 

479
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,770
at some point too but I got to finish up
the walls and do a ceiling in here and

480
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:19,780
the walls and do a ceiling in here and
 

481
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,920
the walls and do a ceiling in here and
something at this level to something

482
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:22,930
something at this level to something
 

483
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,610
something at this level to something
cool hopefully but yeah Wilson let's go

484
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:26,620
cool hopefully but yeah Wilson let's go
 

485
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,230
cool hopefully but yeah Wilson let's go
visit Wilson our are sad and lonely pet

486
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:31,240
visit Wilson our are sad and lonely pet
 

487
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,530
visit Wilson our are sad and lonely pet
that's that's not alive he's waiting for

488
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:34,540
that's that's not alive he's waiting for
 

489
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,530
that's that's not alive he's waiting for
us to give him a brain our poor guy here

490
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:39,540
us to give him a brain our poor guy here
 

491
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,880
us to give him a brain our poor guy here
so a little while ago I posed that

492
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:41,890
so a little while ago I posed that
 

493
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,960
so a little while ago I posed that
problem I don't know if you guys

494
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:42,970
problem I don't know if you guys
 

495
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,270
problem I don't know if you guys
remember it but I was having some

496
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:45,280
remember it but I was having some
 

497
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,640
remember it but I was having some
trouble figuring out where to go from

498
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:47,650
trouble figuring out where to go from
 

499
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,300
trouble figuring out where to go from
where we're at now with Wilson sort of a

500
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,310
where we're at now with Wilson sort of a
 

501
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,380
where we're at now with Wilson sort of a
redstone problem and I posted that

502
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:55,390
redstone problem and I posted that
 

503
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,690
redstone problem and I posted that
hoping I was going to get the answer

504
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:57,700
hoping I was going to get the answer
 

505
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,240
hoping I was going to get the answer
from somebody like somebody was going to

506
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,250
from somebody like somebody was going to
 

507
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,600
from somebody like somebody was going to
tell me how to do it in a 3x5 area using

508
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:03,610
tell me how to do it in a 3x5 area using
 

509
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,640
tell me how to do it in a 3x5 area using
some comparator trick I hadn't thought

510
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:05,650
some comparator trick I hadn't thought
 

511
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,700
some comparator trick I hadn't thought
of and it was going to be amazing but

512
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:08,710
of and it was going to be amazing but
 

513
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,850
of and it was going to be amazing but
now that never happened it's just it's a

514
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:11,860
now that never happened it's just it's a
 

515
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,070
now that never happened it's just it's a
complicated problem with no good

516
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,080
complicated problem with no good
 

517
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,610
complicated problem with no good
solution from what I can tell because

518
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:17,620
solution from what I can tell because
 

519
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,650
solution from what I can tell because
what I got to do let's go back up to our

520
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:19,660
what I got to do let's go back up to our
 

521
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,110
what I got to do let's go back up to our
problem here is I got to do some

522
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,120
problem here is I got to do some
 

523
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,700
problem here is I got to do some
calculations in the game basically like

524
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:26,710
calculations in the game basically like
 

525
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,880
calculations in the game basically like
real number calculations converted to

526
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:29,890
real number calculations converted to
 

527
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,850
real number calculations converted to
redstone which is possible in the game

528
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:32,860
redstone which is possible in the game
 

529
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,879
redstone which is possible in the game
it's definitely possible

530
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:34,889
it's definitely possible
 

531
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:37,879
it's definitely possible
but the problem is making it's not

532
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:37,889
but the problem is making it's not
 

533
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:43,900
but the problem is making it's not
gigantic is one issue the other issue is

534
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:43,910
gigantic is one issue the other issue is
 

535
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,009
gigantic is one issue the other issue is
making it so there's not a ton of

536
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:46,019
making it so there's not a ton of
 

537
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,869
making it so there's not a ton of
redstone running all the time that's

538
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:47,879
redstone running all the time that's
 

539
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,069
redstone running all the time that's
going to like my world out and you know

540
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
going to like my world out and you know
 

541
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,949
going to like my world out and you know
making making everything connect

542
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
making making everything connect
 

543
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,720
making making everything connect
together is another challenge because

544
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:56,730
together is another challenge because
 

545
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,759
together is another challenge because
it's sort of a mess back there if you

546
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:58,769
it's sort of a mess back there if you
 

547
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:01,129
it's sort of a mess back there if you
saw like it's it's orderly but there's

548
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:01,139
saw like it's it's orderly but there's
 

549
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:06,919
saw like it's it's orderly but there's
so many wires all over the place but the

550
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:06,929
so many wires all over the place but the
 

551
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:10,189
so many wires all over the place but the
general suggestion I got from people is

552
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:10,199
general suggestion I got from people is
 

553
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,019
general suggestion I got from people is
I should handle these one at a time so

554
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:12,029
I should handle these one at a time so
 

555
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,479
I should handle these one at a time so
trying to convert them all together

556
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:14,489
trying to convert them all together
 

557
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:18,049
trying to convert them all together
which yeah I think that is a good good

558
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:18,059
which yeah I think that is a good good
 

559
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:21,979
which yeah I think that is a good good
plan but still to handle each of these

560
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:21,989
plan but still to handle each of these
 

561
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:25,819
plan but still to handle each of these
individually the thing is like these

562
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:25,829
individually the thing is like these
 

563
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:28,309
individually the thing is like these
numbers by the way they represents the

564
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:28,319
numbers by the way they represents the
 

565
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:31,429
numbers by the way they represents the
number of items I need to flow from one

566
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:31,439
number of items I need to flow from one
 

567
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:34,249
number of items I need to flow from one
of our variables here this is how I'm

568
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:34,259
of our variables here this is how I'm
 

569
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:37,099
of our variables here this is how I'm
doing the variables for Wilson just the

570
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:37,109
doing the variables for Wilson just the
 

571
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:41,419
doing the variables for Wilson just the
hopper hop or combo and if we want

572
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:41,429
hopper hop or combo and if we want
 

573
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:44,059
hopper hop or combo and if we want
addition or subtraction to it we power

574
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:44,069
addition or subtraction to it we power
 

575
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,069
addition or subtraction to it we power
one or the other and an item will flow

576
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
one or the other and an item will flow
 

577
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,799
one or the other and an item will flow
from here to here or else from here to

578
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:48,809
from here to here or else from here to
 

579
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:52,509
from here to here or else from here to
there right and then we get a different

580
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:52,519
there right and then we get a different
 

581
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,460
there right and then we get a different
signal length depending on how many

582
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:55,470
signal length depending on how many
 

583
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,619
signal length depending on how many
items are in in one of the hoppers right

584
00:15:59,619 --> 00:15:59,629
items are in in one of the hoppers right
 

585
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:04,009
items are in in one of the hoppers right
the thing is to make three items flow

586
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:04,019
the thing is to make three items flow
 

587
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,269
the thing is to make three items flow
for example we need to power the thing

588
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:08,279
for example we need to power the thing
 

589
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:14,109
for example we need to power the thing
for 3.5 ticks per item so that would be

590
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:14,119

 

591
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:19,489

go brain 10.5 redstone ticks to get

592
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:19,499
go brain 10.5 redstone ticks to get
 

593
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:22,340
go brain 10.5 redstone ticks to get
negative three right and if we got a

594
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:22,350
negative three right and if we got a
 

595
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,159
negative three right and if we got a
pill to build a pulse extender for each

596
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:25,169
pill to build a pulse extender for each
 

597
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:27,979
pill to build a pulse extender for each
of these it's going to get kind of big

598
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:27,989
of these it's going to get kind of big
 

599
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:31,189
of these it's going to get kind of big
and messy and leggy and it's a it's a

600
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
and messy and leggy and it's a it's a
 

601
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,449
and messy and leggy and it's a it's a
big problem but I did think of one way

602
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:35,459
big problem but I did think of one way
 

603
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,210
big problem but I did think of one way
we can simplify it a little bit I don't

604
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:38,220
we can simplify it a little bit I don't
 

605
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,329
we can simplify it a little bit I don't
know for if we got enough figured out to

606
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:41,339
know for if we got enough figured out to
 

607
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,439
know for if we got enough figured out to
to use this but it's sort of a better

608
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:45,449
to use this but it's sort of a better
 

609
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:48,060
to use this but it's sort of a better
way of doing it instead of doing that

610
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,070
way of doing it instead of doing that
 

611
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,480
way of doing it instead of doing that
hopper hopper combo like I was going to

612
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:50,490
hopper hopper combo like I was going to
 

613
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,269
hopper hopper combo like I was going to
what we can do instead is have a

614
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
what we can do instead is have a
 

615
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,079
what we can do instead is have a
comparator like this put a block in

616
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:58,089
comparator like this put a block in
 

617
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:01,620
comparator like this put a block in
front and then redstone comes back to

618
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:01,630
front and then redstone comes back to
 

619
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,079
front and then redstone comes back to
the comparator like that right and what

620
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,089
the comparator like that right and what
 

621
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,020
the comparator like that right and what
this does is it's a way of generating

622
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,030
this does is it's a way of generating
 

623
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,000
this does is it's a way of generating
quick pulses in the game very very

624
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,010
quick pulses in the game very very
 

625
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:15,870
quick pulses in the game very very
easily like if we do that nothing really

626
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:15,880
easily like if we do that nothing really
 

627
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,549
easily like if we do that nothing really
happens but if we switch this to

628
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:17,559
happens but if we switch this to
 

629
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:20,730
happens but if we switch this to
subtraction mode the power comes back to

630
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:20,740
subtraction mode the power comes back to
 

631
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,230
subtraction mode the power comes back to
the comparator and it does this it emits

632
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:25,240
the comparator and it does this it emits
 

633
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,449
the comparator and it does this it emits
a quick pulse which does like the game I

634
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:27,459
a quick pulse which does like the game I
 

635
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:32,570
a quick pulse which does like the game I
can feel it already but what's this

636
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:32,580
can feel it already but what's this
 

637
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,600
can feel it already but what's this
instead of doing long pulses with a

638
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:36,610
instead of doing long pulses with a
 

639
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,240
instead of doing long pulses with a
hopper hopper combo we're going to do a

640
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,250
hopper hopper combo we're going to do a
 

641
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,710
hopper hopper combo we're going to do a
dropper dropper combo one of these is

642
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:43,720
dropper dropper combo one of these is
 

643
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
dropper dropper combo one of these is
going to be addition one of these is

644
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:45,730
going to be addition one of these is
 

645
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,390
going to be addition one of these is
going to be subtraction and so for

646
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
going to be subtraction and so for
 

647
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,750
going to be subtraction and so for
example if we power this ah it doesn't

648
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:54,760
example if we power this ah it doesn't
 

649
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,180
example if we power this ah it doesn't
work darn it I didn't test it I thought

650
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,190
work darn it I didn't test it I thought
 

651
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,890
work darn it I didn't test it I thought
it was just going to work darn it no

652
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:03,900
it was just going to work darn it no
 

653
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,210
it was just going to work darn it no
what what do we have to do to make it

654
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:06,220
what what do we have to do to make it
 

655
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,530
what what do we have to do to make it
work that's not going to work

656
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:07,540
work that's not going to work
 

657
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:17,840
work that's not going to work
that's not going to work oh-ho still no

658
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:17,850

 

659
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,789

- that's not changing

660
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:20,799
- that's not changing
 

661
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:30,899
- that's not changing
darn it these pulses are too quick well

662
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:30,909
darn it these pulses are too quick well
 

663
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,230
darn it these pulses are too quick well
that worked

664
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:33,240
that worked
 

665
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,700
that worked
interesting I thought they fixed that is

666
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:38,710
interesting I thought they fixed that is
 

667
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:45,440
interesting I thought they fixed that is
it not sharing though oh no it's going

668
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:45,450
it not sharing though oh no it's going
 

669
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,090
it not sharing though oh no it's going
ok so we can make items flow very

670
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:48,100
ok so we can make items flow very
 

671
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,820
ok so we can make items flow very
quickly and very precisely if we do a

672
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:50,830
quickly and very precisely if we do a
 

673
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,330
quickly and very precisely if we do a
system like this instead and then we

674
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,340
system like this instead and then we
 

675
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,470
system like this instead and then we
only have to power this for like a much

676
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
only have to power this for like a much
 

677
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,510
only have to power this for like a much
shorter time compared to if we do a

678
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:00,520
shorter time compared to if we do a
 

679
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,260
shorter time compared to if we do a
hopper hopper

680
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,270
hopper hopper
 

681
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,750
hopper hopper
thing so that'll reduce the the redstone

682
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
thing so that'll reduce the the redstone
 

683
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,140
thing so that'll reduce the the redstone
we need for the build which will be a

684
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,150
we need for the build which will be a
 

685
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,760
we need for the build which will be a
nice improvement like let's see actually

686
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:11,770
nice improvement like let's see actually
 

687
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,350
nice improvement like let's see actually
let's just do a quick test here how many

688
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
let's just do a quick test here how many
 

689
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,890
let's just do a quick test here how many
items can we get flowing with just a 4

690
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:16,900
items can we get flowing with just a 4
 

691
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:26,400
items can we get flowing with just a 4
tick out good game now ah ok we're right

692
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,410
tick out good game now ah ok we're right
 

693
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,850
tick out good game now ah ok we're right
by it trying to do some redstone here

694
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:31,860

 

695
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,840

figuring out the problems of the

696
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:33,850
figuring out the problems of the
 

697
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,360
figuring out the problems of the
universe here and the stinking creepers

we yeah we're just going to do a quick

716
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
we yeah we're just going to do a quick
 

717
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,520
we yeah we're just going to do a quick
test here we're going to pulse this

718
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:14,530
test here we're going to pulse this
 

719
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,220
test here we're going to pulse this
really quick and see how my items flow

720
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,230
really quick and see how my items flow
 

721
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,620
really quick and see how my items flow
from here to there with just four ticks

722
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:19,630
from here to there with just four ticks
 

723
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:28,170
from here to there with just four ticks
on a repeater look like to a 2 mm still

724
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:28,180
on a repeater look like to a 2 mm still
 

725
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,510
on a repeater look like to a 2 mm still
not so much super but we can really make

726
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
not so much super but we can really make
 

727
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
not so much super but we can really make
things smaller that way so it's like two

728
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:35,530
things smaller that way so it's like two
 

729
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,990
things smaller that way so it's like two
ticks instead of 3.5 the downside of

730
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000
ticks instead of 3.5 the downside of
 

731
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,580
ticks instead of 3.5 the downside of
doing this though is now we have nine

732
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:41,590
doing this though is now we have nine
 

733
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,520
doing this though is now we have nine
slots instead of five slots like we have

734
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:44,530
slots instead of five slots like we have
 

735
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:52,200
slots instead of five slots like we have
a hopper so mm we'll have to use more

736
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,210
a hopper so mm we'll have to use more
 

737
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,180
a hopper so mm we'll have to use more
ender pearls instead of regular items or

738
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,190
ender pearls instead of regular items or
 

739
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,180
ender pearls instead of regular items or
something I don't know but it's just an

740
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,190
something I don't know but it's just an
 

741
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,250
something I don't know but it's just an
idea I think we should use droppers

742
00:20:59,250 --> 00:20:59,260
idea I think we should use droppers
 

743
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:06,360
idea I think we should use droppers
instead well anyways guys we're going to

744
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:06,370
instead well anyways guys we're going to
 

745
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,760
instead well anyways guys we're going to
have to end episode here for today sort

746
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:08,770
have to end episode here for today sort
 

747
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,830
have to end episode here for today sort
of a shorter one and I do apologize for

748

of a shorter one and I do apologize for
that but not to worry it's going to be

April soon and I'll have
 

753
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,470
April soon and I'll have
time then to put into my recordings

754
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:17,480
time then to put into my recordings
 

755
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,010
time then to put into my recordings
again

756
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:18,020
again
 

757
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,300
