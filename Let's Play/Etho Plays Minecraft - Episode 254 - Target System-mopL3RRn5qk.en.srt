00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:23,580
coffee or or get caffeine or sugar into
 

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,490
coffee or or get caffeine or sugar into
your system any other way because when

12
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:25,500
your system any other way because when
 

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,220
your system any other way because when
you go to bed you might find yourself in

14
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:28,230
you go to bed you might find yourself in
 

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,490
you go to bed you might find yourself in
the same situation you might have

16
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:30,500
the same situation you might have
 

17
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,930
the same situation you might have
yourself a redstone nightmare like I

18
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:32,940
yourself a redstone nightmare like I
 

19
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,229
yourself a redstone nightmare like I
have here and then you got to solve it

20
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239
have here and then you got to solve it
 

21
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,850
have here and then you got to solve it
before you can move on and wake up this

22
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:39,860
before you can move on and wake up this
 

23
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,560
before you can move on and wake up this
this is quite the nightmare but you know

24
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:42,570
this is quite the nightmare but you know
 

25
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,000
this is quite the nightmare but you know
what Wilson is coming along here I have

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,010
what Wilson is coming along here I have
 

27
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,950
what Wilson is coming along here I have
I've been working on it I probably won't

28
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
I've been working on it I probably won't
 

29
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,110
I've been working on it I probably won't
show too much of the red stoning anymore

30
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
show too much of the red stoning anymore
 

31
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,049
show too much of the red stoning anymore
just I'll just show you the basic steps

32
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:54,059
just I'll just show you the basic steps
 

33
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,090
just I'll just show you the basic steps
I'm taken to finish it probably because

34
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:56,100
I'm taken to finish it probably because
 

35
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,750
I'm taken to finish it probably because
it's it's pretty slow going here but

36
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
it's it's pretty slow going here but
 

37
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,880
it's it's pretty slow going here but
basically it what I've just added is

38
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:01,890
basically it what I've just added is
 

39
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,509
basically it what I've just added is
this this thing here which allows me to

40
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
this this thing here which allows me to
 

41
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,679
this this thing here which allows me to
lock the hoppers and each variable now

42
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:09,689
lock the hoppers and each variable now
 

43
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,719
lock the hoppers and each variable now
has these two wires I can connect to

44
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:11,729
has these two wires I can connect to
 

45
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,660
has these two wires I can connect to
basically this one is for addition if I

46
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:14,670
basically this one is for addition if I
 

47
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,570
basically this one is for addition if I
send power to that's it will unlock the

48
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:17,580
send power to that's it will unlock the
 

49
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,990
send power to that's it will unlock the
hoppers and allow items to flow through

50
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,000
hoppers and allow items to flow through
 

51
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,850
hoppers and allow items to flow through
this way or if I do this one then it's

52
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:28,860
this way or if I do this one then it's
 

53
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,630
this way or if I do this one then it's
subtraction so now items can flow the

54
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
subtraction so now items can flow the
 

55
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,080
subtraction so now items can flow the
other way into this hopper now what I

56
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,090
other way into this hopper now what I
 

57
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,300
other way into this hopper now what I
got to do is connect each of these

58
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,310
got to do is connect each of these
 

59
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,600
got to do is connect each of these
together all three of those plus plus

60
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:47,610
together all three of those plus plus
 

61
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,020
together all three of those plus plus
this and this and that will be a master

62
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,030
this and this and that will be a master
 

63
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,929
this and this and that will be a master
reset line so if the pet dies I just

64
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:53,939
reset line so if the pet dies I just
 

65
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,620
reset line so if the pet dies I just
pull a lever or or something I send a

66
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:57,630
pull a lever or or something I send a
 

67
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,109
pull a lever or or something I send a
signal for probably a minute or two to

68
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:00,119
signal for probably a minute or two to
 

69
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,609
signal for probably a minute or two to
clear everything and then we have a

70
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:01,619
clear everything and then we have a
 

71
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,539
clear everything and then we have a
brand new pet basically so that's the

72
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:05,549
brand new pet basically so that's the
 

73
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,010
brand new pet basically so that's the
next step I don't know if you guys can

74
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,020
next step I don't know if you guys can
 

75
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,109
next step I don't know if you guys can
tell but I'm still kind of sick from

76
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
tell but I'm still kind of sick from
 

77
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,910
tell but I'm still kind of sick from
from before

78
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
from before
 

79
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,460
from before

83
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,590
trying not to talk like this you know
but I can't quite help it mm-hmm work

84
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:20,600
but I can't quite help it mm-hmm work
 

85
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,890
but I can't quite help it mm-hmm work
off like I just did there yeah the

86
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:23,900
off like I just did there yeah the
 

87
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,690

I've been doing a few other things
around here I checked out the slime farm

112
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
around here I checked out the slime farm
 

113
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,600
around here I checked out the slime farm
I've been trying to figure out why some

114
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:07,610
I've been trying to figure out why some
 

115
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:15,449
I've been trying to figure out why some
of this stuff isn't working these guys

116
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:15,459
of this stuff isn't working these guys
 

117
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,640
of this stuff isn't working these guys
like why this minecart thing wasn't

118
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:18,650
like why this minecart thing wasn't
 

119
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,340
like why this minecart thing wasn't
working anymore oh it didn't work

120
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,350
working anymore oh it didn't work
 

121
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,590
working anymore oh it didn't work
he just picked up a slide let's go in

122
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:26,600
he just picked up a slide let's go in
 

123
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,270
he just picked up a slide let's go in
there just show you what's going on

124
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,280
there just show you what's going on
 

125
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:35,170
there just show you what's going on
ah yeah that guy had a slime in OOP oh

126
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,180
ah yeah that guy had a slime in OOP oh
 

127
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,610
ah yeah that guy had a slime in OOP oh
it's picking up more guys cool yeah but

128
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:39,620
it's picking up more guys cool yeah but
 

129
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,860
it's picking up more guys cool yeah but
basically empty mine carts they they

130
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:41,870
basically empty mine carts they they
 

131
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,660
basically empty mine carts they they
move a lot further than they used to is

132
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:43,670
move a lot further than they used to is
 

133
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,360
move a lot further than they used to is
one issue so my lazy junction right here

134
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,370

 

135
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,680

you just saw it it's it's having a

136
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:53,690
you just saw it it's it's having a
 

137
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,310
you just saw it it's it's having a
slight problem detecting empty carts now

138
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,320
slight problem detecting empty carts now
 

139
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,930
slight problem detecting empty carts now
before I had the detector over here well

140
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:04,940
before I had the detector over here well
 

141
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,880
before I had the detector over here well
sorry about that this episode's going to

142
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:06,890
sorry about that this episode's going to
 

143
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,980
sorry about that this episode's going to
be a bit choppy I think just because I

144
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:08,990
be a bit choppy I think just because I
 

145
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,330
be a bit choppy I think just because I
gotta clear my throat every so often

146
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:10,340
gotta clear my throat every so often
 

147
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,140
gotta clear my throat every so often
here so my apologies sorry please

148
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,150
here so my apologies sorry please
 

149
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,140
here so my apologies sorry please
forgive me but yeah I had to detect a

150
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,150
forgive me but yeah I had to detect a
 

151
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,840
forgive me but yeah I had to detect a
rail on top of the pumpkin before right

152
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:19,850
rail on top of the pumpkin before right
 

153
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,600
rail on top of the pumpkin before right
and since empty carts lose their

154
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:22,610
and since empty carts lose their
 

155
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,380
and since empty carts lose their
momentum quicker than then carts that

156
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:26,390
momentum quicker than then carts that
 

157
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,320
momentum quicker than then carts that
have something in it takes to the empty

158
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,330
have something in it takes to the empty
 

159
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,940
have something in it takes to the empty
cart longer to get to this Junction and

160
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:30,950
cart longer to get to this Junction and
 

161
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,190
cart longer to get to this Junction and
by that time this Junction would switch

162
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:33,200
by that time this Junction would switch
 

163
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,210
by that time this Junction would switch
back so it would go this way but now

164
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:37,220
back so it would go this way but now
 

165
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,160
back so it would go this way but now
since empty carts looser momentum a bit

166
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,170
since empty carts looser momentum a bit
 

167
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,230
since empty carts looser momentum a bit
slower they're actually getting by here

168
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
slower they're actually getting by here
 

169
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,450
slower they're actually getting by here
before it switches so they go further

170
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:46,460
before it switches so they go further
 

171
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,560
before it switches so they go further
quicker which is a good thing that's a

172
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:50,570
quicker which is a good thing that's a
 

173
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,290
quicker which is a good thing that's a
good change I would say but yeah I've

174
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:53,300
good change I would say but yeah I've
 

175
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,660
good change I would say but yeah I've
tried moving the detector rail back I

176
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:55,670
tried moving the detector rail back I
 

177
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,120
tried moving the detector rail back I
moved it here that didn't fix it then

178
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,130
moved it here that didn't fix it then
 

179
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,830
moved it here that didn't fix it then
when I moved it here instead of all the

180
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
when I moved it here instead of all the
 

181
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,260
when I moved it here instead of all the
carts going straight regardless of

182
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,270
carts going straight regardless of
 

183
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,150
carts going straight regardless of
whether they were empty or full now they

184
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
whether they were empty or full now they
 

185
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,240
whether they were empty or full now they
all go this way regardless of whether

186
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,250
all go this way regardless of whether
 

187
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,370
all go this way regardless of whether
they're empty or full so there's no real

188
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:09,380
they're empty or full so there's no real
 

189
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,690
they're empty or full so there's no real
change in the speed of the carts whether

190
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:13,700
change in the speed of the carts whether
 

191
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,640
change in the speed of the carts whether
they're empty or full with my setup here

192
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:15,650
they're empty or full with my setup here
 

193
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,200
they're empty or full with my setup here
so I think I got to move this power rail

194
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,210
so I think I got to move this power rail
 

195
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,300
so I think I got to move this power rail
back a little bit and hopefully that

196
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,310
back a little bit and hopefully that
 

197
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,220
back a little bit and hopefully that
will will do the trick

198
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,230
will will do the trick
 

199
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,160
will will do the trick
because empty carts are still slower or

200
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,170
because empty carts are still slower or
 

201
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,909
because empty carts are still slower or
they lose their momentum quicker so it's

202
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:30,919
they lose their momentum quicker so it's
 

203
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:32,590
they lose their momentum quicker so it's
still possible to do a junction like

204
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:32,600
still possible to do a junction like
 

205
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,470
still possible to do a junction like
this I just step to tinker with it a bit

206
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:37,480

 

207
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,870

well we hit level 30 again it's time for

208
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
well we hit level 30 again it's time for
 

209
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,630
well we hit level 30 again it's time for
another book enchantment what are we

210
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:43,640
another book enchantment what are we
 

211
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,640
another book enchantment what are we
going to get I don't know let's find out

212
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:47,650
going to get I don't know let's find out
 

213
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:54,640
going to get I don't know let's find out
efficiency 3 whoa all right I think I

214
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:54,650
efficiency 3 whoa all right I think I
 

215
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,940
efficiency 3 whoa all right I think I
got it fixed here cart goes that way you

216
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:57,950
got it fixed here cart goes that way you
 

217
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,530
got it fixed here cart goes that way you
saw the track switch twice there

218
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:00,540
saw the track switch twice there
 

219
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,810
saw the track switch twice there
and since it was moving so slow it was

220
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:02,820
and since it was moving so slow it was
 

221
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,610
and since it was moving so slow it was
able to go that way instead of going

222
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:04,620
able to go that way instead of going
 

223
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,500
able to go that way instead of going
straight because they gave it enough

224
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:06,510
straight because they gave it enough
 

225
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,350
straight because they gave it enough
time to switch back and so I moved the

226
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
time to switch back and so I moved the
 

227
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,180
time to switch back and so I moved the
detector rail one away from the pumpkin

228
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,190
detector rail one away from the pumpkin
 

229
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,520
detector rail one away from the pumpkin
and the power rail two away from the

230
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:13,530
and the power rail two away from the
 

231
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,320
and the power rail two away from the
detector rail before it was detected

232
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,330
detector rail before it was detected
 

233
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,780
detector rail before it was detected
rail there and power rail there and that

234
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:17,790
rail there and power rail there and that
 

235
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:25,040
rail there and power rail there and that
seems to work with my setup now um yeah

236
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,050
seems to work with my setup now um yeah
 

237
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,960
seems to work with my setup now um yeah
accidentally had a big slime go up here

238
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:26,970
accidentally had a big slime go up here
 

239
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,870
accidentally had a big slime go up here
now my karts are all messed up but it

240
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:29,880
now my karts are all messed up but it
 

241
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,250
now my karts are all messed up but it
does seem to be working again which is

242
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:31,260
does seem to be working again which is
 

243
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,730
does seem to be working again which is
good there is a few other things I

244
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:34,740
good there is a few other things I
 

245
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,460
good there is a few other things I
spotted though that I could improve this

246
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:37,470
spotted though that I could improve this
 

247
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:44,900
spotted though that I could improve this
I think let's see all right that's all

248
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:44,910
I think let's see all right that's all
 

249
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,510
I think let's see all right that's all
reset I tried it out the big slime still

250
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
reset I tried it out the big slime still
 

251
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,820
reset I tried it out the big slime still
get picked up which is good from the

252
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:49,830
get picked up which is good from the
 

253
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,470
get picked up which is good from the
corner here now that we can turn stairs

254
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:54,480
corner here now that we can turn stairs
 

255
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,070
corner here now that we can turn stairs
like before I had it like it was like

256
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,080
like before I had it like it was like
 

257
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,540
like before I had it like it was like
that and there's this little gap you

258
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:02,550
that and there's this little gap you
 

259
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,310
that and there's this little gap you
could see into here from I think I can

260
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:04,320
could see into here from I think I can
 

261
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,040
could see into here from I think I can
cover that up now if I switch that to a

262
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,050
cover that up now if I switch that to a
 

263
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,480
cover that up now if I switch that to a
sideways there let's just try this out

264
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,490
sideways there let's just try this out
 

265
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,200
sideways there let's just try this out
real quick

266
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,210
real quick
 

267
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:19,220
real quick
Oh nope went the wrong way um I might

268
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,230
Oh nope went the wrong way um I might
 

269
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,520
Oh nope went the wrong way um I might
have to get one more stair I should

270
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:22,530
have to get one more stair I should
 

271
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,530
have to get one more stair I should
actually put stairs here too because we

272
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:24,540
actually put stairs here too because we
 

273
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,440
actually put stairs here too because we
got these little corners it might look

274
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,450
got these little corners it might look
 

275
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,360
got these little corners it might look
better see prepping table real quick

276
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,370
better see prepping table real quick
 

277
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:39,440
better see prepping table real quick
here doo doo doo doo I've kind of just

278
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,450
here doo doo doo doo I've kind of just
 

279
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,090
here doo doo doo doo I've kind of just
been going around and looking for little

280
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:41,100
been going around and looking for little
 

281
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,310
been going around and looking for little
things to fix around in the cave here

282
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:43,320
things to fix around in the cave here
 

283
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,410
things to fix around in the cave here
because if you don't if you don't fix

284
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:45,420
because if you don't if you don't fix
 

285
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,270
because if you don't if you don't fix
stuff eventually everything gets broken

286
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
stuff eventually everything gets broken
 

287
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,550
stuff eventually everything gets broken
and then you don't like you don't like

288
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:49,560
and then you don't like you don't like
 

289
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,680
and then you don't like you don't like
your world anymore oh I see the problem

290
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:51,690
your world anymore oh I see the problem
 

291
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,200
your world anymore oh I see the problem
is facing the wrong way I'm supposed to

292
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,210
is facing the wrong way I'm supposed to
 

293
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,220
is facing the wrong way I'm supposed to
put it like this there we go perfect so

294
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,230
put it like this there we go perfect so
 

295
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,230
put it like this there we go perfect so
I want to make sure I keep maintaining

296
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
I want to make sure I keep maintaining
 

297
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,620
I want to make sure I keep maintaining
things let's see what this looks like

298
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,630
things let's see what this looks like
 

299
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,070
things let's see what this looks like
too

300
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080

 

301
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,809

I want to do this instead yeah yeah I

302
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:10,819
I want to do this instead yeah yeah I
 

303
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,290
I want to do this instead yeah yeah I
think we should do that give this little

304
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:14,300
think we should do that give this little
 

305
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,040
think we should do that give this little
updates I tried one more thing here I'm

306
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,050
updates I tried one more thing here I'm
 

307
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,809
updates I tried one more thing here I'm
not sure if it's working but I was

308
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:19,819
not sure if it's working but I was
 

309
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,490
not sure if it's working but I was
finding a lot of times the little slimes

310
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:21,500
finding a lot of times the little slimes
 

311
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,670
finding a lot of times the little slimes
were falling down and and somehow not

312
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:24,680
were falling down and and somehow not
 

313
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,339
were falling down and and somehow not
falling into the water they were just

314
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:26,349
falling into the water they were just
 

315
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:28,749
falling into the water they were just
landing right beside here and then we're

316
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:28,759
landing right beside here and then we're
 

317
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,820
landing right beside here and then we're
able to run around my teeth or hop

318
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:30,830
able to run around my teeth or hop
 

319
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,009
able to run around my teeth or hop
around my cave so now I got these

320
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:33,019
around my cave so now I got these
 

321
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:37,290
around my cave so now I got these
trapdoors just to make it a little bit

322
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:37,300
trapdoors just to make it a little bit
 

323
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,719
trapdoors just to make it a little bit
tougher for them to get out I hope we'll

324
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:40,729
tougher for them to get out I hope we'll
 

325
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,530
tougher for them to get out I hope we'll
see if that works

326
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:43,540

 

327
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:53,560

oops there we go cool this would be

328
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:53,570
oops there we go cool this would be
 

329
00:08:53,570 --> 00:09:02,790
oops there we go cool this would be
covered beautiful here comes a big slide

330
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800

 

331
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,579

and I decide that in one more little

332
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:06,589
and I decide that in one more little
 

333
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,220
and I decide that in one more little
feature to our our track loop here it's

334
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,230
feature to our our track loop here it's
 

335
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,150
feature to our our track loop here it's
a it's a safety feature if for some

336
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,160
a it's a safety feature if for some
 

337
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,370
a it's a safety feature if for some
reason a card starts going the wrong way

338
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:15,380
reason a card starts going the wrong way
 

339
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,350
reason a card starts going the wrong way
around here there there really wasn't a

340
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
around here there there really wasn't a
 

341
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,509
around here there there really wasn't a
way of it fixing itself so now I've

342
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
way of it fixing itself so now I've
 

343
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,370
way of it fixing itself so now I've
added this extra detector rail over here

344
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:23,380
added this extra detector rail over here
 

345
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:30,210
added this extra detector rail over here
and if a car goes over its empty or full

346
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:30,220
and if a car goes over its empty or full
 

347
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,569
and if a car goes over its empty or full
it fails darn it you know what I did I

348
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:34,579
it fails darn it you know what I did I
 

349
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:37,000
it fails darn it you know what I did I
forgot to put a block here so I can show

350
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,010
forgot to put a block here so I can show
 

351
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,470
forgot to put a block here so I can show
you the circuit but there's a redstone

352
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
you the circuit but there's a redstone
 

353
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,460

torch below the junction and detector

354
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:42,470
torch below the junction and detector
 

355
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,740
torch below the junction and detector
rail goes to that by doing that alright

356
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:47,750
rail goes to that by doing that alright
 

357
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,509
rail goes to that by doing that alright
so I'm going to cover it up if we can

358
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
so I'm going to cover it up if we can
 

359
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,819
so I'm going to cover it up if we can
build this quick enough the carts going

360
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:51,829
build this quick enough the carts going
 

361
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:56,350
build this quick enough the carts going
to come around and we can see orc doodoo

362
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:56,360
to come around and we can see orc doodoo
 

363
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,139
to come around and we can see orc doodoo
it's going the wrong way should come

364
00:09:59,139 --> 00:09:59,149
it's going the wrong way should come
 

365
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:04,139
it's going the wrong way should come
around that corner any second I hope

366
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:04,149
around that corner any second I hope
 

367
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:07,870
around that corner any second I hope
still no sign and by the way this is

368
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:07,880
still no sign and by the way this is
 

369
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,780
still no sign and by the way this is
awesome they they fix the map flickering

370
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:10,790
awesome they they fix the map flickering
 

371
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,210

thing I'm not using that patch yet but I

372
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:13,220
thing I'm not using that patch yet but I
 

373
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,370
thing I'm not using that patch yet but I
will be soon

374

will be soon
 

375
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,530
will be soon
there's still performance issues as far

376
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:17,540
there's still performance issues as far
 

377
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,440
there's still performance issues as far
as I can tell oh here comes the cart

378
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:19,450
as I can tell oh here comes the cart
 

379
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,670
as I can tell oh here comes the cart
so that works out perfect for me there

380
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
so that works out perfect for me there
 

381
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,740
so that works out perfect for me there
we go

382
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:24,750
we go
 

383
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,090
we go
and it goes back on the stack and

384
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,100
and it goes back on the stack and
 

385
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,410
and it goes back on the stack and
hopefully that won't have any trouble

386
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:31,420
hopefully that won't have any trouble
 

387
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,260
hopefully that won't have any trouble
with carts going this way don't think it

388
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:34,270
with carts going this way don't think it
 

389
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,860
with carts going this way don't think it
will this is mostly just for decoration

390
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:37,870
will this is mostly just for decoration
 

391
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,950
will this is mostly just for decoration
this this giant map I'll probably have

392
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:40,960
this this giant map I'll probably have
 

393
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,070
this this giant map I'll probably have
more maps now that I have them you know

394
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,080
more maps now that I have them you know
 

395
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,720
more maps now that I have them you know
it's easy to copy them I might have more

396
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:45,730
it's easy to copy them I might have more
 

397
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,640
it's easy to copy them I might have more
where we can actually get up close and

398
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:47,650
where we can actually get up close and
 

399
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,830
where we can actually get up close and
look at the details because you can't

400
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:49,840
look at the details because you can't
 

401
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,870
look at the details because you can't
see a lot from this but it's still cool

402
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:51,880
see a lot from this but it's still cool
 

403
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:59,010
see a lot from this but it's still cool
to see it from a distance yeah and also

404
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,020
to see it from a distance yeah and also
 

405
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,310

now for for the small slimes too and I

412
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:14,620
now for for the small slimes too and I
 

413
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,130
now for for the small slimes too and I
should do something with the mediums but

414
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,140
should do something with the mediums but
 

415
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,170
should do something with the mediums but
I don't really want the mediums the

416

here yeah we got space over there and
 

433
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:03,660
here yeah we got space over there and
this is probably wirings in it that's

434
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:03,670
this is probably wirings in it that's
 

435
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,200
this is probably wirings in it that's
scary to do it's fine it's fine okay

436
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,210
scary to do it's fine it's fine okay
 

437

was standing here right now they can
 

479
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,160
was standing here right now they can
actually hit me for some reason so it's

480
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,170
actually hit me for some reason so it's
 

481
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,930
actually hit me for some reason so it's
a bit more dangerous now uh but yeah

482
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:26,940
a bit more dangerous now uh but yeah
 

483
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,100
a bit more dangerous now uh but yeah
what was I gonna do let's see let's see

484
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,110
what was I gonna do let's see let's see
 

485
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,470
what was I gonna do let's see let's see
let's go I'm going to tell you guys

486
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:33,480
let's go I'm going to tell you guys
 

487
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,080
let's go I'm going to tell you guys
about my Safari idea it's a little crazy

488
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,090
about my Safari idea it's a little crazy
 

489
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,350
about my Safari idea it's a little crazy
I think you'll like it though I talked

490
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
I think you'll like it though I talked
 

491
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,670
I think you'll like it though I talked
about this before I want to make a

492
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:40,680
about this before I want to make a
 

493
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,800
about this before I want to make a
shooting range of some sorts in this

494
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:42,810
shooting range of some sorts in this
 

495
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:47,750
shooting range of some sorts in this
game in my world here and I figured out

496
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
game in my world here and I figured out
 

497
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,340
game in my world here and I figured out
how I'm going to do it I I'm pretty sure

498
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,350
how I'm going to do it I I'm pretty sure
 

499
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,100
how I'm going to do it I I'm pretty sure
we're going to do a safari like a nice

500
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,110
we're going to do a safari like a nice
 

501
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,930
we're going to do a safari like a nice
fenced area we're going to do a bunch of

502
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:53,940
fenced area we're going to do a bunch of
 

503
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,180
fenced area we're going to do a bunch of
terraforming get a nice wood land area

504
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,190
terraforming get a nice wood land area
 

505
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,840
terraforming get a nice wood land area
maybe some some water and and all that

506
00:13:59,840 --> 00:13:59,850
maybe some some water and and all that
 

507
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,150
maybe some some water and and all that
kind of stuff I got this big forest area

508
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
kind of stuff I got this big forest area
 

509
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,300
kind of stuff I got this big forest area
here it seems that quite a few elevation

510
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:05,310
here it seems that quite a few elevation
 

511
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,140
here it seems that quite a few elevation
changes to which would be good this this

512
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,150
changes to which would be good this this
 

513
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,210
changes to which would be good this this
would be a nice spot I think this big

514
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:11,220
would be a nice spot I think this big
 

515
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,880
would be a nice spot I think this big
forest area and I'm going to set up

516
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:13,890
forest area and I'm going to set up
 

517
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,800
forest area and I'm going to set up
targets in the forest I think two

518
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:18,810
targets in the forest I think two
 

519
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,300
targets in the forest I think two
different types one type I'm going to

520
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:20,310
different types one type I'm going to
 

521
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:24,530
different types one type I'm going to
have chickens like an aerial targets so

522
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:24,540
have chickens like an aerial targets so
 

523
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,320
have chickens like an aerial targets so
I'll have like a dispenser in the air

524
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,330
I'll have like a dispenser in the air
 

525
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,020
I'll have like a dispenser in the air
with chicken eggs in and that will be

526
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,030
with chicken eggs in and that will be
 

527
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,240
with chicken eggs in and that will be
that will shoot randomly and if a

528
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,250
that will shoot randomly and if a
 

529
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,920
that will shoot randomly and if a
chicken falls down it'll it'll hit a

530
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:33,930
chicken falls down it'll it'll hit a
 

531
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,770
chicken falls down it'll it'll hit a
trip wire and that will will tell the

532
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:36,780
trip wire and that will will tell the
 

533
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,700
trip wire and that will will tell the
system that it should

534
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:37,710
system that it should
 

535
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,470
system that it should
was released and if I don't kill it by

536
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:39,480
was released and if I don't kill it by
 

537
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,270
was released and if I don't kill it by
the time it gets to the bottom it will

538
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:41,280
the time it gets to the bottom it will
 

539
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,560
the time it gets to the bottom it will
hit another tripwire and I lose a point

540
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:45,570
hit another tripwire and I lose a point
 

541
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,890
hit another tripwire and I lose a point
basically if I don't kill it and that's

542
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:48,900
basically if I don't kill it and that's
 

543
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,420
basically if I don't kill it and that's
I'm going to attract that then I have

544
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:50,430
I'm going to attract that then I have
 

545
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,970
I'm going to attract that then I have
another idea though for a boat target

546
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:52,980
another idea though for a boat target
 

547
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,680
another idea though for a boat target
and we're going to try build that I

548
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:54,690
and we're going to try build that I
 

549
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,050
and we're going to try build that I
think it's it's going to be good so I'm

550
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,060
think it's it's going to be good so I'm
 

551
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,460
think it's it's going to be good so I'm
gonna get some stuff together all right

552
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:01,470
gonna get some stuff together all right
 

553
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,320
gonna get some stuff together all right
I got a bunch of stuff together here I

554
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,330
I got a bunch of stuff together here I
 

555
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,930
I got a bunch of stuff together here I
think that's pretty much all little need

556
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:05,940
think that's pretty much all little need
 

557
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,630
think that's pretty much all little need
let's run through this this boat target

558
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:08,640
let's run through this this boat target
 

559
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,770
let's run through this this boat target
idea so what I would like have like a

560
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:12,780
idea so what I would like have like a
 

561
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:21,500
idea so what I would like have like a
dispenser with boats in maybe maybe a

562
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:21,510
dispenser with boats in maybe maybe a
 

563
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,070
dispenser with boats in maybe maybe a
hopper with a chest above to fill it now

564
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:25,080
hopper with a chest above to fill it now
 

565
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,440
hopper with a chest above to fill it now
that won't work we would need to hoppers

566
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,450
that won't work we would need to hoppers
 

567
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,410
that won't work we would need to hoppers
yeah the thing about shooting a boat

568
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:33,420
yeah the thing about shooting a boat
 

569
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,870
yeah the thing about shooting a boat
from a dispenser it's pretty picky it

570
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:35,880
from a dispenser it's pretty picky it
 

571
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,990
from a dispenser it's pretty picky it
seems like you can't just make the boat

572
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,000
seems like you can't just make the boat
 

573
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,300
seems like you can't just make the boat
up here it checks a few conditions I

574
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,310
up here it checks a few conditions I
 

575
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,980
up here it checks a few conditions I
think one of them is it needs water for

576
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:45,990
think one of them is it needs water for
 

577
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,310
think one of them is it needs water for
sure like you have to have water that

578
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:49,320
sure like you have to have water that
 

579
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,140
sure like you have to have water that
the boat will get dispensed into let's

580
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,150
the boat will get dispensed into let's
 

581
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,620
the boat will get dispensed into let's
just set that up that work yeah that

582
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:54,630
just set that up that work yeah that
 

583
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,480
just set that up that work yeah that
works so now there we go we got a boat

584
00:15:59,480 --> 00:15:59,490
works so now there we go we got a boat
 

585
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,010
works so now there we go we got a boat
so that would be our target and of

586
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:01,020
so that would be our target and of
 

587
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,630
so that would be our target and of
course as you know you can destroy a

588
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:02,640
course as you know you can destroy a
 

589
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,010
course as you know you can destroy a
boat with arrows so that's that's how

590
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,020
boat with arrows so that's that's how
 

591
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,500
boat with arrows so that's that's how
that would work and the beauty of it is

592
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:09,510
that would work and the beauty of it is
 

593
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,260
that would work and the beauty of it is
it's a moving target like a horizontal

594
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,270
it's a moving target like a horizontal
 

595
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,670
it's a moving target like a horizontal
moving targets the chileans would be a

596
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
moving targets the chileans would be a
 

597
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,130
moving targets the chileans would be a
vertical moving target okay now the

598
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,140
vertical moving target okay now the
 

599
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,530
vertical moving target okay now the
other question I have is if you have

600
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:21,540
other question I have is if you have
 

601
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,020
other question I have is if you have
something blocking the boat will it

602
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,030
something blocking the boat will it
 

603
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,490
something blocking the boat will it
spawn it does but it will land on it

604
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:28,500
spawn it does but it will land on it
 

605
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,060
spawn it does but it will land on it
okay

606
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,070
okay
 

607
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,640
okay
so ideally we want that area clear so

608
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:31,650
so ideally we want that area clear so
 

609
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:38,060
so ideally we want that area clear so
maybe to hoppers like that and then the

610
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,070
maybe to hoppers like that and then the
 

611
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,700
maybe to hoppers like that and then the
chest will put on top like here for

612
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:43,710
chest will put on top like here for
 

613
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,830
chest will put on top like here for
extra storage that's a trap chest it

614
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:45,840
extra storage that's a trap chest it
 

615
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,760
extra storage that's a trap chest it
seems and then if you put a few boats so

616
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:49,770
seems and then if you put a few boats so
 

617
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,439
seems and then if you put a few boats so
they'll feed into that okay

618
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:51,449
they'll feed into that okay
 

619
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:55,789
they'll feed into that okay
so that's the basic start to it let's

620
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:55,799
so that's the basic start to it let's
 

621
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:00,590
so that's the basic start to it let's
let's go a little deeper now so ideally

622
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:00,600
let's go a little deeper now so ideally
 

623
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,599
let's go a little deeper now so ideally
I want it to work where if I send the

624
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:02,609
I want it to work where if I send the
 

625
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:05,750
I want it to work where if I send the
dispenser or the set up some power it

626
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
dispenser or the set up some power it
 

627
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,659
dispenser or the set up some power it
will have a chance of randomly

628
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:07,669
will have a chance of randomly
 

629
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:10,220
will have a chance of randomly
dispensing a boat I don't want to happen

630
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,230
dispensing a boat I don't want to happen
 

631
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,019
dispensing a boat I don't want to happen
I don't want it to happen at a specific

632
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:12,029
I don't want it to happen at a specific
 

633
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:15,740
I don't want it to happen at a specific
time I want it to be random I think if

634
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:15,750
time I want it to be random I think if
 

635
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:22,519
time I want it to be random I think if
we just do that and then power its needs

636
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:22,529
we just do that and then power its needs
 

637
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:28,720
we just do that and then power its needs
power but the trip books will randomly

638
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:28,730

 

639
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,330

and they'll randomly sorry I'm I'm

640
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:31,340
and they'll randomly sorry I'm I'm
 

641
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,690
and they'll randomly sorry I'm I'm
thinking here

642
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:32,700
thinking here
 

643
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,840
thinking here
they'll randomly make the dispenser

644
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:35,850
they'll randomly make the dispenser
 

645
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:43,460
they'll randomly make the dispenser
shoot if it's being powered okay another

646
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:43,470
shoot if it's being powered okay another
 

647
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,980
shoot if it's being powered okay another
idea like behind the safari I'm going to

648
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:45,990
idea like behind the safari I'm going to
 

649
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,690
idea like behind the safari I'm going to
be riding around in a mine carts

650
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:47,700
be riding around in a mine carts
 

651
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,430
be riding around in a mine carts
there'll be a track throughout it then

652
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
there'll be a track throughout it then
 

653
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,350
there'll be a track throughout it then
they'll be fast sections and slow

654
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
they'll be fast sections and slow
 

655
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,240
they'll be fast sections and slow
sections maybe the cart will stop in

656
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,250
sections maybe the cart will stop in
 

657
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,889
sections maybe the cart will stop in
places for a certain amount of time and

658
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:56,899
places for a certain amount of time and
 

659
00:17:56,899 --> 00:18:00,769
places for a certain amount of time and
and only targets within the area will

660
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:00,779
and only targets within the area will
 

661
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,669
and only targets within the area will
appear randomly then I'll have to shoot

662
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:04,679
appear randomly then I'll have to shoot
 

663
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,120
appear randomly then I'll have to shoot
at okay so then we get we get our moving

664
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,130
at okay so then we get we get our moving
 

665
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,830
at okay so then we get we get our moving
boats hopefully this will activate at

666
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840
boats hopefully this will activate at
 

667
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,980
boats hopefully this will activate at
least once let's let's see let's put a

668
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:15,990
least once let's let's see let's put a
 

669
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,289
least once let's let's see let's put a
couple more trip pokes at least one more

670
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:20,299
couple more trip pokes at least one more
 

671
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,549
couple more trip pokes at least one more
unless that was patched I think it was

672
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
unless that was patched I think it was
 

673
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,919
unless that was patched I think it was
an idea is I'll have to destroy the boat

674
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:27,929
an idea is I'll have to destroy the boat
 

675
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:29,480
an idea is I'll have to destroy the boat
before it gets to a certain point

676
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:29,490
before it gets to a certain point
 

677
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,830
before it gets to a certain point
otherwise it's going to go over pressure

678
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
otherwise it's going to go over pressure
 

679
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,310
otherwise it's going to go over pressure
plates let's just sleep here and if it

680
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,320
plates let's just sleep here and if it
 

681
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,830
plates let's just sleep here and if it
goes over the pressure plate then I lost

682
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
goes over the pressure plate then I lost
 

683
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,190
goes over the pressure plate then I lost
the point basically so if I break it any

684
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
the point basically so if I break it any
 

685
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,210
the point basically so if I break it any
time before that pressure plates it

686
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:47,220
time before that pressure plates it
 

687
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,080
time before that pressure plates it
won't go over top it okay so that

688
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,090
won't go over top it okay so that
 

689
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,539
won't go over top it okay so that
updated that's good to know

690
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:53,549
updated that's good to know
 

691
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,759
updated that's good to know
or learning things here we have to have

692
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:55,769
or learning things here we have to have
 

693
00:18:55,769 --> 00:19:04,090
or learning things here we have to have
ground or weights maybe let's just

694
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:04,100

 

695
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,139

let's see what could we put here I just

696
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:06,149
let's see what could we put here I just
 

697
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:10,609
let's see what could we put here I just
assign or anything would work really we

698
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:10,619
assign or anything would work really we
 

699
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:12,619
assign or anything would work really we
want it to look relatively good too

700
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:12,629
want it to look relatively good too
 

701
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:17,119
want it to look relatively good too
though daddy can't use that could use

702
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,129
though daddy can't use that could use
 

703
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:18,950
though daddy can't use that could use
stone pressure plates to hold water in

704
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
stone pressure plates to hold water in
 

705
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:29,629
stone pressure plates to hold water in
place they won't get activated yeah all

706
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:29,639
place they won't get activated yeah all
 

707
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:31,909
place they won't get activated yeah all
right anyway so go over the pressure

708
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
right anyway so go over the pressure
 

709
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,799
right anyway so go over the pressure
plate and then I got to make it so the

710
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:33,809
plate and then I got to make it so the
 

711
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:36,649
plate and then I got to make it so the
boat gets recycled as well so I want it

712
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:36,659
boat gets recycled as well so I want it
 

713
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:39,049
boat gets recycled as well so I want it
to hit like a cactus at the end of here

714
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:39,059
to hit like a cactus at the end of here
 

715
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,739
to hit like a cactus at the end of here
and go into a hopper or if I destroy it

716
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:42,749
and go into a hopper or if I destroy it
 

717
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,200
and go into a hopper or if I destroy it
then it will wash down to the end and

718
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,210
then it will wash down to the end and
 

719
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,289
then it will wash down to the end and
then come back to the hopper so I'm

720
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:48,299
then come back to the hopper so I'm
 

721
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:49,580
then come back to the hopper so I'm
going to I'm going to play with it a bit

722
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:49,590
going to I'm going to play with it a bit
 

723
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,509
going to I'm going to play with it a bit
off camera here see where we get all

724
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:53,519
off camera here see where we get all
 

725
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,310
off camera here see where we get all
right a couple important discoveries

726
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:55,320
right a couple important discoveries
 

727
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,279
right a couple important discoveries
here half slabs are wonderful they slow

728
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:58,289
here half slabs are wonderful they slow
 

729
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:00,169
here half slabs are wonderful they slow
the boat down so it gives me more time

730
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:00,179
the boat down so it gives me more time
 

731
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,810
the boat down so it gives me more time
to shoot at the target which is a good

732
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:02,820
to shoot at the target which is a good
 

733
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,330
to shoot at the target which is a good
thing if I want and it also holds the

734
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:05,340
thing if I want and it also holds the
 

735
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,310
thing if I want and it also holds the
water in place cactus does not work that

736
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
water in place cactus does not work that
 

737
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,049
water in place cactus does not work that
boat just got randomly dispensed it

738
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:12,059
boat just got randomly dispensed it
 

739
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:16,539
boat just got randomly dispensed it
breaks the boat into planks and sticks

740
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:16,549
breaks the boat into planks and sticks
 

741
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:22,639
breaks the boat into planks and sticks
again which is not going to work so yeah

742
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:22,649
again which is not going to work so yeah
 

743
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:25,159
again which is not going to work so yeah
let's see but when I broke it with the

744
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:25,169
let's see but when I broke it with the
 

745
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:29,299
let's see but when I broke it with the
arrow I'm pretty sure it gave us the

746
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:29,309
arrow I'm pretty sure it gave us the
 

747
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:33,979
arrow I'm pretty sure it gave us the
boat which whoops well that's one way to

748
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:33,989
boat which whoops well that's one way to
 

749
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:37,519
boat which whoops well that's one way to
do it yeah that gives us a boat if we

750
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:37,529
do it yeah that gives us a boat if we
 

751
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:41,239
do it yeah that gives us a boat if we
break it I'm going to try dispenser with

752
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:41,249
break it I'm going to try dispenser with
 

753
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:44,090
break it I'm going to try dispenser with
an arrow and I think that will still

754
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,100
an arrow and I think that will still
 

755
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,399
an arrow and I think that will still
break it into planks if I was to guess

756
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:46,409
break it into planks if I was to guess
 

757
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:51,379
break it into planks if I was to guess
that's what it should do but maybe maybe

758
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:51,389
that's what it should do but maybe maybe
 

759
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:56,299
that's what it should do but maybe maybe
it gives it back to us okay this is

760
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:56,309
it gives it back to us okay this is
 

761
00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:01,330
it gives it back to us okay this is
arrow in a dispenser test

762
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:01,340

 

763
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:06,249

okay so boats in here let's release it

764
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:06,259
okay so boats in here let's release it
 

765
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:08,779
okay so boats in here let's release it
it'll hit the pressure plates and that

766
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:08,789
it'll hit the pressure plates and that
 

767
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,789
it'll hit the pressure plates and that
will shoot the boat and it breaks it

768
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:10,799
will shoot the boat and it breaks it
 

769
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,739
will shoot the boat and it breaks it
into oh wait a minute

770
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:12,749
into oh wait a minute
 

771
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:15,399
into oh wait a minute
it broke before it even that shot I

772
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:15,409
it broke before it even that shot I
 

773
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:21,259
it broke before it even that shot I
think you can only shot once right all

774
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:21,269
think you can only shot once right all
 

775
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:22,549
think you can only shot once right all
right just to be sure we're only going

776
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:22,559
right just to be sure we're only going
 

777
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,080
right just to be sure we're only going
to put one arrow in this time we're

778
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,090
to put one arrow in this time we're
 

779
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,070
to put one arrow in this time we're
going to try that again that was a

780
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,080
going to try that again that was a
 

781
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,879
going to try that again that was a
little weird I think it crashed crashing

782
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:28,889
little weird I think it crashed crashing
 

783
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:30,470
little weird I think it crashed crashing
it deuce blanks so we can't do it that

784
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,480
it deuce blanks so we can't do it that
 

785
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:37,549
it deuce blanks so we can't do it that
way either and I'm just seeing lava with

786
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:37,559
way either and I'm just seeing lava with
 

787
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:43,729
way either and I'm just seeing lava with
your planks as well yeah I think it's

788
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:43,739
your planks as well yeah I think it's
 

789
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:47,869
your planks as well yeah I think it's
shot oh okay let's just cut this off for

790
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:47,879
shot oh okay let's just cut this off for
 

791
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:54,169
shot oh okay let's just cut this off for
now and we'll just manually do it I'm

792
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:54,179
now and we'll just manually do it I'm
 

793
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,379
now and we'll just manually do it I'm
pretty sure anything that the player

794
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:56,389
pretty sure anything that the player
 

795
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:58,820
pretty sure anything that the player
does will give you the boat back but

796
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:58,830
does will give you the boat back but
 

797
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,249
does will give you the boat back but
anything natural you won't get it back

798
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:01,259
anything natural you won't get it back
 

799
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:08,619
anything natural you won't get it back
oh and it takes more than one shot - you

800
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:08,629

 

801
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:14,739

won - oh come on stop regen health

802
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:14,749
won - oh come on stop regen health
 

803
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:19,700
won - oh come on stop regen health
stinking boat all right all right all

804
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:19,710
stinking boat all right all right all
 

805
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,830
stinking boat all right all right all
right fine

806
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:20,840
right fine
 

807
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,919
right fine
we will put down a lever just to try

808
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:24,929
we will put down a lever just to try
 

809
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:30,589
we will put down a lever just to try
this oh it does give a boat oh so we

810
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:30,599
this oh it does give a boat oh so we
 

811
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:35,299
this oh it does give a boat oh so we
would need to shoot it twice but that's

812
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:35,309
would need to shoot it twice but that's
 

813
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:37,399
would need to shoot it twice but that's
one way we could recycle it if if we

814
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:37,409
one way we could recycle it if if we
 

815
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:41,299
one way we could recycle it if if we
care be a lot easier not to recycle and

816
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:41,309
care be a lot easier not to recycle and
 

817
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:46,639
care be a lot easier not to recycle and
just have a big buffer here we are going

818
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:46,649
just have a big buffer here we are going
 

819
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:48,049
just have a big buffer here we are going
to do a lava test because I am curious

820
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:48,059
to do a lava test because I am curious
 

821
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,570
to do a lava test because I am curious
that's I didn't think that would give us

822
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:50,580
that's I didn't think that would give us
 

823
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,869
that's I didn't think that would give us
a boat but it did so maybe this will - I

824
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:55,879

 

825
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:58,639

can't place it there let's put that

826
00:22:58,639 --> 00:22:58,649
can't place it there let's put that
 

827
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:02,800
can't place it there let's put that
there ah

828
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:02,810

 

829
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:07,850

really hmm that's the easy way that's

830
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:07,860
really hmm that's the easy way that's
 

831
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,330
really hmm that's the easy way that's
what we're doing I decided to do the

832
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:11,340
what we're doing I decided to do the
 

833
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,810
what we're doing I decided to do the
cactus test again because I figured the

834
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:14,820
cactus test again because I figured the
 

835
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,030
cactus test again because I figured the
reason it broke into planks before is

836
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,040
reason it broke into planks before is
 

837
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,530
reason it broke into planks before is
because it actually crashed on the

838
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:18,540
because it actually crashed on the
 

839
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,570
because it actually crashed on the
cactus not because the cactus gave us

840
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:20,580
cactus not because the cactus gave us
 

841
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:26,360
cactus not because the cactus gave us
that so turns out that's what it is we

842
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:26,370
that so turns out that's what it is we
 

843
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,440
that so turns out that's what it is we
got a boat there so if it crashes it

844
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:30,450
got a boat there so if it crashes it
 

845
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,660
got a boat there so if it crashes it
gives us planks but any other method of

846
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:32,670
gives us planks but any other method of
 

847
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,430
gives us planks but any other method of
destroying a boat seems to just give the

848
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:34,440
destroying a boat seems to just give the
 

849
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,320
destroying a boat seems to just give the
boat itself from what I can tell that's

850
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:36,330
boat itself from what I can tell that's
 

851
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,600
boat itself from what I can tell that's
that's my Jes of how it works since

852
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:41,610
that's my Jes of how it works since
 

853
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,460
that's my Jes of how it works since
we're doing the Safari thing these slabs

854
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:43,470
we're doing the Safari thing these slabs
 

855
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,010
we're doing the Safari thing these slabs
will most likely be some type of wood

856
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,020
will most likely be some type of wood
 

857
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,990
will most likely be some type of wood
that make it blend in a little better I

858
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,000
that make it blend in a little better I
 

859
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,180
that make it blend in a little better I
want to show you this so like I have the

860
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,190
want to show you this so like I have the
 

861
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,800
want to show you this so like I have the
slabs the full length here and that

862
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:51,810
slabs the full length here and that
 

863
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,200
slabs the full length here and that
makes a huge difference on the timing so

864
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,210
makes a huge difference on the timing so
 

865
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,890
makes a huge difference on the timing so
we'll have a lot of control how long we

866
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:57,900
we'll have a lot of control how long we
 

867
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,840
we'll have a lot of control how long we
want the target to be random dispense oh

868
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:01,850
want the target to be random dispense oh
 

869
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,700
want the target to be random dispense oh
they're going to collide but yeah it

870
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:04,710
they're going to collide but yeah it
 

871
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,400
they're going to collide but yeah it
like up to like this point they'll ride

872
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,410
like up to like this point they'll ride
 

873
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,140
like up to like this point they'll ride
the water but then they they settle on

874
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,150
the water but then they they settle on
 

875
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,700
the water but then they they settle on
the half slabs and the water slowly

876
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:10,710
the half slabs and the water slowly
 

877
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,580
the half slabs and the water slowly
pushes them with a lot of friction and

878
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:13,590
pushes them with a lot of friction and
 

879
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,060
pushes them with a lot of friction and
it takes a long time for it to drop so

880
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,070
it takes a long time for it to drop so
 

881
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,040
it takes a long time for it to drop so
we can make a quick target or slow

882
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,050
we can make a quick target or slow
 

883
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,500
we can make a quick target or slow
targets it's a little glitchy at the end

884
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:21,510
targets it's a little glitchy at the end
 

885
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:27,110
targets it's a little glitchy at the end
though but then it falls down and we can

886
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,120
though but then it falls down and we can
 

887
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,200
though but then it falls down and we can
drop it on a pressure plate or through

888
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,210
drop it on a pressure plate or through
 

889
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,870
drop it on a pressure plate or through
tripwire and maybe into a recycler if we

890
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
tripwire and maybe into a recycler if we
 

891
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,150
tripwire and maybe into a recycler if we
want to do that if we don't do the

892
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,160
want to do that if we don't do the
 

893
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,320
want to do that if we don't do the
recycler thing we can have a comparator

894
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:39,330
recycler thing we can have a comparator
 

895
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,440
recycler thing we can have a comparator
on one of these hoppers and then we're

896
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:42,450
on one of these hoppers and then we're
 

897
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,020
on one of these hoppers and then we're
free to cover this up and then that can

898
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,030
free to cover this up and then that can
 

899
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,720
free to cover this up and then that can
power redstone lamps or whatever when

900
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:47,730
power redstone lamps or whatever when
 

901
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,490
power redstone lamps or whatever when
the lamp goes off that means there's

902
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:49,500
the lamp goes off that means there's
 

903
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,390
the lamp goes off that means there's
like between 0 and 15 or whatever boats

904
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:53,400
like between 0 and 15 or whatever boats
 

905
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,190
like between 0 and 15 or whatever boats
left in the system and we got to refill

906
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
left in the system and we got to refill
 

907
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,790
left in the system and we got to refill
it so it would be a good indicator light

908
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:00,800

 

909
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,700

yeah I think this is a good good idea

910
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:03,710
yeah I think this is a good good idea
 

911
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,330
yeah I think this is a good good idea
should be fun

912
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:05,340
should be fun
 

913
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,010
should be fun
I don't know when we're going to do it

914
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,020
I don't know when we're going to do it
 

915
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,730
I don't know when we're going to do it
I'm still focusing on Wilson but it's

916
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:10,740
I'm still focusing on Wilson but it's
 

917
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,380
I'm still focusing on Wilson but it's
going to be a lot of terraforming if we

918
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:12,390
going to be a lot of terraforming if we
 

919
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,410
going to be a lot of terraforming if we
do it it'll be a good mix of like

920
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:15,420
do it it'll be a good mix of like
 

921
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,100
do it it'll be a good mix of like
redstone

922
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,110
redstone
 

923
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,100
redstone
own in terraforming and decorating will

924
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,110
own in terraforming and decorating will
 

925
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,710
own in terraforming and decorating will
probably do other stuff in the thing too

926
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:21,720
probably do other stuff in the thing too
 

927
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,570
probably do other stuff in the thing too
like have little structures just for

928
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:23,580
like have little structures just for
 

929
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:28,840
like have little structures just for
looks as well and that sort of thing

930
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:28,850

 

931
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,190

well that's going to be about it for

932
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,200
well that's going to be about it for
 

933
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,110
well that's going to be about it for
today everyone but I did pick out the

934
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,120
today everyone but I did pick out the
 

935
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,150
today everyone but I did pick out the
comment as usual and this is what it

936
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:35,160
comment as usual and this is what it
 

937
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,630
comment as usual and this is what it
says

938
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:35,640
says
 

939
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,330
says
ESO do you keep your video files of the

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,610
online storage after a while do you know
what other people do differently good

950
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:52,620
what other people do differently good
 

951
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,159
what other people do differently good
question good question I do have a
