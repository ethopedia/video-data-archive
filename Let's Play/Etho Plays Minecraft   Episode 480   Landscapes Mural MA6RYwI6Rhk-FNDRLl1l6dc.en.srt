the fat rat we

40
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
the fat rat we

until today
so i replaced all the bud switches we

48
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
so i replaced all the bud switches we
 

49
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,869
so i replaced all the bud switches we
had here with observer blocks

50
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
had here with observer blocks
 

51
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,110
had here with observer blocks
and they just have a wire connecting

52
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
and they just have a wire connecting
 

53
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,990
and they just have a wire connecting
them all together

54
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
them all together
 

55
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,709
them all together
on both sides runs down to the note

56
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
on both sides runs down to the note
 

57
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,670
on both sides runs down to the note
blocks there

58
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
blocks there
 

59
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,869
blocks there
so if we grow a mushroom let's try this

60
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
so if we grow a mushroom let's try this
 

61
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,350
so if we grow a mushroom let's try this
out

62
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360

 

63
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:16,950

it worked before hopefully it does now

64
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:16,960

 

65
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,390

so it's working pretty good i would say

66
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400

 

67
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,910

and they work separate from each other

68
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
and they work separate from each other
 

69
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,990
and they work separate from each other
so even though this observer block was

70
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
so even though this observer block was
 

71
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,870
so even though this observer block was
triggered

72
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
triggered
 

73
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,590
triggered
it uh still played the song this after

74
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
it uh still played the song this after
 

75
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,190
it uh still played the song this after
we grew the second mushroom so they

76
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
we grew the second mushroom so they
 

77
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,789
we grew the second mushroom so they
didn't like cancel each other out

78
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
didn't like cancel each other out
 

79
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,510
didn't like cancel each other out
and if we remove the mushroom block here

80
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
and if we remove the mushroom block here
 

81
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,830
and if we remove the mushroom block here
in here it it untriggers it doesn't play

82
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
in here it it untriggers it doesn't play
 

83
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,590
in here it it untriggers it doesn't play
the song when you remove it though

84
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
the song when you remove it though
 

85
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,510
the song when you remove it though
otherwise it'd be too much music a

86
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
otherwise it'd be too much music a
 

87
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,749
otherwise it'd be too much music a
little bit of music is good but too much

88
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
little bit of music is good but too much
 

89
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,030
little bit of music is good but too much

00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
more of this green you won't see as much
 

507
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,870
more of this green you won't see as much
of it once

508
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
of it once
 

509
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,750
of it once
once they're in they'll block it right

510
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
once they're in they'll block it right
 

511
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,230
once they're in they'll block it right
so

512
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
so
 

513
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,389
so
yeah i think it's an improvement

514
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
yeah i think it's an improvement
 

515
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,990
yeah i think it's an improvement
personally i know some of you are not

516
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
personally i know some of you are not
 

517
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,190
personally i know some of you are not
gonna like it but it adds color it adds

518
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
gonna like it but it adds color it adds
 

519
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,949
gonna like it but it adds color it adds
variation

520
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
variation
 

521
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,190
variation
and i don't think it looks super bad

522
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200

 

523
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,829

it's the best i could do guys let's move

524
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
it's the best i could do guys let's move
 

525
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,389
it's the best i could do guys let's move
on

526
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
on
 

527
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,069
on
okay so we're gonna go down to the man

528
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
okay so we're gonna go down to the man
 

529
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,990
okay so we're gonna go down to the man
cave now there is this

530
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
cave now there is this
 

531
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,710
cave now there is this
little sliver of a problem that has

532
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
little sliver of a problem that has
 

533
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,829
little sliver of a problem that has
shown up

534
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
shown up
 

535
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,230
shown up
because i i worked on that roof for the

536
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
because i i worked on that roof for the
 

537
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,230
because i i worked on that roof for the
tree farm

538
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
tree farm
 

539
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,110
tree farm
or ceiling ceiling is the correct term a

540
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
or ceiling ceiling is the correct term a
 

541
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,350
or ceiling ceiling is the correct term a
few episodes ago we finished this up

542
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
few episodes ago we finished this up
 

543
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,269
few episodes ago we finished this up
now we have this little three wide gap

544
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
now we have this little three wide gap
 

545
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,509
now we have this little three wide gap
here between this part of the man cave

546
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
here between this part of the man cave
 

547
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,949
here between this part of the man cave
and this part of the man cave

548
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
and this part of the man cave
 

549
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,829
and this part of the man cave
we could leave it as stone wouldn't be

550
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
we could leave it as stone wouldn't be
 

551
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,590
we could leave it as stone wouldn't be
terrible

552
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
terrible
 

553
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,509
terrible
but i think we'll do what we do in a lot

554
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
but i think we'll do what we do in a lot
 

555
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,750
but i think we'll do what we do in a lot
of parts where we put in these jungle

556
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
of parts where we put in these jungle
 

557
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,949
of parts where we put in these jungle
leaves

558
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
leaves
 

559
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,990
leaves
just to to give it that nice green feel

560
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
just to to give it that nice green feel
 

561
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,870
just to to give it that nice green feel
you know

562
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
you know
 

563
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,630
you know
so let's try that out and

564
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
so let's try that out and
 

565
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,389
so let's try that out and
i think we are gonna have to

566
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399

 

567
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,829

how are we gonna position this i think

568
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:13,839
how are we gonna position this i think
 

569
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,150
how are we gonna position this i think
we'll put green leaves there

570
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
we'll put green leaves there
 

571
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,509
we'll put green leaves there
should we do staircase style one there

572
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
should we do staircase style one there
 

573
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,430
should we do staircase style one there
one there

574
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
one there
 

575
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,110
one there
and we might even try to do a little bit

576
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
and we might even try to do a little bit
 

577
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,829
and we might even try to do a little bit
of droopy leaf leafage

578
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
of droopy leaf leafage
 

579
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,910
of droopy leaf leafage
could look good too i'm gonna change out

580
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
could look good too i'm gonna change out
 

581
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,190
could look good too i'm gonna change out
a bunch of this and just see what it

582
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
a bunch of this and just see what it
 

583
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,389
a bunch of this and just see what it
looks like i think

584
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
looks like i think
 

585
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,310
looks like i think
so have it running all along here

586
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320

 

587
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,190

and all along here and maybe put some

588
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
and all along here and maybe put some
 

589
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:44,069
and all along here and maybe put some
lights behind it too

590
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079

 

591
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,910

okay so that's what it looks like right

592
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
okay so that's what it looks like right
 

593
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,910
okay so that's what it looks like right
now with no lighting behind it

594
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
now with no lighting behind it
 

595
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,590
now with no lighting behind it
and now that's what it looks like with

596
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
and now that's what it looks like with
 

597
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,110
and now that's what it looks like with
some hidden lighting it's a little bit

598
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
some hidden lighting it's a little bit
 

599
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,670
some hidden lighting it's a little bit
brighter

600
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
brighter
 

601
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,069
brighter
a little bit nicer i think you know what

602
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
a little bit nicer i think you know what
 

603
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,069
a little bit nicer i think you know what
i just realized

604
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
i just realized
 

605
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,110
i just realized
this is odd number right you see it's

606
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
this is odd number right you see it's
 

607
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,389
this is odd number right you see it's
three blocks there

608
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
three blocks there
 

609
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,509
three blocks there
this is odd number over here and then

610
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:05,519
this is odd number over here and then
 

611
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,030
this is odd number over here and then
ah this should be three blocks wide here

612
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
ah this should be three blocks wide here
 

613
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,629
ah this should be three blocks wide here
it's two blocks wide i i've always been

614
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
it's two blocks wide i i've always been
 

615
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,829
it's two blocks wide i i've always been
a great builder guys

616
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
a great builder guys
 

617
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,750
a great builder guys
always yep that's gonna bug me

618
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
always yep that's gonna bug me
 

619
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,069
always yep that's gonna bug me
let's not think about it let's not think

620
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
let's not think about it let's not think
 

621
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,910
let's not think about it let's not think
about it what i'm gonna do in a few

622
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
about it what i'm gonna do in a few
 

623
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,310
about it what i'm gonna do in a few
places here is try add some oak planks

624
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
places here is try add some oak planks
 

625
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,670
places here is try add some oak planks
as well just to break up the

626
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
as well just to break up the
 

627
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,110
as well just to break up the
total straightness of this centered

628
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
total straightness of this centered
 

629
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,190
total straightness of this centered
of course so this is the very center

630
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
of course so this is the very center
 

631
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,269
of course so this is the very center
maybe we could try a few blocks out

632
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:35,279
maybe we could try a few blocks out
 

633
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,590
maybe we could try a few blocks out
let's kind of make it do something like

634
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600
let's kind of make it do something like
 

635
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,550
let's kind of make it do something like
that

636
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
that
 

637
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,310
that
maybe i should use some stairs

638
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320

 

639
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,590

oh okay guys so check it out

640
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
oh okay guys so check it out
 

641
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,470
oh okay guys so check it out
we uh we got a solution here i think i

642
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
we uh we got a solution here i think i
 

643
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,389
we uh we got a solution here i think i
did try out the oak bracing

644
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,399
did try out the oak bracing
 

645
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,310
did try out the oak bracing
like the oak slabs and stairs but it

646
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
like the oak slabs and stairs but it
 

647
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,550
like the oak slabs and stairs but it
stood out so much it really didn't look

648
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
stood out so much it really didn't look
 

649
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,430
stood out so much it really didn't look
too good

650
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
too good
 

651
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,829
too good
i looked out of place so instead i tried

652
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
i looked out of place so instead i tried
 

653
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,670
i looked out of place so instead i tried
the droopy leaf idea

654
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
the droopy leaf idea
 

655
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,230
the droopy leaf idea
and i like this a lot personally i think

656
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
and i like this a lot personally i think
 

657
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,190
and i like this a lot personally i think
that's good

658
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
that's good
 

659
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,590
that's good
we had this very long straight section

660
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
we had this very long straight section
 

661
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,269
we had this very long straight section
and this breaks it up like it has all

662
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
and this breaks it up like it has all
 

663
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,949
and this breaks it up like it has all
these height variations you can't really

664
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
these height variations you can't really
 

665
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,710
these height variations you can't really
tell now

666
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
tell now
 

667
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,990
tell now
how straight this was before or still is

668
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
how straight this was before or still is
 

669
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,629
how straight this was before or still is
this is

670
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
this is
 

671
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,750
this is
kind of blocked by the leaves um also

672
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760

760
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
all right so there's going to be a
 

761
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,910
all right so there's going to be a
foreground layer here

762
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
foreground layer here
 

763
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:11,829
foreground layer here
background and then sky

764
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:11,839

 

765
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,590

okay let's uh let's do it over here

766
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
okay let's uh let's do it over here
 

767
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,269
okay let's uh let's do it over here
instead of over there because our

768
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
instead of over there because our
 

769
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,990
instead of over there because our
our haste beacon doesn't reach that far

770
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
our haste beacon doesn't reach that far
 

771
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,629
our haste beacon doesn't reach that far
uh

772

bad i i like that
i would be happy if the whole wall was

780
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
i would be happy if the whole wall was
 

781
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,230
i would be happy if the whole wall was
that i think i could get used to it

782
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240
that i think i could get used to it
 

783
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,150
that i think i could get used to it
but we're going to try to add more to it

784
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
but we're going to try to add more to it
 

785
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,990
but we're going to try to add more to it
make it look a little bit cooler

786
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
make it look a little bit cooler
 

787
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,509
make it look a little bit cooler
uh so we want to

788
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519

 

789
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,710

do like landscapes if we just use grass

790
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:38,720
do like landscapes if we just use grass
 

791
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,430
do like landscapes if we just use grass
blocks

792
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
blocks
 

793
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,629
blocks
to represent grass it doesn't look good

794
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
to represent grass it doesn't look good
 

795
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,150
to represent grass it doesn't look good
from the side right so we're going to

796
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
from the side right so we're going to
 

797
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,350
from the side right so we're going to
use lime clay

798
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360
use lime clay
 

799
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,150
use lime clay
for grass and stuff so this would be

800
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
for grass and stuff so this would be
 

801
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,350
for grass and stuff so this would be
i don't know if this is going to look

802
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
i don't know if this is going to look
 

803
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,350
i don't know if this is going to look
good either guys i'm just trying this

804
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
good either guys i'm just trying this
 

805
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,150
good either guys i'm just trying this
so we'll try it out then we'll make some

806
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
so we'll try it out then we'll make some
 

807
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,870
so we'll try it out then we'll make some
changes and

808
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880
changes and
 

809
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,110
changes and
and stuff and until we find something we

810
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
and stuff and until we find something we
 

811
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,949
and stuff and until we find something we
like

812
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
like
 

813
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,389
like
but that would represent like totally

814
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
but that would represent like totally
 

815
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,189
but that would represent like totally
flat grass right there but we'll add

816
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
flat grass right there but we'll add
 

817
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,870
flat grass right there but we'll add
things like hills in the background and

818
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
things like hills in the background and
 

819
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,269
things like hills in the background and
stuff too so maybe

820
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
stuff too so maybe
 

821
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,189
stuff too so maybe
in places the terrain's a bit rougher

822
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
in places the terrain's a bit rougher
 

823
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,749
in places the terrain's a bit rougher
we'll make mountains and stuff

824
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
we'll make mountains and stuff
 

825
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,790
we'll make mountains and stuff
maybe we'll make a desert area

826
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
maybe we'll make a desert area
 

827
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,470
maybe we'll make a desert area
snowy areas you know

828
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
snowy areas you know
 

829
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,990
snowy areas you know
we can even add more to the foreground

830
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000
we can even add more to the foreground
 

831
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,509
we can even add more to the foreground
and stuff and hopefully that'll look

832
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
and stuff and hopefully that'll look
 

833
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,269
and stuff and hopefully that'll look
cool

834
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
cool
 

835
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,030
cool

836
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
add some clouds lots of little things
 

837
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,269
add some clouds lots of little things
like that we'll probably

838
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
like that we'll probably
 

839
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,710
like that we'll probably
hopefully look neat

840
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720

 

841
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,230

all right looks like i threw some blocks

842
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
all right looks like i threw some blocks
 

843
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,629
all right looks like i threw some blocks
against the wall

844
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639
against the wall
 

845
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,670
against the wall
okay what about trees let's try trees so

846
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
okay what about trees let's try trees so
 

847
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,470
okay what about trees let's try trees so
let's say

848
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
let's say
 

849
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,269
let's say
we we wanted to make a forest right we

850
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
we we wanted to make a forest right we
 

851
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,470
we we wanted to make a forest right we
could put down some some logs

852
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
could put down some some logs
 

853
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,870
could put down some some logs
and then some leaves make a round tree

854
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:54,880
and then some leaves make a round tree
 

855
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,990
and then some leaves make a round tree
or something

856
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
or something
 

857
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,310
or something
actually won't get look good if we put

858
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
actually won't get look good if we put
 

859
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,910
actually won't get look good if we put
leaves on the side of it we'll want to

860
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
leaves on the side of it we'll want to
 

861
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,990
leaves on the side of it we'll want to
put it above

862
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
put it above
 

863
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,230
put it above
the the wood here we'll do a three by

864
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
the the wood here we'll do a three by
 

865
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,590
the the wood here we'll do a three by
three tree

866
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
three tree
 

867
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,270
three tree
or something how about that that would

868
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
or something how about that that would
 

869
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,110
or something how about that that would
look good right

870
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120

 

871
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,909

sure and then we could have one in the

872
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
sure and then we could have one in the
 

873
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,270
sure and then we could have one in the
background

874
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280

 

875
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,789

uh-huh uh-huh this is a process guys

876
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
uh-huh uh-huh this is a process guys
 

877
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:28,710
uh-huh uh-huh this is a process guys
it's not gonna be perfect right away

878
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:28,720

 

879
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,070

well you know what guys i had my doubts

880
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
well you know what guys i had my doubts
 

881
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,070
well you know what guys i had my doubts
at first i wasn't sure this was gonna

882
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
at first i wasn't sure this was gonna
 

883
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,549
at first i wasn't sure this was gonna
really work but i think this looks

884
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,559
really work but i think this looks
 

885
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,150
really work but i think this looks
pretty cool honestly i think that's

886
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
pretty cool honestly i think that's
 

887
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,510
pretty cool honestly i think that's
pretty unique

888
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
pretty unique
 

889
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,909
pretty unique
i'm happy with that the only thing that

890
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,310
in there and all kinds of things
this is probably the best i can do um

908
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
this is probably the best i can do um
 

909
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,630
this is probably the best i can do um
but yeah i think that's neat i actually

910
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
but yeah i think that's neat i actually
 

911
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,669
but yeah i think that's neat i actually
checked and everything is

912
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
checked and everything is
 

913
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,190
checked and everything is
like mob proof right now like the

914
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
like mob proof right now like the
 

915
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,830
like mob proof right now like the
lighting is okay as it is

916
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
lighting is okay as it is
 

917
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,789
lighting is okay as it is
and uh we might continue here and build

918
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799
and uh we might continue here and build
 

919
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,350
and uh we might continue here and build
like a desert themed area maybe a forest

920
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
like a desert themed area maybe a forest
 

921
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,830
like a desert themed area maybe a forest
or

922
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
or
 

923
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,270
or
cold snow and stuff

924
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
cold snow and stuff
 

925
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,549
cold snow and stuff
kind of area glaciers it's really easy

926
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
kind of area glaciers it's really easy
 

927
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,870
kind of area glaciers it's really easy
to do this too i was surprised

928
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
to do this too i was surprised
 

929
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,710
to do this too i was surprised
like you don't need to do much just a

930
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
like you don't need to do much just a
 

931
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,549
like you don't need to do much just a
couple blocks here and there and

932
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
couple blocks here and there and
 

933
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,350
couple blocks here and there and
it makes a huge difference i wanted to

934
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,360
it makes a huge difference i wanted to
 

935
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,190
it makes a huge difference i wanted to
try with you guys i had an idea of how

936
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
try with you guys i had an idea of how
 

937
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,110
try with you guys i had an idea of how
you could maybe do a lake

938
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
you could maybe do a lake
 

939
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,870
you could maybe do a lake
so water should flow towards the hole

940
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
so water should flow towards the hole
 

941
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,870
so water should flow towards the hole
right we're gonna put some lighting

942
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
right we're gonna put some lighting
 

943
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,750
right we're gonna put some lighting
hidden lighting here

944
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
hidden lighting here
 

945
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,270
hidden lighting here
like so and then if we put water

946
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
like so and then if we put water
 

947
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,909
like so and then if we put water
right here it should flow towards that

948
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
right here it should flow towards that
 

949
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,830
right here it should flow towards that
hole

950
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
hole
 

951
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,510
hole
oh did that stupid enderman there was an

952
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
oh did that stupid enderman there was an
 

953
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,789
oh did that stupid enderman there was an
enderman walking around i think he stole

954
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:54,799
enderman walking around i think he stole
 

955
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,190
enderman walking around i think he stole
my sandblock

956
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
my sandblock
 

957
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,750
my sandblock
all right is this going to look like a

958
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
all right is this going to look like a
 

959
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,590
all right is this going to look like a
lake

960
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
lake
 

961
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,950
lake
question let's take a step back

962
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:06,960

 

963
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,390

maybe i think or a river could that pass

964
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
maybe i think or a river could that pass
 

965
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,310
maybe i think or a river could that pass
as a river maybe

966
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
as a river maybe
 

967
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,150
as a river maybe
i could see it you know it would help to

968
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
i could see it you know it would help to
 

969
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,669
i could see it you know it would help to
sell it though is if we put a boat in

970
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:15,679
sell it though is if we put a boat in
 

971
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,510
sell it though is if we put a boat in
there let's try put a boat in

972
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
there let's try put a boat in
 

973
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,029
there let's try put a boat in
see if it'll stay in place or if we can

974
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,039
see if it'll stay in place or if we can
 

975
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,990
see if it'll stay in place or if we can
even put it down

976
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
even put it down
 

977
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,710
even put it down
all right oh yeah there it goes water

978
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
all right oh yeah there it goes water
 

979
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,070
all right oh yeah there it goes water
kind of pulls it in

980
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080

 

981
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,590

uh-huh all right it's a little strange

982
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
uh-huh all right it's a little strange
 

983
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:31,990
uh-huh all right it's a little strange
but

984
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,000
but
 

985
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,510
but
i do really like this i think it's cool

986
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
i do really like this i think it's cool
 

987
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,430
i do really like this i think it's cool
let's look from a distance here

988
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
let's look from a distance here
 

989
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,350
let's look from a distance here
this is meant to be background though

990
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
this is meant to be background though
 

991
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,710
this is meant to be background though
like we're gonna have the trees growing

992
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
like we're gonna have the trees growing
 

993
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,310
like we're gonna have the trees growing
in here so you won't really see it too

994
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
in here so you won't really see it too
 

995
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,190
in here so you won't really see it too
much

996
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
much
 

997
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,190
much
it doesn't need a lot of detail

998
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200

 

999
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,669

but i'm happy with that so far let me

not good enough we need faster i think
 

1165
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,990
not good enough we need faster i think
so i think we can use hopper minecarts

1166
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,000
so i think we can use hopper minecarts
 

1167
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,549
so i think we can use hopper minecarts
to get it out quicker

1168
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559
to get it out quicker
 

1169
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,669
to get it out quicker
and hopefully spread it uh

1170
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
and hopefully spread it uh
 

1171
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,190
and hopefully spread it uh
how how do we want this to work exactly

1172
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
how how do we want this to work exactly
 

1173
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,070
how how do we want this to work exactly
i'm not sure

1174
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,080
i'm not sure
 

1175
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,590
i'm not sure
i haven't like pre-built this or

1176
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:57,600
i haven't like pre-built this or
 

1177
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,590
i haven't like pre-built this or
anything

1178
00:22:59,590 --> 00:22:59,600
anything
 

1179
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,789
anything
but we can stack multiples

1180
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:02,799
but we can stack multiples
 

1181
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,630
but we can stack multiples
within the same block and it should

1182
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
within the same block and it should
 

1183
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,549
within the same block and it should
still pull out two oh

1184
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
still pull out two oh
 

1185
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,669
still pull out two oh
wait a minute i just learned something

1186
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:11,679
wait a minute i just learned something
 

1187
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,710
wait a minute i just learned something
new i did not know these were so fast

1188
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
new i did not know these were so fast
 

1189
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,470
new i did not know these were so fast
has it always been like that

1190
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480

 

1191
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,669

okay that's interesting that is very

1192
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
okay that's interesting that is very
 

1193
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,310
okay that's interesting that is very
interesting

1194
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320

 

1195
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,310

okay so one of the big problems we're

1196
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
okay so one of the big problems we're
 

1197
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,669
okay so one of the big problems we're
probably gonna have with this

1198
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
probably gonna have with this
 

1199
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,909
probably gonna have with this
is how do we split the mine carts apart

1200
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:31,919
is how do we split the mine carts apart
 

1201
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:32,710
is how do we split the mine carts apart
like if they

1202
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:32,720
like if they
 

1203
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,350
like if they
are all picking up items out of that

1204
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,360
are all picking up items out of that
 

1205
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,149
are all picking up items out of that
chest

1206
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
chest
 

1207
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,669
chest
we don't want to just use one hopper

1208
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
we don't want to just use one hopper
 

1209
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,669
we don't want to just use one hopper
minecart because it would take forever

1210
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:39,679
minecart because it would take forever
 

1211
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,669
minecart because it would take forever
for it to go from

1212
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679

 

1213
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,350

over 64 furnaces you know we only wanted

1214
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,360
over 64 furnaces you know we only wanted
 

1215
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:47,990
over 64 furnaces you know we only wanted
to deliver

1216
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,000
to deliver
 

1217
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,230
to deliver
one item to each furnace as it goes by

1218
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240

 

1219
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,870

so we'd probably want to use at least

1220
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880
so we'd probably want to use at least
 

1221
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,909
so we'd probably want to use at least
four maybe eight hopper mine carts

1222
00:23:57,909 --> 00:23:57,919
four maybe eight hopper mine carts
 

1223
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,190
four maybe eight hopper mine carts
to deliver the items so this is possibly

1224
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
to deliver the items so this is possibly
 

1225
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,990
to deliver the items so this is possibly
a way we could

1226
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
a way we could
 

1227
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,029
a way we could
easily do four let's see if it'll pick

1228
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:05,039
easily do four let's see if it'll pick
 

1229
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,510
easily do four let's see if it'll pick
up the items out of the chest

1230
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:07,520
up the items out of the chest
 

1231
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,830
up the items out of the chest
if we get it right up to that fence i'm

1232
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
if we get it right up to that fence i'm
 

1233
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,149
if we get it right up to that fence i'm
not sure i haven't tried

1234
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:12,159
not sure i haven't tried
 

1235
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,750
not sure i haven't tried
it doesn't darn

1236
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:15,760
it doesn't darn
 

1237
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,390
it doesn't darn
okay what if we take that out uh maybe

1238
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,400
okay what if we take that out uh maybe
 

1239
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,230
okay what if we take that out uh maybe
there's another block

1240
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,240
there's another block
 

1241
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,990
there's another block
let's try just the normal fence they're

1242
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
let's try just the normal fence they're
 

1243
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,269
let's try just the normal fence they're
a little bit thinner

1244
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279

 

1245
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,470

we don't want it to like go on the block

1246
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
we don't want it to like go on the block
 

1247
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,350
we don't want it to like go on the block
just like as far as it can without

1248
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
just like as far as it can without
 

1249
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,350
just like as far as it can without
getting stuck

1250
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:33,360
getting stuck
 

1251
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,070
getting stuck
should be able to go a little bit more

1252
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,080
should be able to go a little bit more
 

1253
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,190
should be able to go a little bit more
oh

1254
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
oh
 

1255
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,549
oh
now it still can't pick up out of the

1256
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:38,559
now it still can't pick up out of the
 

1257
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,470
now it still can't pick up out of the
chest okay

1258
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:40,480
chest okay
 

1259
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,230
chest okay
um well let's get rid of this i think

1260
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,240
um well let's get rid of this i think
 

1261
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,789
um well let's get rid of this i think
glass

1262
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
glass
 

1263
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,470
glass
are glass panes thinner than fences i

1264
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
are glass panes thinner than fences i
 

1265
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,029
are glass panes thinner than fences i
can't even remember

1266
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,039
can't even remember
 

1267
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,190
can't even remember
oh too far yeah it has to stay on the

1268
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,200
oh too far yeah it has to stay on the
 

1269
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,029
oh too far yeah it has to stay on the
rail

1270
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,039
rail
 

1271
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,190
rail
otherwise this gets way more complicated

1272
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200

 

1273
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,029

but anyways guys i'm gonna keep thinking

1274
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
but anyways guys i'm gonna keep thinking
 

1275
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,510
but anyways guys i'm gonna keep thinking
of ideas here and then we might

1276
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:03,520
of ideas here and then we might
 

1277
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,430
of ideas here and then we might
uh build the super smell tree for our

1278
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
uh build the super smell tree for our
 

1279
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,990
uh build the super smell tree for our
next episode

1280
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000

 

1281
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,830

and uh might be a fun technical build

1282
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:11,840
and uh might be a fun technical build
 

1283
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,950
and uh might be a fun technical build
for you guys too if you're looking for

1284
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:12,960
for you guys too if you're looking for
 

1285
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,549
for you guys too if you're looking for
one

1286
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559
one
 

1287
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,590
one
i don't know if i didn't oh oh that was

1288
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
i don't know if i didn't oh oh that was
 

1289
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,710
i don't know if i didn't oh oh that was
weird

1290
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
weird
 

1291
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,350
weird
it's gotta be a graphical glitch right i

1292
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:21,360
it's gotta be a graphical glitch right i
 

1293
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,110
it's gotta be a graphical glitch right i
think so

1294
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120
think so
 

1295
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,029
think so
if we break that

1296
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039

 

1297
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:33,269

no it's not actually there

1298
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:33,279

 

1299
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,750

anyways guys i think we're gonna wrap up

1300
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
anyways guys i think we're gonna wrap up
 

1301
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,590
anyways guys i think we're gonna wrap up
the episode here for today

1302
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:37,600
the episode here for today
 

1303
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,990
the episode here for today
so here is the comment i picked out it

1304
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,000
so here is the comment i picked out it
 

1305
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,870
so here is the comment i picked out it
says

1306
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880
says
 

1307
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,789
says
hey etho why don't you have old

1308
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:42,799
hey etho why don't you have old
 

1309
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,190
hey etho why don't you have old
tutorials like your mob system and

1310
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,200
tutorials like your mob system and
 

1311
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,950
tutorials like your mob system and
brewing in playlists

1312
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
brewing in playlists
 

1313
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,029
brewing in playlists
also is there a specific reason why you

1314
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:49,039
also is there a specific reason why you
 

1315
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,630
also is there a specific reason why you
don't do more tutorials like them

1316
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:52,640
don't do more tutorials like them
 

1317
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,590
don't do more tutorials like them
so my playlists are a mess as a lot of

1318
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:55,600
so my playlists are a mess as a lot of
 

1319
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,070
so my playlists are a mess as a lot of
you know

1320
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,080
you know
 

1321
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,630
you know
that's high on my to-do list i'm hoping

1322
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
that's high on my to-do list i'm hoping
 

1323
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,390
that's high on my to-do list i'm hoping
i've actually been planning

1324
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,400
i've actually been planning
 

1325
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,269
i've actually been planning
to just sit down and spend a couple

1326
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:03,279
to just sit down and spend a couple
 

1327
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,149
to just sit down and spend a couple
hours on them

1328
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:04,159
hours on them
 

1329
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,990
hours on them
and hopefully sort out some of the

1330
