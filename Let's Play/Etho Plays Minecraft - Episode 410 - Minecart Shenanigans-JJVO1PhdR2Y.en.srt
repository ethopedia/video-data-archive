seems to be working in working order

164
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:06,750
seems to be working in working order

press the button

166
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:09,650
press the button
 

167
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,420
press the button
things happen that's a good sign right

168
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:12,430
things happen that's a good sign right
 

169
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,830
things happen that's a good sign right
let's see if we we can see it happen

170
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:14,840
let's see if we we can see it happen
 

171
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,360
let's see if we we can see it happen
here okay so these all pull out I think

172
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,370
here okay so these all pull out I think
 

173
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,030
here okay so these all pull out I think
the timings are all correct and the only

174
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,040
the timings are all correct and the only
 

175
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,830
the timings are all correct and the only
thing those this track doesn't go

176
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
thing those this track doesn't go
 

177
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,990
thing those this track doesn't go
anywhere but maybe for testing actually

178
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,000
anywhere but maybe for testing actually
 

179
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,300
anywhere but maybe for testing actually
it does go somewhere doesn't it I don't

180
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,310
it does go somewhere doesn't it I don't
 

181
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,890
it does go somewhere doesn't it I don't
think it was complete though but for

182
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:32,900
think it was complete though but for
 

183
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,450
think it was complete though but for
testing maybe what we'll do for right

184
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:34,460
testing maybe what we'll do for right
 

185
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,540
testing maybe what we'll do for right
now is just like veer this away from

186
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:37,550
now is just like veer this away from
 

187
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,969
now is just like veer this away from
here and make it loop back on itself so

188
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:39,979
here and make it loop back on itself so
 

189
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,820
here and make it loop back on itself so
we got to take this track here and make

190
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:42,830
we got to take this track here and make
 

191
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:50,100
we got to take this track here and make
it connect back to the start up here

192
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,110
it connect back to the start up here
 

193
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,379
it connect back to the start up here
yeah has to connect to over here and

194
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:53,389
yeah has to connect to over here and
 

195
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,629
yeah has to connect to over here and
then I'll do a full loop around and we

196
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:55,639
then I'll do a full loop around and we
 

197
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,400
then I'll do a full loop around and we
can we can see if it actually is working

198
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,410
can we can see if it actually is working
 

199
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,320
can we can see if it actually is working
properly so I'm going to set that up

200
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,330
properly so I'm going to set that up
 

201
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,570
properly so I'm going to set that up
right now

202
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:00,580
right now
 

203
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,770
right now

Oh bump why have I never lit this area

214
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:24,590
Oh bump why have I never lit this area

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,969
Oh bump why have I never lit this area
up I have no idea right by the portal

216
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:27,979
up I have no idea right by the portal
 

217
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:28,930

right by my bed

218
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:28,940
right by my bed
 

219
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,360
right by my bed
all my items I've never lit it up so

220
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,370
all my items I've never lit it up so
 

221
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,520
all my items I've never lit it up so
that the creepers can blow up all my my

222
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:33,530
that the creepers can blow up all my my
 

223
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,930
that the creepers can blow up all my my
goodies here apparently cool so we got

224
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:37,940
goodies here apparently cool so we got
 

225
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,150
goodies here apparently cool so we got
this thing looping around on itself and

226
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
this thing looping around on itself and
 

227
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,250
this thing looping around on itself and
we should be able to check out how it

228
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,260
we should be able to check out how it
 

229
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,250
we should be able to check out how it
works and if it works I'm not sure I

230
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,260
works and if it works I'm not sure I
 

231
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,680
works and if it works I'm not sure I
think this should though from what I've

232
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:47,690
think this should though from what I've
 

233
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,230
think this should though from what I've
inspected so first test we're going to

234
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
inspected so first test we're going to
 

235
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,629
inspected so first test we're going to
do we're just going to stack maybe five

236
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
do we're just going to stack maybe five
 

237
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,390
do we're just going to stack maybe five
mine carts on one of these I think this

238
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:55,400
mine carts on one of these I think this
 

239
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,760
mine carts on one of these I think this
is how we load it right maybe we start

240
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:57,770
is how we load it right maybe we start
 

241
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,430
is how we load it right maybe we start
here and push it that might be a bit

242
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:00,440
here and push it that might be a bit
 

243
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,100
here and push it that might be a bit
more consistent okay and if I remember

244
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,110
more consistent okay and if I remember
 

245
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,620
more consistent okay and if I remember
right this these hold five mine carts

246
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:05,630
right this these hold five mine carts
 

247
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,310
right this these hold five mine carts
per column or maybe it wasn't even

248
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:09,320
per column or maybe it wasn't even
 

249
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,750
per column or maybe it wasn't even
limited I don't think it was limit is

250
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:10,760
limited I don't think it was limit is
 

251
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,210
limited I don't think it was limit is
just how high we make the stack but I

252
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:13,220
just how high we make the stack but I
 

253
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,180
just how high we make the stack but I
think we made it four five right yeah

254
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,190
think we made it four five right yeah
 

255
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,529
think we made it four five right yeah
well that little stack pretty neatly

256
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:17,539
well that little stack pretty neatly
 

257
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,020
well that little stack pretty neatly
actually so to begin I think we just

258
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,030
actually so to begin I think we just
 

259
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,670
actually so to begin I think we just
have to activate this

260
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
have to activate this
 

261
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,790
have to activate this
let's just see what happens we also are

262
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:27,800
let's just see what happens we also are
 

263
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,710
let's just see what happens we also are
interested in what order they come back

264
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:29,720
interested in what order they come back
 

265
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,420
interested in what order they come back
are they going to fall down this chamber

266
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:31,430
are they going to fall down this chamber
 

267
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,870
are they going to fall down this chamber
the front one there I'm not sure oh they

268
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
the front one there I'm not sure oh they
 

269
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,490
the front one there I'm not sure oh they
went to the front one oh that's

270
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:39,500
went to the front one oh that's
 

271
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,150
went to the front one oh that's
interesting because there's so little

272
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:43,160
interesting because there's so little
 

273
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,810
interesting because there's so little
distance in the track okay maybe we

274
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:49,820
distance in the track okay maybe we
 

275
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,630
distance in the track okay maybe we
can't test this year there's not enough

276
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:52,640
can't test this year there's not enough
 

277
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,130
can't test this year there's not enough
distance in the track for it to finish

278
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:54,140
distance in the track for it to finish
 

279
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,230
distance in the track for it to finish
and this is going around in an infinite

280
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
and this is going around in an infinite
 

281
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,350
and this is going around in an infinite
loop okay we're going to give this

282
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
loop okay we're going to give this
 

283
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,510
loop okay we're going to give this
another try now I just ran a whole bunch

284
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
another try now I just ran a whole bunch
 

285
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
another try now I just ran a whole bunch
of track so this first station connects

286
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,290
of track so this first station connects
 

287
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,990
of track so this first station connects
the second one and second one a third

288
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,000
the second one and second one a third
 

289
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,180
the second one and second one a third
one it's just a third one doesn't

290
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,190
one it's just a third one doesn't
 

291
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,220
one it's just a third one doesn't
connect back to this first one so it's

292
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,230
connect back to this first one so it's
 

293
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,050
connect back to this first one so it's
not quite complete at the moment but

294
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,060
not quite complete at the moment but
 

295
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:22,330
not quite complete at the moment but
what we're really interested in oh did

296
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:22,340
what we're really interested in oh did
 

297
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,240
what we're really interested in oh did

so we're interested in what order they

314
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:01,820
so we're interested in what order they
 

315
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,880
so we're interested in what order they
arrived so pay attention to the items in

316
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:03,890
arrived so pay attention to the items in
 

317
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,040
arrived so pay attention to the items in
these mine carts we want them to arrive

318
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,050
these mine carts we want them to arrive
 

319
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,470
these mine carts we want them to arrive

sometimes there's no redstone up here

508
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:09,779
sometimes there's no redstone up here
 

509
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,660
sometimes there's no redstone up here
guys I never put the redstone in so

510
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:11,670
guys I never put the redstone in so
 

511
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,759
guys I never put the redstone in so
these these junctions are supposed to be

512
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:13,769
these these junctions are supposed to be
 

513
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:16,129
these these junctions are supposed to be
controlled by something and that thing

514
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:16,139
controlled by something and that thing
 

515
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,550
controlled by something and that thing
is not here to to do it so I'm going to

516
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:19,560
is not here to to do it so I'm going to
 

517
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,710
is not here to to do it so I'm going to
put that in right now and hopefully this

518
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:21,720
put that in right now and hopefully this
 

519
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,869
put that in right now and hopefully this
will work also I checked out the first

520
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:23,879
will work also I checked out the first
 

521
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,670
will work also I checked out the first
station this is the third one by the way

522
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
station this is the third one by the way
 

523
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,309
station this is the third one by the way
first station has some inconsistencies

524
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:28,319
first station has some inconsistencies
 

525
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:30,800
first station has some inconsistencies
at the top here compared to the second

526
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:30,810
at the top here compared to the second
 

527
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,350
at the top here compared to the second
one so maybe if we get everything the

528
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
one so maybe if we get everything the
 

529
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,110
one so maybe if we get everything the
way it should it'll work let's hope for

530
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,120
way it should it'll work let's hope for
 

531
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,379
way it should it'll work let's hope for
the best here all right well it's

532
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:39,389
the best here all right well it's
 

533
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:42,019
the best here all right well it's
do-or-die time guys this is our final

534
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:42,029
do-or-die time guys this is our final
 

535
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,869
do-or-die time guys this is our final
test it has to work otherwise we're

536
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:44,879
test it has to work otherwise we're
 

537
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,480
test it has to work otherwise we're
given up perfect

538
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:47,490
given up perfect
 

539
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,499
given up perfect
okay Oh No why does it do that it seems

okay Oh No why does it do that it seems
 

541
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:53,449
okay Oh No why does it do that it seems
every time it does that is when we have

542
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:53,459
every time it does that is when we have
 

543
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,980
every time it does that is when we have
problems too but everything is at

544
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:57,990
problems too but everything is at

double-checked like 20 times the

548
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:02,939
double-checked like 20 times the
 

549
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:04,340
double-checked like 20 times the
Redstone is all right

550
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:04,350
Redstone is all right
 

551
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,999
Redstone is all right
and it's just this invisible minecart

552
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:08,009
and it's just this invisible minecart
 

553
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:10,759
and it's just this invisible minecart
thing I can explain where it seems to be

554
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:10,769
thing I can explain where it seems to be
 

555
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:12,410
thing I can explain where it seems to be
sending to mine carts I don't know if it

556
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:12,420
sending to mine carts I don't know if it
 

557

off-camera here because we've seen a lot

612
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:49,300
off-camera here because we've seen a lot
 

613

617
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,480
figured out now turns out I'm an idiot I
put a redstone torch to power the thing

618
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:57,490
put a redstone torch to power the thing
 

619
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,000
put a redstone torch to power the thing
to power these power rails cuz without

620
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,010
to power these power rails cuz without
 

621
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,900
to power these power rails cuz without
it they're unpowered yes okay well I

622
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:03,910
it they're unpowered yes okay well I
 

623
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,120
it they're unpowered yes okay well I
didn't realize this redstone down here

624
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,130
didn't realize this redstone down here
 

625
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,710
didn't realize this redstone down here
is pointing at this torch so whenever

626
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:07,720
is pointing at this torch so whenever
 

627
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,170
is pointing at this torch so whenever
these these minecarts go over top here

628
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:10,180
these these minecarts go over top here
 

629
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,270
these these minecarts go over top here
to trigger the whole thing it unpowered

630
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:12,280
to trigger the whole thing it unpowered
 

631
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,940
to trigger the whole thing it unpowered
this rail here and they all kind of

632
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:14,950
this rail here and they all kind of
 

633
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,100
this rail here and they all kind of
stopped and bunch up and then bounce

634
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,110
stopped and bunch up and then bounce
 

635
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,330
stopped and bunch up and then bounce
back so let's just move that to maybe

636
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:21,340
back so let's just move that to maybe
 

637
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,080
back so let's just move that to maybe
over here and power that and everything

638
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,090
over here and power that and everything
 

639
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,330
over here and power that and everything
should work perfect

640
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:26,340
should work perfect
 

641
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,770
should work perfect
yep that did the trick guys I just

642
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:28,780
yep that did the trick guys I just
 

643
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,630
yep that did the trick guys I just
tested it all and it seems to work

644
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:30,640
tested it all and it seems to work
 

645
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,960
tested it all and it seems to work
perfectly now so that's great the only

646
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:33,970
perfectly now so that's great the only
 

647
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,940
perfectly now so that's great the only
thing left to do with this like it works

648
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:35,950
thing left to do with this like it works
 

649
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,750
thing left to do with this like it works
as it is now but we can't request carts

650
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:38,760
as it is now but we can't request carts
 

651
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,520
as it is now but we can't request carts
like I want to so if there's no mind

652
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:41,530
like I want to so if there's no mind
 

653
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,740
like I want to so if there's no mind
cards here if our storage items aren't

654
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:43,750
cards here if our storage items aren't
 

655
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,600
cards here if our storage items aren't
here I want to be able to press a button

656
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:45,610
here I want to be able to press a button
 

657
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,510
here I want to be able to press a button
and it's going to check the other

658
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:48,520
and it's going to check the other
 

659
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,450
and it's going to check the other
stations for the minecart and if they're

660
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:51,460
stations for the minecart and if they're
 

661
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,860
stations for the minecart and if they're
at that station we want it to

662
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:52,870
at that station we want it to
 

663
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,950
at that station we want it to
automatically bring them to us and then

664
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:55,960
automatically bring them to us and then
 

665
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,310
automatically bring them to us and then
stop here and we want that for all the

666
00:16:59,310 --> 00:16:59,320
stop here and we want that for all the
 

667
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,810
stop here and we want that for all the
stations so I've been trying to think of

668
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:00,820
stations so I've been trying to think of
 

669
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,360
stations so I've been trying to think of
an elegant way of doing that it's

670
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,370
an elegant way of doing that it's
 

671
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,430
an elegant way of doing that it's
actually pretty complicated as it turns

672
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:05,440
actually pretty complicated as it turns
 

673
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:11,579
actually pretty complicated as it turns
out so what we want to do I think let's

674
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:11,589
out so what we want to do I think let's
 

675
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:15,060
out so what we want to do I think let's
tap a bit of land here rather than

676
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,070
tap a bit of land here rather than
 

677
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,730
tap a bit of land here rather than
forcing the minecarts to always arrive

678
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:17,740
forcing the minecarts to always arrive
 

679
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,610
forcing the minecarts to always arrive
here and fall down we want to change it

680
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:20,620
here and fall down we want to change it
 

681
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,669
here and fall down we want to change it
so that they have the ability to pass by

682
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:24,679
so that they have the ability to pass by
 

683
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:27,490
so that they have the ability to pass by
each of these stations and instead will

684
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:27,500
each of these stations and instead will
 

685
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,810
each of these stations and instead will
have a junction that when it's enabled

686
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:31,820
have a junction that when it's enabled
 

687
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,409
have a junction that when it's enabled
it will it will go to here basically

688
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:37,419
it will it will go to here basically
 

689
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:39,549
it will it will go to here basically
it's going to be really I might have to

690
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:39,559
it's going to be really I might have to
 

691
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,700
it's going to be really I might have to
change a lot of stuff around I think

692
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:41,710
change a lot of stuff around I think
 

693
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,440
change a lot of stuff around I think
darn it's because these tracks don't

694
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,450
darn it's because these tracks don't
 

695
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,090
darn it's because these tracks don't
come up very nicely they're all like

696
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:46,100
come up very nicely they're all like
 

697
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,760
come up very nicely they're all like
going down and coming up and they're not

698
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:48,770
going down and coming up and they're not
 

699
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:54,370
going down and coming up and they're not
like beside beside here but yeah

700
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:54,380
like beside beside here but yeah
 

701
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,770
like beside beside here but yeah
basically have a junction all right when

702
00:17:59,770 --> 00:17:59,780
basically have a junction all right when
 

703
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,860
basically have a junction all right when
we press the button here I want mine

704
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:02,870
we press the button here I want mine
 

705
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,990
we press the button here I want mine
carts to be ejected from a dispenser and

706
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,000
carts to be ejected from a dispenser and
 

707
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,750
carts to be ejected from a dispenser and
it will go down this track and let's see

708
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:13,760
it will go down this track and let's see
 

709
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,720
it will go down this track and let's see
this is going to be so messy oh

710
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:18,730

 

711
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,980

basically have another Junction here

712
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:20,990
basically have another Junction here
 

713
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,890
basically have another Junction here
sort of thing minecart will get ejected

714
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:23,900
sort of thing minecart will get ejected
 

715
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,350
sort of thing minecart will get ejected
go down the track when it passes by each

716
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,360
go down the track when it passes by each
 

717
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,240
go down the track when it passes by each
of these stations will have a detector

718
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,250
of these stations will have a detector
 

719
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,649
of these stations will have a detector
rail and when this gets triggered it's

720
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:35,659
rail and when this gets triggered it's
 

721
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:37,779
rail and when this gets triggered it's
going to it's going to power this whole

722
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:37,789
going to it's going to power this whole
 

723
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,820
going to it's going to power this whole
thing so it's going to send any mine

724
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:39,830
thing so it's going to send any mine
 

725
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,830
thing so it's going to send any mine
cards that this that this minecart

726
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:44,840
cards that this that this minecart
 

727
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,560
cards that this that this minecart
passes by you see so as it goes by the

728
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:47,570
passes by you see so as it goes by the
 

729
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,270
passes by you see so as it goes by the
station's if the mine carts are there

730
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
station's if the mine carts are there
 

731
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,980
station's if the mine carts are there
it's going to check them and send them

732
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:50,990
it's going to check them and send them
 

733
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:56,049
it's going to check them and send them
down this track and once it finishes a

734
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:56,059
down this track and once it finishes a
 

735
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:00,549
down this track and once it finishes a
full rotation we want to send it back

736
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559
full rotation we want to send it back
 

737
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,140
full rotation we want to send it back
into this dispenser and have this this

738
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,150
into this dispenser and have this this
 

739
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,570
into this dispenser and have this this
thing switch so that the mine carts go

740
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:07,580
thing switch so that the mine carts go
 

741
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,890
thing switch so that the mine carts go
here yes I'm not doing it today that's

742
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:11,900
here yes I'm not doing it today that's
 

743
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,590
here yes I'm not doing it today that's
the rough idea though gonna take a

744
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:14,600
the rough idea though gonna take a
 

745
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,520
the rough idea though gonna take a
little time to work that out now we're

746
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:18,530
little time to work that out now we're
 

747
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,730
little time to work that out now we're
gonna head back to broken track we're

748
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:21,740
gonna head back to broken track we're
 

749
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,909
gonna head back to broken track we're
gonna head back to the man cave area do

750
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:24,919
gonna head back to the man cave area do
 

751
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:27,390
gonna head back to the man cave area do
some projects around there hopefully

752
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:27,400
some projects around there hopefully
 

753
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,680
some projects around there hopefully
fixed it good good good

to that like the idea is to make it work

872
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:12,760
to that like the idea is to make it work
 

873
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,250
to that like the idea is to make it work
with shields right there's gonna be

874
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:14,260
with shields right there's gonna be
 

875
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,020
with shields right there's gonna be
shields in the game so you can block if

876
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,030
shields in the game so you can block if
 

877

you left-click I assume no right-click

878
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:20,620
you left-click I assume no right-click
 

879
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,070
you left-click I assume no right-click
it would be right-click like you do

880
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,080
it would be right-click like you do
 

881
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,049
it would be right-click like you do
currently so I'm wondering maybe they're

882
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:28,059
currently so I'm wondering maybe they're
 

883
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:30,090
currently so I'm wondering maybe they're
going to make it so if you have blocks

884
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:30,100
going to make it so if you have blocks
 

885
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,669

selected in your left hand if you if you
left-click that would be reversed so

888
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:36,280
left-click that would be reversed so
 

889
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,580
left-click that would be reversed so
like right now the place blocks you have

979
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:31,700
that's what the nexus is for and then if
we run out of them here we got to go get
