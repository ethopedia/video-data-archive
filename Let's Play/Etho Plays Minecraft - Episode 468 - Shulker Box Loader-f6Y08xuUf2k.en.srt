one of the big problems I was having

50
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,220
one of the big problems I was having
 

51
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,810
one of the big problems I was having
with the end cities is I would go you

52
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:11,820
with the end cities is I would go you
 

53
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,420
with the end cities is I would go you
know exploring generating new terrain

54
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:14,430
know exploring generating new terrain
 

55
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,690
know exploring generating new terrain
and then this is not the right tunnel ah

56
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:19,700
and then this is not the right tunnel ah
 

57
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,929
and then this is not the right tunnel ah
I'm very good at locations but then you

58
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:23,939
I'm very good at locations but then you
 

59
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,030
I'm very good at locations but then you
know I I find another end city ten

60
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:26,040
know I I find another end city ten
 

61
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,130
know I I find another end city ten
minutes later and surprise surprise it's

62
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:28,140
minutes later and surprise surprise it's
 

63
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,200
minutes later and surprise surprise it's
the one I raided already and that kept

64
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,210
the one I raided already and that kept
 

65
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,730
the one I raided already and that kept
happening to me cuz I was just kind of

66
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:31,740
happening to me cuz I was just kind of
 

67
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,090
happening to me cuz I was just kind of
chaotically exploring the end finding

68
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:35,100
chaotically exploring the end finding
 

69
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,480
chaotically exploring the end finding
new cities and then it's like wait a

70
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:38,490
new cities and then it's like wait a
 

71
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,460
new cities and then it's like wait a
minute where have I gone where haven't I

72
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:40,470
minute where have I gone where haven't I
 

73
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,200
minute where have I gone where haven't I
gone I'm not sure anymore

74
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,210
gone I'm not sure anymore
 

75
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,539
gone I'm not sure anymore
it all kind of blends together after a

76
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:44,549
it all kind of blends together after a
 

77
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:45,830
it all kind of blends together after a
while and especially if you guys are

78
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
while and especially if you guys are
 

79
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,420
while and especially if you guys are
playing on servers this is going to be a

80
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:47,430
playing on servers this is going to be a
 

81
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,780
playing on servers this is going to be a
problem for you

82
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:48,790
problem for you
 

83
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,110
problem for you
like how do you know what in cities have

84
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:52,120
like how do you know what in cities have
 

85
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,760
like how do you know what in cities have
been rated which ones haven't been so I

86
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:55,770
been rated which ones haven't been so I
 

87
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,490
been rated which ones haven't been so I
had one of those moments so oh yeah

88
00:01:59,490 --> 00:01:59,500
had one of those moments so oh yeah
 

89
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,450
had one of those moments so oh yeah
kind of moments it's like they made it

90
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:03,460
kind of moments it's like they made it
 

91
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,610
kind of moments it's like they made it
so Maps worked in the end I forgot about

92
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:05,620
so Maps worked in the end I forgot about
 

93
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,770
so Maps worked in the end I forgot about
that and then I remember is like this is

94
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:07,780
that and then I remember is like this is
 

95
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,320
that and then I remember is like this is
the greatest thing ever so check it out

96
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,330
the greatest thing ever so check it out
 

97
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,680
the greatest thing ever so check it out
this is I totally zoomed out map so it's

98
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:13,690
this is I totally zoomed out map so it's
 

99
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,580
this is I totally zoomed out map so it's
2048 by 2048 area and you can see pretty

100
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:17,590
2048 by 2048 area and you can see pretty
 

101
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,590
2048 by 2048 area and you can see pretty
clearly on the map there's the purple

102
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:19,600
clearly on the map there's the purple
 

103
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,830
clearly on the map there's the purple
clusters there those are the N cities so

104
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:22,840
clusters there those are the N cities so
 

105
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,170
clusters there those are the N cities so
I've been using a map while exploring

106
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:25,180
I've been using a map while exploring
 

107
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,210
I've been using a map while exploring
here and this is great because it shows

108
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:30,220
here and this is great because it shows
 

109
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,030
here and this is great because it shows
me where I've been so I can totally get

110
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
me where I've been so I can totally get
 

111
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,620
me where I've been so I can totally get
perfect coverage of the area and not

112
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:34,630
perfect coverage of the area and not
 

113
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,980
perfect coverage of the area and not
miss any cities but also I know I've

114
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:37,990
miss any cities but also I know I've
 

115
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,900
miss any cities but also I know I've
I've explored these three now so I don't

116
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:39,910
I've explored these three now so I don't
 

117
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,630
I've explored these three now so I don't
have to go back to this location so that

118
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
have to go back to this location so that
 

119
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,130
have to go back to this location so that
is the way to do it I think here I made

120
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,140
is the way to do it I think here I made
 

121
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,280
is the way to do it I think here I made
another one as well oh you can dual

122
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,290
another one as well oh you can dual
 

123
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,170
another one as well oh you can dual
wield maps next level craziness year so

124
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:55,180
wield maps next level craziness year so
 

125
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,199
wield maps next level craziness year so
I've been to about 7n cities already I

126
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:58,209
I've been to about 7n cities already I
 

127
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,510
I've been to about 7n cities already I
got to make a new map for a new quadrant

128
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:00,520
got to make a new map for a new quadrant
 

129
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,740
got to make a new map for a new quadrant
now so also I brought some item frames

130
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:04,750
now so also I brought some item frames
 

131
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,380
now so also I brought some item frames
let's see how they look in these if we

132
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:07,390
let's see how they look in these if we
 

133
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,580
let's see how they look in these if we
put these in here I'm done with these

134
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:08,590
put these in here I'm done with these
 

135
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,699
put these in here I'm done with these
ones I've explored all the cities bam

136
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:11,709
ones I've explored all the cities bam
 

137
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,140
ones I've explored all the cities bam
and bam pretty cool so that's our main

138
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,150
and bam pretty cool so that's our main
 

139
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,610
and bam pretty cool so that's our main
island over there and then the void area

140
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:20,620
island over there and then the void area
 

141
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,920
island over there and then the void area
over there then all the new island stuff

142
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:22,930
over there then all the new island stuff
 

143
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,740
over there then all the new island stuff
over here so what I figured out like I

144
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:25,750
over here so what I figured out like I
 

145
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,020
over here so what I figured out like I
don't use maps too often so I wasn't

146
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,030
don't use maps too often so I wasn't
 

147
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,500
don't use maps too often so I wasn't
really sure how they work to be honest

148
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:30,510
really sure how they work to be honest
 

149
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,600
really sure how they work to be honest
the first one I made at 0 0 and then the

150
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:33,610
the first one I made at 0 0 and then the
 

151
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,580
the first one I made at 0 0 and then the
other one I think I was negative x and z

152
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:38,590
other one I think I was negative x and z
 

153
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:44,729
other one I think I was negative x and z
let's try make one over here see you if

154
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:44,739
let's try make one over here see you if
 

155
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,979
let's try make one over here see you if
I do this correctly see if I understand

156
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:46,989
I do this correctly see if I understand
 

157
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:49,320
I do this correctly see if I understand
it now so it will right-click look at

158
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,330
it now so it will right-click look at
 

159
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,260
it now so it will right-click look at
our map here it's our of our island

160
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:52,270
our map here it's our of our island
 

161
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,880
our map here it's our of our island
let's see what happens now when we zoom

162
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:53,890
let's see what happens now when we zoom
 

163
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,370
let's see what happens now when we zoom
out so to zoom out you need a crafting

164
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:56,380
out so to zoom out you need a crafting
 

165
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,240
out so to zoom out you need a crafting
table and a bunch of paper let's get our

166
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,250
table and a bunch of paper let's get our
 

167
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,750
table and a bunch of paper let's get our
paper here

168
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
paper here
 

169
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,790
paper here
all right put your map inside takes 8

170
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:03,800
all right put your map inside takes 8
 

171
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,410
all right put your map inside takes 8
paper to zoom out one level I didn't

172
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:05,420
paper to zoom out one level I didn't
 

173
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,300
paper to zoom out one level I didn't
think you can do it four times boom boom

174
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,310
think you can do it four times boom boom
 

175
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,809
think you can do it four times boom boom
boom

176
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:10,819
boom
 

177
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,449
boom
maps are a little bit glitchy right now

178
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:13,459
maps are a little bit glitchy right now
 

179
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:16,509
maps are a little bit glitchy right now
uh have I gone all the way it says

180
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:16,519
uh have I gone all the way it says
 

181
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,090
uh have I gone all the way it says
unknown map now Oh mm try it out oh it's

182
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,100
unknown map now Oh mm try it out oh it's
 

183
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,610
unknown map now Oh mm try it out oh it's
working I think four four yeah that's

184
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:24,620
working I think four four yeah that's
 

185
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,460
working I think four four yeah that's
totally zoomed out one problem maybe I

186
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:27,470
totally zoomed out one problem maybe I
 

187
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,050
totally zoomed out one problem maybe I
don't understand this because this looks

188
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,060
don't understand this because this looks
 

189
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,939
don't understand this because this looks
the same as the one we got already

190
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:30,949
the same as the one we got already
 

191
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:33,640
the same as the one we got already
because the islands at the top left like

192
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:33,650
because the islands at the top left like
 

193
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,779
because the islands at the top left like
the one on the right here okay so I

194
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:37,789
the one on the right here okay so I
 

195
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:41,439
the one on the right here okay so I
still don't understand maps it seems but

196
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:41,449
still don't understand maps it seems but
 

197
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,450
still don't understand maps it seems but
I think I know where I went wrong I

198
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:43,460
I think I know where I went wrong I
 

199
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,629
I think I know where I went wrong I
mixed up my directions so the top of the

200
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
mixed up my directions so the top of the
 

201
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,629
mixed up my directions so the top of the
map this way is north which is the

202
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:49,639
map this way is north which is the
 

203
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,189
map this way is north which is the
direction we're facing now so I think we

204
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
direction we're facing now so I think we
 

205
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,510
direction we're facing now so I think we
need that way and that way on the map

206
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:54,520
need that way and that way on the map
 

207
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,080
need that way and that way on the map
let's try that out

208
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,090
let's try that out
 

209
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,260
let's try that out
so let's go to see I thought I made one

210
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,270
so let's go to see I thought I made one
 

211
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,439
so let's go to see I thought I made one
negative negative X and Zed but I guess

212
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:02,449
negative negative X and Zed but I guess
 

213
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,689
negative negative X and Zed but I guess
maybe not let's try make one over here

214
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:04,699
maybe not let's try make one over here
 

215
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:09,010
maybe not let's try make one over here
then oh and see if it fills in the

216
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,020
then oh and see if it fills in the
 

217
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,129
then oh and see if it fills in the
missing quadrant here alright the thing

218
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:12,139
missing quadrant here alright the thing
 

219
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:14,650
missing quadrant here alright the thing
I found out though is the maps

220
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:14,660
I found out though is the maps
 

221
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,930
I found out though is the maps
auto-align their borders which i did not

222
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:16,940
auto-align their borders which i did not
 

223
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,089
auto-align their borders which i did not
know before i thought you had to be very

224
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:19,099
know before i thought you had to be very
 

225
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:21,790
know before i thought you had to be very
careful where you created the map but as

226
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:21,800
careful where you created the map but as
 

227
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,210
careful where you created the map but as
long as you're within the area it seems

228
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,220
long as you're within the area it seems
 

229
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,159
long as you're within the area it seems
to auto-align everything which is nice

230
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:27,169
to auto-align everything which is nice
 

231
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:32,080
to auto-align everything which is nice
so let's see now no it still got it

232
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,090
so let's see now no it still got it
 

233
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,839
so let's see now no it still got it
wrong maybe I could go farther this way

234
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:34,849
wrong maybe I could go farther this way
 

235
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:38,770
wrong maybe I could go farther this way
I don't really understand maps are hard

236
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:38,780
I don't really understand maps are hard
 

237
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,629
I don't really understand maps are hard
sometimes

238
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:39,639
sometimes
 

239
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,490
sometimes
let's try go farther this way we want

240
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:42,500
let's try go farther this way we want
 

241
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,080
let's try go farther this way we want
the island to either be at the bottom

242
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,090
the island to either be at the bottom
 

243
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,550
the island to either be at the bottom
right or bottom left did we do it right

244
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:47,560
right or bottom left did we do it right
 

245
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,830
right or bottom left did we do it right
bottom left that's good right that's

246
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
bottom left that's good right that's
 

247
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,710
bottom left that's good right that's
what I said bottom left maybe I was just

248
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:53,720
what I said bottom left maybe I was just
 

249
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,800
what I said bottom left maybe I was just
too close to 0-0 maybe goes a little

250
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:56,810
too close to 0-0 maybe goes a little
 

251
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,449
too close to 0-0 maybe goes a little
ways away

252
00:05:59,449 --> 00:05:59,459

 

253
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,009

alright guys so after I get my map here

254
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:02,019
alright guys so after I get my map here
 

255
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,350
alright guys so after I get my map here
what I do is I fly around the border of

256
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:04,360
what I do is I fly around the border of
 

257
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,589
what I do is I fly around the border of
the map kind of spiral my way inside to

258
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:07,599
the map kind of spiral my way inside to
 

259
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:10,019
the map kind of spiral my way inside to
uncover all the terrain here oh we just

260
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:10,029
uncover all the terrain here oh we just
 

261
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:12,509
uncover all the terrain here oh we just
passed over a fortress apparently and

262
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:12,519
passed over a fortress apparently and
 

263
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,609
passed over a fortress apparently and
when I do this I go pretty high up in

264
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:14,619
when I do this I go pretty high up in
 

265
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:15,299
when I do this I go pretty high up in
the sky

266
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:15,309
the sky
 

267
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,459
the sky
I went up to like a thousand and then

268
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:17,469
I went up to like a thousand and then
 

269
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:19,169
I went up to like a thousand and then
that way you can have a pretty good

270
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:19,179
that way you can have a pretty good
 

271
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,779
that way you can have a pretty good
downward angle as you go here get some

272
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:21,789
downward angle as you go here get some
 

273
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:24,809
downward angle as you go here get some
nice momentum otherwise if you fly near

274
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:24,819
nice momentum otherwise if you fly near
 

275
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,419
nice momentum otherwise if you fly near
the ground you should go too fast I find

276
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:27,429
the ground you should go too fast I find
 

277
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:42,389
the ground you should go too fast I find
ah whoops wasn't watching my health one

and we do this and we will try to get
back I looked in that Enderman I looked

286
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:55,719
back I looked in that Enderman I looked
 

287
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,839
back I looked in that Enderman I looked
at an Enderman I don't have a good armor

288
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:57,849
at an Enderman I don't have a good armor
 

289

I looked at more No all right so we are
 

291
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:08,969
I looked at more No all right so we are
supposed to get to minus 324 and like

292
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:08,979
supposed to get to minus 324 and like
 

293

gonna be over the void like on the right

296
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:15,219
gonna be over the void like on the right
 

297
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:18,359
gonna be over the void like on the right
way yes I am okay good we want it to be

298
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:18,369
way yes I am okay good we want it to be
 

299
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:20,249
way yes I am okay good we want it to be
over a big island like we're at right

300
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:20,259
over a big island like we're at right
 

301
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,179
over a big island like we're at right
now oh I just saw some items fall I

307
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:35,219
there's hope uh scared of some of these
oh no I'm still on the same island can I

308
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:35,229
oh no I'm still on the same island can I
 

309
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:38,969
oh no I'm still on the same island can I
take you sick items raining from the sky

would really recommend just like rating
 

435
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,790
would really recommend just like rating
these fortresses instead of like trying

436
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:35,800
these fortresses instead of like trying
 

437
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,180
these fortresses instead of like trying
to enchant it it's it's great doing this

and you gets cool stuff like dragon

440
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
and you gets cool stuff like dragon

I don't think there's any way of making

446
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:48,850
I don't think there's any way of making
 

447
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,090
I don't think there's any way of making
the farms like if I kill them all here

448
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:51,100
the farms like if I kill them all here
 

449
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,850
the farms like if I kill them all here
they're not coming back they're gone

450
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:52,860
they're not coming back they're gone
 

451

so this boat typically has three of them

452
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,450
so this boat typically has three of them
 

453
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,150
so this boat typically has three of them
or always has three of them I think

454
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,160
or always has three of them I think
 

455
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,340
or always has three of them I think
there's one guy here always one guy

456
00:10:59,340 --> 00:10:59,350
there's one guy here always one guy
 

457
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,960
there's one guy here always one guy
inside the room and then I think there's

458
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:00,970
inside the room and then I think there's
 

459
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,700
inside the room and then I think there's
one on the side here yeah right over

460
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:02,710
one on the side here yeah right over
 

461

always one which is pretty easy to miss
 

465
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,290
always one which is pretty easy to miss

545
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,280
city's brand new ones I didn't go back
to any of the ones we found previously

546
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,290
to any of the ones we found previously
 

547
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,680
to any of the ones we found previously
when they first came out so this is all

548
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:07,690
when they first came out so this is all
 

549
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,160
when they first came out so this is all
brand new loot and I also spent about

550
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,170
brand new loot and I also spent about
 

551
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,060
brand new loot and I also spent about
five hours doing it so nine cities five

552
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,070
five hours doing it so nine cities five
 

553
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,579
five hours doing it so nine cities five
hours probably wasted 30 minutes from

554
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:17,589
hours probably wasted 30 minutes from
 

555
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,760
hours probably wasted 30 minutes from
dying in there as well so yeah I'm

556
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:20,770
dying in there as well so yeah I'm

dying in there as well so yeah I'm
guessing about 30 minutes to locate and

558
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,080

563
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,990
is a fair bit of time when you when you
think about it and here we go check out

564
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,000
think about it and here we go check out
 

565
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,210
think about it and here we go check out
this box so this is how many shelter

566
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:33,220
this box so this is how many shelter

over the concept of that here and I'll
 

717
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,160
over the concept of that here and I'll
show you my design that's going to get

of storage with your farms you have to
 

737
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:27,299
of storage with your farms you have to
like do this continuous thing where you

now with the shelter boxes you can

744
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:34,840
now with the shelter boxes you can
 

745
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,080
now with the shelter boxes you can
pretty much have almost infinite storage

746
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,090
pretty much have almost infinite storage
 

747
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:41,030
pretty much have almost infinite storage
and like no area at all which is cool I

00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
you can see over here this is kind of
 

755
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,740
you can see over here this is kind of
annoying I have to like pick up the

756
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:52,750
annoying I have to like pick up the
 

757
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,049
annoying I have to like pick up the
zombie flesh out of the chest here put

758
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:55,059
zombie flesh out of the chest here put
 

759
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:56,669
zombie flesh out of the chest here put
into shocker box and then I can

760
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:56,679
into shocker box and then I can
 

761
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:00,330
into shocker box and then I can
transport it easily the idea of a box

762
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:00,340
transport it easily the idea of a box
 

763
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,180
transport it easily the idea of a box
loader and unloader is an automatic way

764
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,190
loader and unloader is an automatic way
 

765
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,760
loader and unloader is an automatic way
of filling these up and then like

766
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:05,770
of filling these up and then like
 

767
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,260
of filling these up and then like
collecting them together and then the

768
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,270
collecting them together and then the
 

769
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,030
collecting them together and then the
unloader takes items out of here and

770
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,040
unloader takes items out of here and
 

771
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,149
unloader takes items out of here and
puts them into your system so if we take

772
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:12,159
puts them into your system so if we take
 

773
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,940
puts them into your system so if we take
my Nexus for example I could set up a

774
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:14,950
my Nexus for example I could set up a
 

775
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,190
my Nexus for example I could set up a
box and loader there and then drop off

776
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200
box and loader there and then drop off
 

777
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,490
box and loader there and then drop off
20 chakra boxes full of stuff it'll take

778
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:20,500
20 chakra boxes full of stuff it'll take
 

779
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,110
20 chakra boxes full of stuff it'll take
all the items out of it automatically

780
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,120
all the items out of it automatically
 

781
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,450
all the items out of it automatically
sort it in my Nexus and that would be

782
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:24,460
sort it in my Nexus and that would be
 

783
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,780
sort it in my Nexus and that would be
pretty cool so yeah let's let's try

784
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:27,790
pretty cool so yeah let's let's try
 

785
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,640
pretty cool so yeah let's let's try
build a box loader here so I got rid of

786
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:29,650
build a box loader here so I got rid of
 

787

zombie flesh let's try to make three of

794
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:41,140
zombie flesh let's try to make three of
 

795
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,940
zombie flesh let's try to make three of
these together here I got this down to a

796
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:44,950
these together here I got this down to a
 

797
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,120
these together here I got this down to a
three-wide tileable thing that means i

798
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,130
three-wide tileable thing that means i
 

799
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,730
three-wide tileable thing that means i
need to place these three blocks apart

800
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:50,740
need to place these three blocks apart
 

801
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,940
need to place these three blocks apart
from each other and this is kind of a

802
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:53,950
from each other and this is kind of a
 

803
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,870
from each other and this is kind of a
word I put my stuff I I first like when

804
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:57,880
word I put my stuff I I first like when
 

805
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,980
word I put my stuff I I first like when
I do redstone stuff I usually focus on

806
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:00,990
I do redstone stuff I usually focus on
 

807
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,450
I do redstone stuff I usually focus on
what I wanted to look like first before

808
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:03,460
what I wanted to look like first before
 

809
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,419
what I wanted to look like first before

00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:06,429
I even do the redstone so for example
 

811
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:08,039
I even do the redstone so for example
here I really wanted this to look nice

812
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:08,049
here I really wanted this to look nice
 

813
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,600
here I really wanted this to look nice
on the outside it's kind of a tricky

814
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:09,610
on the outside it's kind of a tricky
 

815
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,539
on the outside it's kind of a tricky
thing with these shelter box things to

816
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:12,549
thing with these shelter box things to
 

817
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:15,810
thing with these shelter box things to
have a nice looking interface because of

818
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:15,820
have a nice looking interface because of
 

819
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,890
have a nice looking interface because of
all the stuff you need to

820
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:16,900
all the stuff you need to
 

821
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,230
all the stuff you need to
include with it but I'm pretty happy

include with it but I'm pretty happy
 

823
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,750
include with it but I'm pretty happy
with how this looks actually so

824
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:21,760
with how this looks actually so
 

825
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,970
with how this looks actually so
basically we have one chest the bottom

826
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:23,980
basically we have one chest the bottom
 

827
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,620
basically we have one chest the bottom
here on top of these double chests is

828
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:28,630
here on top of these double chests is
 

829
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,750
here on top of these double chests is
going to be a hopper over here and then

830
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:30,760
going to be a hopper over here and then
 

831
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,200
going to be a hopper over here and then
on top of those is the chakra boxes so

832
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,210
on top of those is the chakra boxes so
 

833
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,410
on top of those is the chakra boxes so
oh I broke that under chest that was

834
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:37,420
oh I broke that under chest that was
 

835
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,090
oh I broke that under chest that was
here yeah basically on top of this

836
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,100
here yeah basically on top of this
 

837
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,130
here yeah basically on top of this
there'll be a shelter box at each of

838
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:44,140
there'll be a shelter box at each of
 

839
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:48,390
there'll be a shelter box at each of
these and then we go up one more or two

840
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
these and then we go up one more or two
 

841
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,990
these and then we go up one more or two
more like so another stair here and I

842
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,000
more like so another stair here and I
 

843
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,180
more like so another stair here and I
think I put it where I'm trying to like

844
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,190
think I put it where I'm trying to like
 

845
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,950
think I put it where I'm trying to like
do this off of memory it's a pretty

846
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:58,960
do this off of memory it's a pretty
 

847
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,870
do this off of memory it's a pretty
complicated thing but there's not a lot

848
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
complicated thing but there's not a lot
 

849
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,450
complicated thing but there's not a lot
to it so I think I can pull it off here

850
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:03,460
to it so I think I can pull it off here
 

851
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:08,040
to it so I think I can pull it off here
oh yeah then a double chest over here

852
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,050
oh yeah then a double chest over here
 

853
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,410
oh yeah then a double chest over here
and to hide this double chest what I

854
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:10,420
and to hide this double chest what I
 

855
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,730
and to hide this double chest what I
decided to do is put like stairs running

856
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:14,740
decided to do is put like stairs running
 

857
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,890
decided to do is put like stairs running
across oh maybe I didn't do it like this

865
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,010
definitely alright so we have access to
all three of the chests here fairly nice

866
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,020
all three of the chests here fairly nice
 

867
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,160
all three of the chests here fairly nice
interface basically you drop off empty

868
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,170
interface basically you drop off empty
 

869
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,430
interface basically you drop off empty
shell core box is up here and then it's

870
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:38,440
shell core box is up here and then it's
 

871
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,020
shell core box is up here and then it's
going to place those over here you can

872
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,030

00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:45,730
the bottom here is going to be the
 

879
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,990
the bottom here is going to be the
shelter boxes full of stuff so it's kind

880
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,000
shelter boxes full of stuff so it's kind
 

881

of a nice progress empty filling full
 

883
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,100
of a nice progress empty filling full
okay maybe it's not the most beautiful

884
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,110
okay maybe it's not the most beautiful
 

885
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,610
okay maybe it's not the most beautiful
interface but with some decoration I'm

886
00:20:59,610 --> 00:20:59,620
interface but with some decoration I'm
 

887
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,800
interface but with some decoration I'm
sure it would look nice or maybe if we

888
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:01,810
sure it would look nice or maybe if we
 

889
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,930
sure it would look nice or maybe if we
built it out of wood but the big thing

890
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:03,940
built it out of wood but the big thing
 

891
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,600
built it out of wood but the big thing
here is I want to access to all three of

892
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:06,610
here is I want to access to all three of
 

893
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,790
here is I want to access to all three of
these Jes and that's what I was able to

894
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:08,800
these Jes and that's what I was able to
 

895
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,680
these Jes and that's what I was able to
pull off here so that's kind of nice

896
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:10,690
pull off here so that's kind of nice
 

897
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,540
pull off here so that's kind of nice
alright so let's start doing the

898
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:12,550
alright so let's start doing the
 

899
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,370
alright so let's start doing the
redstone part of this so we're going to

900
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:14,380
redstone part of this so we're going to
 

901
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,670
redstone part of this so we're going to
remove this temporarily all right so to

902
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:17,680
remove this temporarily all right so to
 

903
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,530
remove this temporarily all right so to
place the shocker box of course you have

904
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:19,540
place the shocker box of course you have
 

905
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,240
place the shocker box of course you have
to use a dispenser and that's going to

906
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,250
to use a dispenser and that's going to
 

907
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,390
to use a dispenser and that's going to
go on this side here on the right side

908
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
go on this side here on the right side
 

909
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,230
go on this side here on the right side
if you're facing this way and we want to

910
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
if you're facing this way and we want to
 

911
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,659
if you're facing this way and we want to
fill this up with empty shelter boxes

912
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:30,669
fill this up with empty shelter boxes
 

913
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:32,759
fill this up with empty shelter boxes
so from this chest our empty chakra box

914
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:32,769
so from this chest our empty chakra box
 

915
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:37,109
so from this chest our empty chakra box
chest we will run a hopper here into the

916
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:37,119
chest we will run a hopper here into the
 

917
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,590
chest we will run a hopper here into the
dispenser from there and that's the main

918
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:40,600
dispenser from there and that's the main
 

919
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,119
dispenser from there and that's the main
reason for these stairs just to hide

920
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:42,129
reason for these stairs just to hide
 

921
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:44,249
reason for these stairs just to hide
that hopper so it's not it's not ugly

922
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:44,259
that hopper so it's not it's not ugly
 

923
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:48,570
that hopper so it's not it's not ugly
there alright and to break the shocker

924
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:48,580
there alright and to break the shocker
 

925
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,970
there alright and to break the shocker
box that's a big thing place break

926
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:50,980
box that's a big thing place break
 

927
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,070
box that's a big thing place break
pickup you got to have all three of

928
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,080
pickup you got to have all three of
 

929
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,289
pickup you got to have all three of
those things I'm going to use an

930
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:55,299
those things I'm going to use an
 

931
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:57,359
those things I'm going to use an
upside-down slab there and a sticky

932
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:57,369
upside-down slab there and a sticky
 

933
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:01,169
upside-down slab there and a sticky
piston to push that down into it like a

934
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:01,179
piston to push that down into it like a
 

935
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:06,690
piston to push that down into it like a
so alright and let's see here what we

936
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:06,700
so alright and let's see here what we
 

937
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,019
so alright and let's see here what we
got to do actually that should probably

938
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:10,029
got to do actually that should probably
 

939
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:13,320
got to do actually that should probably
be a quartz block yeah what we got to do

940
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,330
be a quartz block yeah what we got to do
 

941
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,659
be a quartz block yeah what we got to do
here is the rest of the Redstone I'll

942
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:15,669
here is the rest of the Redstone I'll
 

943
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,940
here is the rest of the Redstone I'll
probably do on this is get a signal out

944
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:17,950
probably do on this is get a signal out
 

945
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,729
probably do on this is get a signal out
of the Shocker box we need to detect

946
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:20,739
of the Shocker box we need to detect
 

947
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,830
of the Shocker box we need to detect
when it's full of items right so we're

948
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:22,840
when it's full of items right so we're
 

949
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,479
when it's full of items right so we're
going to use a comparator over here

950
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:24,489
going to use a comparator over here
 

951
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:27,269
going to use a comparator over here
chakra box will be here will read that

952
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:27,279
chakra box will be here will read that
 

953
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,739
chakra box will be here will read that
signal and we need to do a subtraction

954
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:31,749
signal and we need to do a subtraction
 

955
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:34,289
signal and we need to do a subtraction
thing here so we need another comparator

956
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:34,299
thing here so we need another comparator
 

957
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:38,369
thing here so we need another comparator
on subtract mode and we want this

958
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:38,379
on subtract mode and we want this
 

959
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:43,889
on subtract mode and we want this
powered at 15 so 15 on this one and 15

960
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:43,899
powered at 15 so 15 on this one and 15
 

961
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:47,460
powered at 15 so 15 on this one and 15
on this one 15 minus 15 is 0 so that

962
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:47,470
on this one 15 minus 15 is 0 so that
 

963
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,470
on this one 15 minus 15 is 0 so that
will make this redstone torch shut off

964
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:51,480
will make this redstone torch shut off
 

965
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,749
will make this redstone torch shut off
when this box is totally full is

966
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:54,759
when this box is totally full is
 

967
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,629
when this box is totally full is
basically what we're going for here

968
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:56,639
basically what we're going for here
 

969
00:22:56,639 --> 00:23:00,739
basically what we're going for here
all right Oh memories starting to fade

970
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:00,749
all right Oh memories starting to fade
 

971
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:05,180
all right Oh memories starting to fade
how did I do this I don't know um

972
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,190
how did I do this I don't know um
 

973
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:12,299
how did I do this I don't know um
Oh might need to pause I think I had a

974
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:12,309
Oh might need to pause I think I had a
 

975
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:15,869
Oh might need to pause I think I had a
repeater here I'm gonna pause yeah

976
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:15,879
repeater here I'm gonna pause yeah
 

977
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:17,340
repeater here I'm gonna pause yeah
probably a good thing I did that because

978
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:17,350
probably a good thing I did that because
 

979
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,529
probably a good thing I did that because
I would have got it wrong otherwise now

980
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:19,539
I would have got it wrong otherwise now
 

981
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:20,999
I would have got it wrong otherwise now
what we actually got to do here is to

982
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:21,009
what we actually got to do here is to
 

983
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:24,690
what we actually got to do here is to
put a server block right over here

984
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:24,700
put a server block right over here
 

985
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,720
put a server block right over here
detector side facing up and then we put

986
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:27,730
detector side facing up and then we put
 

987
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,989
detector side facing up and then we put
another block here and then the repeater

988
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:30,999
another block here and then the repeater
 

989
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:35,310
another block here and then the repeater
set at 2 and the redstone dust from this

990
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:35,320
set at 2 and the redstone dust from this
 

991
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,919
set at 2 and the redstone dust from this
torch here so basically when this box

992
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:37,929
torch here so basically when this box
 

993
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:40,499
torch here so basically when this box
fills up a stuff it's going to tell this

994
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:40,509
fills up a stuff it's going to tell this
 

995
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:44,009
fills up a stuff it's going to tell this
piston to go down break it but that does

996
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:44,019
piston to go down break it but that does
 

997
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:44,680
piston to go down break it but that does
not

998
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:44,690
not
 

999
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,450
not
date this comparator when the Box

1000
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:46,460
date this comparator when the Box
 

1001
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,070
date this comparator when the Box
disappears in order to do that we use

1002
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,080
disappears in order to do that we use
 

1003
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,469
disappears in order to do that we use
this observer block it sends a signal to

1004
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:50,479
this observer block it sends a signal to
 

1005
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,029
this observer block it sends a signal to
it and that tells this comparator to

1006
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:52,039
it and that tells this comparator to
 

1007
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:55,060
it and that tells this comparator to
shut off kind of a weird thing but

1008
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,070
shut off kind of a weird thing but
 

1009
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,879
shut off kind of a weird thing but
that's just redstone for you all right

1010
00:23:57,879 --> 00:23:57,889
that's just redstone for you all right
 

1011
00:23:57,889 --> 00:24:00,849
that's just redstone for you all right
so now what we want to do is tell this

1012
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:00,859
so now what we want to do is tell this
 

1013
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:03,279
so now what we want to do is tell this
dispenser to shoot out at another box to

1014
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:03,289
dispenser to shoot out at another box to
 

1015
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:05,310
dispenser to shoot out at another box to
take the place of the one missing

1016
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:05,320
take the place of the one missing
 

1017
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,629
take the place of the one missing
so from this redstone torch we're going

1018
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:07,639
so from this redstone torch we're going
 

1019
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:10,599
so from this redstone torch we're going
to run a couple repeaters here this one

1020
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:10,609
to run a couple repeaters here this one
 

1021
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:12,820
to run a couple repeaters here this one
we will set two for this one we will set

1022
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:12,830
we will set two for this one we will set
 

1023
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,820
we will set two for this one we will set
to three and then last thing we got to

1024
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:15,830
to three and then last thing we got to
 

1025
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,769
to three and then last thing we got to
do here is control the locking on this

1026
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:17,779
do here is control the locking on this
 

1027
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:20,080
do here is control the locking on this
hopper here so it doesn't steal the

1028
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,090
hopper here so it doesn't steal the
 

1029
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,389
hopper here so it doesn't steal the
items out of the Shocker boxes we just

1030
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:22,399
items out of the Shocker boxes we just
 

1031
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:24,719
items out of the Shocker boxes we just
want to pick up the box when we break it

1032
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:24,729
want to pick up the box when we break it
 

1033
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:36,129
want to pick up the box when we break it
so to do that um from from this block

1034
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:36,139
so to do that um from from this block
 

1035
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:38,399
so to do that um from from this block
here that the comparator is going into

1036
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:38,409
here that the comparator is going into
 

1037
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:43,180
here that the comparator is going into
we get the signal and we run it this way

1038
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,190
we get the signal and we run it this way
 

1039
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,119
we get the signal and we run it this way
I think we set this at three actually I

1040
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:46,129
I think we set this at three actually I
 

1041
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:48,430
I think we set this at three actually I
know we set this at three and then that

1042
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:48,440
know we set this at three and then that
 

1043
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,169
know we set this at three and then that
goes to this hopper here and that locks

1044
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:50,179
goes to this hopper here and that locks
 

1045
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:52,330
goes to this hopper here and that locks
it so no items we put in the shelter box

1046
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:52,340
it so no items we put in the shelter box
 

1047
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,619
it so no items we put in the shelter box
are going to go into that hopper all

1048
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:56,629
are going to go into that hopper all
 

1049
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:58,479
are going to go into that hopper all
right cool and that's the whole thing

1050
00:24:58,479 --> 00:24:58,489
right cool and that's the whole thing
 

1051
00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:00,879
right cool and that's the whole thing
here let's let's actually look at it

1052
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:00,889
here let's let's actually look at it
 

1053
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:03,820
here let's let's actually look at it
from a distance here this is hard to

1054
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:03,830
from a distance here this is hard to
 

1055
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,239
from a distance here this is hard to
figure it out that's not the whole thing

1056
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:06,249
figure it out that's not the whole thing
 

1057
00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:09,940
figure it out that's not the whole thing
in order to fill up the shelter box what

1058
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:09,950
in order to fill up the shelter box what
 

1059
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,129
in order to fill up the shelter box what
you can do is run a hopper right over

1060
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:12,139
you can do is run a hopper right over
 

1061
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:15,039
you can do is run a hopper right over
here so from from that chest there I

1062
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:15,049
here so from from that chest there I
 

1063
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,349
here so from from that chest there I
would run a hopper down here so I just

1064
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:17,359
would run a hopper down here so I just
 

1065
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,409
would run a hopper down here so I just
about got this too wide it's three wide

1066
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:20,419
about got this too wide it's three wide
 

1067
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,479
about got this too wide it's three wide
though technically but we got a lot of

1068
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:22,489
though technically but we got a lot of
 

1069
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:24,009
though technically but we got a lot of
space here so it makes it easy to run

1070
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:24,019
space here so it makes it easy to run
 

1071
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:26,759
space here so it makes it easy to run
hoppers to it which is nice as well oh

1072
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:26,769
hoppers to it which is nice as well oh
 

1073
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:28,989
hoppers to it which is nice as well oh
yeah one other thing I like to do with

1074
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:28,999
yeah one other thing I like to do with
 

1075
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:30,700
yeah one other thing I like to do with
this is put a button over here so we can

1076
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,710
this is put a button over here so we can
 

1077
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,940
this is put a button over here so we can
Auto eject stuff from the dispenser nice

1078
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:33,950
Auto eject stuff from the dispenser nice
 

1079
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,129
Auto eject stuff from the dispenser nice
and easy but we should be able to place

1080
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:36,139
and easy but we should be able to place
 

1081
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:38,739
and easy but we should be able to place
the Shocker box here let's get a couple

1082
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:38,749
the Shocker box here let's get a couple
 

1083
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:43,330
the Shocker box here let's get a couple
of them in there empty ones empty shell

1084
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:43,340
of them in there empty ones empty shell
 

1085
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,119
of them in there empty ones empty shell
core box is go up here to place our

1086
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:46,129
core box is go up here to place our
 

1087
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:48,399
core box is go up here to place our
first one you can use the button we can

1088
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,409
first one you can use the button we can
 

1089
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:50,139
first one you can use the button we can
open it still because the upside-down

1090
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:50,149
open it still because the upside-down
 

1091
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,749
open it still because the upside-down
slab above it and you'll notice it

1092
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:52,759
slab above it and you'll notice it
 

1093
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,119
slab above it and you'll notice it
placed it upright so it opens upwards if

1094
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:55,129
placed it upright so it opens upwards if
 

1095
00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:57,489
placed it upright so it opens upwards if
you have a block below this even though

1096
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:57,499
you have a block below this even though
 

1097
00:25:57,499 --> 00:25:58,090
you have a block below this even though
the

1098
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:58,100
the
 

1099
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,279
the
spencer's sideways at always places its

1100
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:00,289
spencer's sideways at always places its
 

1101
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:04,900
spencer's sideways at always places its
upright okay guys so you can see here we

1102
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:04,910
upright okay guys so you can see here we
 

1103
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,930
upright okay guys so you can see here we
got our box loader connected to the

1104
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:07,940
got our box loader connected to the
 

1105
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,090
got our box loader connected to the
zombie flesh chest from our item filter

1106
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,100
zombie flesh chest from our item filter
 

1107
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,630
zombie flesh chest from our item filter
up there from the from the gold farm

1108
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:12,640
up there from the from the gold farm
 

1109
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,130
up there from the from the gold farm
which isn't really running while we're

1110
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:15,140
which isn't really running while we're
 

1111
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,650
which isn't really running while we're
down here so just for this test I filled

1112
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:17,660
down here so just for this test I filled
 

1113
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,110
down here so just for this test I filled
up that chest there with some zombie

1114
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,120
up that chest there with some zombie
 

1115
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,770
up that chest there with some zombie
flesh and it's funneling into here to

1116
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:23,780
flesh and it's funneling into here to
 

1117
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,270
flesh and it's funneling into here to
speed this up even further I'm going to

1118
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:25,280
speed this up even further I'm going to
 

1119
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,390
speed this up even further I'm going to
manually put a few more into here just

1120
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:27,400
manually put a few more into here just
 

1121
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,680
manually put a few more into here just
to get it to that point where it's just

1122
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:29,690
to get it to that point where it's just
 

1123
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,310
to get it to that point where it's just
about to switch over alright so just a

1124
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:33,320
about to switch over alright so just a
 

1125
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,630
about to switch over alright so just a
few more until this fills up you see it

1126
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:37,640
few more until this fills up you see it
 

1127
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,730
few more until this fills up you see it
breaks it places a new empty one there

1128
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:39,740
breaks it places a new empty one there
 

1129
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,630
breaks it places a new empty one there
that full one goes down into here and

1130
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
that full one goes down into here and
 

1131
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,090
that full one goes down into here and
it'll keep doing that until it runs out

1132
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:46,100
it'll keep doing that until it runs out
 

1133
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,970
it'll keep doing that until it runs out
of these empty chests so I load it in a

1134
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:48,980
of these empty chests so I load it in a
 

1135
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,080
of these empty chests so I load it in a
few from up here those go down into here

1136
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,090
few from up here those go down into here
 

1137
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,940
few from up here those go down into here
and we could have up to a double chest

1138
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:54,950
and we could have up to a double chest
 

1139
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,580
and we could have up to a double chest
of shelter boxes in here and a double

1140
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:57,590
of shelter boxes in here and a double
 

1141
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,620
of shelter boxes in here and a double
chest the full ones down here so that's

1142
00:26:59,620 --> 00:26:59,630
chest the full ones down here so that's
 

1143
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:02,159
chest the full ones down here so that's
a lot of storage in a small area but

1144
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:02,169
a lot of storage in a small area but
 

1145
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:05,350
a lot of storage in a small area but
those are very expensive as we saw so

1146
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:05,360
those are very expensive as we saw so
 

1147
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,299
those are very expensive as we saw so
I'd probably only have a few in here but

1148
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:07,309
I'd probably only have a few in here but
 

1149
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:11,909
I'd probably only have a few in here but
there's potential to put more if I want

1150
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
there's potential to put more if I want
 

1151
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,620
there's potential to put more if I want
alright guys well unfortunately it is

1152
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:14,630
alright guys well unfortunately it is
 

1153
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,260
alright guys well unfortunately it is
that time again I was actually planning

1154
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:17,270
that time again I was actually planning
 

1155
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,730
that time again I was actually planning
on building the unloader with you

1156
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:18,740
on building the unloader with you
 

1157
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,770
on building the unloader with you
designing it together but that will have

1158
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:20,780
designing it together but that will have
 

1159
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,250
designing it together but that will have
to wait for another episode it seems but

1160
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:24,260
to wait for another episode it seems but
 

1161
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,960
to wait for another episode it seems but
hopefully you find that loader useful I

1162
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:25,970
hopefully you find that loader useful I
 

1163
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,390
hopefully you find that loader useful I
have a lot of cases in my world like a

1164
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:28,400
have a lot of cases in my world like a
 

1165
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,330
have a lot of cases in my world like a
lot of farms like even here for example

1166
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:31,340
lot of farms like even here for example
 

1167
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,260
lot of farms like even here for example
where I'm considering adding that in

1168
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,270
where I'm considering adding that in
 

1169
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,529
where I'm considering adding that in
it's going to be like some major like

1170
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:37,539
it's going to be like some major like
 

1171
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:40,690
it's going to be like some major like
renovations so I don't know maybe over

1172
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:40,700
renovations so I don't know maybe over
 

1173
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,760
renovations so I don't know maybe over
time I'll I'll get get to switching

1174
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:42,770
time I'll I'll get get to switching
 

1175
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,789
time I'll I'll get get to switching
everything over to that could be cool

1176
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:44,799
everything over to that could be cool
 

1177
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,130
everything over to that could be cool
but here is the comment I picked out for

1178
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:48,140
but here is the comment I picked out for
 

1179
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,070
but here is the comment I picked out for
today guys it says hey ESO do you ever

1180
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,080
today guys it says hey ESO do you ever
 

1181
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,810
today guys it says hey ESO do you ever
look that and wish you didn't switch

1182
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:52,820
look that and wish you didn't switch
 

1183
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,130
look that and wish you didn't switch
your world over to amplify terrain

1184
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:56,140
your world over to amplify terrain
 

1185
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,919
your world over to amplify terrain
that's a good question you know I

1186
00:27:59,919 --> 00:27:59,929
that's a good question you know I
 

1187
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:01,840
that's a good question you know I
thought when I did that I was going to

1188
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:01,850
thought when I did that I was going to
 

1189
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,720
thought when I did that I was going to
have more issues actually it's been

1190
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:04,730
have more issues actually it's been
 

1191
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,630
have more issues actually it's been
pretty good honestly like yeah when its

1192
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:07,640
pretty good honestly like yeah when its
 

1193
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,580
pretty good honestly like yeah when its
brand new terrain and I'm generating it

1194
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:09,590
brand new terrain and I'm generating it
 

1195
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,529
brand new terrain and I'm generating it
and recording

1196
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:11,539
and recording
 

1197
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:14,529
and recording
it struggles a little bit to keep up but

1198
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:14,539
it struggles a little bit to keep up but
 

1199
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:16,479
it struggles a little bit to keep up but
after it's been generated it's usually

1200
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:16,489
after it's been generated it's usually
 

1201
00:28:16,489 --> 00:28:18,700
after it's been generated it's usually
pretty good the second time you go to

1202
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:18,710
pretty good the second time you go to
 

1203
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:23,259
pretty good the second time you go to
that area as far as like exploring

1204
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:23,269
that area as far as like exploring
 

1205
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:25,930
that area as far as like exploring
though it makes it so much more fun like

1206
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:25,940
though it makes it so much more fun like
 

1207
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,119
though it makes it so much more fun like
there's a lot of amazing sights I see I

1208
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:28,129
there's a lot of amazing sights I see I
 

1209
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:31,149
there's a lot of amazing sights I see I
wish I could include them all in like

1210
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:31,159
wish I could include them all in like
 

1211
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:34,450
wish I could include them all in like
like that episode I did last time I saw

1212
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:34,460
like that episode I did last time I saw
 

1213
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,239
like that episode I did last time I saw
some really cool stuff but only had so

1214
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:37,249
some really cool stuff but only had so
 

1215
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:41,049
some really cool stuff but only had so
much time to show it and with the wings

1216
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:41,059
much time to show it and with the wings
 

1217
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:43,060
much time to show it and with the wings
it's a lot of fun flying through all the

1218
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,070
it's a lot of fun flying through all the
 

1219
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,119
it's a lot of fun flying through all the
tunnels and crazy overhangs and stuff it

1220
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:46,129
tunnels and crazy overhangs and stuff it
 

1221
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:48,999
tunnels and crazy overhangs and stuff it
makes so no I don't regret it I really

1222
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:49,009
makes so no I don't regret it I really
 

1223
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:51,249
makes so no I don't regret it I really
do like the amplified train still and I

1224
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:51,259
do like the amplified train still and I
 

1225
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:53,019
do like the amplified train still and I
love having the mix in my world so I got

1226
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:53,029
love having the mix in my world so I got
 

1227
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:55,599
love having the mix in my world so I got
flat spots where I can do building or if

1228
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:55,609
flat spots where I can do building or if
 

1229
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,580
flat spots where I can do building or if
I want I can go to the amplified terrain

1230
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:57,590
I want I can go to the amplified terrain
 

1231
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,430
I want I can go to the amplified terrain
it is hard to build an amplified terrain

1232
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:00,440
it is hard to build an amplified terrain
 

1233
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,210
it is hard to build an amplified terrain
I have found though maybe with some

1234
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:04,220
I have found though maybe with some
 

1235
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,159
I have found though maybe with some
practice you could get better at it but

1236
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:06,169
practice you could get better at it but
 

1237
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:08,320
practice you could get better at it but
I'm I'm not there yet I still need

1238
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:08,330
I'm I'm not there yet I still need
 

1239
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,310
I'm I'm not there yet I still need
practice but I'm working at it hopefully

1240
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,320
practice but I'm working at it hopefully
 

1241
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,009
practice but I'm working at it hopefully
