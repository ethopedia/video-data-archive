i think

36
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
i think
 

37
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,790
i think
and i know you guys get tired i've seen

38
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
and i know you guys get tired i've seen
 

39

and i know you guys get tired i've seen
the same thing over and over

40
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
the same thing over and over
 

41
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,389
the same thing over and over
uh that's kind of the challenge of doing

42
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
uh that's kind of the challenge of doing
 

43
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,470
uh that's kind of the challenge of doing
this youtube stuff it's like

this youtube stuff it's like
 

45
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,950
this youtube stuff it's like
each of these projects i do i could like

46
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
each of these projects i do i could like
 

47
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,270
each of these projects i do i could like
if i if i just recorded in real time it

48
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
if i if i just recorded in real time it
 

49
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,469
if i if i just recorded in real time it
would probably fill

50
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
would probably fill
 

51
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,469
would probably fill
at least 10 episodes like this thing

52
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
at least 10 episodes like this thing
 

53

00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
relatively small project
 

57
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,749
relatively small project
it takes time so one of the benefits of

58
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
it takes time so one of the benefits of
 

59
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,070
it takes time so one of the benefits of
having lots of different projects going

60
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
having lots of different projects going
 

61
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,870
having lots of different projects going
on at the same time is i can

return to them weeks later and they
 

65
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,710
return to them weeks later and they

00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
with my mob system they
 

169
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,550
with my mob system they
they spawn more frequently for sure

170
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,550
drops here so they're spawning in my
system too

196
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
system too
 

197
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,430
system too

won't jam anything
let's see

206
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320

 

207
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,830

um well i've been underground for a
while maybe let's go look up

214
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
while maybe let's go look up
 

215
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,790
while maybe let's go look up
at the top again

216
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
at the top again
 

217
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,310
at the top again
and see just how many slimes are around

218
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320

 

219
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,430

220
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
let's see so in this
 

221
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,350
let's see so in this
snapshot there's a little bit of a bug

222
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
snapshot there's a little bit of a bug
 

223
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,710
snapshot there's a little bit of a bug
with

224
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
with
 

225
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,550
with
with breaking blocks but that's going to

226
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
with breaking blocks but that's going to
 

227
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,550
with breaking blocks but that's going to
get fixed i think tomorrow from what

228
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
get fixed i think tomorrow from what
 

229
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:08,070
get fixed i think tomorrow from what
i've heard

230
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080

 

231
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,749

i think we need to do something about
 

301
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,790
i think we need to do something about
that um

302
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
that um
 

303
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,230
that um
i asked what i should do about it and

304
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
i asked what i should do about it and
 

305
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,309
i asked what i should do about it and
one guy said well it's hard to know

306
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
one guy said well it's hard to know
 

307
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,029
one guy said well it's hard to know
unless you show us the walls and i don't

308
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
unless you show us the walls and i don't
 

309
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,270
unless you show us the walls and i don't
know what i'm doing with the walls so

310
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
know what i'm doing with the walls so
 

311
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,150
know what i'm doing with the walls so
let's play around with that i do know

312
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,160
let's play around with that i do know
 

313
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,830
let's play around with that i do know
with these arches i want them to stick

314
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
with these arches i want them to stick
 

315
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,510
with these arches i want them to stick
out so i want the wall

316
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520

 

317
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,629

at this level okay so that gives us

318
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
at this level okay so that gives us
 

319
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,189
at this level okay so that gives us
one block here on the ground

320
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
one block here on the ground
 

321
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,550
one block here on the ground
um maybe okay

322
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
um maybe okay
 

323
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,510
um maybe okay
so i got i got snow how's it look if we

324
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
so i got i got snow how's it look if we
 

325
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,309
so i got i got snow how's it look if we
put snow on the walls

326
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
put snow on the walls
 

327
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,469
put snow on the walls
probably not too good but

328
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479

 

329
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,510

oh those bats aren't that smart

330
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
oh those bats aren't that smart
 

331
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,150
oh those bats aren't that smart
they do that all the time

332
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160

 

333
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,430

can i do this yeah

334
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
can i do this yeah
 

335
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:01,350
can i do this yeah
just we'll just set this up and see

336
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360

 

337
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,070

that's what it would look like as snow

338
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080

 

339
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,589

not as bad as i thought it would be um

340
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
not as bad as i thought it would be um
 

341
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:16,390
not as bad as i thought it would be um
anyway snow

342
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400

 

343
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,510

oopsies

344
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520

 

345
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,670

uh maybe let's try ice too

346

challenging because again you got to
 

351
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,029
challenging because again you got to
worry about it melting always

352
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039

sandstone and i replaced the snow
 

375
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,710
sandstone and i replaced the snow
like i would replace the snow rings with

376

like i would replace the snow rings with
 

377
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,230
like i would replace the snow rings with

here
 

399
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,910
here
see we could go

400
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920

 

401
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,430

403
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,110

go out like this

404
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120

661
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,389

i think what like i've tried i've tried

662
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
i think what like i've tried i've tried
 

663
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,749
i think what like i've tried i've tried
like

664
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:01,759
like
 

665
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,710
like
just to find the time by recording me

666
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
just to find the time by recording me
 

667
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,749
just to find the time by recording me
making the map

668
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759
making the map
 

669
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,670
making the map
as i'm doing it and then plan to release

670
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
as i'm doing it and then plan to release
 

671
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,870
as i'm doing it and then plan to release
it later

672
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
it later
 

673
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,870
it later
so i don't spoil the map for anybody but

674
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
so i don't spoil the map for anybody but
 

675
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,870
so i don't spoil the map for anybody but
that's that's not working for me either

676
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
that's that's not working for me either
 

677
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,110
that's that's not working for me either
i still

678
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120

still just let it hang
 

681
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,949
still just let it hang
so i don't know maybe it's just a dream

682
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
so i don't know maybe it's just a dream
 

683
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,710
so i don't know maybe it's just a dream

um i think i gotta stop building with
 

727
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,470
um i think i gotta stop building with
stairs and stuff so much i need to

728
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
stairs and stuff so much i need to
 

729
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,909
stairs and stuff so much i need to
try new stuff again i really like it

735
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,029

like i like building with stairs and

736
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
like i like building with stairs and
 

737
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,870
like i like building with stairs and
half slabs but that limits me to what i

738
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
half slabs but that limits me to what i
 

739
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,110
half slabs but that limits me to what i
can actually use for blocks and

740
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
can actually use for blocks and
 

741
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,909
can actually use for blocks and
everything ends up looking the same so

742
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
everything ends up looking the same so
 

743
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,350
everything ends up looking the same so
in the future i might try different

744
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,360
in the future i might try different
 

745
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,270
in the future i might try different
stuff i'm really liking using

746
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
stuff i'm really liking using
 

747
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,310
stuff i'm really liking using
those stone slabs again they've been in

748
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
those stone slabs again they've been in
 

749
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,510
those stone slabs again they've been in
the game forever but i

750
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
the game forever but i
 

751
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,430
the game forever but i
just really started to appreciate them

752
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440

 

753
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,590

but anyway you're probably getting bored

754
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
but anyway you're probably getting bored
 

755
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,750
but anyway you're probably getting bored
of me bored of watching me do this so

756
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:01,760
of me bored of watching me do this so
 

757
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,390
of me bored of watching me do this so
let's

758
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400
let's
 

759
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,590
let's
let's go do something else

760
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:09,600

 

761
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,190

i want to see how close i can get to

762
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
i want to see how close i can get to
 

763
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,270
i want to see how close i can get to
this bat before he takes off

764
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280

 

765
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,350

771
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,590

that's only like three or four blocks

772
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600
that's only like three or four blocks
 

773
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,110
that's only like three or four blocks
i'd say

774
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120
i'd say
 

775
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,350
i'd say
you can get pretty close to those guys

776
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,360

 

777
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,789

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,360
sometimes get my face when i'm down here
 

783
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,390
sometimes get my face when i'm down here
anyway i i finished

787
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,710
i didn't finish but i did the other two
you do the corners got to do these coves

788
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720
you do the corners got to do these coves
 

789
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,950
you do the corners got to do these coves
lots and lots of wood required uh let me

something else i think uh

800
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,280
something else i think uh
 

801
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,510
something else i think uh
maybe we'll play around with the beacon

802
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520

 

803
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,270

so once again in this new snapshot

804
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
so once again in this new snapshot
 

805
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,110
so once again in this new snapshot
the beacon has gotten another makeover i

806
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
the beacon has gotten another makeover i
 

807
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,270
the beacon has gotten another makeover i
think this is it's

808
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
think this is it's
 

809
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,630
think this is it's
it's at least a second i think it might

810
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
it's at least a second i think it might
 

811
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,310
it's at least a second i think it might
be the third time i know this is the

812
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
be the third time i know this is the
 

813
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,150
be the third time i know this is the
third time for the beam

814
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,160
third time for the beam
 

815
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,350
third time for the beam
so this is what it looks like now

816
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
so this is what it looks like now
 

817
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,230
so this is what it looks like now
pretty cool i like it oh oops

818
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,240
pretty cool i like it oh oops
 

819
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,830
pretty cool i like it oh oops
um i've actually like pretty much liked

820
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
um i've actually like pretty much liked
 

821
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,350
um i've actually like pretty much liked
them all so far i don't know why they

822
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:43,360
them all so far i don't know why they
 

823
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,950
them all so far i don't know why they
keep changing them

824
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:46,960

 

825
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,909

um so i think i'm gonna put it over here

826
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919
um so i think i'm gonna put it over here
 

827
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,270
um so i think i'm gonna put it over here
actually i'm gonna have like a beacon

828
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
actually i'm gonna have like a beacon
 

829
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,230
actually i'm gonna have like a beacon
room

830
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
room
 

831
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,350
room
uh it works out pretty perfect

832
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
uh it works out pretty perfect
 

833
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,630
uh it works out pretty perfect
we're gonna do the full scale one so

834
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
we're gonna do the full scale one so
 

835
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,750
we're gonna do the full scale one so
we'll have 40 blocks all around it

836
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
we'll have 40 blocks all around it
 

837
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,270
we'll have 40 blocks all around it
in a square cube i should say

838
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,280
in a square cube i should say
 

839
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,950
in a square cube i should say
uh 40 block radius so at 320

840
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
uh 40 block radius so at 320
 

841
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,950
uh 40 block radius so at 320
160 that should cover just about

842
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:12,960
160 that should cover just about
 

843
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,190
160 that should cover just about
everything in my base all the way up to

844
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,200

 

845
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,750

here i think

846
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,760
here i think
 

847
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,789
here i think
what did i say 160

848
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
what did i say 160
 

849
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,310
what did i say 160
oh where are we oh there we are

850
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
oh where are we oh there we are
 

851
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:35,510
oh where are we oh there we are
um yeah so up to about here

852
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:35,520
um yeah so up to about here
 

853
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,350
um yeah so up to about here
going this way and then it should go i

854
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
going this way and then it should go i
 

855
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,950
going this way and then it should go i
think all the way up to my tree farm i

856
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
think all the way up to my tree farm i
 

857
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,470
think all the way up to my tree farm i
measured

858
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
measured
 

859
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,830
measured

part to be covered 340. we can always

862
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
part to be covered 340. we can always
 

863
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,630
part to be covered 340. we can always
move it if it doesn't work out

864
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:48,640
move it if it doesn't work out
 

865
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,190
move it if it doesn't work out
storage room is it covered yeah so 320 3

866
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,200
storage room is it covered yeah so 320 3
 

867
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,590
storage room is it covered yeah so 320 3
360 up to about here is it cut off so

868
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,600
360 up to about here is it cut off so
 

869
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,070
360 up to about here is it cut off so
that works out pretty good

870
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
that works out pretty good
 

871
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,149
that works out pretty good
pretty much in the middle of everything

872
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:00,159
pretty much in the middle of everything
 

873
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,390
pretty much in the middle of everything
i've built here

874
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400

 

875
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,390

um i don't know what the beam looks like

876
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
um i don't know what the beam looks like
 

877
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,510
um i don't know what the beam looks like
i'm curious i would have like

878
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
i'm curious i would have like
 

879
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,029
i'm curious i would have like
so far the beams have all been white i

880
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
so far the beams have all been white i
 

881
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,470
so far the beams have all been white i
kind of think it'd be cool if they did a

882
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:14,480
kind of think it'd be cool if they did a
 

883
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,510
kind of think it'd be cool if they did a
purple beam

884
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
purple beam
 

885
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,190
purple beam
because you know like ender chests and

886
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,200
because you know like ender chests and
 

887
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,789
because you know like ender chests and
that they have the purple particle

888
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:20,799
that they have the purple particle
 

889
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,350
that they have the purple particle
effect

890
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
effect
 

891
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,549
effect
it's kind of like what they're using to

892
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:24,559
it's kind of like what they're using to
 

893
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,870
it's kind of like what they're using to
to represent energy in this game

894
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:28,880

 

895
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,750

and purple looks cooler than white white

896
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
and purple looks cooler than white white
 

897
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,270
and purple looks cooler than white white

we'll see but i'm i think i want
the base of the beacon here so i'm going

918
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
the base of the beacon here so i'm going
 

919
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,270
the base of the beacon here so i'm going
to dig down and put the pyramid

920
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,280
to dig down and put the pyramid
 

921
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,630
to dig down and put the pyramid
like five blocks lower than this

922
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:08,640
like five blocks lower than this
 

923
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,149
like five blocks lower than this
and this is actually not the first time

924
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
and this is actually not the first time
 

925
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,990
and this is actually not the first time
i've done this today i've i set up a

i've done this today i've i set up a
 

927
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,390
i've done this today i've i set up a
beacon earlier on minecraft

928
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,400
beacon earlier on minecraft
 

929
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,070
beacon earlier on minecraft
but you'll probably see that tomorrow

930
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,080

 

931
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,549

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
nothing of
 

935
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,470
nothing of
importance underneath here

936
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,480

many many many problems it seems
 

941
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,990
many many many problems it seems
we have the mushroom farm over here we

942
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,000
we have the mushroom farm over here we
 

943
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,070
we have the mushroom farm over here we
have the greenhouse

944

have the greenhouse
 

945
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,870
have the greenhouse
below here one of the walls is here

946
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880

 

947
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,310

you can see through the cave so we got a

948
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,320
you can see through the cave so we got a
 

949
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,710
you can see through the cave so we got a
wall

950
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:50,720
wall
 

951
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,750
wall
basically we can't go any

952
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:53,760
basically we can't go any
 

953
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,190
basically we can't go any

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,350

the base of the pyramid for what i have

958
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
the base of the pyramid for what i have
 

959
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,110
the base of the pyramid for what i have
planned is supposed to be 11 by 11

960
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120
planned is supposed to be 11 by 11
 

961
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,190
planned is supposed to be 11 by 11
and that is not going to fit down there

962
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,200
and that is not going to fit down there
 

963
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,110
and that is not going to fit down there
and i wanted

964
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,120
and i wanted
 

965
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,789
and i wanted
it to be like five blocks underground

966
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
it to be like five blocks underground
 

967
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,470
it to be like five blocks underground
this is only

968
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,480
this is only
 

969
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,190
this is only
one two three four

970
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,200

 

971
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,029

so and we have the potion room here

972
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:23,039
so and we have the potion room here
 

973
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,789
so and we have the potion room here
so i'm not quite sure what to do i think

974
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:26,799
so i'm not quite sure what to do i think
 

975
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,789
so i'm not quite sure what to do i think
we might have to put it above ground

976
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:28,799
we might have to put it above ground
 

977
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,070
we might have to put it above ground
actually

978
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,080
actually
 

979
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,549
actually
let's just let's check above here

980
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559

 

981
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,350

this is the ideal position is the thing

982
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,360
this is the ideal position is the thing
 

983
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,350
this is the ideal position is the thing
i would like to have it here

984
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,360
i would like to have it here
 

985
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,789
i would like to have it here
just wish that worked out a little

986
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
just wish that worked out a little
 

987
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:47,909
just wish that worked out a little
better

988
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:47,919

 

989
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,190

i just want to see where it takes us

990
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
i just want to see where it takes us
 

991
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,070
i just want to see where it takes us
outside sounds like it's nighttime

992
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,080

 

993

oh no spiders have just been
 

995
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,789
oh no spiders have just been
tracking us this whole time and the

996
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
tracking us this whole time and the
 

997
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,029
tracking us this whole time and the
creepers

998
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:03,039
creepers
 

999
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:10,310
creepers
where are we

1000
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320

 

1001
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,710

built here

1004
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,080
built here
 

1005
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,470
built here
so yeah maybe we'll put the beacon above

1006
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
so yeah maybe we'll put the beacon above
 

1007
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,310
so yeah maybe we'll put the beacon above
ground

1008
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
ground
 

1009
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,430
ground
instead of underground don't really know

1010
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,440
instead of underground don't really know
 

1011
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,630
instead of underground don't really know
how else i could do it

1012
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:28,640
how else i could do it
 

1013

matter if it's symmetrical or anything
 

1035
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,750

uh since we've changed positions i'm

1036
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
uh since we've changed positions i'm
 

1037
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,710
uh since we've changed positions i'm
only gonna have

1038
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720
only gonna have
 

1039
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,950
only gonna have
four beacons one of them will be for

1040
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
four beacons one of them will be for
 

1041
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,390
four beacons one of them will be for
speed

1042
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:06,400
speed
 

1043
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,789
speed
one for haste one for jumping and

1044
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:10,799
one for haste one for jumping and
 

1045
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,870
one for haste one for jumping and
maybe regen i'm not sure what i'm gonna

1046
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
maybe regen i'm not sure what i'm gonna
 

1047
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,470
maybe regen i'm not sure what i'm gonna
do for the fourth one

1048
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:14,480
do for the fourth one
 

1049
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,950
do for the fourth one
so i only need a 10 by 10 base and i've

1050
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:16,960
so i only need a 10 by 10 base and i've
 

1051
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,590
so i only need a 10 by 10 base and i've
got it

1052
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
got it
 

1053
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,190
got it
all already here

1054
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,200

 

1055
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,789

you can see the room down below it's

1056
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
you can see the room down below it's
 

1057
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,510
you can see the room down below it's
like five blocks below so

1058
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,520
like five blocks below so
 

1059
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,350
like five blocks below so
whatever i do put down there i want to

1060
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
whatever i do put down there i want to
 

1061
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,190
whatever i do put down there i want to
make sure i have room for a ceiling

1062
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,200

 

1063
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,350

a little bit of a buffer so yeah just

1064
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
a little bit of a buffer so yeah just
 

1065
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,110
a little bit of a buffer so yeah just
fill it in

1066
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,120
fill it in
 

1067
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,990
fill it in
i'm going to put obsidian over this as

1068
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
i'm going to put obsidian over this as
 

1069
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,149
i'm going to put obsidian over this as
well probably so if a creeper does blow

1070
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:40,159
well probably so if a creeper does blow
 

1071
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,750
well probably so if a creeper does blow
up

1072
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:41,760
up
 

1073
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,110
up
on the ground above i think

1074
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120
on the ground above i think
 

1075
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,590
on the ground above i think
the iron will be okay and i'll probably

1076
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
the iron will be okay and i'll probably
 

1077
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,070
the iron will be okay and i'll probably
put iron bars around

1078
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
put iron bars around
 

1079
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,269
put iron bars around
the bottom of the beam too so the

1080
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
the bottom of the beam too so the
 

1081
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,909
the bottom of the beam too so the
beacons won't blow up

1082
00:25:57,909 --> 00:25:57,919

 

1083
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,310

wow that was a whole stack already oh my

1084
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,320
wow that was a whole stack already oh my
 

1085
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,909

goodness

1086
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:03,919

 

1087
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,750

1089
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,029
that's all right i got yeah i have like
at least 10 10 stacks of iron blocks

1090
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,039
at least 10 10 stacks of iron blocks
 

1091
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,310
at least 10 10 stacks of iron blocks
in my let's play here so i do not mind

1092
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,320
in my let's play here so i do not mind
 

1093
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,950
in my let's play here so i do not mind
spending a little bit

1094
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:20,960

 

1095
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,430

all right well i'll finish this up and

1096
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
all right well i'll finish this up and

1099
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,669

whoo that is pretty snazzy man look at

1100
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
whoo that is pretty snazzy man look at
 

1101
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,149
whoo that is pretty snazzy man look at
all that

1102
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:30,159
all that
 

1103
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,310
all that
iron so we're going to put the beacon on

1104
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,320
iron so we're going to put the beacon on
 

1105
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,710
iron so we're going to put the beacon on
still get some daylight i'm i'm being

1106
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:36,720
still get some daylight i'm i'm being
 

1107
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,390
still get some daylight i'm i'm being
very careful that i don't let it turn

1108
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
very careful that i don't let it turn
 

1109
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,310
very careful that i don't let it turn
night because i don't want

1110
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320
night because i don't want
 

1111
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,510
night because i don't want
any surprises while working on this

1112
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:43,520
any surprises while working on this
 

1113
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,070
any surprises while working on this
so let's check out the new beam

1114
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,080

 

1115
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,390

that is cool i really do like that

1116
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,400
that is cool i really do like that
 

1117
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,390
that is cool i really do like that
okay that's an improvement if it was

1118
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
okay that's an improvement if it was
 

1119
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,909
okay that's an improvement if it was
purple that would be

1120
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
purple that would be
 

1121
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,230
purple that would be
the ultimate but yeah i think that is

1122
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,240
the ultimate but yeah i think that is
 

1123
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,310
the ultimate but yeah i think that is
definitely better than what they had i

1124
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
definitely better than what they had i
 

1125
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,070
definitely better than what they had i
wish it would turn a little

1126
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,080
wish it would turn a little
 

1127
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,510
wish it would turn a little
quicker though

1128
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:09,520

 

1129
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,029

wonder if that would cause problems

1130
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039

 

1131
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,149

all right and the first one

1132
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
all right and the first one
 

1133
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,750
all right and the first one
did i say this is how much iron i have

1134
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:17,760
did i say this is how much iron i have
 

1135
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,870
did i say this is how much iron i have
left from what we had

1136
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:20,880
left from what we had
 

1137
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,269
left from what we had
um i think the first one i'm going to go

1138
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:23,279
um i think the first one i'm going to go
 

1139
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,389
um i think the first one i'm going to go
for

1140
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:24,399
for
 

1141
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,389
for
so i want i want jump haste speed

1142
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:28,399
so i want i want jump haste speed
 

1143
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,269
so i want i want jump haste speed
and i guess regen is what we'll go for

1144
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:31,279
and i guess regen is what we'll go for
 

1145
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,310
and i guess regen is what we'll go for
first one i'm doing

1146

1151
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,470

oh it's kicked in speed two

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,830
all the time but what i found
is the time it takes to make them

1190
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
is the time it takes to make them
 

1191
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,630
is the time it takes to make them
constantly almost negates the time you

1192
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:38,640
constantly almost negates the time you
 

1193
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,190
constantly almost negates the time you
save

1194
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,200
save
 

1195
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,870
save
from moving around faster so i sort of

1196
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:42,880
from moving around faster so i sort of
 

1197
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,470
from moving around faster so i sort of
stopped that but if

1198

1261
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,750
it shows you where it is yeah so i just
made an obsidian plate it's

1262
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
made an obsidian plate it's
 

1263
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,789
made an obsidian plate it's
it's um just

1264

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,269
over here and here it's protected
diagonally too from explosions

1268
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:23,279
diagonally too from explosions
 

1269
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,669
diagonally too from explosions
and then i'm gonna have iron bars around

1270
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:25,679
and then i'm gonna have iron bars around
 

1271
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,789
and then i'm gonna have iron bars around
here

1272
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:26,799
here
 

1273
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,590
here
maybe three to five high and then

1274
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:29,600
maybe three to five high and then
 

1275
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,430
maybe three to five high and then
obsidian around the top of that just for

1276
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
obsidian around the top of that just for
 

1277
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,510
obsidian around the top of that just for
looks

1278
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:33,520
looks
 

1279
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,110
looks
and maybe try connect it to the ground

1280
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,120
and maybe try connect it to the ground
 

1281
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,750
and maybe try connect it to the ground
somehow i don't know

1282
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:39,760
somehow i don't know
 

1283
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,549
somehow i don't know
should be pretty safe though

1284
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:44,559

 

1285
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,590

oh it's getting night again

oh it's getting night again
 

1287
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,669
oh it's getting night again
should be safe now though

1288
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:51,679
should be safe now though
 

1289
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,549
should be safe now though
all right how's that look i gotta be

1290
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:54,559
all right how's that look i gotta be
 

1291
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,149
all right how's that look i gotta be
careful with this block glitch because i

1292
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:56,159
careful with this block glitch because i
 

1293
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,669
careful with this block glitch because i
can just

1294
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:57,679
can just
 

1295
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,230
can just
instantly break obsidian i'm not careful

1298
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
that's cool so yeah i might try to
 

1299
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,789
that's cool so yeah i might try to
connect it to the ground the top part

1300
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:06,799
connect it to the ground the top part
 

1301
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,430
connect it to the ground the top part
somehow

1302
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,440
somehow
 

1303
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,549
somehow

feel like

1378
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
feel like
 

1379
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,630
feel like
putting on my headphones making sure

1380
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:44,640
putting on my headphones making sure
 

1381
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,230
putting on my headphones making sure
everything is

1382
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:46,240
everything is
 

1383
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,070
everything is
like around me is sound proof so it

1384
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,080
like around me is sound proof so it
 

1385
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,630
like around me is sound proof so it
won't interfere with my recording and

1386
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:50,640
won't interfere with my recording and
 

1387
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,630
won't interfere with my recording and
yeah so there's some laziness involved

1388
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:52,640
yeah so there's some laziness involved
 

1389
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,750
yeah so there's some laziness involved
with that

1390
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:53,760
with that
 

1391
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,630
with that
um specifically with uncharted

1392
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:56,640
um specifically with uncharted
 

1393
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,230
um specifically with uncharted
territories of farming in it

1394
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,240
territories of farming in it
 

1395
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,350
territories of farming in it
i've been doing montages of that

1396
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:01,360
i've been doing montages of that
 

1397
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,269
i've been doing montages of that
but i do watch a lot of other people

1398
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:03,279
but i do watch a lot of other people
 

1399
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,870
but i do watch a lot of other people

play ctm maps and
 

1401
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,350
play ctm maps and
the thing i notice is they either

1402
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:07,360
the thing i notice is they either
 

1403
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,070
the thing i notice is they either
include

1404
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,080
include
 

1405
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,190
include
all of the farming or they

1406
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,200
all of the farming or they
 

1407
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,190
all of the farming or they
or usually people just cut it out

1408
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,200
or usually people just cut it out
 

1409
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,549
or usually people just cut it out
completely

1410
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:14,559
completely
 

1411
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,029
completely
and just get past it so i i sort of

1412
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:17,039
and just get past it so i i sort of
 

1413
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,870
and just get past it so i i sort of
think i have a good balance with that

1414
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:18,880
think i have a good balance with that
 

1415
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,029
