here and then it goes up the elevator
 

199
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,649
here and then it goes up the elevator
and then that is held by a door at the

200
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:42,659
and then that is held by a door at the
 

201
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:50,000
and then that is held by a door at the
top so what should we do next

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,730
down the middle here and this separates
the two lanes so the water doesn't flow

326
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:47,740
the two lanes so the water doesn't flow
 

327
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:55,350
the two lanes so the water doesn't flow
together I think I forgot to mention

328
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
together I think I forgot to mention
 

329
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,960
together I think I forgot to mention
that I'm not just building a road here

330
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:57,970
that I'm not just building a road here
 

331
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,510
that I'm not just building a road here
I'm actually working on redesigning it

332
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:00,520
I'm actually working on redesigning it
 

333
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,110
I'm actually working on redesigning it
too so I don't know exactly what I'm

334
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,120
too so I don't know exactly what I'm
 

335
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:10,260
too so I don't know exactly what I'm
doing at the moment the way I normally

336
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,270
doing at the moment the way I normally
 

337
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,300
doing at the moment the way I normally
do this return system is going to have

338
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:12,310
do this return system is going to have
 

339
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:17,850
do this return system is going to have
to be changed so just for now I'm going

340
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:17,860
to be changed so just for now I'm going
 

341
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,810
to be changed so just for now I'm going
to put an easy loader here which is a

342
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:21,820
to put an easy loader here which is a
 

343
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,510
to put an easy loader here which is a
way of getting boats safely into the

344
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:24,520
way of getting boats safely into the
 

345
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,840
way of getting boats safely into the
dispenser so to do that I need pressure

346
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:30,850
dispenser so to do that I need pressure
 

347
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:55,920
dispenser so to do that I need pressure
plates and some glass and some water

348
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:55,930

 

349
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:00,310

so an easy loader is basically a water

350
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,320
so an easy loader is basically a water
 

351
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:16,450
so an easy loader is basically a water
pattern oh yeah I need a sign to the

352
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:16,460
pattern oh yeah I need a sign to the
 

353
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,160
pattern oh yeah I need a sign to the
sign keeps the water from flowing over

354
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,170
sign keeps the water from flowing over
 

355
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:26,620
sign keeps the water from flowing over
the edge okay so you place the water and

356
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:26,630
the edge okay so you place the water and
 

357
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:31,720
the edge okay so you place the water and
it makes this six block pattern and then

358
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:31,730
it makes this six block pattern and then
 

359
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,200
it makes this six block pattern and then
you place the boat in the center one and

360
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,210
you place the boat in the center one and
 

361
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,580
you place the boat in the center one and
L lines the boat properly you need to

362
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:39,590
L lines the boat properly you need to
 

363
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,790
L lines the boat properly you need to
place is you don't need to should be

364
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:45,800
place is you don't need to should be
 

365
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:51,820
place is you don't need to should be
watching now try out then try placing a

366
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:51,830
watching now try out then try placing a
 

367
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,410
watching now try out then try placing a
boat in it oh yeah I should put

368
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:56,420
boat in it oh yeah I should put
 

369
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:03,970
boat in it oh yeah I should put
something over the dispenser to keep it

370
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:03,980
something over the dispenser to keep it
 

371
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,590
something over the dispenser to keep it
from floating up we're going to place

372
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
from floating up we're going to place
 

373
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,430
from floating up we're going to place
three glass blocks here and then we

374
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:12,440
three glass blocks here and then we
 

375
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,810
three glass blocks here and then we
place the boat in the center it hits

376
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:16,820
place the boat in the center it hits
 

377
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,100
place the boat in the center it hits
this wall hits that wall falls down

378
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,110
this wall hits that wall falls down
 

379
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:26,820
this wall hits that wall falls down
water pushes it up our elevator

380
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:26,830

 

381
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:36,279

and yeah that's good so when I hop in

382
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:36,289
and yeah that's good so when I hop in
 

383
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:38,649
and yeah that's good so when I hop in
the boat it presses the pressure plate

384
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:38,659
the boat it presses the pressure plate
 

385
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:41,370
the boat it presses the pressure plate
and that's going to open this door

386
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:41,380
and that's going to open this door
 

387
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:47,230
and that's going to open this door
once I wire it properly but I do not

388
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,240
once I wire it properly but I do not
 

389
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,600
once I wire it properly but I do not
have any redstone right now so that will

390
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:49,610
have any redstone right now so that will
 

391
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:57,340
have any redstone right now so that will
have to wait and going to show you why

392
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:57,350
have to wait and going to show you why
 

393
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:11,010
have to wait and going to show you why
it's a rapid dispenser place two boats

394
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,020

 

395
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,360

the reason the boats don't break is

396
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,370
the reason the boats don't break is
 

397
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,520
the reason the boats don't break is
because they're always traveling

398
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:15,530
because they're always traveling
 

399
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:22,510
because they're always traveling
straight in my system you can you can

400
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:22,520
straight in my system you can you can
 

401
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,340
straight in my system you can you can
run a boat as hard as you want into wall

402
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:24,350
run a boat as hard as you want into wall
 

403
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,200
run a boat as hard as you want into wall
as long as it's going straight it won't

404
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,210
as long as it's going straight it won't
 

405
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:40,690
as long as it's going straight it won't
break so this this dispenser area is

406
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:40,700
break so this this dispenser area is
 

407
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:47,980
break so this this dispenser area is
only 3 by 2 which is about as tight as

408
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:47,990
only 3 by 2 which is about as tight as
 

409
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,890
only 3 by 2 which is about as tight as
you can fit two boats together see how

410
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:50,900
you can fit two boats together see how
 

411
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,180
you can fit two boats together see how
one is this way and one is lengthwise

412
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,190
one is this way and one is lengthwise
 

413
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,990
one is this way and one is lengthwise
you cannot fit two boats lengthwise in

414
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
you cannot fit two boats lengthwise in
 

415
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,820
you cannot fit two boats lengthwise in
this small area this is very tight and

416
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:02,830
this small area this is very tight and
 

417
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,789
this small area this is very tight and
it like shoots the boat pressing against

418
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:06,799
it like shoots the boat pressing against
 

419
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,260
it like shoots the boat pressing against
the other boat boosts that out the

420
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,270
the other boat boosts that out the
 

421
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,350
the other boat boosts that out the
system

422
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:10,360
system
 

423
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,180
system
so there's pretty much no acceleration

424
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,190
so there's pretty much no acceleration
 

425
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:21,279
so there's pretty much no acceleration
time so this episode's running a little

426
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:21,289
time so this episode's running a little
 

427
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:23,519
time so this episode's running a little
bit long so I'm going to end it here and

428
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:23,529
bit long so I'm going to end it here and
 

429
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:25,450
bit long so I'm going to end it here and
