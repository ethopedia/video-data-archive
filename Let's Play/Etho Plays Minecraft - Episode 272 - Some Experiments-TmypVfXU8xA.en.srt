a riddle for you guys at a challenge if
you guys think you know minecraft very

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
you guys think you know minecraft very
 

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,040
you guys think you know minecraft very
well I think you'll like this one

12
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,050
well I think you'll like this one
 

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,580
well I think you'll like this one
so I have a redstone torch here and a

14
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:31,590
so I have a redstone torch here and a
 

15
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,360
so I have a redstone torch here and a
light but this is no ordinary redstone

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,370
light but this is no ordinary redstone
 

17
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,229
light but this is no ordinary redstone
torch this is a something special I made

18
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:39,239
torch this is a something special I made
 

19
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,130
torch this is a something special I made
I want you to try figure it out so I'll

20
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:43,140
I want you to try figure it out so I'll
 

21
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,010
I want you to try figure it out so I'll
demonstrate it to you imagine a line

22
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,020
demonstrate it to you imagine a line
 

23
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,299
demonstrate it to you imagine a line
running like from here down and when we

24
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:50,309
running like from here down and when we
 

25
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,420
running like from here down and when we
cross that line

26
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:52,430
cross that line
 

27
00:00:52,430 --> 00:01:00,349
cross that line
stuff happens okay so this is a

28
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:00,359
stuff happens okay so this is a
 

29
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,520
stuff happens okay so this is a
proximity sensor whenever we cross the

30
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:04,530
proximity sensor whenever we cross the
 

31
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,070
proximity sensor whenever we cross the
line it works ok and I want you to try

32
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
line it works ok and I want you to try
 

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,830
line it works ok and I want you to try
figure out how this works and I'm gonna

34
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840
figure out how this works and I'm gonna
 

35
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,710
figure out how this works and I'm gonna
tell you what it's doesn't use it does

36
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:15,720
tell you what it's doesn't use it does
 

37
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,780
tell you what it's doesn't use it does
not use command blocks because we're or

38
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:17,790
not use command blocks because we're or
 

39
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,999
not use command blocks because we're or
plain vanilla here it doesn't use

40
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:20,009
plain vanilla here it doesn't use
 

41
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,170
plain vanilla here it doesn't use
monster spawners or mobs at all period

42
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:26,180

 

43
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,749

do you know how it works this is a I

44
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
do you know how it works this is a I
 

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,030
do you know how it works this is a I
think a new method for for sensing like

46
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
think a new method for for sensing like
 

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,870
think a new method for for sensing like
player position I am going to say though

48
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
player position I am going to say though
 

49
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,370
player position I am going to say though
it's not very practical

50
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:40,380
it's not very practical
 

51
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,310
it's not very practical
and has absolutely no use in creative

52
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:43,320
and has absolutely no use in creative
 

53
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,940
and has absolutely no use in creative
because there is command blocks so I

54
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:46,950
because there is command blocks so I
 

55
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,350
because there is command blocks so I
pretty much just built this for for the

56
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
pretty much just built this for for the
 

57
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,149
pretty much just built this for for the
fun of it to see how it works and it's

58
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:53,159
fun of it to see how it works and it's
 

59
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,020
fun of it to see how it works and it's
it's pretty cool alright so I'll show

60
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,030
it's pretty cool alright so I'll show
 

61
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,899
it's pretty cool alright so I'll show
you how it works I think it's I think

62
00:01:59,899 --> 00:01:59,909
you how it works I think it's I think
 

63
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,690
you how it works I think it's I think
it's gonna surprise you so this is

64
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:02,700
it's gonna surprise you so this is
 

65
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,050
it's gonna surprise you so this is
actually something I talked about on

66
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,060
actually something I talked about on
 

67
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,080
actually something I talked about on
feed the beast

68
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,090

 

69
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,259

is it flashing no okay

70
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:13,269
is it flashing no okay
 

71
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:16,470
is it flashing no okay
it works different at night too so

72
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,480
it works different at night too so
 

73
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,650
it works different at night too so
there's that too

74
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:19,660
there's that too
 

75
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,970
there's that too
basically I got a wire running all the

76
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:21,980
basically I got a wire running all the
 

77
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,270
basically I got a wire running all the
way down I decided to put it at like Y

78
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
way down I decided to put it at like Y
 

79
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,970
way down I decided to put it at like Y
11 so I could get a bunch of redstone

80
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:27,980
11 so I could get a bunch of redstone
 

81
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,960
11 so I could get a bunch of redstone
and other things as I as I built this

82
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:33,970

 

83
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,970

all right here we go oh no it keeps

84
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:36,980
all right here we go oh no it keeps
 

85
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,130
all right here we go oh no it keeps
going here it is okay uh-huh

86
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:42,140
going here it is okay uh-huh
 

87
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,800
going here it is okay uh-huh
we have to to pass here they stretch out

88
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:46,810
we have to to pass here they stretch out
 

89
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:52,390
we have to to pass here they stretch out
about 120 blocks each direction and then

90
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
about 120 blocks each direction and then
 

91
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,350
about 120 blocks each direction and then
at the very end guess what there is I'm

92
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
at the very end guess what there is I'm
 

93
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,850
at the very end guess what there is I'm
making you guys think really hard this

94
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:00,860
making you guys think really hard this
 

95
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,610
making you guys think really hard this
episode if you thought this was gonna be

96
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:03,620
episode if you thought this was gonna be
 

97
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,059
episode if you thought this was gonna be
easy

98
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:04,069
easy
 

99
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:05,890
easy
that I was gonna do all the words you

100
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:05,900
that I was gonna do all the words you
 

101
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,789
that I was gonna do all the words you
got another thing coming to you there's

102
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:09,799
got another thing coming to you there's
 

103
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,020
got another thing coming to you there's
a cave up there yeah so at each end

104
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,030
a cave up there yeah so at each end
 

105
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,569
a cave up there yeah so at each end
there is a dispenser with items in and

106
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:16,579
there is a dispenser with items in and
 

107
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,849
there is a dispenser with items in and
those go to a tripwire

108
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:18,859
those go to a tripwire
 

109
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:21,789
those go to a tripwire
I could probably set this up so the

110
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:21,799
I could probably set this up so the
 

111
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,990
I could probably set this up so the
items get recycled but I haven't and

112
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,000
items get recycled but I haven't and
 

113
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,960
items get recycled but I haven't and
when the tripwire gets tripped sends a

114
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:28,970
when the tripwire gets tripped sends a
 

115
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,849
when the tripwire gets tripped sends a
pulse and that runs all the way to the

116
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:30,859
pulse and that runs all the way to the
 

117
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:33,930
pulse and that runs all the way to the
other end of the thing so what I'm doing

118
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:33,940
other end of the thing so what I'm doing
 

119
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,530
other end of the thing so what I'm doing
with this is I'm detecting where I am in

120
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:38,540
with this is I'm detecting where I am in
 

121
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,640
with this is I'm detecting where I am in
the world by detecting if chunks are

122
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:42,650
the world by detecting if chunks are
 

123
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,640
the world by detecting if chunks are
unloaded which is something I didn't

124
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:45,650
unloaded which is something I didn't
 

125
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,479
unloaded which is something I didn't
feed the beast

126
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:46,489
feed the beast
 

127
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,020
feed the beast
and then this is just a RS nor latch to

128
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,030
and then this is just a RS nor latch to
 

129
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:56,379
and then this is just a RS nor latch to
figure out what state it's in so you see

130
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:56,389
figure out what state it's in so you see
 

131
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:58,900
figure out what state it's in so you see
that pulse right there so we got close

132
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:58,910
that pulse right there so we got close
 

133
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,660
that pulse right there so we got close
enough to the other dispenser here for

134
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:01,670
enough to the other dispenser here for
 

135
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,699
enough to the other dispenser here for
it to do that and you might wonder why

136
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:03,709
it to do that and you might wonder why
 

137
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:07,030
it to do that and you might wonder why
it's not doing a constant loop like just

138
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
it's not doing a constant loop like just
 

139
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,150
it's not doing a constant loop like just
always going and it's it's pretty

140
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,160
always going and it's it's pretty
 

141
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,849
always going and it's it's pretty
interesting the way this game deals with

142
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:12,859
interesting the way this game deals with
 

143
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:14,620
interesting the way this game deals with
unloaded chunks so if you have a

144
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:14,630
unloaded chunks so if you have a
 

145
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,719
unloaded chunks so if you have a
redstone Satan I'll go to an unloaded

146
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:16,729
redstone Satan I'll go to an unloaded
 

147
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:19,839
redstone Satan I'll go to an unloaded
chunk it will actually keep going like

148
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:19,849
chunk it will actually keep going like
 

149
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:21,930
chunk it will actually keep going like
it'll load the chunk and the redstone

150
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:21,940
it'll load the chunk and the redstone
 

151
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,629
it'll load the chunk and the redstone
cycle will keep going

152
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:23,639
cycle will keep going
 

153
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,760
cycle will keep going
but there are some things that don't

154
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,770
but there are some things that don't
 

155
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,439
but there are some things that don't
work in on little chunks like block

156
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:30,449
work in on little chunks like block
 

157
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,200
work in on little chunks like block
updates for example you can't have you

158
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,210
updates for example you can't have you
 

159
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,719
updates for example you can't have you
can't like send redstone signal to an

160
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:35,729
can't like send redstone signal to an
 

161
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,300
can't like send redstone signal to an
unloaded chunk and then have havoc oh

162
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,310
unloaded chunk and then have havoc oh
 

163
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,800
unloaded chunk and then have havoc oh
and I got a clock and have wheat growing

164
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:39,810
and I got a clock and have wheat growing
 

165
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,570
and I got a clock and have wheat growing
in that unloaded chunk or anything like

166
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:41,580
in that unloaded chunk or anything like
 

167
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,890
in that unloaded chunk or anything like
that but you can for example trigger a

168
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:45,900
that but you can for example trigger a
 

169
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,140
that but you can for example trigger a
dropper here and that will shoot the

170
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,150
dropper here and that will shoot the
 

171
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,350
dropper here and that will shoot the
item out but since it's in an unloaded

172
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
item out but since it's in an unloaded
 

173
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,129
item out but since it's in an unloaded
chunk items don't actually fall or move

174
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:55,139
chunk items don't actually fall or move
 

175
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,589
chunk items don't actually fall or move
at all they just get dispensed and then

176
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:57,599
at all they just get dispensed and then
 

177
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,059
at all they just get dispensed and then
that's it and then when you move closer

178
00:04:59,059 --> 00:04:59,069
that's it and then when you move closer
 

179
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:01,429
that's it and then when you move closer
to it the item falls and hits the

180
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:01,439
to it the item falls and hits the
 

181
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,029
to it the item falls and hits the
tripwire and then it sends it to the

182
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
tripwire and then it sends it to the
 

183
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,550
tripwire and then it sends it to the
other end which will only activate when

184
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:07,560
other end which will only activate when
 

185
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,589
other end which will only activate when
I get close to that one so yeah it was

186
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:12,599
I get close to that one so yeah it was
 

187
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:16,999
I get close to that one so yeah it was
this a fun fun build I thought you guys

188
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:17,009
this a fun fun build I thought you guys
 

189
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:18,050
this a fun fun build I thought you guys
would find it interesting

190
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,060
would find it interesting
 

191
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,459
would find it interesting
I was curious to see how it would work

192
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:19,469
I was curious to see how it would work
 

193
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:24,050
I was curious to see how it would work
the weird thing though is it at

194
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,060
the weird thing though is it at
 

195
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,269
the weird thing though is it at
nighttime I think like mobs moving

196
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:26,279
nighttime I think like mobs moving
 

197
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,430
nighttime I think like mobs moving
around might affected somehow or

198
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:28,440
around might affected somehow or
 

199
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,899
around might affected somehow or
something I don't know it's a little

200
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:29,909
something I don't know it's a little
 

201
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:33,110
something I don't know it's a little
strange I just finished building it so

202
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
strange I just finished building it so
 

203
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,899
strange I just finished building it so
I'm still learning all the oddities to

204
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:35,909
I'm still learning all the oddities to
 

205
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:40,399
I'm still learning all the oddities to
it and you could set up something like

206
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:40,409
it and you could set up something like
 

207
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:42,950
it and you could set up something like
this like with three points and then you

208
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
this like with three points and then you
 

209
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,619
this like with three points and then you
could precisely figure out where the

210
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:45,629
could precisely figure out where the
 

211
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:46,999
could precisely figure out where the
player needs to be like I'm just

212
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:47,009
player needs to be like I'm just
 

213
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:49,339
player needs to be like I'm just
detecting if I cross a line basically

214
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:49,349
detecting if I cross a line basically
 

215
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,790
detecting if I cross a line basically
but you could figure out precisely to a

216
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
but you could figure out precisely to a
 

217
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,029
but you could figure out precisely to a
chunk I'm sure it can't detect your

218
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:56,039
chunk I'm sure it can't detect your
 

219
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,929
chunk I'm sure it can't detect your
vertical height though oh you jerk

220
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:01,939

 

221
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:04,879

there's so many mobs in my world because

222
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:04,889
there's so many mobs in my world because
 

223
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:12,829
there's so many mobs in my world because
all the caves are lit up here hey but

224
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:12,839
all the caves are lit up here hey but
 

225
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,159
all the caves are lit up here hey but
yeah it's pretty cool so yeah checked it

226
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:16,169
yeah it's pretty cool so yeah checked it
 

227
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,080
yeah it's pretty cool so yeah checked it
out like yeah

228
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,090
out like yeah
 

229
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,450
out like yeah
it allows it from a distance to so it's

230
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:20,460
it allows it from a distance to so it's
 

231
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,770
it allows it from a distance to so it's
like I don't have to walk right by the

232
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:21,780
like I don't have to walk right by the
 

233
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,400
like I don't have to walk right by the
light either it will detect when I cross

234
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:25,410
light either it will detect when I cross
 

235
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:33,469
light either it will detect when I cross
over here all right walk back there's

236
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:33,479
over here all right walk back there's
 

237
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,340
over here all right walk back there's
about a 16 block air range you have to

238
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,350
about a 16 block air range you have to
 

239
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,810
about a 16 block air range you have to
cover before it'll trigger they'll let

240
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:38,820
cover before it'll trigger they'll let
 

241
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,840
cover before it'll trigger they'll let
you triggered here but then I have to be

242
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:41,850
you triggered here but then I have to be
 

243
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,730
you triggered here but then I have to be
about 16 blocks over for it to trigger

244
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:43,740
about 16 blocks over for it to trigger
 

245
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,980
about 16 blocks over for it to trigger
the other way for the chunk to load

246
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:47,990
the other way for the chunk to load
 

247
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,100
the other way for the chunk to load
anyway

248
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,110
anyway

through the grass to get us here can we

286
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:10,770
through the grass to get us here can we
 

287
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:16,810
through the grass to get us here can we
get a record oh I don't want to try

288
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:16,820

 

289
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,159

right what was I talking about let's go

290
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:19,169
right what was I talking about let's go
 

291
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:23,230
right what was I talking about let's go
let's go look at the trees why not

292
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:23,240

 

293
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,400

probably gonna add a few more lights but

294
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,410
probably gonna add a few more lights but
 

295
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,430
probably gonna add a few more lights but
I like to how it looks just just to try

296
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,440
I like to how it looks just just to try
 

297
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,529
I like to how it looks just just to try
make things look a little bitter on top

298

pretty cool all right
I got some other things to show you guys

304
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,060
I got some other things to show you guys
 

305
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,760
I got some other things to show you guys
so let's get to that actually you know

306
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:43,770
so let's get to that actually you know
 

307
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,250
so let's get to that actually you know
what guys a few more things here I was

308
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,260
what guys a few more things here I was
 

309
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,770
what guys a few more things here I was
gonna ask you like I built this as a

310
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:48,780
gonna ask you like I built this as a
 

311
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,800
gonna ask you like I built this as a
this is a technical experiment basically

312
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:51,810
this is a technical experiment basically
 

313
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,930
this is a technical experiment basically
but we can't make it do something and I

314
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:55,940
but we can't make it do something and I
 

315
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,740
but we can't make it do something and I
was wondering if you guys have ideas

316
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:57,750
was wondering if you guys have ideas
 

317
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,190
was wondering if you guys have ideas
what should we make to do I thinking

318
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
what should we make to do I thinking
 

319
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,240
what should we make to do I thinking
about maybe a fountain with water and

320
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,250
about maybe a fountain with water and
 

321
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,370
about maybe a fountain with water and
lava that that change depending on what

322
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:07,380
lava that that change depending on what
 

323
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,780
lava that that change depending on what
side you are at the line but I figure

324
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:10,790
side you are at the line but I figure
 

325
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,520
side you are at the line but I figure
you know collectively all you guys will

326
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:13,530
you know collectively all you guys will
 

327
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,350
you know collectively all you guys will
probably come up with a better idea so

328
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
probably come up with a better idea so
 

329
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,380
probably come up with a better idea so
if you have an idea for for a build here

330
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,390
if you have an idea for for a build here
 

331
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,750
if you have an idea for for a build here
let me know using that feature and

332
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:22,760

 

333
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,500

another interesting thing like with

334
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:26,510
another interesting thing like with
 

335
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,000
another interesting thing like with
triggering triggering a dispenser in an

336
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,010
triggering triggering a dispenser in an
 

337
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,690
triggering triggering a dispenser in an
unloaded chunk if you have TNT in it it

338
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:32,700
unloaded chunk if you have TNT in it it
 

339
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,410
unloaded chunk if you have TNT in it it
will dispense the TNT but the time

340
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:36,420
will dispense the TNT but the time
 

341
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,590
will dispense the TNT but the time
doesn't actually count down on it so

342
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
doesn't actually count down on it so
 

343
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,740
doesn't actually count down on it so
when you re-enter the chunk that you can

344
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:42,750
when you re-enter the chunk that you can
 

345
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,940
when you re-enter the chunk that you can
dispense hundreds of TNT all at once in

346
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:46,950
dispense hundreds of TNT all at once in
 

347
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,130
dispense hundreds of TNT all at once in
one spot and when you re-enter the chunk

348
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,140
one spot and when you re-enter the chunk
 

349
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,840
one spot and when you re-enter the chunk
then it starts counting down and all

350
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:50,850
then it starts counting down and all
 

351
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,690
then it starts counting down and all
explodes at once so with that you can

352
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:53,700
explodes at once so with that you can
 

353
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,790
explodes at once so with that you can
pretty much make the furthest cannon in

354
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
pretty much make the furthest cannon in
 

355
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,950
pretty much make the furthest cannon in
the game you know there's always been

356
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:00,960
the game you know there's always been
 

357
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,590
the game you know there's always been
this challenge at minecraft to build the

358
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
this challenge at minecraft to build the
 

359
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800
this challenge at minecraft to build the
farthest shooting cannon and with that

360
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:06,810
farthest shooting cannon and with that
 

361
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,170
farthest shooting cannon and with that
you could have potentially thousands and

362
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:09,180
you could have potentially thousands and
 

363
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,790
you could have potentially thousands and
thousands of TNT all in one spot but the

364
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:13,800
thousands of TNT all in one spot but the
 

365
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,020
thousands of TNT all in one spot but the
thing is your games not going to be able

366
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,030
thing is your games not going to be able
 

367
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,420
thing is your games not going to be able
to handle it so now it's more how much

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,430
to handle it so now it's more how much
 

369
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,750
to handle it so now it's more how much

you know it's it's pretty much figured

376
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,270
you know it's it's pretty much figured
 

377
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,940
you know it's it's pretty much figured
out now let's see one more thing what

378
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:34,950
out now let's see one more thing what
 

379
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,130
out now let's see one more thing what
one other thing was there

380
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:39,140

 

381
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,500

ah my memory stinks oh well since we're

382
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:44,510
ah my memory stinks oh well since we're
 

383
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,790
ah my memory stinks oh well since we're
all the way back here I'll show you what

384
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:45,800
all the way back here I'll show you what
 

385
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,280
all the way back here I'll show you what
else I worked on after last episode we

386
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,290
else I worked on after last episode we
 

387
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,720
else I worked on after last episode we
built the bridge last time but then

388
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:49,730
built the bridge last time but then
 

389
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,320
built the bridge last time but then
after that I also started working on a

390
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,330
after that I also started working on a
 

391
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,220
after that I also started working on a
path as the video was rendering and yeah

392
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,230
path as the video was rendering and yeah
 

393
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,970
path as the video was rendering and yeah
I think it looks pretty cool let's go to

394
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:00,980
I think it looks pretty cool let's go to
 

395
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,940
I think it looks pretty cool let's go to
sleep see you can see it with the lights

396
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:03,950
sleep see you can see it with the lights
 

397
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:14,920
sleep see you can see it with the lights
on oh it's date so this path it's made

398
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:14,930
on oh it's date so this path it's made
 

399
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:21,280
on oh it's date so this path it's made
out of that cyan hardened clay there's a

400
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,290
out of that cyan hardened clay there's a
 

401
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:27,360
out of that cyan hardened clay there's a
lot of monsters around oh no don't

402
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,370

 

403
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,860

can I sleep it's still kind of dark out

404
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:29,870
can I sleep it's still kind of dark out
 

405
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,960
can I sleep it's still kind of dark out
oh I can't cool yeah it's it's cyan

406
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:34,970
oh I can't cool yeah it's it's cyan
 

407
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,850
oh I can't cool yeah it's it's cyan
hardened clay with stone brick on the

408
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:36,860
hardened clay with stone brick on the
 

409
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,040
hardened clay with stone brick on the
sides and then leaves on the side of

410
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,050
sides and then leaves on the side of
 

411
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,350
sides and then leaves on the side of
that just for aesthetics and I think

412
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
that just for aesthetics and I think
 

413
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,180
that just for aesthetics and I think
that looks pretty cool

414
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,190
that looks pretty cool
 

415
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,820
that looks pretty cool
each of these lights is controlled by a

416
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:45,830
each of these lights is controlled by a
 

417
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,380
each of these lights is controlled by a
light sensor you can see it under the

418
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:47,390
light sensor you can see it under the
 

419
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,020
light sensor you can see it under the
leaves here and there's basically a

420
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,030
leaves here and there's basically a
 

421
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,330
leaves here and there's basically a
redstone dust under that and it goes to

422
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:52,340
redstone dust under that and it goes to
 

423
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,800
redstone dust under that and it goes to
a redstone torch and up to the light and

424
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:55,810
a redstone torch and up to the light and
 

425
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,390
a redstone torch and up to the light and
sunlight than or moonlight can shine

426
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:58,400
sunlight than or moonlight can shine
 

427
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,270
sunlight than or moonlight can shine
through the leaves here and and they're

428
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:01,280
through the leaves here and and they're
 

429
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,970
through the leaves here and and they're
all independently working and the path

430
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:03,980
all independently working and the path
 

431
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,880
all independently working and the path
comes up here you can see there's like

432
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:06,890
comes up here you can see there's like
 

433
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,250
comes up here you can see there's like
no stairs here it's like the idea is I

434
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:09,260
no stairs here it's like the idea is I
 

435
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,960
no stairs here it's like the idea is I
wanted to make a horse path basically

436
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:10,970
wanted to make a horse path basically
 

437
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,560
wanted to make a horse path basically
and they can walk up one block jumps you

438
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:14,570
and they can walk up one block jumps you
 

439
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,140
and they can walk up one block jumps you
know but if we manually do it we got a

440
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,150
know but if we manually do it we got a
 

441
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:22,000
know but if we manually do it we got a
we got jump it ourselves and good thing

442
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,010
we got jump it ourselves and good thing
 

443
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,970
we got jump it ourselves and good thing
I turned around it's not done yet I'm

444
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:24,980
I turned around it's not done yet I'm
 

445
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,800
I turned around it's not done yet I'm
still working that putting sensors under

446
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:26,810
still working that putting sensors under
 

447
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,020
still working that putting sensors under
the lights and also finishing the path

448
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,030
the lights and also finishing the path
 

449
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:34,960
the lights and also finishing the path
to it's not quite done goes around here

450
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:34,970
to it's not quite done goes around here
 

451
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,240
to it's not quite done goes around here
we got a nice view might do something in

452
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,250
we got a nice view might do something in
 

453
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,580
we got a nice view might do something in
this area I made it go through a hill

454
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:39,590
this area I made it go through a hill
 

455
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,150
this area I made it go through a hill
here and then that's about as far as I

456
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,160
here and then that's about as far as I
 

457
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,640
here and then that's about as far as I
got the idea is I want to get it up to

458
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:45,650
got the idea is I want to get it up to
 

459
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,190
got the idea is I want to get it up to
the library here though which is at the

460
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,200
the library here though which is at the
 

461
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
the library here though which is at the
top of the mountain and have a nice

462
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,210
top of the mountain and have a nice
 

463
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,470
top of the mountain and have a nice
horse path to get to that

464
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:53,480
horse path to get to that
 

465
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,180
horse path to get to that
I still do kind of want to do an East

466
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,190
I still do kind of want to do an East
 

467
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,160
I still do kind of want to do an East
Road though to get to this library so I

468
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,170
Road though to get to this library so I
 

469
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,260
Road though to get to this library so I
haven't put that idea out of there yet I

470
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,270
haven't put that idea out of there yet I
 

471
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,300
haven't put that idea out of there yet I
put down torches to how I think I'm

472
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:04,310
put down torches to how I think I'm
 

473
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,320
put down torches to how I think I'm
gonna make it go but I'm not sure yet

474
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,330
gonna make it go but I'm not sure yet
 

475
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,570
gonna make it go but I'm not sure yet
like a line of torches you can see it

476
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:10,580
like a line of torches you can see it
 

477
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,540
like a line of torches you can see it
the own like that I tried not to make

478
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:13,550
the own like that I tried not to make
 

479
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,920
the own like that I tried not to make
the path straight just so it would look

480
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:14,930
the path straight just so it would look
 

481
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,770
the path straight just so it would look
a little more pleasing and then our

482
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:17,780
a little more pleasing and then our
 

483
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,520
a little more pleasing and then our
library's at the top here and we're not

484
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:21,530
library's at the top here and we're not
 

485
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,800
library's at the top here and we're not
working on that today I know a lot of

486
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:23,810
working on that today I know a lot of
 

487
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,170
working on that today I know a lot of
people have been asking me to but today

488
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:26,180
people have been asking me to but today
 

489
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,100
people have been asking me to but today
we're mostly going to be doing

490
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,110
we're mostly going to be doing
 

491
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,480
we're mostly going to be doing
experiments and stuff in my world I

492
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:31,490
experiments and stuff in my world I
 

493
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,070
experiments and stuff in my world I
always have lots of projects going at a

494
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,080
always have lots of projects going at a
 

495
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,500
always have lots of projects going at a
time and I like it that way because then

496
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:35,510
time and I like it that way because then
 

497
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,320
time and I like it that way because then
I never get bored of the game I only

498
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,330
I never get bored of the game I only
 

499
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,930
I never get bored of the game I only
have like one or two projects going it's

500
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:40,940
have like one or two projects going it's
 

501
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,350
have like one or two projects going it's
not I might not necessarily want to work

502
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:44,360
not I might not necessarily want to work
 

503
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,210
not I might not necessarily want to work
on them that day and then it's like I

504
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:46,220
on them that day and then it's like I
 

505
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,250
on them that day and then it's like I
don't want to play so that's why I like

506
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:48,260
don't want to play so that's why I like
 

507
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,580
don't want to play so that's why I like
to have lots of stuff going and the

508
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:51,590
to have lots of stuff going and the
 

509
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,790
to have lots of stuff going and the
problem with that those people like I

510
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:54,800
problem with that those people like I
 

511
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,200
problem with that those people like I
know I always have people asking me to

512
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,210
know I always have people asking me to
 

513
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,230
know I always have people asking me to
work on the village the Emerald City and

514
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,240
work on the village the Emerald City and
 

515
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,780
work on the village the Emerald City and
a lot of stuff people get projects they

516
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:01,790
a lot of stuff people get projects they
 

517
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,920
a lot of stuff people get projects they
want me to work on they have their

518
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:02,930
want me to work on they have their
 

519
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,000
want me to work on they have their
favorites and Wilson and I don't always

520
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,010
favorites and Wilson and I don't always
 

521
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,730
favorites and Wilson and I don't always
work on it but eventually I do tend to

522
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:09,740
work on it but eventually I do tend to
 

523
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,830
work on it but eventually I do tend to
get stuff done so don't worry we'll

524
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:11,840
get stuff done so don't worry we'll
 

525
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,950
get stuff done so don't worry we'll
return to stuff it's not like I bend the

526
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:14,960
return to stuff it's not like I bend the
 

527
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:23,680
return to stuff it's not like I bend the
ideas totally right still haven't

528
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:23,690
ideas totally right still haven't
 

529
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,320
ideas totally right still haven't
thought of that thing I forgot anyway

530
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,330
thought of that thing I forgot anyway
 

531
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,260
thought of that thing I forgot anyway
the other thing we're gonna do now back

532
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:29,270
the other thing we're gonna do now back
 

533
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,000
the other thing we're gonna do now back
to experimenting here we're going to the

534
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,010
to experimenting here we're going to the
 

535
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,520
to experimenting here we're going to the
nether I figured we would do this

536
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:33,530
nether I figured we would do this
 

537
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,920
nether I figured we would do this
together on camera here because a lot of

538
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:35,930
together on camera here because a lot of
 

539
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,500
together on camera here because a lot of
people weren't sure about this myself

540
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:38,510
people weren't sure about this myself
 

541
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:43,080
people weren't sure about this myself
included do beacons worked in the nether

542
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,090
included do beacons worked in the nether
 

543
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:48,820
included do beacons worked in the nether
what do you guys think

544
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:48,830

 

545
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,260

again I had a lot of different comments

546
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,270
again I had a lot of different comments
 

547
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,150
again I had a lot of different comments
about this people weren't really sure

548
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,160
about this people weren't really sure
 

549
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,920
about this people weren't really sure
some people were sure I think but most

550
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:57,930
some people were sure I think but most
 

551
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,810
some people were sure I think but most
people didn't know basically well I

552
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:02,820
people didn't know basically well I
 

553
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,460
people didn't know basically well I
don't know at the moment Ashley we're

554
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:04,470
don't know at the moment Ashley we're
 

555
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,910
don't know at the moment Ashley we're
gonna figure it out you can see these

556
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
gonna figure it out you can see these
 

557
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,460
gonna figure it out you can see these
are all disabled at the moment I can't I

558
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:10,470
are all disabled at the moment I can't I
 

559
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,810
are all disabled at the moment I can't I
can't activate the beacon can't hit

560
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:14,820
can't activate the beacon can't hit
 

561
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,800
can't activate the beacon can't hit
checkmark it's all grayed out oh it is

562
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:18,810
checkmark it's all grayed out oh it is
 

563
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,700
checkmark it's all grayed out oh it is
working

564
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:21,710

 

565
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:28,060

interesting oh okay now it's that's done

566
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,070
interesting oh okay now it's that's done
 

567
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:32,510
interesting oh okay now it's that's done
okay check oh that did eat it though it

568
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:32,520
okay check oh that did eat it though it
 

569
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,380
okay check oh that did eat it though it
works it's just a little bit glitchy

570
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:35,390
works it's just a little bit glitchy
 

571
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,940
works it's just a little bit glitchy
which I don't know if it's supposed to

572
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:37,950
which I don't know if it's supposed to
 

573
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:46,460
which I don't know if it's supposed to
work or not gonna give me speed yeah

574
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,470
work or not gonna give me speed yeah
 

575
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,490
work or not gonna give me speed yeah
give me speed okay it seems to work

576
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:49,500
give me speed okay it seems to work
 

577
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,130
give me speed okay it seems to work
pretty good the thing is I started

578
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:52,140
pretty good the thing is I started
 

579
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,110
pretty good the thing is I started
building a big pyramid and I was having

580
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,120
building a big pyramid and I was having
 

581
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,850
building a big pyramid and I was having
trouble getting it to work though so

582
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:55,860
trouble getting it to work though so
 

583
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,180
trouble getting it to work though so
we'll see if we can actually make it

584
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,190
we'll see if we can actually make it
 

585
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,000
we'll see if we can actually make it
worked here so I'm gonna put a pyramid

586
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,010
worked here so I'm gonna put a pyramid
 

587
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:08,440
worked here so I'm gonna put a pyramid
underneath here

588
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:08,450

 

589
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:15,120

you see there's no options now there is

590
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,130
you see there's no options now there is
 

591
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,220
you see there's no options now there is
it's a little weird and I don't think we

592
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,230
it's a little weird and I don't think we
 

593
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,860
it's a little weird and I don't think we
have any buff at the moment so with this

594
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:20,870
have any buff at the moment so with this
 

595
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,690
have any buff at the moment so with this
big pyramid it's not really working

596
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:22,700
big pyramid it's not really working
 

597
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:32,170
big pyramid it's not really working
properly oh okay it's here now I don't

598
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:32,180
properly oh okay it's here now I don't
 

599
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,730
properly oh okay it's here now I don't
think I can put something in and make it

600
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:33,740
think I can put something in and make it
 

601
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,620
think I can put something in and make it
work so it is strange if you can get a

602
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:38,630
work so it is strange if you can get a
 

603
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,040
work so it is strange if you can get a
beacon on top of the bedrock so it will

604
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,050
beacon on top of the bedrock so it will
 

605
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,620
beacon on top of the bedrock so it will
work like normal I think because it has

606
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:44,630
work like normal I think because it has
 

607
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,329
work like normal I think because it has
sunlight I'm wondering if we break some

608
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:49,339
sunlight I'm wondering if we break some
 

609
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,069
sunlight I'm wondering if we break some
of these blocks and put them back if we

610
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:51,079
of these blocks and put them back if we
 

611
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:52,750
of these blocks and put them back if we
can get it to work her maybe there's

612
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:52,760
can get it to work her maybe there's
 

613
00:16:52,760 --> 00:17:00,540
can get it to work her maybe there's
some other trick we could do no okay we

614
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:00,550
some other trick we could do no okay we
 

615
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,780
some other trick we could do no okay we
dismantle the pyramid the Earl at layer

616
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:04,790
dismantle the pyramid the Earl at layer
 

617
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:10,170
dismantle the pyramid the Earl at layer
maybe we can make it work then

618
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:10,180

 

619
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:19,340

oh boy I'm sure I could get it to work

620
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,350
oh boy I'm sure I could get it to work
 

621
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:24,450
oh boy I'm sure I could get it to work
if I messed with it enough because it

622
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:24,460
if I messed with it enough because it
 

623
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,370
if I messed with it enough because it
was working like it the small steel so

624
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:26,380
was working like it the small steel so
 

625
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,750
was working like it the small steel so
I'm sure there's a trick to making the

626
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
I'm sure there's a trick to making the
 

627
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,290
I'm sure there's a trick to making the
big one work maybe I'll mess with it a

628
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:31,300
big one work maybe I'll mess with it a
 

629
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,360
big one work maybe I'll mess with it a
bit off-camera here I was hoping I would

630
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:33,370
bit off-camera here I was hoping I would
 

631
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,510
bit off-camera here I was hoping I would
have figured it out by now but I'll be

632
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:36,520
have figured it out by now but I'll be
 

633
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,670
have figured it out by now but I'll be
right back okay so I was having a little

634
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:41,680
right back okay so I was having a little
 

635
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,340
right back okay so I was having a little
trouble getting it working down there

636
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:43,350
trouble getting it working down there
 

637
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:47,360
trouble getting it working down there
maybe because I had blocks above it but

638
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:47,370
maybe because I had blocks above it but
 

639
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,590
maybe because I had blocks above it but
sad to build it here where it was

640
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
sad to build it here where it was
 

641
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,350
sad to build it here where it was
working built it up a little higher

642
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:52,360
working built it up a little higher
 

643
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,610
working built it up a little higher
I had the 3x3 going it's not very sound

644
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:56,620
I had the 3x3 going it's not very sound
 

645
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,520
I had the 3x3 going it's not very sound
seems very loud to me today I don't know

646
00:17:59,520 --> 00:17:59,530
seems very loud to me today I don't know
 

647
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,180
seems very loud to me today I don't know
why I had it working at the 3x3 here and

648
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,190
why I had it working at the 3x3 here and
 

649
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,490
why I had it working at the 3x3 here and
then I added on the other three layers

650
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:05,500
then I added on the other three layers
 

651
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,400
then I added on the other three layers
once I had it working and so a level for

652
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,410
once I had it working and so a level for
 

653
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:16,530
once I had it working and so a level for
beacon should work 50 blocks away so

654
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:16,540
beacon should work 50 blocks away so
 

655
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:22,350
beacon should work 50 blocks away so
this is 13 here and if we go we would

656
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:22,360
this is 13 here and if we go we would
 

657
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,660
this is 13 here and if we go we would
have to go to about 63 then for it to

658
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:24,670
have to go to about 63 then for it to
 

659
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:34,650
have to go to about 63 then for it to
stop right at 63 all right is it

660
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:34,660
stop right at 63 all right is it
 

661
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,810
stop right at 63 all right is it
refreshing yep one more block 64 way now

662
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:39,820
refreshing yep one more block 64 way now
 

663
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:45,260
refreshing yep one more block 64 way now
it is not so yeah it is level for beacon

664
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:45,270
it is not so yeah it is level for beacon
 

665
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,660
it is not so yeah it is level for beacon
I'm wondering if we can get the speed 2

666
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:48,670
I'm wondering if we can get the speed 2
 

667
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,530
I'm wondering if we can get the speed 2
here so let's try that I was really

668
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:52,540
here so let's try that I was really
 

669
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,300
here so let's try that I was really
worried about breaking it off camera

670
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:54,310
worried about breaking it off camera
 

671
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,750
worried about breaking it off camera
because then I'd have to rebuild it all

672
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:58,760

 

673
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,799

if it does break so that should work

674
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:02,809
if it does break so that should work
 

675
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,740
if it does break so that should work
speed - yep speed - works perfect

676
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:05,750
speed - yep speed - works perfect
 

677
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,080
speed - yep speed - works perfect
so beacons are possible in the nether

678
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,090
so beacons are possible in the nether
 

679
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:13,060
so beacons are possible in the nether
without putting them on bedrock so what

680
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,070
without putting them on bedrock so what
 

681
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,070
without putting them on bedrock so what
makes it not worth is the next question

682
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,080
makes it not worth is the next question
 

683
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,020
makes it not worth is the next question
so I'm going to put some blocks above

684
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,030
so I'm going to put some blocks above
 

685
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:26,620
so I'm going to put some blocks above
here I put one right here all right it's

686
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:26,630
here I put one right here all right it's
 

687
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,870
here I put one right here all right it's
still working

688
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:27,880
still working
 

689
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,950
still working
no it's not hmm interesting

690
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
no it's not hmm interesting
 

691
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,280
no it's not hmm interesting
I think because nether rat is all

692
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,290
I think because nether rat is all
 

693
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:41,460
I think because nether rat is all
natural right and I put that there

694
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:41,470
natural right and I put that there
 

695
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,799
natural right and I put that there
or maybe it just needs three blocks now

696
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:44,809
or maybe it just needs three blocks now
 

697
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:49,260
or maybe it just needs three blocks now
it's working they can go up one more

698
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,270
it's working they can go up one more
 

699
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,890
it's working they can go up one more
maybe no maybe it's just gotta be

700
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:53,900
maybe no maybe it's just gotta be
 

701
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:01,169
maybe no maybe it's just gotta be
another rack above break it and it works

702
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:01,179
another rack above break it and it works
 

703
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:04,630
another rack above break it and it works
I think we found the the reason here

704
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
I think we found the the reason here
 

705
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,039
I think we found the the reason here
let's try a different thing let's put a

706
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:06,049
let's try a different thing let's put a
 

707
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:09,680
let's try a different thing let's put a
ladder above

708
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:09,690

 

709
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,169

you're gonna refresh do that refresh no

710
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:13,179
you're gonna refresh do that refresh no
 

711
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,270
you're gonna refresh do that refresh no
problem so it's like it gets cutting out

712
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
problem so it's like it gets cutting out
 

713
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:24,890
problem so it's like it gets cutting out
the sunlight that portal so annoy SL

714
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:24,900
the sunlight that portal so annoy SL
 

715
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:31,830
the sunlight that portal so annoy SL
that's zero interesting let's try one

716
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
that's zero interesting let's try one
 

717
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,230
that's zero interesting let's try one
more other block and not refreshing

718
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:37,240
more other block and not refreshing
 

719
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,160
more other block and not refreshing
let's try slabs cuz that's what we have

720
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,170
let's try slabs cuz that's what we have
 

721
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:48,930
let's try slabs cuz that's what we have
above there nope okay so that's what it

722
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:48,940
above there nope okay so that's what it
 

723
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:55,169
above there nope okay so that's what it
is pretty simple and they kicked in cool

724
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:55,179
is pretty simple and they kicked in cool
 

725
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:59,210
is pretty simple and they kicked in cool
so if we built it if we put beacon above

726
00:20:59,210 --> 00:20:59,220
so if we built it if we put beacon above
 

727
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,640
so if we built it if we put beacon above
here or some other place even you should

728
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:02,650
here or some other place even you should
 

729
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,390
here or some other place even you should
work fine

730
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:03,400
work fine
 

731
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,450
work fine
I think I'll allow maybe put up above

732
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:06,460
I think I'll allow maybe put up above
 

733
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,220
I think I'll allow maybe put up above
here there's one more thing I should

734
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,230
here there's one more thing I should
 

735
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,960
here there's one more thing I should
probably point out with this it turns

736
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:12,970
probably point out with this it turns
 

737
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,370
probably point out with this it turns
out like it's working right now right

738
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:16,380
out like it's working right now right
 

739
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,650
out like it's working right now right
but if I manually place some netherrack

740
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:19,660
but if I manually place some netherrack
 

741
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,010
but if I manually place some netherrack
like stuff I placed myself that wasn't

742
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,020
like stuff I placed myself that wasn't
 

743
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,919
like stuff I placed myself that wasn't
naturally generated that way it doesn't

744
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:25,929
naturally generated that way it doesn't
 

745
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:29,610
naturally generated that way it doesn't
work and I'm guessing if there's a

746
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:29,620
work and I'm guessing if there's a
 

747
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,330
work and I'm guessing if there's a
closed stone or another breaker or

748
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:33,340
closed stone or another breaker or
 

749
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,370
closed stone or another breaker or
another quartz or something above it's

750
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:35,380
another quartz or something above it's
 

751
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,370
another quartz or something above it's
not gonna work either but I could be

752
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:38,380
not gonna work either but I could be
 

753
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,630
not gonna work either but I could be
wrong

754
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:41,640

 

755
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,030

alright guys it works we have a speed to

756
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,040
alright guys it works we have a speed to
 

757
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,169
alright guys it works we have a speed to
beacon now level 4 has a radius of 50

758
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:49,179
beacon now level 4 has a radius of 50
 

759
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:51,990
beacon now level 4 has a radius of 50
blocks diameter of a hundred and I put

760
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
blocks diameter of a hundred and I put
 

761
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,450
blocks diameter of a hundred and I put
it right above the netherrack they're

762
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:54,460
it right above the netherrack they're
 

763
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,049
it right above the netherrack they're
like two blocks above with the beacon

764
00:21:58,049 --> 00:21:58,059
like two blocks above with the beacon
 

765
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,980
like two blocks above with the beacon
directly above the center here

766
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:00,990
directly above the center here
 

767
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:05,870
directly above the center here
so pretty cool we got speed - it works

768
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:05,880
so pretty cool we got speed - it works
 

769
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,370
so pretty cool we got speed - it works
and still gotta finish the ceiling in

770
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:10,380
and still gotta finish the ceiling in
 

771
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,139
and still gotta finish the ceiling in
here I don't know what I'm doing yet

772
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:12,149
here I don't know what I'm doing yet
 

773
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:14,990
here I don't know what I'm doing yet
though but I tell you once I figure it

774
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,000
though but I tell you once I figure it
 

775
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,940
though but I tell you once I figure it
out we will do it don't you worry

776
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:18,950

 

777
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,860

anyways I think we should get to reading

778
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:21,870
anyways I think we should get to reading
 

779
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,639
anyways I think we should get to reading

walkthrough of your world but you threw
 

785
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:32,960
walkthrough of your world but you threw
it away because we see all the things

786
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:32,970

often you might be partially right we do
 

789
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:39,289
often you might be partially right we do
see some stuff often like the stuff in

790
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:39,299
see some stuff often like the stuff in
 

791
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,419
see some stuff often like the stuff in
the man cave but I don't know what they

792
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:41,429
the man cave but I don't know what they
 

793
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:44,510
the man cave but I don't know what they
all do we just see the front of the

794
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:44,520
all do we just see the front of the
 

795
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,600
all do we just see the front of the
