from my other base because what I got to
 

79
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,670
from my other base because what I got to
do is I got to clear at least clear the

80
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:12,680
do is I got to clear at least clear the
 

81
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,660
do is I got to clear at least clear the

I can I should try to get rid of them
 

85
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,009
I can I should try to get rid of them
completely

86
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:20,019
completely
 

87
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:24,640

I've already mostly got rid of a fairly

88
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:24,650
I've already mostly got rid of a fairly
 

89
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,360
I've already mostly got rid of a fairly
big island over there it's just a little

90
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,370
big island over there it's just a little
 

91
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,430
big island over there it's just a little
bit left before I did that though I

92
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:32,440
bit left before I did that though I
 

93
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,220
bit left before I did that though I
planted some soil down so that I could

94
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,230
planted some soil down so that I could
 

95
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,070
planted some soil down so that I could
get the grass to travel closer to my

96
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,080
get the grass to travel closer to my
 

97
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,610
get the grass to travel closer to my
centre here when I make grass travel I

98
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:42,620
centre here when I make grass travel I
 

99
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,470
centre here when I make grass travel I
like to make it at least two wide so

100
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
like to make it at least two wide so
 

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,180
like to make it at least two wide so
that it'll go faster and I got a little

102
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,190
that it'll go faster and I got a little
 

103
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,270
that it'll go faster and I got a little
well set up here water that won't freeze

104
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,280
well set up here water that won't freeze
 

105
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,750
well set up here water that won't freeze
and yeah so after that's cleared I'll

106
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:58,760
and yeah so after that's cleared I'll
 

107
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,390
and yeah so after that's cleared I'll
probably clear that one out using tea

108
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:01,400
probably clear that one out using tea
 

109
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,570
probably clear that one out using tea
and tea it's pretty big and I got clear

110
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:04,580
and tea it's pretty big and I got clear
 

111
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,449
and tea it's pretty big and I got clear
that one this one's huge I'm a little

112
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:07,459
that one this one's huge I'm a little
 

113
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:10,060
that one this one's huge I'm a little
worried about I might not get rid of

114
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,070
worried about I might not get rid of
 

115
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,210

now though I think this episode I'm
 

121
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,570
now though I think this episode I'm
going to start to building those EMP

122
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:24,580
going to start to building those EMP
 

123
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:31,110
going to start to building those EMP
units though so let's get to that so now

124
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
units though so let's get to that so now
 

125
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,330
units though so let's get to that so now
I've marked out this rectangle here with

126
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:33,340
I've marked out this rectangle here with
 

127
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,410
I've marked out this rectangle here with
these little pillars around this center

128
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:37,420
these little pillars around this center
 

129
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,460
these little pillars around this center
point here this is going to be my mob

130
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:41,470
point here this is going to be my mob
 

131
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,040
point here this is going to be my mob
area it's going to be a bit off the ice

132
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,050
area it's going to be a bit off the ice
 

133
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:49,910
area it's going to be a bit off the ice
I think six blocks up total and it's

134
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:49,920
I think six blocks up total and it's
 

135
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,730
I think six blocks up total and it's
sixteen wide and 22 long so fairly big

136
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:55,740
sixteen wide and 22 long so fairly big
 

137
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,610
sixteen wide and 22 long so fairly big
but not too too big

138
00:04:59,610 --> 00:04:59,620
but not too too big
 

139
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:05,250
but not too too big
I believe the entrance of my base will

140
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:05,260
I believe the entrance of my base will
 

141
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,380
I believe the entrance of my base will
be from this direction and then you will

142
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,390
be from this direction and then you will
 

143
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,610
be from this direction and then you will
go up a little bit to the mob area here

144
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:14,620
go up a little bit to the mob area here
 

145
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:20,340
go up a little bit to the mob area here
I got to fill in this rectangle and put

146
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:20,350
I got to fill in this rectangle and put
 

147
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:27,210
I got to fill in this rectangle and put
a layer of soil all the way all the way

148
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:27,220
a layer of soil all the way all the way
 

149
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:33,200
a layer of soil all the way all the way
to fill it up and then I will be back

150
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,210

 

151
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,750

that is a strangest looking table I have

152
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:36,760
that is a strangest looking table I have
 

153
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,240
that is a strangest looking table I have
ever seen but now Adso it's just a soil

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,250
ever seen but now Adso it's just a soil
 

155

molding for my mob area floor here it's

156
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:49,870
molding for my mob area floor here it's
 

157
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,810
molding for my mob area floor here it's
a little strange to start building like

158
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:51,820
a little strange to start building like
 

159
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:58,080
a little strange to start building like
this already since this is important

160
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,090
this already since this is important
 

161
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,909
this already since this is important
part of the base so I should build it

162
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
part of the base so I should build it
 

163
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,180
part of the base so I should build it
first and I also know I want it off the

164
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,190
first and I also know I want it off the
 

165
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,730
first and I also know I want it off the
ground so that's why I'm doing this

166
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:05,740
ground so that's why I'm doing this
 

167
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,330
ground so that's why I'm doing this
because I need to run wiring underground

168
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:09,340
because I need to run wiring underground
 

169
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,270
because I need to run wiring underground
and land out like water canals and stuff

170
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:12,280
and land out like water canals and stuff
 

171
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,750
and land out like water canals and stuff
hidden underground so I need it at least

172
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:15,760
hidden underground so I need it at least
 

173
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,050
hidden underground so I need it at least
three blocks up but I think I'm making

174
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:19,060
three blocks up but I think I'm making
 

175
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,140
three blocks up but I think I'm making
it six blocks up here just so I have a

176
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,150
it six blocks up here just so I have a
 

177
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,060
it six blocks up here just so I have a
little bit of a buffer in case I need

178
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,070
little bit of a buffer in case I need
 

179
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,079
little bit of a buffer in case I need
more

180
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:27,089

 

181
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:34,739

so let's see which direction are we if

182
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:34,749
so let's see which direction are we if
 

183
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:40,399
so let's see which direction are we if
the entrance to my base is on the side I

184
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:40,409
the entrance to my base is on the side I
 

185
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:44,339
the entrance to my base is on the side I
figured this out on paper kind of and

186
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:44,349
figured this out on paper kind of and
 

187
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:48,749
figured this out on paper kind of and
have 4 e MP units on this side three on

188
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:48,759
have 4 e MP units on this side three on
 

189
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,969
have 4 e MP units on this side three on
that side and four on the side and all

190
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:53,979
that side and four on the side and all
 

191
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:58,709
that side and four on the side and all
the items can merge kind of in the

192
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:58,719
the items can merge kind of in the
 

193
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,569
the items can merge kind of in the
center area I'll probably have a few

194
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:00,579
center area I'll probably have a few
 

195
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:03,899
center area I'll probably have a few
other things in the center will be

196
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:03,909
other things in the center will be
 

197
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:09,419
other things in the center will be
walking paths and I think I'm just going

198
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:09,429
walking paths and I think I'm just going
 

199
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:15,919
walking paths and I think I'm just going
to fill this with ice for now which is

200
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:15,929
to fill this with ice for now which is
 

201
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:28,110
to fill this with ice for now which is
not as difficult as you might think

202
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,120

 

203
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,680

I just can place the water I think up to

204
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:31,690
I just can place the water I think up to
 

205
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:37,110
I just can place the water I think up to
two blocks away ice is already starting

206
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
two blocks away ice is already starting
 

207
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:56,300
two blocks away ice is already starting
to form just like that

208
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,310

 

209
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:03,230

automatically fills itself in I've used

210
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,240
automatically fills itself in I've used
 

211
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,090
automatically fills itself in I've used
a lot of soil blocks building this so

212
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,100
a lot of soil blocks building this so
 

213
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,530
a lot of soil blocks building this so
it's a good thing I have to level up

214
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:06,540
it's a good thing I have to level up
 

215
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,740
it's a good thing I have to level up
these islands around here otherwise I

216
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:09,750
these islands around here otherwise I
 

217
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,850
these islands around here otherwise I
might run out because I pretty much use

218
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:13,860
might run out because I pretty much use
 

219
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,880
might run out because I pretty much use
them all at my other base building that

220
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:16,890
them all at my other base building that
 

221
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,540
them all at my other base building that
slime farm so don't have a whole lot of

222
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:20,550
slime farm so don't have a whole lot of
 

223
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,220
slime farm so don't have a whole lot of
soil left okay well I'm going to let

224
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,230
soil left okay well I'm going to let
 

225
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,650
soil left okay well I'm going to let
this freeze over it's not going to be

226
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:27,660
this freeze over it's not going to be
 

227
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,020
this freeze over it's not going to be
ice in the end but I'm just using it as

228
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,030
ice in the end but I'm just using it as
 

229
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,399
ice in the end but I'm just using it as
a start just because it's a easy to make

230
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:34,409
a start just because it's a easy to make
 

231
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:42,290
a start just because it's a easy to make
ice floor I started laying down the

232
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:42,300
ice floor I started laying down the
 

233
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,840
ice floor I started laying down the
placement of the EMP units this is kind

234
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:47,850
placement of the EMP units this is kind
 

235
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,020
placement of the EMP units this is kind
of what it's going to be like there's 11

236
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,030
of what it's going to be like there's 11
 

237
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:56,600
of what it's going to be like there's 11
of these in total I'm not I haven't

238
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:56,610
of these in total I'm not I haven't
 

239
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,080
of these in total I'm not I haven't
decided

240
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,090
decided
 

241
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,410
decided
officially on any of the block types I'm

242
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:00,420
officially on any of the block types I'm
 

243
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,520
officially on any of the block types I'm
using that right now I'm just using

244
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:01,530
using that right now I'm just using
 

245
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,550
using that right now I'm just using
sandstone it's a little bit hard to

246
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
sandstone it's a little bit hard to
 

247
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,600
sandstone it's a little bit hard to
choose what type to use because I have

248
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:07,610
choose what type to use because I have
 

249
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,600
choose what type to use because I have
nothing else built in the base so I have

250
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:11,610
nothing else built in the base so I have
 

251
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,660
nothing else built in the base so I have
nothing to match the style with but

252
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:13,670
nothing to match the style with but
 

253
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,579
nothing to match the style with but
that's for now I'm using sandstone this

254
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:16,589
that's for now I'm using sandstone this
 

255
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,450
that's for now I'm using sandstone this
won't be solid ice either in the end ah

256
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:20,460
won't be solid ice either in the end ah
 

257
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,350
won't be solid ice either in the end ah
I was thinking about maybe using snow

258
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
I was thinking about maybe using snow
 

259
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,970
I was thinking about maybe using snow
but if you guys have ideas of things

260
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:25,980
but if you guys have ideas of things
 

261
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,960
but if you guys have ideas of things
that look good with ice and stuff let me

262
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:29,970
that look good with ice and stuff let me
 

263
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,680
that look good with ice and stuff let me
know there will be a little bit of ice

264
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:33,690
know there will be a little bit of ice
 

265
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,810
know there will be a little bit of ice
here yeah but the way this is going to

266
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:38,820
here yeah but the way this is going to
 

267
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,110
here yeah but the way this is going to
work this one's going to be for chickens

268
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
work this one's going to be for chickens
 

269
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,700
work this one's going to be for chickens
this one's for pigs this one's for sheep

270
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:45,710
this one's for pigs this one's for sheep
 

271
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:51,200
this one's for pigs this one's for sheep
this one's for cows and I know it

272
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,210
this one's for cows and I know it
 

273
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,730
this one's for cows and I know it
doesn't really make sense to have one

274
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:52,740
doesn't really make sense to have one
 

275
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,110
doesn't really make sense to have one
for sheep and cows because I don't know

276
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
for sheep and cows because I don't know
 

277
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,760
for sheep and cows because I don't know
how to separate the two so why would I

278
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:58,770
how to separate the two so why would I
 

279
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,450
how to separate the two so why would I
have one for each well probably I'll

280
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:02,460
have one for each well probably I'll
 

281
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,699
have one for each well probably I'll
have the sheep and cows together in this

282
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:04,709
have the sheep and cows together in this
 

283
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:09,680
have the sheep and cows together in this
one but I'm making one for both for

284
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:09,690
one but I'm making one for both for
 

285
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,410
one but I'm making one for both for
two reasons one in case I ever figure

286
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:12,420
two reasons one in case I ever figure
 

287
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,320
two reasons one in case I ever figure
out how to separate the two or someone

288
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,330
out how to separate the two or someone
 

289
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,070
out how to separate the two or someone
else does

290
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,080
else does
 

291
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,570
else does
like if notch ever adds scarecrows right

292
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:20,580
like if notch ever adds scarecrows right
 

293
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,460
like if notch ever adds scarecrows right
over to the game we might have new ways

294
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:22,470
over to the game we might have new ways
 

295
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,270
over to the game we might have new ways
of separating mobs you never know the

296
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:26,280
of separating mobs you never know the
 

297
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,330
of separating mobs you never know the
other thing if new mobs get added to the

298
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:29,340
other thing if new mobs get added to the
 

299
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,910
other thing if new mobs get added to the
game I'll have another free chamber

300
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
game I'll have another free chamber
 

301
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,570
game I'll have another free chamber
available so I might be able to you know

302
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:35,580
available so I might be able to you know
 

303
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,810
available so I might be able to you know
use it because otherwise I have no way

304
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:38,820
use it because otherwise I have no way
 

305
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,280
use it because otherwise I have no way
of expanding this let's see what else

306
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,290
of expanding this let's see what else
 

307
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,500
of expanding this let's see what else
I believe this one will be for wolves

308
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:47,510
I believe this one will be for wolves
 

309
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,940
I believe this one will be for wolves
this fat one here is going to be for

310
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:49,950
this fat one here is going to be for
 

311
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,040
this fat one here is going to be for
spiders it's going to have to be a bit

312
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,050
spiders it's going to have to be a bit
 

313
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,400
spiders it's going to have to be a bit
different than the other ones this one

314
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,410
different than the other ones this one
 

315
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:02,900
different than the other ones this one
will be for squid this one for slime and

316
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:02,910
will be for squid this one for slime and
 

317
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:08,570
will be for squid this one for slime and
again I'm going to have Sambi or I might

318
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:08,580
again I'm going to have Sambi or I might
 

319
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,410
again I'm going to have Sambi or I might
do creeper first zombie skeleton and

320
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:12,420
do creeper first zombie skeleton and
 

321
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,690
do creeper first zombie skeleton and
again the only one I can automatically

322
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:14,700
again the only one I can automatically
 

323
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,230
again the only one I can automatically
separate is creepers and even that's a

324
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
separate is creepers and even that's a
 

325
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,220
separate is creepers and even that's a
little bit tough to do so in all

326
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,230
little bit tough to do so in all
 

327
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,530
little bit tough to do so in all
likelihood I'll probably have creepers

328
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:24,540
likelihood I'll probably have creepers
 

329
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,970
likelihood I'll probably have creepers
then zombie skeletons and creepers and

330
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:28,980
then zombie skeletons and creepers and
 

331
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,850
then zombie skeletons and creepers and
all together in this one and this one

332
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:31,860
all together in this one and this one
 

333
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,360
all together in this one and this one
will probably be free and if a new mob

334
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,370
will probably be free and if a new mob
 

335
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,670
will probably be free and if a new mob
gets added to the game or I find some

336
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
gets added to the game or I find some
 

337
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
gets added to the game or I find some
way to properly separate them

338
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:39,690
way to properly separate them
 

339
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:46,090
way to properly separate them
automatically then I will use this spot

340
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:46,100

 

341
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,600

yeah that's that's the plan so I'm going

342
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:50,610
yeah that's that's the plan so I'm going
 

343
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,260
yeah that's that's the plan so I'm going
to build these up again I'm not decided

344
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:54,270
to build these up again I'm not decided
 

345
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,920
to build these up again I'm not decided
on the look here just trying to get to

346
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:56,930
on the look here just trying to get to
 

347
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:05,690
on the look here just trying to get to
the shape going so that's kind of what

348
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:05,700
the shape going so that's kind of what
 

349
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,620
the shape going so that's kind of what
they look like

350
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:10,630

 

351
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,610

I think I think since there's a lot of

352
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:14,620
I think I think since there's a lot of
 

353
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,920
I think I think since there's a lot of
ice around I might start using color

354
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:16,930
ice around I might start using color
 

355
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,010
ice around I might start using color
wool more because it kind of I think it

356
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:20,020
wool more because it kind of I think it
 

357
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,000
wool more because it kind of I think it
would go well with ice as well you could

358
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,010
would go well with ice as well you could
 

359
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,850
would go well with ice as well you could
have lots of different colors probably

360
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:25,860
have lots of different colors probably
 

361
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,810
have lots of different colors probably
without looking too strange because ice

362
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:30,820
without looking too strange because ice
 

363
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,960
without looking too strange because ice
is a lighter block uh-huh anyway I'm

364
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:36,970
is a lighter block uh-huh anyway I'm
 

365
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,370
is a lighter block uh-huh anyway I'm
going to keep working on this well I'm

366
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:41,380
going to keep working on this well I'm
 

367
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,650
going to keep working on this well I'm
out of sandstone again guys so I'm gonna

368
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:43,660
out of sandstone again guys so I'm gonna
 

369
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,940
out of sandstone again guys so I'm gonna
have to get some more sometime but let's

370
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:46,950
have to get some more sometime but let's
 

371
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,190
have to get some more sometime but let's
let's keep working on this for now each

372
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:50,200
let's keep working on this for now each
 

373
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,100
let's keep working on this for now each
of these is going to need I believe five

374
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,110
of these is going to need I believe five
 

375
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,560
of these is going to need I believe five
sticky pistons I know one goes pointing

376
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:58,570
sticky pistons I know one goes pointing
 

377
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:06,870
sticky pistons I know one goes pointing
down here another one goes here glass on

378
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
down here another one goes here glass on
 

379
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,770
down here another one goes here glass on
top glass on that one

380
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:10,780
top glass on that one
 

381
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,620
top glass on that one
and then I think it goes or was it I

382
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:15,630
and then I think it goes or was it I
 

383
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:24,000
and then I think it goes or was it I
think over here just three of them

384
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,010
think over here just three of them
 

385
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,170
think over here just three of them
stacked on top of each other like that

386
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:27,180
stacked on top of each other like that
 

387
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,570
stacked on top of each other like that
the nice thing about posting my videos

388
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:30,580
the nice thing about posting my videos
 

389
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,690
the nice thing about posting my videos
online I can always look at them as a

390
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:33,700
online I can always look at them as a
 

391
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,300
online I can always look at them as a
reference later so instead of having to

392
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,310
reference later so instead of having to
 

393
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,620
reference later so instead of having to
walk all the way back to my base to see

394
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:40,630
walk all the way back to my base to see
 

395
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,040
walk all the way back to my base to see
what - how to build these EMP things I

396
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,050
what - how to build these EMP things I
 

397
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,920
what - how to build these EMP things I
was able to just look at my last let's

398
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:46,930
was able to just look at my last let's
 

399
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:52,530
was able to just look at my last let's
play episode which is nice yeah so chest

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:52,540
play episode which is nice yeah so chest
 

401
00:13:52,540 --> 00:14:03,240
play episode which is nice yeah so chest
go here kind of like this I may put like

402
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,250
go here kind of like this I may put like
 

403
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,590
go here kind of like this I may put like
a pillar here

404
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600

 

405
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:17,040

maybe this for looks yeah levers one two

406
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,050
maybe this for looks yeah levers one two
 

407
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,120
maybe this for looks yeah levers one two
three four and that's kind of how you

408
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,130
three four and that's kind of how you
 

409
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:28,110
three four and that's kind of how you
build these things so I'm going to keep

410
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,120
build these things so I'm going to keep
 

411
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,580
build these things so I'm going to keep
at it

412
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:31,590

 

413
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,760

mmm

414
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:32,770
mmm
 

415
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,840
mmm
well it seems like I made a huge mistake

416
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:35,850
well it seems like I made a huge mistake
 

417
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,000
well it seems like I made a huge mistake
I'm going to have to redo all these

418
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,010
I'm going to have to redo all these
 

419
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,290
I'm going to have to redo all these
walls the problem is kind of how these

420
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:43,300
walls the problem is kind of how these
 

421
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,440
walls the problem is kind of how these
corners are meeting they're a little bit

422
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,450
corners are meeting they're a little bit
 

423
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,850
corners are meeting they're a little bit
too cramped I think I don't think it's

424
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:50,860
too cramped I think I don't think it's
 

425
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,200
too cramped I think I don't think it's
going to be a problem with the wiring

426
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,210
going to be a problem with the wiring
 

427
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,440
going to be a problem with the wiring
but just the look looks kind of cramped

428
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:55,450
but just the look looks kind of cramped
 

429
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,800
but just the look looks kind of cramped
and also the way the water streams are

430
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:58,810
and also the way the water streams are
 

431
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,920
and also the way the water streams are
going to flow I'll have to have the hole

432
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:00,930
going to flow I'll have to have the hole
 

433
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,670
going to flow I'll have to have the hole
right here for this one to go here and

434
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
right here for this one to go here and
 

435
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,940
right here for this one to go here and
this one to go here and that's not going

436
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:08,950
this one to go here and that's not going
 

437
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,410
this one to go here and that's not going
to work very good because I'll be

438
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:10,420
to work very good because I'll be
 

439
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:18,210
to work very good because I'll be
walking over this all the time so I kind

440
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,220
walking over this all the time so I kind
 

441
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,680
walking over this all the time so I kind
of want instead this being one - I want

442
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:22,690
of want instead this being one - I want
 

443
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,410
of want instead this being one - I want
it one two three wide in the corners so

444
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:27,420
it one two three wide in the corners so
 

445
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,210
it one two three wide in the corners so
to do that I need to move this wall back

446
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:30,220
to do that I need to move this wall back
 

447
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:36,870
to do that I need to move this wall back
one block also these ones I have kind of

448
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
one block also these ones I have kind of
 

449
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,010
one block also these ones I have kind of
five wide and with these spider walls I

450
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:41,020
five wide and with these spider walls I
 

451
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,440
five wide and with these spider walls I
have them at four wide a little bit

452
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,450
have them at four wide a little bit
 

453
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,640
have them at four wide a little bit
worried I'll have trouble with that

454
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,650
worried I'll have trouble with that
 

455
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,170
worried I'll have trouble with that
later - so I think I'm just going to

456
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:46,180
later - so I think I'm just going to
 

457
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,400
later - so I think I'm just going to
make them five wide just to be safe even

458
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,410
make them five wide just to be safe even
 

459
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,500
make them five wide just to be safe even
though I probably don't while I might

460
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:52,510
though I probably don't while I might
 

461
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:57,890
though I probably don't while I might
need to I don't know

462
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:57,900

 

463
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,400

I move the walls back this one had to go

464
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,410
I move the walls back this one had to go
 

465
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,770
I move the walls back this one had to go
back two blocks this one had to go back

466
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:03,780
back two blocks this one had to go back
 

467
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,590
back two blocks this one had to go back
two blocks and this one have to go back

468
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:06,600
two blocks and this one have to go back
 

469
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,390
two blocks and this one have to go back
one block so that's unfortunate I had to

470
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:11,400
one block so that's unfortunate I had to
 

471
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,040
one block so that's unfortunate I had to
do that but it's a good thing I caught

472
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,050
do that but it's a good thing I caught
 

473
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,200
do that but it's a good thing I caught
it as soon as I did because that would

474
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,210
it as soon as I did because that would
 

475
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:20,020
it as soon as I did because that would
have been a problem later on I'm sure

476
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,030
have been a problem later on I'm sure
 

477
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,540
have been a problem later on I'm sure
now kind of standstill here I'm out of

478
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:23,550

there's a problem and same with the left

there's a problem and same with the left
 

545
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,379
there's a problem and same with the left

there's a problem I'm thinking I'm going
 

549
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,849
there's a problem I'm thinking I'm going
to just work on leveling this island and

550
00:18:59,849 --> 00:18:59,859
to just work on leveling this island and
 

551
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:02,049
to just work on leveling this island and
hopefully I'll get some sandstone from

552
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:02,059
hopefully I'll get some sandstone from
 

553
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,369
hopefully I'll get some sandstone from
doing that because there's sand around

554
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:03,379
doing that because there's sand around
 

555
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:05,680
doing that because there's sand around
here so a little bit deeper I'm thinking

556
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:05,690
here so a little bit deeper I'm thinking
 

557
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:10,299
here so a little bit deeper I'm thinking
they're sandstone so it looks like from

558
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:10,309
they're sandstone so it looks like from
 

559
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:15,249
they're sandstone so it looks like from
a distance and see we have mob spawning

560
00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:15,259
a distance and see we have mob spawning
 

561
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:19,659
a distance and see we have mob spawning
on here so we need to brown sheet and to

562
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:19,669
on here so we need to brown sheet and to
 

563
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:24,969
on here so we need to brown sheet and to
keep that from happening I'm going to be

564
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:24,979
keep that from happening I'm going to be
 

565
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:30,729
keep that from happening I'm going to be
using TNT so apparently if you hit it

566
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:30,739
using TNT so apparently if you hit it
 

567
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:34,049
using TNT so apparently if you hit it
with flint and steel

568

with flint and steel
 

569
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:39,940
with flint and steel
it works like it used to hopefully I

570
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:39,950
it works like it used to hopefully I
 

571
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,319
it works like it used to hopefully I
don't make too big of a mess I'll

572
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:44,329
don't make too big of a mess I'll
 

573
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:49,989
don't make too big of a mess I'll
sandstone here I'm going to try to do

574
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:49,999
sandstone here I'm going to try to do
 

575
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:58,620
sandstone here I'm going to try to do
the bulk of this with tea and tea

576
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:58,630

 

577
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:14,520

oh whoa there's some sandstone it's kind

578
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:14,530
oh whoa there's some sandstone it's kind
 

579
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,080
oh whoa there's some sandstone it's kind
of I don't really want to get though

580
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,090
of I don't really want to get though
 

581
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,279
of I don't really want to get though
it's a little too deeper so I'll

582
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:20,289
it's a little too deeper so I'll
 

583
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:22,500
it's a little too deeper so I'll
probably have to go back to my main base

584
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:22,510
probably have to go back to my main base
 

585
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:26,580
probably have to go back to my main base
in my normal location I go for young

586
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:26,590
in my normal location I go for young
 

587
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:33,270
in my normal location I go for young
sandstone but I'm gonna level this

588
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,280
sandstone but I'm gonna level this
 

589
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,100
sandstone but I'm gonna level this
island anyway I don't know that looks

590
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,110
island anyway I don't know that looks
 

591
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,100
island anyway I don't know that looks
kind of cool to me doesn't it it's like

592
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,110
kind of cool to me doesn't it it's like
 

593
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,210
kind of cool to me doesn't it it's like
half the hills is blown away any of the

594
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:45,220
half the hills is blown away any of the
 

595
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,850
half the hills is blown away any of the
areas that I go too deep I need to fill

596
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:47,860
areas that I go too deep I need to fill
 

597
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,070
areas that I go too deep I need to fill
in the soil so I got to be careful with

598
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
in the soil so I got to be careful with
 

599
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,960
in the soil so I got to be careful with
the TNT but like that areas like over

600
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:54,970
the TNT but like that areas like over
 

601
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,210
the TNT but like that areas like over
there I can use TNT no problem and they

602
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:57,220
there I can use TNT no problem and they
 

603
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,120
there I can use TNT no problem and they
also have a stone base so I don't need

604
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,130
also have a stone base so I don't need
 

605
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:05,940
also have a stone base so I don't need
to worry about going below well I might

606
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:05,950
to worry about going below well I might
 

607

I'm at Y 64 that's what I want this
 

609
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,669
I'm at Y 64 that's what I want this
whole thing to be once I get this all

never even know there was an island here

616
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,190
never even know there was an island here
 

617
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:24,380
never even know there was an island here
and no mobs will be able to spawn here

619
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,640

well guys I think that's where I'm going

620
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:26,650
well guys I think that's where I'm going
 

621
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,899
well guys I think that's where I'm going
to end today's episode I'm really

622
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:30,909
to end today's episode I'm really
 

623
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:34,500
to end today's episode I'm really
enjoying building the new base there it

624
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:34,510
enjoying building the new base there it
 

625
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,930
enjoying building the new base there it
might be pretty confusing right now but

626
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:36,940
might be pretty confusing right now but
 

627
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,960
might be pretty confusing right now but
don't worry it'll become a lot clearer

628
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:39,970
don't worry it'll become a lot clearer
 

629
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,180
don't worry it'll become a lot clearer
as I work on it more what I'm actually

630
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,190
as I work on it more what I'm actually
 

631
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,730
as I work on it more what I'm actually
intending on doing

632
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:43,740
intending on doing
 

633
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,710
intending on doing
it's a strange project that's for sure

634
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
it's a strange project that's for sure
 

635
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,649
it's a strange project that's for sure
but will be fun thank you for watching
