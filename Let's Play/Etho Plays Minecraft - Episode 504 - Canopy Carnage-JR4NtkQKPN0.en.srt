and random house fires are very hard to

172
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,290
and random house fires are very hard to
 

173
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,300
and random house fires are very hard to
explain to insurance companies but a

174
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,310
explain to insurance companies but a
 

175
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,340
explain to insurance companies but a
house with a fireplace in well accidents

176
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,350
house with a fireplace in well accidents
 

177
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:58,890
house with a fireplace in well accidents
happen free upgrade that's right okay so

178
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:58,900

 

179
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,210

no dragon there we go light our fire I

180
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:03,220
no dragon there we go light our fire I
 

181
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,710
no dragon there we go light our fire I
don't know if this will actually burn

182
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
don't know if this will actually burn
 

183
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,259
don't know if this will actually burn
something let's let's count this one

184
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:07,269
something let's let's count this one
 

185
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:10,259
something let's let's count this one
two three four I think this wood might

186
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:10,269
two three four I think this wood might
 

187
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:12,750
two three four I think this wood might
catch on fire up there I can get rid of

188
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:12,760
catch on fire up there I can get rid of
 

189
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,179
catch on fire up there I can get rid of
this torch and just for good insurance

190
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:15,189
this torch and just for good insurance
 

191
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,159
this torch and just for good insurance
here let's put a carpet right by the

192
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:17,169
here let's put a carpet right by the
 

193
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:20,430
here let's put a carpet right by the
fire yeah we don't actually want the

194
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:20,440
fire yeah we don't actually want the
 

195
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,550
fire yeah we don't actually want the
place to burn down just yet but just

196
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:23,560
place to burn down just yet but just
 

197
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,260
place to burn down just yet but just
when we want to upgrade so until then we

198
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,270
when we want to upgrade so until then we
 

199
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,249
when we want to upgrade so until then we
can just play some string up here

200
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:29,259
can just play some string up here
 

201
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,189
can just play some string up here
because it's not flammable I think we

202
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:32,199
because it's not flammable I think we
 

203
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,500
because it's not flammable I think we
need three more pieces yeah three more

204
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:34,510
need three more pieces yeah three more
 

205
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,640
need three more pieces yeah three more
pieces so if we do this I don't think

206
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:38,650
pieces so if we do this I don't think
 

207
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,040
pieces so if we do this I don't think
that'll burn now because it travels one

208
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,050
that'll burn now because it travels one
 

209
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,980
that'll burn now because it travels one
two three four blocks above one block

210
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:43,990
two three four blocks above one block
 

211
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,290
two three four blocks above one block
below and one block all around so I

212
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:46,300
below and one block all around so I
 

213
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,040
below and one block all around so I
think that's fireproof now although that

214
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,050
think that's fireproof now although that
 

215
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,870
think that's fireproof now although that
looks kind of dumb doesn't it maybe I

216
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:51,880
looks kind of dumb doesn't it maybe I
 

217
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,900
looks kind of dumb doesn't it maybe I
should use something else anyways so

218
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:54,910
should use something else anyways so
 

219
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,490
should use something else anyways so
this is just about done we got ourselves

220
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:56,500
this is just about done we got ourselves
 

221
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,439
this is just about done we got ourselves
an upstairs here I think it's very nice

222
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:58,449
an upstairs here I think it's very nice
 

223
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:00,360
an upstairs here I think it's very nice
it's very nice we can get some pictures

224
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,370
it's very nice we can get some pictures
 

225
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,670
it's very nice we can get some pictures
in and we don't really have room for a

226
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:02,680
in and we don't really have room for a
 

227
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,469
in and we don't really have room for a
closet or anything so I think I'll just

228
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
closet or anything so I think I'll just
 

229
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,680
closet or anything so I think I'll just
do that and we'll call it good here all

230
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:07,690
do that and we'll call it good here all
 

231
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,890
do that and we'll call it good here all
right I put one picture downstairs here

232
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:09,900
right I put one picture downstairs here
 

233
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,750
right I put one picture downstairs here
and we're pretty much out of space so

234
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:12,760
and we're pretty much out of space so
 

235
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,670
and we're pretty much out of space so
we're gonna call that good I'm happy

236
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:14,680
we're gonna call that good I'm happy
 

237
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,790
we're gonna call that good I'm happy
with that okay so this should be

238
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:17,800
with that okay so this should be
 

239
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,810
with that okay so this should be
interesting

240
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:18,820
interesting
 

241
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,540
interesting
I got something kind of prepped here

242
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:21,550
I got something kind of prepped here
 

243
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,640
I got something kind of prepped here
while building the mushroom houses

244
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:23,650
while building the mushroom houses
 

245
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,899
while building the mushroom houses
trying to think what should we do with

246
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:24,909
trying to think what should we do with
 

247
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:26,580
trying to think what should we do with
our swamp biome how can we make it look

248
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:26,590
our swamp biome how can we make it look
 

249
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,589
our swamp biome how can we make it look
better because we're doing that biome

250
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:28,599
better because we're doing that biome
 

251
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:29,909
better because we're doing that biome
enhancement thing where we take our

252
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
enhancement thing where we take our
 

253
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,629
enhancement thing where we take our
biomes our swamp our desert our plains

254
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:33,639
biomes our swamp our desert our plains
 

255
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,189
biomes our swamp our desert our plains
and forests and stuff and try to make

256
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
and forests and stuff and try to make
 

257
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,879
and forests and stuff and try to make
them look cooler than their defaults and

258
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:37,889
them look cooler than their defaults and
 

259
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,080
them look cooler than their defaults and
with a swamp here like we've done the

260
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,090
with a swamp here like we've done the
 

261
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,460
with a swamp here like we've done the
mushroom thing we've just added a

262
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:41,470
mushroom thing we've just added a
 

263
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,050
mushroom thing we've just added a
mushroom house I think those are cool I

264
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,060
mushroom house I think those are cool I
 

265
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,430
mushroom house I think those are cool I
would like to add a few more mushrooms

266
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:44,440
would like to add a few more mushrooms
 

267
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,850
would like to add a few more mushrooms
to this and I thought like even if we

268
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:47,860
to this and I thought like even if we
 

269
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,680
to this and I thought like even if we
add mushrooms and change out the ground

270
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:49,690
add mushrooms and change out the ground
 

271
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,180
add mushrooms and change out the ground
and add some decorations it's still

272
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,190
and add some decorations it's still
 

273
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,230
and add some decorations it's still
gonna feel pretty empty I think so I'm

274
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,240
gonna feel pretty empty I think so I'm
 

275
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,270
gonna feel pretty empty I think so I'm
gonna try something a little bit more

276
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
gonna try something a little bit more
 

277
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,719
gonna try something a little bit more
crazy here I would like to have like 30

278
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:00,729
crazy here I would like to have like 30
 

279
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:03,659
crazy here I would like to have like 30
custom trees 20 blocks tall and

280
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:03,669
custom trees 20 blocks tall and
 

281
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,580
custom trees 20 blocks tall and
spreading throughout the whole biome

282
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:05,590
spreading throughout the whole biome
 

283
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,969
spreading throughout the whole biome
here but good luck building 30 custom

284
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:08,979
here but good luck building 30 custom
 

285
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:10,769
here but good luck building 30 custom
trees and survival right there's no way

286
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:10,779
trees and survival right there's no way
 

287
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,120
trees and survival right there's no way
the copy trees

288
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,130
the copy trees
 

289
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,580
the copy trees
so I'm gonna try a cheese method here

290
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:14,590
so I'm gonna try a cheese method here
 

291
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,780
so I'm gonna try a cheese method here
which will still take quite a bit of

292
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:15,790
which will still take quite a bit of
 

293
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,080
which will still take quite a bit of
time but I think it should be

294
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,090
time but I think it should be
 

295
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,430
time but I think it should be
interesting I want to make a fake canopy

296
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:22,440
interesting I want to make a fake canopy
 

297
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,560
interesting I want to make a fake canopy
that looks like a real canopy if you

298
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:25,570
that looks like a real canopy if you
 

299
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,800
that looks like a real canopy if you
know what I mean so birch trees they

300
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:28,810
know what I mean so birch trees they
 

301
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,330
know what I mean so birch trees they
they are 5 by 5's right so we want to

302
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:33,340
they are 5 by 5's right so we want to
 

303
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,630
they are 5 by 5's right so we want to
place them every 4 blocks here I got to

304
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:36,640
place them every 4 blocks here I got to
 

305
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,930
place them every 4 blocks here I got to
think of a better way of counting maybe

306
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:38,940
think of a better way of counting maybe
 

307
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,580
think of a better way of counting maybe
can I use the f3 would that make this

308
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:41,590
can I use the f3 would that make this
 

309
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:47,820
can I use the f3 would that make this
easier so we're at 23 1 2 3 4 5 it would

310
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:47,830
easier so we're at 23 1 2 3 4 5 it would
 

311
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,580
easier so we're at 23 1 2 3 4 5 it would
be every 5 right yeah so 28 whenever

312
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:50,590
be every 5 right yeah so 28 whenever
 

313
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,190
be every 5 right yeah so 28 whenever
it's at 3 or 8 on the x-coordinate

314
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,200
it's at 3 or 8 on the x-coordinate
 

315
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,230
it's at 3 or 8 on the x-coordinate
that's when I place a sapling that makes

316
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:55,240
that's when I place a sapling that makes
 

317
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,260
that's when I place a sapling that makes
that easy ok so basically all I'm gonna

318
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,270
that easy ok so basically all I'm gonna
 

319
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,820
that easy ok so basically all I'm gonna
do is plant the bunch of saplings up

320
00:06:59,820 --> 00:06:59,830
do is plant the bunch of saplings up
 

321
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,370
do is plant the bunch of saplings up
here and I'm gonna let them grow

322
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:02,380
here and I'm gonna let them grow
 

323
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,920
here and I'm gonna let them grow
naturally if any don't grow I'll come by

324
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:04,930
naturally if any don't grow I'll come by
 

325
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,340
naturally if any don't grow I'll come by
with some bonemeal and that'll be our

326
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:08,350
with some bonemeal and that'll be our
 

327
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,400
with some bonemeal and that'll be our
first step to this if it ends up looking

328
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,410
first step to this if it ends up looking
 

329
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,830
first step to this if it ends up looking
terrible I did make a backup before I

330
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
terrible I did make a backup before I
 

331
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,110
terrible I did make a backup before I
started this so we can just undo any

332
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,120
started this so we can just undo any
 

333
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,210
started this so we can just undo any
changes if this really doesn't look good

334
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:18,220
changes if this really doesn't look good
 

335
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,540
changes if this really doesn't look good
afterwards cuz I'm not really sure how

336
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:21,550
afterwards cuz I'm not really sure how
 

337
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,420
afterwards cuz I'm not really sure how
it's gonna turn out here all right and I

338
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:24,430
it's gonna turn out here all right and I
 

339
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,000
it's gonna turn out here all right and I
think when I start the next row here I

340
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,010

 

341
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,200

don't know if I'll put them like

342
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,210
don't know if I'll put them like
 

343
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,940
don't know if I'll put them like
side-by-side with each other that would

344
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:32,950
side-by-side with each other that would
 

345
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,860
side-by-side with each other that would
be easier but I think I'll try staggered

346
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:34,870
be easier but I think I'll try staggered
 

347
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,660
be easier but I think I'll try staggered
them instead so let's start instead of

348
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:36,670
them instead so let's start instead of
 

349
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,360
them instead so let's start instead of
starting like right here maybe let's

350
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,370
starting like right here maybe let's
 

351
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,260
starting like right here maybe let's
like move it over a couple blocks that's

352
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:43,270
like move it over a couple blocks that's
 

353
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:51,120
like move it over a couple blocks that's
it at 0 and 5 ok so some time has passed

354
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,130
it at 0 and 5 ok so some time has passed
 

355
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,220
it at 0 and 5 ok so some time has passed
here and our trees have grown for the

356
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,230
here and our trees have grown for the
 

357
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,350
here and our trees have grown for the
most part there's still a couple missing

358
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
most part there's still a couple missing
 

359
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,050
most part there's still a couple missing
and as you can see it's pretty much

360
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:58,060
and as you can see it's pretty much
 

361
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,210
and as you can see it's pretty much
fills up the whole whole area there's

362
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:00,220
fills up the whole whole area there's
 

363
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,090
fills up the whole whole area there's
just the odd block between the trees

364
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:03,100
just the odd block between the trees
 

365
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,380
just the odd block between the trees
that I need to fill in and as I suspect

366
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:07,390
that I need to fill in and as I suspect
 

367
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,480
that I need to fill in and as I suspect
it it doesn't really look super super

368
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:09,490
it it doesn't really look super super
 

369
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,430
it it doesn't really look super super
good just yet right so there's gonna be

370
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
good just yet right so there's gonna be
 

371
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,250
good just yet right so there's gonna be
several steps to doing this and we're

372
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:14,260
several steps to doing this and we're
 

373
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,200
several steps to doing this and we're
just doing it on a small section to try

374
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,210
just doing it on a small section to try
 

375
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,940
just doing it on a small section to try
it and if it looks good here then we'll

376
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:17,950
it and if it looks good here then we'll
 

377
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,780
it and if it looks good here then we'll
like expand on this about 2 or 3 maybe 4

378
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:21,790
like expand on this about 2 or 3 maybe 4
 

379
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,200
like expand on this about 2 or 3 maybe 4
times but basically what I got to do now

380
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,210
times but basically what I got to do now
 

381
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,100
times but basically what I got to do now
is go

382
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,110
is go
 

383
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,980
is go
through this chop down the trees and I'm

384
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:31,990
through this chop down the trees and I'm
 

385
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,100
through this chop down the trees and I'm
ascared of of chopping down too much any

386
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,110
ascared of of chopping down too much any
 

387
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,870
ascared of of chopping down too much any
that didn't grow I got a bone meal and

388
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
that didn't grow I got a bone meal and
 

389
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,730
that didn't grow I got a bone meal and
you can see they kind of grow at various

390
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:38,740
you can see they kind of grow at various
 

391
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,590
you can see they kind of grow at various
Heights too so it's gonna hopefully let

392
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:40,600
Heights too so it's gonna hopefully let
 

393
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,100
Heights too so it's gonna hopefully let
make it look a bit more staggered be

394
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,110
make it look a bit more staggered be
 

395
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,980
make it look a bit more staggered be
good okay so check it out so this is

396
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:46,990
good okay so check it out so this is
 

397
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,120
good okay so check it out so this is
what it looks like now that we've

398
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,130
what it looks like now that we've
 

399
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,910
what it looks like now that we've
removed the the tree trunks kind of the

400
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:50,920
removed the the tree trunks kind of the
 

401
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,400
removed the the tree trunks kind of the
nighttime a view of it right now let's

402
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,410
nighttime a view of it right now let's
 

403
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,620
nighttime a view of it right now let's
go to sleep

404

glitched out it's kind of funny if we

412
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,040
glitched out it's kind of funny if we
 

413
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,230
glitched out it's kind of funny if we
sleep in here ba boom ba boom ba boom

[Laughter]
 

417
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,510
[Laughter]
I think it's cuz there's a half slab

418
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:15,520
I think it's cuz there's a half slab
 

419
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,980
I think it's cuz there's a half slab
over the over the top of the head I'm

420
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:16,990
over the over the top of the head I'm
 

421
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,670
over the over the top of the head I'm
not sure alright so this is the daytime

422
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:20,680
not sure alright so this is the daytime
 

423
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,000
not sure alright so this is the daytime
look pretty cool so we got to fill in

424
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,010
look pretty cool so we got to fill in
 

425
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,360
look pretty cool so we got to fill in
the gaps next year I did most the trees

426
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,370
the gaps next year I did most the trees
 

427
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,350
the gaps next year I did most the trees
where I just removed one of the the logs

428
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
where I just removed one of the the logs
 

429
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,780
where I just removed one of the the logs
like flush with the leaves but then in

430
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:33,790
like flush with the leaves but then in
 

431
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,660
like flush with the leaves but then in
some places I tried removing two and it

432
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:36,670
some places I tried removing two and it
 

433
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,730
some places I tried removing two and it
started leaving these big giant gaps a

434
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:38,740
started leaving these big giant gaps a
 

435
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,630
started leaving these big giant gaps a
bunch of the leaves despawned so

436
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:41,640
bunch of the leaves despawned so
 

437
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,080
bunch of the leaves despawned so
probably best just to remove one like if

438
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,090
probably best just to remove one like if
 

439
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,430
probably best just to remove one like if
we go to a tree here I'll try show you

440
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
we go to a tree here I'll try show you
 

441
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:56,190
we go to a tree here I'll try show you
what I mean hello maybe not alright it's

442
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,200
what I mean hello maybe not alright it's
 

443
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,960
what I mean hello maybe not alright it's
so freaky working here there's so many

444
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:57,970
so freaky working here there's so many
 

445
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,710
so freaky working here there's so many
mobs that spawn alright so if we just

446
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:01,720
mobs that spawn alright so if we just
 

447
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,780
mobs that spawn alright so if we just
remove one we we kind of do that but if

448
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:03,790
remove one we we kind of do that but if
 

449
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,620
remove one we we kind of do that but if
we remove two and you're placed to a

450
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:07,630
we remove two and you're placed to a
 

451
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,270
we remove two and you're placed to a
whole bunch of the leaves will despawn

452
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:09,280
whole bunch of the leaves will despawn
 

453
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,130
whole bunch of the leaves will despawn
so it's it's better just to do one I

454
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,140
so it's it's better just to do one I
 

455
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,920
so it's it's better just to do one I
think alright so this is what it looks

456
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:13,930
think alright so this is what it looks
 

457
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,110
think alright so this is what it looks
like from the sky here the top view of

458
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,120
like from the sky here the top view of
 

459
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,510
like from the sky here the top view of
it's a little bit funny looking I would

460
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:18,520
it's a little bit funny looking I would
 

461
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,770
it's a little bit funny looking I would
say so my next step here is to fill it

462
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:22,780
say so my next step here is to fill it
 

463
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,540
say so my next step here is to fill it
in like I said but we're gonna do some

464
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:24,550
in like I said but we're gonna do some
 

465
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,150
in like I said but we're gonna do some
other stuff as well so I'm gonna I think

466
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,160
other stuff as well so I'm gonna I think
 

467
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,440
other stuff as well so I'm gonna I think
it's gonna be easiest to do it from on

468
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,450
it's gonna be easiest to do it from on
 

469
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,980
it's gonna be easiest to do it from on
top here to fill in the gaps I'll try to

470
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:31,990
top here to fill in the gaps I'll try to
 

471
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,400
top here to fill in the gaps I'll try to
do that looks like there's gonna be a

472
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,410
do that looks like there's gonna be a
 

473
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,990
do that looks like there's gonna be a
few quite a few to fill in but then

474
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
few quite a few to fill in but then
 

475
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,460
few quite a few to fill in but then
another thing I'm gonna try to do here

476
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:41,470
another thing I'm gonna try to do here
 

477
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,260
another thing I'm gonna try to do here
if we want to give it that spooky swamp

478
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:43,270
if we want to give it that spooky swamp
 

479
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,080
if we want to give it that spooky swamp
feeling we got to block out the lights

480
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,090
feeling we got to block out the lights
 

481
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,900
feeling we got to block out the lights
so I'm gonna have to cover all this over

482
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:48,910
so I'm gonna have to cover all this over
 

483
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,540
so I'm gonna have to cover all this over
with some some sort of block and I think

484
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,550
with some some sort of block and I think
 

485
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,440
with some some sort of block and I think
clay will closely match the leaf color

486
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,450
clay will closely match the leaf color
 

487
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:00,150
clay will closely match the leaf color
here so basically I got to make sure no

488
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
here so basically I got to make sure no
 

489
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,640
here so basically I got to make sure no
light can pass through here and then

490
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:02,650
light can pass through here and then
 

491
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,230
light can pass through here and then
that's gonna look funny from the top

492
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
that's gonna look funny from the top
 

493
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,420
that's gonna look funny from the top
view as well so then you got to add

494
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:06,430
view as well so then you got to add
 

495
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,940
view as well so then you got to add
another layer or two of leaves on top of

496
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:08,950
another layer or two of leaves on top of
 

497
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,120
another layer or two of leaves on top of
this as well so check this out I forgot

498
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,130
this as well so check this out I forgot
 

499
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,070
this as well so check this out I forgot
that the leaves are actually gonna block

500
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,080
that the leaves are actually gonna block
 

501
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,340
that the leaves are actually gonna block
out the skylights like they with just a

502
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,350
out the skylights like they with just a
 

503
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,930
out the skylights like they with just a
few leaves you don't notice it but when

504
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:18,940
few leaves you don't notice it but when
 

505
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,250
few leaves you don't notice it but when
you get a bunch of them together and I

506
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:20,260
you get a bunch of them together and I
 

507
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,680
you get a bunch of them together and I
filled in the gaps now it's like

508
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:22,690
filled in the gaps now it's like
 

509
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,590
filled in the gaps now it's like
completely dark underneath there it's a

510
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
completely dark underneath there it's a
 

511
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,710
completely dark underneath there it's a
it's a CPM map oh oh oh we almost blew

512
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
it's a CPM map oh oh oh we almost blew
 

513
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,990
it's a CPM map oh oh oh we almost blew
up there I'm gonna run through here and

514
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,000
up there I'm gonna run through here and
 

515
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,210
up there I'm gonna run through here and
light it up thing is I don't need to put

516
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:36,220
light it up thing is I don't need to put
 

517
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,710
light it up thing is I don't need to put
the clay blocks above the leaves but I'm

518
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:37,720
the clay blocks above the leaves but I'm
 

519
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,930
the clay blocks above the leaves but I'm
still going to I think just because I

520
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:39,940
still going to I think just because I
 

521
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,730
still going to I think just because I
don't like seeing the blue through them

522
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:41,740
don't like seeing the blue through them
 

523
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,190
don't like seeing the blue through them
like that this the blue sky I think it's

524
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:44,200
like that this the blue sky I think it's
 

525
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,710
like that this the blue sky I think it's
better we cover them still hmm

526
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:46,720
better we cover them still hmm
 

527
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,690
better we cover them still hmm
this is where I start calculating time

528
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:48,700
this is where I start calculating time
 

529
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,130
this is where I start calculating time
and stuff so I covered up some of this

530
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,140
and stuff so I covered up some of this
 

531
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,810
and stuff so I covered up some of this
of course it takes a long time placing

532
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:54,820
of course it takes a long time placing
 

533
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,170
of course it takes a long time placing
the blocks to do this but it took just

534
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:58,180
the blocks to do this but it took just
 

535
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,610
the blocks to do this but it took just
to do this little section that's eight

536
00:11:59,610 --> 00:11:59,620
to do this little section that's eight
 

537
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,970
to do this little section that's eight
stacks of clay and we're gonna need at

538
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:02,980
stacks of clay and we're gonna need at
 

539
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,430
stacks of clay and we're gonna need at
least 24 maybe thirty two stacks total

540
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
least 24 maybe thirty two stacks total
 

541
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,740
least 24 maybe thirty two stacks total
for this section but we're I want to

542
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:07,750
for this section but we're I want to
 

543
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,110
for this section but we're I want to
expand this like probably three times

544
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,120
expand this like probably three times
 

545
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,410
expand this like probably three times
the size as well so it's gonna be well I

546
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:13,420
the size as well so it's gonna be well I
 

547
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,740
the size as well so it's gonna be well I
can't even count 72 stacks of clay plus

548
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:16,750
can't even count 72 stacks of clay plus
 

549
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,060
can't even count 72 stacks of clay plus
we got a cover over this with leaves

550
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,070
we got a cover over this with leaves
 

551
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,820
we got a cover over this with leaves
again I was thinking about using

552
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:20,830
again I was thinking about using
 

553
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,740
again I was thinking about using
concrete powder but I'm not sure I liked

554
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:22,750
concrete powder but I'm not sure I liked
 

555
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,050
concrete powder but I'm not sure I liked
it as much it would be cheap I could get

556
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:25,060
it as much it would be cheap I could get
 

557
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,870
it as much it would be cheap I could get
this easily so that would be the nice

558
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:27,880
this easily so that would be the nice
 

559
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,400
this easily so that would be the nice
thing about it let's maybe just do a

560
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,410
thing about it let's maybe just do a
 

561
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,750
thing about it let's maybe just do a
small section here just to see if it

562
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
small section here just to see if it
 

563
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,820
small section here just to see if it
makes much of a difference all right so

564
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:37,830
makes much of a difference all right so
 

565
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,440
makes much of a difference all right so
that's the clay over there I like that

566
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:40,450
that's the clay over there I like that
 

567
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,210
that's the clay over there I like that
way more than just having the blue sky

568
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:42,220
way more than just having the blue sky
 

569
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,940
way more than just having the blue sky
showing for sure can we really see much

570
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:44,950
showing for sure can we really see much
 

571
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,640
showing for sure can we really see much
of a difference between that and the

572
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:46,650
of a difference between that and the
 

573
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,760
of a difference between that and the
concrete over there no you can't really

574
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:50,770
concrete over there no you can't really
 

575
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,640
concrete over there no you can't really
yeah I'm gonna switch over then because

576
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:53,650
yeah I'm gonna switch over then because
 

577
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,940
yeah I'm gonna switch over then because
this is dirt and gravel right you can

578
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:57,950
this is dirt and gravel right you can
 

579
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,620
this is dirt and gravel right you can
tell I haven't used concrete powder all

580
00:12:59,620 --> 00:12:59,630
tell I haven't used concrete powder all
 

581
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,170
tell I haven't used concrete powder all
that much so it's actually for gravel

582
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:02,180
that much so it's actually for gravel
 

583
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,710
that much so it's actually for gravel
and for sand and not dirt and the dye

584
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:05,720
and for sand and not dirt and the dye
 

585
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,840
and for sand and not dirt and the dye
and I think collecting clays a lot

586
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:07,850
and I think collecting clays a lot
 

587
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,920
and I think collecting clays a lot
easier than concrete powder actually

588
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:10,930
easier than concrete powder actually
 

589
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,310
easier than concrete powder actually
because like sands at all various

590
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:15,320
because like sands at all various
 

591
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,840
because like sands at all various
different levels and stuff it's kind of

592
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:16,850
different levels and stuff it's kind of
 

593
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,550
different levels and stuff it's kind of
annoying to collect in the desert and

594
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560
annoying to collect in the desert and
 

595
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,980
annoying to collect in the desert and
it's only like paper-thin but if you go

596
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:20,990
it's only like paper-thin but if you go
 

597
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,440
it's only like paper-thin but if you go
to the Mesa it's like solid solid clay

598
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,450
to the Mesa it's like solid solid clay
 

599
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:55,780
to the Mesa it's like solid solid clay
instead of a beacon really easy oh I am

600
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:55,790
instead of a beacon really easy oh I am
 

601
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,120
instead of a beacon really easy oh I am
so tired now guys I've been at this for

602
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,130
so tired now guys I've been at this for
 

603
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,930
so tired now guys I've been at this for
hours now just non-stop block placing

604
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:01,940
hours now just non-stop block placing
 

605
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,210
hours now just non-stop block placing
thousands and thousands of blocks but

606
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:04,220
thousands and thousands of blocks but
 

607
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,130
thousands and thousands of blocks but
check it out it's it's pretty good right

608
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:06,140
check it out it's it's pretty good right
 

609
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,310
check it out it's it's pretty good right
so I did expand it a lot I don't think

610
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:09,320
so I did expand it a lot I don't think
 

611
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,410
so I did expand it a lot I don't think
I'm gonna make it any bigger though you

612
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:11,420
I'm gonna make it any bigger though you
 

613
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,880
I'm gonna make it any bigger though you
can see it goes all the way around there

614
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:12,890
can see it goes all the way around there
 

615
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,680
can see it goes all the way around there
I think that's gonna be the final size

616
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:14,690
I think that's gonna be the final size
 

617
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,980
I think that's gonna be the final size
of it I I like that there's still lots

618
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:17,990
of it I I like that there's still lots
 

619
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,320
of it I I like that there's still lots
of stuff we can do with it but I'm I'm

620
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,330
of stuff we can do with it but I'm I'm
 

621
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,810
of stuff we can do with it but I'm I'm
getting tuckered out here as you can see

622
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:22,820
getting tuckered out here as you can see
 

623
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,430
getting tuckered out here as you can see
I didn't put the leaves overtop the clay

624
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:24,440
I didn't put the leaves overtop the clay
 

625
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
I didn't put the leaves overtop the clay
there I'm gonna save that for another

626
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:26,450
there I'm gonna save that for another
 

627
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,990
there I'm gonna save that for another
day I did do a little section there just

628
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,000
day I did do a little section there just
 

629
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,070
day I did do a little section there just
something an idea of what it'll look

630
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:30,080
something an idea of what it'll look
 

631
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,370
something an idea of what it'll look
like that's just one block thickness on

632
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:33,380
like that's just one block thickness on
 

633
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,660
like that's just one block thickness on
the leaves there and I think that looks

634
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:34,670
the leaves there and I think that looks
 

635
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,440
the leaves there and I think that looks
fine as is and another nice thing about

636
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:38,450
fine as is and another nice thing about
 

637
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,420
fine as is and another nice thing about
the clay here I realize is it acts as a

638
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:40,430
the clay here I realize is it acts as a
 

639
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,710
the clay here I realize is it acts as a
barrier like if you just have leaves

640
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
barrier like if you just have leaves
 

641
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,370
barrier like if you just have leaves
solid leaves they're transparent blocks

642
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:47,380
solid leaves they're transparent blocks
 

643
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,900
solid leaves they're transparent blocks
so if you're on fancy graphics

644
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:49,910
so if you're on fancy graphics
 

645
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,550
so if you're on fancy graphics
everything needs to be rendered

646
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:51,560
everything needs to be rendered
 

647
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,070
everything needs to be rendered
including the ground below but this kind

648
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:54,080
including the ground below but this kind
 

649
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,750
including the ground below but this kind
of acts as a shield so it should

650
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
of acts as a shield so it should
 

651
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,280
of acts as a shield so it should
increase our frame rate quite a bit

652
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,290
increase our frame rate quite a bit
 

653
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,410
increase our frame rate quite a bit
having this year which is I think is

654
00:14:59,410 --> 00:14:59,420
having this year which is I think is
 

655
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,000
having this year which is I think is
cool

656
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,010

 

657
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,310

I guess let's go down and check it out

658
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
I guess let's go down and check it out
 

659
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,210
I guess let's go down and check it out
right so where do we get down here let's

660
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,220
right so where do we get down here let's
 

661
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,010
right so where do we get down here let's
go over here and alright here it is guys

662
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,020
go over here and alright here it is guys
 

663
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,350
go over here and alright here it is guys
this is how it looks right now again

664
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
this is how it looks right now again
 

665
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,270
this is how it looks right now again
like I said I would like to do some more

666
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:17,280
like I said I would like to do some more
 

667
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,840
like I said I would like to do some more
with it

668
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:17,850
with it
 

669
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,310
with it
I got rid of all the the scaffolding and

670
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
I got rid of all the the scaffolding and
 

671
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,400
I got rid of all the the scaffolding and
stuff because for what I want to do next

672
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:25,410
stuff because for what I want to do next
 

673
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,170
stuff because for what I want to do next
I need to lower the staff holding like

674
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:27,180
I need to lower the staff holding like
 

675
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,060
I need to lower the staff holding like
three blocks or so is just too close to

676
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,070
three blocks or so is just too close to
 

677
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,760
three blocks or so is just too close to
the leaves I can't work with that but

678
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:31,770
the leaves I can't work with that but
 

679
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,550
the leaves I can't work with that but
even as it is right now by staggering

680
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
even as it is right now by staggering
 

681
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,350
even as it is right now by staggering
the trees it creates a pretty cool

682
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:36,360
the trees it creates a pretty cool
 

683
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,900
the trees it creates a pretty cool
pattern it's a it's like wavy it's not

684
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:38,910
pattern it's a it's like wavy it's not
 

685
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,630
pattern it's a it's like wavy it's not
square which is good that's I was hoping

686
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:41,640
square which is good that's I was hoping
 

687
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,880
square which is good that's I was hoping
for so I think it is fine like it is

688
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:43,890
for so I think it is fine like it is
 

689
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,310
for so I think it is fine like it is
right now but something I would possibly

690
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
right now but something I would possibly
 

691
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,580
right now but something I would possibly
like to consider doing in the future

692
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:48,590
like to consider doing in the future
 

693
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,740
like to consider doing in the future
it's just that hanging leaves sort of

694
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:51,750
it's just that hanging leaves sort of
 

695
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,130
it's just that hanging leaves sort of
thing I like to do so just rough it up a

696
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:55,140
thing I like to do so just rough it up a
 

697
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,980
thing I like to do so just rough it up a
bit so it's not flat stuff and now have

698
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:57,990
bit so it's not flat stuff and now have
 

699
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,960
bit so it's not flat stuff and now have
leaves drooping down you can see if I'm

700
00:15:59,960 --> 00:15:59,970
leaves drooping down you can see if I'm
 

701
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,720
leaves drooping down you can see if I'm
too close to the top here I can't really

702
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:02,730
too close to the top here I can't really
 

703
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,610
too close to the top here I can't really
work I got to go down like six blocks or

704
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:04,620
work I got to go down like six blocks or
 

705
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,790
work I got to go down like six blocks or
so the other big thing we should do with

706
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:07,800
so the other big thing we should do with
 

707
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,460
so the other big thing we should do with
this by the way is we need to create

708
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:10,470
this by the way is we need to create
 

709
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,830
this by the way is we need to create
like parts of custom trees that go up

710
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:12,840
like parts of custom trees that go up
 

711
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,750
like parts of custom trees that go up
and connect to the canopy just the wood

712
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:14,760
and connect to the canopy just the wood
 

713
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,430
and connect to the canopy just the wood
part of the tree we don't have to do

714
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:16,440
part of the tree we don't have to do
 

715
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,690
part of the tree we don't have to do
anything with the leaves I don't think

716
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:17,700
anything with the leaves I don't think
 

717
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,300
anything with the leaves I don't think
which is the most time-consuming part of

718
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:20,310
which is the most time-consuming part of
 

719
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,910
which is the most time-consuming part of
making a custom tree I would say but

720
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:22,920
making a custom tree I would say but
 

721
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,770
making a custom tree I would say but
just have it attached in a few places so

722
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:24,780
just have it attached in a few places so
 

723
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,450
just have it attached in a few places so
it doesn't look like the canopies

724
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:26,460
it doesn't look like the canopies
 

725
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,760
it doesn't look like the canopies
floating like it is right now and

726
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:28,770
floating like it is right now and
 

727
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,280
floating like it is right now and
that'll make it a lot better plus it'll

728
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,290
that'll make it a lot better plus it'll
 

729
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,200
that'll make it a lot better plus it'll
add some more structures in the swamp

730
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,210
add some more structures in the swamp
 

731
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,930
add some more structures in the swamp
down below here the other thing I'm

732
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:35,940
down below here the other thing I'm
 

733
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,220
down below here the other thing I'm
going to try to do here though is I'm

734
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,230
going to try to do here though is I'm
 

735
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,290
going to try to do here though is I'm
now that we're done building for today I

736
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:39,300
now that we're done building for today I
 

737
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,120
now that we're done building for today I
think get rid of all the torches and

738
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,130
think get rid of all the torches and
 

739
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,530
think get rid of all the torches and
then we're gonna play with the lighting

740
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:42,540
then we're gonna play with the lighting
 

741
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,030
then we're gonna play with the lighting
to see if we can get a cool atmosphere

742
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,040
to see if we can get a cool atmosphere
 

743
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,440
to see if we can get a cool atmosphere
this is how I would like to keep it to

744
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:48,450
this is how I would like to keep it to
 

745
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,360
this is how I would like to keep it to
be honest like it's darken areas and

746
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,370
be honest like it's darken areas and
 

747
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,070
be honest like it's darken areas and
brighten other areas where the light can

748
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,080
brighten other areas where the light can
 

749
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,140
brighten other areas where the light can
seep through around the mushrooms and

750
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,150
seep through around the mushrooms and
 

751
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,870
seep through around the mushrooms and
stuff we got some glowing trees in here

752
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
stuff we got some glowing trees in here
 

753
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,930
stuff we got some glowing trees in here
still so that's bright around those but

754
00:16:59,930 --> 00:16:59,940
still so that's bright around those but
 

755
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,250
still so that's bright around those but
the mobs are just such a problem so we

756
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:04,260
the mobs are just such a problem so we
 

757
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,270
the mobs are just such a problem so we
either have to do hidden lighting or I

758
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
either have to do hidden lighting or I
 

759
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,829
either have to do hidden lighting or I
think I'll go up into the canopy and

760
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
think I'll go up into the canopy and
 

761
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,480
think I'll go up into the canopy and
make up a couple spots where the light

762
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:11,490
make up a couple spots where the light
 

763
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,060
make up a couple spots where the light
can get through

764
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,070
can get through
 

765
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,550
can get through
because this is like we can't ever enter

766
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:15,560
because this is like we can't ever enter
 

767
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,770
because this is like we can't ever enter
there during the day as it is right now

768
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:17,780
there during the day as it is right now
 

769
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,200
there during the day as it is right now
so that's useless all right so let's go

770
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,210
so that's useless all right so let's go
 

771
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,360
so that's useless all right so let's go
check it out now I punched about I think

772
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:22,370
check it out now I punched about I think
 

773
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,520
check it out now I punched about I think
seven holes into the canopy which live

774
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:24,530
seven holes into the canopy which live
 

775
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,350
seven holes into the canopy which live
it up quite a bit and I also put a few

776
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:26,360
it up quite a bit and I also put a few
 

777
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,870
it up quite a bit and I also put a few
torches on the ground which we can

778
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
torches on the ground which we can
 

779
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,550
torches on the ground which we can
replace with fancier lights later I just

780
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:30,560
replace with fancier lights later I just
 

781
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,890
replace with fancier lights later I just
have them there is like possible places

782
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:32,900
have them there is like possible places
 

783
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,890
have them there is like possible places
for like a mushroom light or something

784
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:35,900
for like a mushroom light or something
 

785
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,250
for like a mushroom light or something
like that

786
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:36,260
like that
 

787
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,860
like that
so let's walk through here let's see how

788
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:38,870
so let's walk through here let's see how
 

789
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,140
so let's walk through here let's see how
quickly it takes the mobs to respawn and

790
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,150
quickly it takes the mobs to respawn and
 

791
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,570
quickly it takes the mobs to respawn and
also how the atmosphere feels now that's

792
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:43,580
also how the atmosphere feels now that's
 

793
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,380
also how the atmosphere feels now that's
a bit brighter it's okay like there's

794
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:47,390
a bit brighter it's okay like there's
 

795
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,000
a bit brighter it's okay like there's
still light in dark spots right I like

796
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,010
still light in dark spots right I like
 

797
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:52,660
still light in dark spots right I like
that feels okay I put one hole right

798
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:52,670
that feels okay I put one hole right
 

799
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,250
that feels okay I put one hole right
above the center of this thing so the

800
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,260
above the center of this thing so the
 

801
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,540
above the center of this thing so the
nether wart farm should stay bright

802
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:55,550
nether wart farm should stay bright
 

803
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:00,700
nether wart farm should stay bright
during the day as well not nearly as

804
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:00,710
during the day as well not nearly as
 

805
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,250
during the day as well not nearly as
many mobs that's good because he could

806
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:03,260
many mobs that's good because he could
 

807
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,050
many mobs that's good because he could
barely walk through here before but if

808
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,060
barely walk through here before but if
 

809
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,340
barely walk through here before but if
we're in the area for a long time

810
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:06,350
we're in the area for a long time
 

811
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:12,490
we're in the area for a long time
they'll still respawn it's actually

812
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:12,500
they'll still respawn it's actually
 

813
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,550

00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:14,560
quite a bit better like there's only
 

815
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,190

pretty good so like there are dark spots
 

819
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,540
pretty good so like there are dark spots
like that maybe we could put path blocks

820
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:22,550
like that maybe we could put path blocks
 

821
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,610
like that maybe we could put path blocks
there or some other block where they

822
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:24,620
there or some other block where they
 

823
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,380
there or some other block where they

computers from a store I like doing it
 

907
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,010
computers from a store I like doing it
that way I have built them before as

908
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:09,020
that way I have built them before as
 

909
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,080

931
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,950
in stores anymore so I've looked at I
can't find like anything I have to build

932
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
can't find like anything I have to build
 

933
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,200
can't find like anything I have to build
one I think this time around or just

934
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,210
one I think this time around or just
 

935
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,360
one I think this time around or just
upgrade my graphics card maybe is

936
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,370
upgrade my graphics card maybe is
 

937
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,490

another idea but I'm not sure like if I

938
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:53,500
another idea but I'm not sure like if I
 

939

they the same size or do I need a

942
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,210
they the same size or do I need a
 

943
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,940
they the same size or do I need a
different motherboard for it I'm not

944
