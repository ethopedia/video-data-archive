00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:28,470
I'm still using an old snapshot from a
 

21
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,200
I'm still using an old snapshot from a
few months ago I have not wanted to

22
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,210
few months ago I have not wanted to
 

23
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,939
few months ago I have not wanted to
upgrade I've been putting it off because

24
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:31,949
upgrade I've been putting it off because
 

25
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,389
upgrade I've been putting it off because
I'm hoping Mojang will revert their

26
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:35,399
I'm hoping Mojang will revert their
 

27
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,270
I'm hoping Mojang will revert their
redstone changes with the 1.16 update

28
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,280
redstone changes with the 1.16 update
 

29
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,660
redstone changes with the 1.16 update
but the 1.16 update is out now they did

30
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:41,670
but the 1.16 update is out now they did
 

31
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,520
but the 1.16 update is out now they did
not revert them so I just gotta suck it

32
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:43,530
not revert them so I just gotta suck it
 

33
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,750
not revert them so I just gotta suck it
up and take it basically so here's the

34
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
up and take it basically so here's the
 

35
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,880
up and take it basically so here's the
deal they made a very subtle change with

36
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:49,890
deal they made a very subtle change with
 

37
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,950
deal they made a very subtle change with
redstone to try make it a little easier

38
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:51,960
redstone to try make it a little easier
 

39
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,250
redstone to try make it a little easier
for new players to understand um

40
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:54,260
for new players to understand um
 

41
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,439
for new players to understand um
basically when redstone is pointing in a

42
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:57,449
basically when redstone is pointing in a
 

43
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,750
basically when redstone is pointing in a
block now it's gonna power that block so

44
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
block now it's gonna power that block so
 

45
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,510
block now it's gonna power that block so
in the updates this redstone is pointing

46
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:02,520
in the updates this redstone is pointing
 

47
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,950
in the updates this redstone is pointing
at the boom block so this boom block

48
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:03,960
at the boom block so this boom block
 

49
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,690
at the boom block so this boom block
gets powered which means this light

50
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:05,700
gets powered which means this light
 

51
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,880
gets powered which means this light
turns on this comparator on the other

52
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:07,890
turns on this comparator on the other
 

53
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,219
turns on this comparator on the other
side gets powered and basically it just

54
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:10,229
side gets powered and basically it just
 

55
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,679
side gets powered and basically it just
changes redstone that's fine right for

56
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:12,689
changes redstone that's fine right for
 

57
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,510
changes redstone that's fine right for
the average player most people they only

58
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:14,520
the average player most people they only
 

59
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,580
the average player most people they only
have a world around for a few months

60
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:16,590
have a world around for a few months
 

61
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,410
have a world around for a few months
baby they usually don't do a lot of

62
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:18,420
baby they usually don't do a lot of
 

63
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,609
baby they usually don't do a lot of
redstone but for me oh man this is gonna

64
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:22,619
redstone but for me oh man this is gonna
 

65
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:23,300
redstone but for me oh man this is gonna
be horrible

66
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:23,310
be horrible
 

67
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,210
be horrible
I got an old world years old here with

68
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:26,220
I got an old world years old here with
 

69
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,280
I got an old world years old here with
full of redstone contraptions a lot of

70
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,290
full of redstone contraptions a lot of
 

71
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,140
full of redstone contraptions a lot of
weird stuff as well and I know this is

72
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,150
weird stuff as well and I know this is
 

73
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,390
weird stuff as well and I know this is
gonna break a lot of things but let's

74
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
gonna break a lot of things but let's
 

75
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,740
gonna break a lot of things but let's
update it and let's see what happens

76
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:33,750
update it and let's see what happens
 

77
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,359

00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,020
to the latest snapshot 20w 27a this is
 

83
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,080
to the latest snapshot 20w 27a this is
the one that introduces brutes into the

84
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,090
the one that introduces brutes into the
 

85
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,630
the one that introduces brutes into the
game as well as all the 1.16 stuff and

86
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
game as well as all the 1.16 stuff and
 

87
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,389
game as well as all the 1.16 stuff and
you can see our thing here looks exactly

88
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:47,399
you can see our thing here looks exactly
 

89
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,219
you can see our thing here looks exactly
the same right but now that when we

90
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:49,229
the same right but now that when we
 

91
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,859
the same right but now that when we
update it oh that light turned on what

92
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:53,869
update it oh that light turned on what
 

93
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:56,620
update it oh that light turned on what
the comparator turned on oh no

94
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:56,630
the comparator turned on oh no
 

95
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,170
the comparator turned on oh no
everything's changed alright so

96
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:00,180
everything's changed alright so
 

97

and like test out my redstone
contraptions and just see what's broken

102
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,070
contraptions and just see what's broken
 

103
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,490
contraptions and just see what's broken
and what's not

the updates which has me worried
 

121
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,650
the updates which has me worried
because I don't know how to fix that if

122
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:35,660
because I don't know how to fix that if
 

123
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,250
because I don't know how to fix that if
it doesn't work it's gonna be tricky

it doesn't work it's gonna be tricky
 

125
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,140
it doesn't work it's gonna be tricky
let's give it a test run there let's

126
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,150
let's give it a test run there let's
 

127
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,610
let's give it a test run there let's
maybe try it some netherrack so ii 5 e

128
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:44,620
maybe try it some netherrack so ii 5 e
 

129
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,850
maybe try it some netherrack so ii 5 e
and then 5 over here

130
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:48,860
and then 5 over here
 

131
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,100
and then 5 over here
pull the lever we should get some

132
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,110
pull the lever we should get some
 

133
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,280
pull the lever we should get some
netherrack delivered here and yeah it's

134
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,290
netherrack delivered here and yeah it's
 

135
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,320
netherrack delivered here and yeah it's
looking okay actually that's great

136
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,330
looking okay actually that's great
 

137
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,270
looking okay actually that's great
yeah it might not be as bad as I thought

138
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:58,280
yeah it might not be as bad as I thought
 

139
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,070
yeah it might not be as bad as I thought
it was gonna be actually so pumped in

140
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
it was gonna be actually so pumped in
 

141
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,229
it was gonna be actually so pumped in
farm is still working ok let's check out

guess I kind of expected something
 

151
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,490
guess I kind of expected something
similar here mushroom stocks got pushed

152
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:15,500
similar here mushroom stocks got pushed
 

153
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,810
similar here mushroom stocks got pushed
up as well that's what they're supposed

154

157
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:22,140

yeah the potion lab is all good here all

158
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,150
yeah the potion lab is all good here all
 

159
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,550
yeah the potion lab is all good here all
right well I've checked a lot of this

160
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:23,560
right well I've checked a lot of this
 

161
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,110
right well I've checked a lot of this
stuff now and I haven't found anything

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
stuff now and I haven't found anything
 

163
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,940
stuff now and I haven't found anything
broken yet so I'm very happy about that

164
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:26,950
broken yet so I'm very happy about that
 

165
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,660
broken yet so I'm very happy about that
but uh Wilson is a big one as well let's

166
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:30,670
but uh Wilson is a big one as well let's
 

167
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,690
but uh Wilson is a big one as well let's
check this out so give them an apple see

168
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:33,700
check this out so give them an apple see
 

169
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,289
check this out so give them an apple see
if that still works yeah okay okay

170
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:37,299
if that still works yeah okay okay
 

171
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:40,589
if that still works yeah okay okay
that's good super happy Wilson neutral

172
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:40,599
that's good super happy Wilson neutral
 

173
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,559
that's good super happy Wilson neutral
Wilson sad Wilson very sad Wilson and

174
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:43,569
Wilson sad Wilson very sad Wilson and
 

175
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,479
Wilson sad Wilson very sad Wilson and
dead Wilson so all the phases are

176
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:45,489
dead Wilson so all the phases are
 

177
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:48,420
dead Wilson so all the phases are
working still try the food bar if that

178
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:48,430
working still try the food bar if that
 

179
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,080
working still try the food bar if that
still works

180
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,090
still works
 

181
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,849
still works
I should go up by about two I think yeah

182
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:53,859
I should go up by about two I think yeah
 

183
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,979
I should go up by about two I think yeah
that looks good let's test out the blue

184
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:55,989
that looks good let's test out the blue
 

185
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:57,689
that looks good let's test out the blue
fire here this was a really weird

186
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:57,699
fire here this was a really weird
 

187
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:04,709
fire here this was a really weird
contraption well it looks like I might

188
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:04,719
contraption well it looks like I might
 

189
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,809
contraption well it looks like I might
have been worried about nothing cuz I

190
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:06,819
have been worried about nothing cuz I
 

191
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,520
have been worried about nothing cuz I
can't find anything broken actually so

192
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:08,530
can't find anything broken actually so
 

193
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,050
can't find anything broken actually so
that's that's great actually I was

194
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,060
that's that's great actually I was
 

195
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,179
that's that's great actually I was
really worried about that um there might

196
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:12,189
really worried about that um there might
 

197
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:13,500
really worried about that um there might
be some broken stuff I just haven't

198
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:13,510
be some broken stuff I just haven't
 

199
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,089
be some broken stuff I just haven't
discovered it yet I don't know but it's

200
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:15,099
discovered it yet I don't know but it's
 

201
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,659
discovered it yet I don't know but it's
nothing major like I expected so that's

202
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:18,669
nothing major like I expected so that's
 

203
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:20,999
nothing major like I expected so that's
good now that I've updated we have

204
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:21,009
good now that I've updated we have
 

205
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:22,800
good now that I've updated we have
access to a brand new redstone

206
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:22,810
access to a brand new redstone
 

207
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,980
access to a brand new redstone
contraption is it target block let's try

208
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:25,990
contraption is it target block let's try
 

209
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,129
contraption is it target block let's try
the tried and out oh it does work so the

210
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:29,139
the tried and out oh it does work so the
 

211
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,439
the tried and out oh it does work so the
closer you hit to the center but further

212
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:31,449
closer you hit to the center but further
 

213
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,409
closer you hit to the center but further
the signal goes I believe let's stretch

214
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:34,419
the signal goes I believe let's stretch
 

215
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:37,529
the signal goes I believe let's stretch
it out a bit more alright let's check

216
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:37,539
it out a bit more alright let's check
 

217
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:40,469
it out a bit more alright let's check
this out yes so it doesn't go all the

218
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
this out yes so it doesn't go all the
 

219
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,640
this out yes so it doesn't go all the
way closer to center than it reaches

220
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:44,650
way closer to center than it reaches
 

221
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,980
way closer to center than it reaches
further that's the intended purpose of

222
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:46,990
further that's the intended purpose of
 

223
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,480
further that's the intended purpose of
the target block but what it's actually

224
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:48,490
the target block but what it's actually
 

225
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,640
the target block but what it's actually
gonna use for most the time is the new

226
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:50,650
gonna use for most the time is the new
 

227
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,070
gonna use for most the time is the new
functionality it has in redstone so

228
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,080
functionality it has in redstone so
 

229
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,879
functionality it has in redstone so
check this out

230
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:53,889
check this out
 

231
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:56,010
check this out
when you put it next to the redstone

232
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,020
when you put it next to the redstone
 

233
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,050
when you put it next to the redstone
line you see the Redstone actually

234
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,060
line you see the Redstone actually
 

235
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,749
line you see the Redstone actually
connects to the target block well with

236
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:00,759
connects to the target block well with
 

237
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,219
connects to the target block well with
other types of blocks it doesn't do that

238
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:02,229
other types of blocks it doesn't do that
 

239
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:04,409
other types of blocks it doesn't do that
so this is a special functionality of it

240
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:04,419
so this is a special functionality of it
 

241
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:07,350
so this is a special functionality of it
and I'm gonna be using that probably a

242
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
and I'm gonna be using that probably a
 

243
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,550
and I'm gonna be using that probably a
lot because it's really cool so you can

244
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:11,560
lot because it's really cool so you can
 

245
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,860
lot because it's really cool so you can
see the repeater turns out here the

246
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:13,870
see the repeater turns out here the
 

247
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,140
see the repeater turns out here the
torch goes off that makes it great for

248
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,150
torch goes off that makes it great for
 

249
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,240
torch goes off that makes it great for
compacting redstone but it's also pretty

250
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,250
compacting redstone but it's also pretty
 

251
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,920
compacting redstone but it's also pretty
useful when working with comparators

252
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:19,930
useful when working with comparators
 

253
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,709
useful when working with comparators
where the signal strength matters so

254
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:22,719
where the signal strength matters so
 

255
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:24,629
where the signal strength matters so
let's say for example we add redstone

256
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
let's say for example we add redstone
 

257
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,520
let's say for example we add redstone
dust here this has a strength of 1 over

258
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:26,530
dust here this has a strength of 1 over
 

259
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,330
dust here this has a strength of 1 over
here but if I add a target block we go

260
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:30,340
here but if I add a target block we go
 

261
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,980
here but if I add a target block we go
up to 2 so I have a little bit more

262
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:31,990
up to 2 so I have a little bit more
 

263
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,239
up to 2 so I have a little bit more
control over what I'm

264
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:33,249
control over what I'm
 

265
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:38,519
control over what I'm
want to happen here alright so I've been

266
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:38,529
want to happen here alright so I've been
 

267
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:40,739
want to happen here alright so I've been
trying to build up my shelter box

268
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:40,749
trying to build up my shelter box
 

269
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:42,839
trying to build up my shelter box
collection lately so I did another hour

270
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:42,849
collection lately so I did another hour
 

271
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,119
collection lately so I did another hour
of n city rating the other day and this

272
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:45,129
of n city rating the other day and this
 

273
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:46,589
of n city rating the other day and this
is what we got

274
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:46,599
is what we got
 

275
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:49,649
is what we got
look at this bunch of stuff in a bunch

let's take the random stuff ah that's
 

295
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:23,539
let's take the random stuff ah that's
gonna be a new glitch whoa Kay hello

gonna be a new glitch whoa Kay hello
 

297
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,489
gonna be a new glitch whoa Kay hello
that probably happened because I was

298
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:26,499
that probably happened because I was
 

299
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:28,229
that probably happened because I was
recording while riding the ice road and

300
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:28,239
recording while riding the ice road and
 

301
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:30,929
recording while riding the ice road and
those two don't go together very well my

302

some funny stuff afterwards got to be
 

307
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:37,229
some funny stuff afterwards got to be
careful here there's gonna be the brutes

308
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:37,239
careful here there's gonna be the brutes
 

309
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:42,089
careful here there's gonna be the brutes
spawning now I think all right don't see

310
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:42,099
spawning now I think all right don't see
 

311
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:47,219
spawning now I think all right don't see
any though what's the plan what's going

about it so mind out a bunch of black
 

317
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,759
about it so mind out a bunch of black
stone here kind of got an area s started

318
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:53,769
stone here kind of got an area s started
 

319
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:57,029
stone here kind of got an area s started
we're gonna be putting a giant higgling

320
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
we're gonna be putting a giant higgling
 

321
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,419
we're gonna be putting a giant higgling
bar during trading hall here the way I

322
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:00,429
bar during trading hall here the way I
 

323
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:02,819
bar during trading hall here the way I
want this to work is we'll probably have

324
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:02,829
want this to work is we'll probably have
 

325
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,619
want this to work is we'll probably have
a double chest somewhere we put the gold

326
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:04,629
a double chest somewhere we put the gold
 

327
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:07,199
a double chest somewhere we put the gold
in it's gonna split that gold up to

328
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,209
in it's gonna split that gold up to
 

329
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,719
in it's gonna split that gold up to
probably I'm guessing at least two dozen

330
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:09,729
probably I'm guessing at least two dozen
 

331
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,459
probably I'm guessing at least two dozen
big lens but we'll know when we start

332
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:11,469
big lens but we'll know when we start
 

333
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:13,529
big lens but we'll know when we start
testing this out but a whole bunch of

334
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:13,539
testing this out but a whole bunch of
 

335
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:14,669
testing this out but a whole bunch of
big ones right they're gonna give us

336
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:14,679
big ones right they're gonna give us
 

337
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,139
big ones right they're gonna give us
their items and then we want to auto

338
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:16,149
their items and then we want to auto
 

339
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:18,479
their items and then we want to auto
sort those into a bunch of chest before

340
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:18,489
sort those into a bunch of chest before
 

341
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:20,669
sort those into a bunch of chest before
we get started though we're gonna do a

342
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:20,679
we get started though we're gonna do a
 

343
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:23,729
we get started though we're gonna do a
little redstone lesson with e so this is

344
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:23,739
little redstone lesson with e so this is
 

345
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,739
little redstone lesson with e so this is
valuable stuff guys are you ready for

346
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:25,749
valuable stuff guys are you ready for
 

347
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:27,269
valuable stuff guys are you ready for
this okay so most of you are familiar

348
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:27,279
this okay so most of you are familiar
 

349
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,489
this okay so most of you are familiar
with the idea of hopper chains right you

350
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:29,499
with the idea of hopper chains right you
 

351
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:32,189
with the idea of hopper chains right you
put items in they funnel down and then

352
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:32,199
put items in they funnel down and then
 

353
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,600
put items in they funnel down and then
they end up over here takes a little bit

354
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:33,610
they end up over here takes a little bit
 

355
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,719
they end up over here takes a little bit
of time not too bad um and then we can

356
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:36,729
of time not too bad um and then we can
 

357
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:38,669
of time not too bad um and then we can
hook other hoppers underneath these to

358
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:38,679
hook other hoppers underneath these to
 

359
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:40,559
hook other hoppers underneath these to
pull the items out and set up item

360
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:40,569
pull the items out and set up item
 

361
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,409
pull the items out and set up item
filters and all kinds of stuff right so

362
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:43,419
filters and all kinds of stuff right so
 

363
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,569
filters and all kinds of stuff right so
one of the major bottlenecks when making

364
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:45,579
one of the major bottlenecks when making
 

365
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:46,980
one of the major bottlenecks when making
massive systems and

366
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:46,990
massive systems and
 

367
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,990
massive systems and
minecraft is the speed of hoppers they

368
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,000
minecraft is the speed of hoppers they
 

369
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,990
minecraft is the speed of hoppers they
can transfer items at 2.5 items per

370
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
can transfer items at 2.5 items per
 

371
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,990
can transfer items at 2.5 items per
second or the speed here which is great

372
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,000
second or the speed here which is great
 

373
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,730
second or the speed here which is great
in most circumstances but like with

374
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:56,740
in most circumstances but like with
 

375
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,140
in most circumstances but like with
piglet bartering where we're getting

376
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,150
piglet bartering where we're getting
 

377
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,900
piglet bartering where we're getting
tons and tons of items this is gonna get

378
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:00,910
tons and tons of items this is gonna get
 

379
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,360
tons and tons of items this is gonna get
backed up really quickly and in the

380
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,370
backed up really quickly and in the
 

381
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,950
backed up really quickly and in the
nether we don't have the option of using

382
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
nether we don't have the option of using
 

383
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,040
nether we don't have the option of using
water streams or anything either so this

384
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,050
water streams or anything either so this
 

385
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,560
water streams or anything either so this
is this is it unless we cheat the system

386
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:10,570
is this is it unless we cheat the system
 

387
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,630
is this is it unless we cheat the system
somehow and one of the ways we're gonna

388
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:12,640
somehow and one of the ways we're gonna
 

389
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,210
somehow and one of the ways we're gonna
do that is by using a dropper chain

390
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:15,220
do that is by using a dropper chain
 

391
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,160
do that is by using a dropper chain
instead of a hopper chain what here's

392
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,170
instead of a hopper chain what here's
 

393
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,050
instead of a hopper chain what here's
the thing so dropper chains are actually

394
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,060
the thing so dropper chains are actually
 

395
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,330
the thing so dropper chains are actually
better than opera chains in a lot of

396
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:24,340
better than opera chains in a lot of
 

397
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,580
better than opera chains in a lot of
ways but people don't really use them in

398
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:26,590
ways but people don't really use them in
 

399
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,130
ways but people don't really use them in
the game for a few reasons one of them

400
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:29,140
the game for a few reasons one of them
 

401
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,130
the game for a few reasons one of them
is they tend to be harder to set up and

402
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,140
is they tend to be harder to set up and
 

403
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,710
is they tend to be harder to set up and
they make Etana noise which isn't ideal

404
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:34,720
they make Etana noise which isn't ideal
 

405
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,050
they make Etana noise which isn't ideal
in most cases and usually they're just

406
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,060
in most cases and usually they're just
 

407
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,680
in most cases and usually they're just
overkill and hoppers do the job right

408
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:39,690
overkill and hoppers do the job right
 

409
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,880
overkill and hoppers do the job right
here's the thing though like hoppers

410
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:41,890
here's the thing though like hoppers
 

411
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,360
here's the thing though like hoppers
they transfer items at one item every 4

412
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,370
they transfer items at one item every 4
 

413
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,760
they transfer items at one item every 4
redstone ticks in the game and what

414
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:47,770
redstone ticks in the game and what
 

415
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,270
redstone ticks in the game and what
happens in 4 redstone ticks on on off

416
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:51,280
happens in 4 redstone ticks on on off
 

417
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,270
happens in 4 redstone ticks on on off
that means two items can pass through in

418
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:54,280
that means two items can pass through in
 

419
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,130
that means two items can pass through in
the same amount of time so this is twice

420
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,140
the same amount of time so this is twice
 

421
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,610
the same amount of time so this is twice
as quick as hoppers but the way we got

422
00:08:59,610 --> 00:08:59,620
as quick as hoppers but the way we got
 

423
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,470
as quick as hoppers but the way we got
this set up here isn't a good good way

424
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:01,480
this set up here isn't a good good way
 

425
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,300
this set up here isn't a good good way
of doing it so if we just run redstone

426
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:03,310
of doing it so if we just run redstone
 

427
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,690
of doing it so if we just run redstone
over top and we do this guess what

428
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:06,700
over top and we do this guess what
 

429
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,950
over top and we do this guess what
they're coming out the end there they're

430
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:07,960
they're coming out the end there they're
 

431
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,500
they're coming out the end there they're
not getting sucked up by our potential

432
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:10,510
not getting sucked up by our potential
 

433
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,600
not getting sucked up by our potential
item filters running along underneath

434
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:12,610
item filters running along underneath
 

435
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,430
item filters running along underneath
here that is because all the Redstone is

436
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:14,440
here that is because all the Redstone is
 

437
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,650
here that is because all the Redstone is
activating at the exact same time and

438
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:16,660
activating at the exact same time and
 

439
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,080
activating at the exact same time and
we're not controlling it so depending on

440
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,090
we're not controlling it so depending on
 

441
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,090
we're not controlling it so depending on
what order the game decides to update

442
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:21,100
what order the game decides to update
 

443
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,330
what order the game decides to update
these it's going to like instantly snip

444
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:24,340
these it's going to like instantly snip
 

445
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,980
these it's going to like instantly snip
across some of these droppers and the

446
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:25,990
across some of these droppers and the
 

447
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,620
across some of these droppers and the
hoppers won't be able to pick it up so a

448
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:28,630
hoppers won't be able to pick it up so a
 

449
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,120
hoppers won't be able to pick it up so a
better way of doing it is to have

450
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,130
better way of doing it is to have
 

451
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,790
better way of doing it is to have
another chain of observers over top of

452
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
another chain of observers over top of
 

453
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,400
another chain of observers over top of
the chain of droppers and then you can

454
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:35,410
the chain of droppers and then you can
 

455
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,140
the chain of droppers and then you can
set up an observer clock on one of the

456
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,150
set up an observer clock on one of the
 

457
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,630
set up an observer clock on one of the
ends here if by making the observers

458
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:39,640
ends here if by making the observers
 

459
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,540
ends here if by making the observers
face each other and here's that horrible

460
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:42,550
face each other and here's that horrible
 

461
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,370
face each other and here's that horrible
noise I'm talking about

462
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:45,380

 

463
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,519

yeah yeah but we can load this up with

464
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:49,529
yeah yeah but we can load this up with
 

465
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,139
yeah yeah but we can load this up with
items over here and they'll make their

466
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:51,149
items over here and they'll make their
 

467
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:54,230
items over here and they'll make their
way down clock is running back and forth

468
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
way down clock is running back and forth
 

469
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,470
way down clock is running back and forth
here shooting up the end there you can

470
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:57,480
here shooting up the end there you can
 

471
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,540
here shooting up the end there you can
see this is the raid over here so that's

472
00:09:59,540 --> 00:09:59,550
see this is the raid over here so that's
 

473
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,230
see this is the raid over here so that's
twice the speed of hoppers and each of

474
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:03,240
twice the speed of hoppers and each of
 

475
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,780
twice the speed of hoppers and each of
these is given time to potentially put

476
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:05,790
these is given time to potentially put
 

477
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,240
these is given time to potentially put
their items into a hopper below like an

478
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,250
their items into a hopper below like an
 

479
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,860
their items into a hopper below like an
item filter like a so but as you can see

480
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:12,870
item filter like a so but as you can see
 

481
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,000
item filter like a so but as you can see
they're still shooting out of the end

482
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,010
they're still shooting out of the end
 

483
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,650
they're still shooting out of the end
here because it's twice the speed of

484
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:15,660
here because it's twice the speed of
 

485
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,199
here because it's twice the speed of
hoppers so we actually need to to keep

486
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:18,209
hoppers so we actually need to to keep
 

487
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:19,910
hoppers so we actually need to to keep
up with that rate and they'll go into

488
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
up with that rate and they'll go into
 

489
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,290
up with that rate and they'll go into
both of these aha

490
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:21,300
both of these aha
 

491
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,850
both of these aha
so that is the basic idea to what we're

492
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:22,860
so that is the basic idea to what we're
 

493
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,120
so that is the basic idea to what we're
doing so let's get started now with what

494
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,130
doing so let's get started now with what
 

495
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,920
doing so let's get started now with what
I got in mind we're gonna need to space

496
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:27,930
I got in mind we're gonna need to space
 

497
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,050
I got in mind we're gonna need to space
our chests three blocks apart from each

498
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,060
our chests three blocks apart from each
 

499
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,440
our chests three blocks apart from each
other so this is our Center gonna line

500
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,450
other so this is our Center gonna line
 

501
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,000
other so this is our Center gonna line
up with the chest here and I'm thinking

502
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,010
up with the chest here and I'm thinking
 

503
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,740
up with the chest here and I'm thinking
we're gonna have like seven chests along

504
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:36,750
we're gonna have like seven chests along
 

505
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,030
we're gonna have like seven chests along
this side four along here and four along

506
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
this side four along here and four along
 

507
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:50,360
this side four along here and four along
here that adds up to 15 okay so we got

508
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,370
here that adds up to 15 okay so we got
 

509
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,460
here that adds up to 15 okay so we got
our room expanded a little bit more here

510
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:52,470
our room expanded a little bit more here
 

511
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,610
our room expanded a little bit more here
and our chess positions figured out

512
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:54,620
and our chess positions figured out
 

513
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,920
and our chess positions figured out
hopefully again this is not something

514
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:57,930
hopefully again this is not something
 

515
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,660
hopefully again this is not something
I've built in creative already so we're

516
00:10:59,660 --> 00:10:59,670
I've built in creative already so we're
 

517
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,980
I've built in creative already so we're
gonna kind of figure it out as we go

518
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:00,990
gonna kind of figure it out as we go
 

519
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,340
gonna kind of figure it out as we go
here but I believe we're gonna want to

520
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:04,350
here but I believe we're gonna want to
 

521
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,860
here but I believe we're gonna want to
store fifteen different items there's 13

522
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:06,870
store fifteen different items there's 13
 

523
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,600
store fifteen different items there's 13
stackable items you get from piglet

524
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:08,610
stackable items you get from piglet
 

525
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,980
stackable items you get from piglet
bartering and then there's the fire

526
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:09,990
bartering and then there's the fire
 

527
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,220
bartering and then there's the fire
resistant potions there is the Iron

528
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,230
resistant potions there is the Iron
 

529
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,689
resistant potions there is the Iron
Boots with soul speed on and then

530
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:14,699
Boots with soul speed on and then
 

531
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:16,460
Boots with soul speed on and then
there's the soul speed enchanted books

532
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:16,470
there's the soul speed enchanted books
 

533
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,160
there's the soul speed enchanted books
that adds up to 16 but we're gonna void

534
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,170
that adds up to 16 but we're gonna void
 

535
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,319
that adds up to 16 but we're gonna void
the iron boots probably I don't want to

536
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:21,329
the iron boots probably I don't want to
 

537
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:25,250
the iron boots probably I don't want to
save those so 15 total um what we're

538
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:25,260
save those so 15 total um what we're
 

539
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,259
save those so 15 total um what we're
gonna be doing is trying to do four

540
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:27,269
gonna be doing is trying to do four
 

541
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,990
gonna be doing is trying to do four
times hopper speed with the system so we

542
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
times hopper speed with the system so we
 

543
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,030
times hopper speed with the system so we
got a point for hoppers into each of

544
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,040
got a point for hoppers into each of
 

545
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,310
got a point for hoppers into each of
these double chests and I very quickly

546
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
these double chests and I very quickly
 

547
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,259
these double chests and I very quickly
ran out of supplies there so he had to

548
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:36,269
ran out of supplies there so he had to
 

549
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:37,550
ran out of supplies there so he had to
come back here and we're gonna make a

550
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:37,560
come back here and we're gonna make a
 

551
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,050
come back here and we're gonna make a
bunch of chests bunch of hoppers and

552
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,060
bunch of chests bunch of hoppers and
 

553
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,090
bunch of chests bunch of hoppers and
stuff yeah Jess and how much iron do I

554
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:44,100
stuff yeah Jess and how much iron do I
 

555
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,829
stuff yeah Jess and how much iron do I
have I might need to need to go get some

556
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
have I might need to need to go get some
 

557
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,019
have I might need to need to go get some
more iron actually we have like over

558
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:48,029
more iron actually we have like over
 

559
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:50,120
more iron actually we have like over
eight stacks of iron box just one or two

560
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,130
eight stacks of iron box just one or two
 

561
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,610
eight stacks of iron box just one or two
episodes ago and somehow they're all

562
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:52,620
episodes ago and somehow they're all
 

563
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,510
episodes ago and somehow they're all
gone now

564
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:54,520
gone now
 

565
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,770
gone now
I don't know where they all went so you

566
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:55,780
I don't know where they all went so you
 

567
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,140
I don't know where they all went so you
guys spent some time at the the new goon

568
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,150
guys spent some time at the the new goon
 

569
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,330
guys spent some time at the the new goon
farm here get some iron get some gold

570
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:00,340
farm here get some iron get some gold
 

571
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:05,220
farm here get some iron get some gold
oh yeah still working okay so check it

572
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,230
oh yeah still working okay so check it
 

573
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,600
oh yeah still working okay so check it
out we are back you're working on the

574
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:06,610
out we are back you're working on the
 

575
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,460
out we are back you're working on the
project here and as you can see it is

576
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:08,470
project here and as you can see it is
 

577
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,280
project here and as you can see it is
actually a pretty big project a very

578
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,290
actually a pretty big project a very
 

579
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,140
actually a pretty big project a very
expensive one as well all these hoppers

580
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,150
expensive one as well all these hoppers
 

581
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,480
expensive one as well all these hoppers
man that's the has a lot of iron in

582
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:15,490
man that's the has a lot of iron in
 

583
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,570
man that's the has a lot of iron in
there um so I actually had to move the

584
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:18,580
there um so I actually had to move the
 

585
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,280
there um so I actually had to move the
chests again I expanded the room a

586
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,290
chests again I expanded the room a
 

587
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,750
chests again I expanded the room a
little bit more I realized I need more

588
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
little bit more I realized I need more
 

589
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,900
little bit more I realized I need more
space between these two so yeah this

590
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:24,910
space between these two so yeah this
 

591
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,730
space between these two so yeah this
room got a little bit bigger I'm about

592
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:26,740
room got a little bit bigger I'm about
 

593
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,440
room got a little bit bigger I'm about
to set up the dropper chains here I just

594
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,450
to set up the dropper chains here I just
 

595
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,970
to set up the dropper chains here I just
kind of want to show you guys how that's

596
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:29,980
kind of want to show you guys how that's
 

597
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,480
kind of want to show you guys how that's
that's gonna be done also while digging

598
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:33,490
that's gonna be done also while digging
 

599
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,060
that's gonna be done also while digging
this out I found out there is a giant

600
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,070
this out I found out there is a giant
 

601
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,680
this out I found out there is a giant
lava pool above us and you can see the

602
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:37,690
lava pool above us and you can see the
 

603
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,800
lava pool above us and you can see the
lava droplets coming down yeah so we're

604
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:40,810
lava droplets coming down yeah so we're
 

605
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,800
lava droplets coming down yeah so we're
gonna be doing a double dropper chain

606
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:42,810
gonna be doing a double dropper chain
 

607
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,980
gonna be doing a double dropper chain
which means four times hopper speed and

608
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:45,990
which means four times hopper speed and
 

609
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,330
which means four times hopper speed and
I want to show you how to do the corners

610
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:48,340
I want to show you how to do the corners
 

611
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,310
I want to show you how to do the corners
here so it is possible to take corners

612
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
here so it is possible to take corners
 

613
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,190
here so it is possible to take corners
with this we got to go like yeah one

614
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,200
with this we got to go like yeah one
 

615
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,930
with this we got to go like yeah one
more this way and then we gotta go this

616
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:57,940
more this way and then we gotta go this
 

617
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,440
more this way and then we gotta go this
way and then to actually make sure all

618
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:01,450
way and then to actually make sure all
 

619
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,510
way and then to actually make sure all
these droppers activate we gotta add two

620
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:03,520
these droppers activate we gotta add two
 

621
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,790
these droppers activate we gotta add two
more here and then for this row we can

622
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:05,800
more here and then for this row we can
 

623
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,300
more here and then for this row we can
just go like normal back here a little

624
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:09,310
just go like normal back here a little
 

625
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:15,810
just go like normal back here a little
bit like this and bam corner taken very

626
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:15,820
bit like this and bam corner taken very
 

627
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,730
bit like this and bam corner taken very
good very good so our next big step here

628
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:17,740
good very good so our next big step here
 

629
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,620
good very good so our next big step here
is we gotta install a bunch of item

630
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:19,630
is we gotta install a bunch of item
 

631
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,470
is we gotta install a bunch of item
filters for item filters per item to

632
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
filters for item filters per item to
 

633
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,560
filters for item filters per item to
keep up with the four times hopper speed

634
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:24,570
keep up with the four times hopper speed
 

635
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,300
keep up with the four times hopper speed
so yeah we're going overkill at this

636
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,310
so yeah we're going overkill at this
 

637
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,420
so yeah we're going overkill at this
project just for the fun of it

638
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:30,430
project just for the fun of it
 

639
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,890
project just for the fun of it
but it should be really cool and it's

640
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:31,900
but it should be really cool and it's
 

641
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,440
but it should be really cool and it's
all done so what we're gonna have to do

642
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,450
all done so what we're gonna have to do
 

643
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,320
all done so what we're gonna have to do
is add and hoppers one more hopper

644
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,330
is add and hoppers one more hopper
 

645
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,840
is add and hoppers one more hopper
underneath here and then this will be

646
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:39,850
underneath here and then this will be
 

647
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,230
underneath here and then this will be
where we put our item filter and then

648
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,240
where we put our item filter and then
 

649
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,730
where we put our item filter and then
all along here we got to do that

650
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:46,740
all along here we got to do that
 

651
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,000
all along here we got to do that
comparators going all along and probably

652
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,010
comparators going all along and probably
 

653
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,410
comparators going all along and probably
gonna have to make several trips back

654
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:52,420
gonna have to make several trips back
 

655
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,290
gonna have to make several trips back
home to get more stuff here cuz this is

656
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:55,300
home to get more stuff here cuz this is
 

657
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,260
home to get more stuff here cuz this is
using up a lot of resources all right

658
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:58,270
using up a lot of resources all right
 

659
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,960
using up a lot of resources all right
and then there's gonna be item filters

660
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:00,970
and then there's gonna be item filters
 

661
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,450
and then there's gonna be item filters
on this side as well so we got to do the

662
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:03,460
on this side as well so we got to do the
 

663
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,550
on this side as well so we got to do the
exact same thing mirrored we won't be

664
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:05,560
exact same thing mirrored we won't be
 

665
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,680
exact same thing mirrored we won't be
able to see the side from the room

666
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:08,690
able to see the side from the room
 

667
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,030
able to see the side from the room
uh-huh very good very good so we got

668
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
uh-huh very good very good so we got
 

669
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,160
uh-huh very good very good so we got
those item filters installed but it

670
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,170
those item filters installed but it
 

671
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,829
those item filters installed but it
occurred to me some of the items we get

672
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
occurred to me some of the items we get
 

673
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,420
occurred to me some of the items we get
from the piglet bartering can't actually

674
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:17,430
from the piglet bartering can't actually
 

675
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,579
from the piglet bartering can't actually
be sorted with an item filter that way

676
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:19,589
be sorted with an item filter that way
 

677
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,220
be sorted with an item filter that way
the non stackable items we get Iron

678
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:22,230
the non stackable items we get Iron
 

679
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,019
the non stackable items we get Iron
Boots with soul speed on from the pig

680
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:24,029
Boots with soul speed on from the pig
 

681
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,630
Boots with soul speed on from the pig
lens as well as fire resistant potion

682
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:26,640
lens as well as fire resistant potion
 

683
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,110
lens as well as fire resistant potion
splash fire resistant potions and

684
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120
splash fire resistant potions and
 

685
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,340
splash fire resistant potions and
enchanted books and these are all mixed

686
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:31,350
enchanted books and these are all mixed
 

687
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,590
enchanted books and these are all mixed
in with the other goodies you get from

688
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
in with the other goodies you get from
 

689
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,310
in with the other goodies you get from
them and these four items are non

690
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:37,320
them and these four items are non
 

691
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,620
them and these four items are non
stackable right so it would be nice if

692
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:39,630
stackable right so it would be nice if
 

693
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,269
stackable right so it would be nice if
we could separate them in some way and

694
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
we could separate them in some way and
 

695
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,449
we could separate them in some way and
there actually is a way of doing it but

696
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:44,459
there actually is a way of doing it but
 

697
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:45,199
there actually is a way of doing it but
it's gonna be tricky

698
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:45,209
it's gonna be tricky
 

699
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:50,480
it's gonna be tricky
okay so step one is this special item

700
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:50,490
okay so step one is this special item
 

701
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,949
okay so step one is this special item
filter here so this is a way of

702
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:51,959
filter here so this is a way of
 

703
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,530
filter here so this is a way of
separating stackable items from non

704
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:54,540
separating stackable items from non
 

705
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,480
separating stackable items from non
stackable items like if we put grass in

706
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:56,490
stackable items like if we put grass in
 

707
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,670
stackable items like if we put grass in
there that's gonna end up in this chest

708
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:58,680
there that's gonna end up in this chest
 

709
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,139
there that's gonna end up in this chest
but if we put this other stuff in that

710
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:00,149
but if we put this other stuff in that
 

711
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,410
but if we put this other stuff in that
doesn't stack it's gonna end up down

712
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:03,420
doesn't stack it's gonna end up down
 

713
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,480
doesn't stack it's gonna end up down
here and one will get stuck in the

714
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:05,490
here and one will get stuck in the
 

715
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,870
here and one will get stuck in the
hopper there so basically these will

716
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
hopper there so basically these will
 

717
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,120
hopper there so basically these will
emit a signal strength of two while the

718
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,130
emit a signal strength of two while the
 

719
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,800
emit a signal strength of two while the
non stackable is only a signal strength

720
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:12,810
non stackable is only a signal strength
 

721
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,560
non stackable is only a signal strength
of one if it's two then it unpowered

722
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:15,570
of one if it's two then it unpowered
 

723
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,210
of one if it's two then it unpowered
this hopper over here and it pulls the

724
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:17,220
this hopper over here and it pulls the
 

725
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,850
this hopper over here and it pulls the
items down instead of it going in here

726
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:18,860
items down instead of it going in here
 

727
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,310
items down instead of it going in here
that's the way we do that so that's step

728
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
that's the way we do that so that's step
 

729
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,019
that's the way we do that so that's step
one and I'm kind of imagining the pig

730
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:24,029
one and I'm kind of imagining the pig
 

731
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:26,210
one and I'm kind of imagining the pig
ones are gonna be standing right on top

732
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,220
ones are gonna be standing right on top
 

733
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,100
ones are gonna be standing right on top
of this hopper here throwing their

734
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,110
of this hopper here throwing their
 

735
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,740
of this hopper here throwing their
goodies in there and then we got to work

736
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:30,750
goodies in there and then we got to work
 

737
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,990
goodies in there and then we got to work
on separating these two different

738
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,000
on separating these two different
 

739
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,480
on separating these two different
branches aha so this branch with the

740
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:35,490
branches aha so this branch with the
 

741
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,329
branches aha so this branch with the
stackable items that's these items here

742
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:38,339
stackable items that's these items here
 

743
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,620
stackable items that's these items here
this is what we've been working on most

744
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:39,630
this is what we've been working on most
 

745
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,329
this is what we've been working on most
episode four we have a home for those

746
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:41,339
episode four we have a home for those
 

747
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,400
episode four we have a home for those
now and that's kind of all set up with

748
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,410
now and that's kind of all set up with
 

749
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,139
now and that's kind of all set up with
the dropper chains and stuff but now we

750
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:45,149
the dropper chains and stuff but now we
 

751
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:47,750
the dropper chains and stuff but now we
also want to work on this the non

752
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:47,760
also want to work on this the non
 

753
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,630
also want to work on this the non
stackable items so I've done step two

754
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:50,640
stackable items so I've done step two
 

755
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,180
stackable items so I've done step two
here this is for separating potions from

756
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,190
here this is for separating potions from
 

757
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,000
here this is for separating potions from
the other non stackable items so if we

758
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,010
the other non stackable items so if we
 

759
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,939
the other non stackable items so if we
again do this little test here throw in

760
00:15:58,939 --> 00:15:58,949
again do this little test here throw in
 

761
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:01,610
again do this little test here throw in
our goodies chanted books and all that

762
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:01,620
our goodies chanted books and all that
 

763
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,430
our goodies chanted books and all that
kind of stuff it's gonna run those into

764
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:04,440
kind of stuff it's gonna run those into
 

765
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,790
kind of stuff it's gonna run those into
a brewing stand and enchanted books and

766
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:07,800
a brewing stand and enchanted books and
 

767
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,230
a brewing stand and enchanted books and
the boots can't go into the brewing

768
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,240
the boots can't go into the brewing
 

769
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,630
the boots can't go into the brewing
stand so they get stuck here and then

770
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:11,640
stand so they get stuck here and then
 

771
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,980
stand so they get stuck here and then
after a certain amount of time if

772
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:12,990
after a certain amount of time if
 

773
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,180
after a certain amount of time if
they're still in there

774
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,190
they're still in there
 

775
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,019
they're still in there
this special filter unpowered the hopper

776
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:18,029
this special filter unpowered the hopper
 

777
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:19,610
this special filter unpowered the hopper
below and it pulls items out and puts

778
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:19,620
below and it pulls items out and puts
 

779
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,140
below and it pulls items out and puts
them

780
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,150
them
 

781
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:26,060
them
why are the fire those in there wait a

782
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,070
why are the fire those in there wait a
 

783
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,540
why are the fire those in there wait a
second

784
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:26,550
second
 

785
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,940
second
Wade have tested this before start

786
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:28,950
Wade have tested this before start
 

787
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,040
Wade have tested this before start
recording what did I do wrong it did

788
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,050
recording what did I do wrong it did
 

789
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,960
recording what did I do wrong it did
something wrong guys

790
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:35,970

 

791
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,379

oh maybe I I don't know okay I think it

792
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:39,389
oh maybe I I don't know okay I think it
 

793
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:40,849
oh maybe I I don't know okay I think it
was just getting overwhelmed like it

794
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:40,859
was just getting overwhelmed like it
 

795
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:42,529
was just getting overwhelmed like it
always worked if I just put one potion

796
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:42,539
always worked if I just put one potion
 

797
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:45,319
always worked if I just put one potion
in but I think sometimes too were going

798
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:45,329
in but I think sometimes too were going
 

799
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:47,389
in but I think sometimes too were going
into the hopper at the same time so I've

800
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:47,399
into the hopper at the same time so I've
 

801
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,189
into the hopper at the same time so I've
tried to speed this up now I replace the

802
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
tried to speed this up now I replace the
 

803
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,559
tried to speed this up now I replace the
hopper with a dropper and now we also

804
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:51,569
hopper with a dropper and now we also
 

805
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:53,269
hopper with a dropper and now we also
have a redstone dust here powers this

806
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
have a redstone dust here powers this
 

807
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,819
have a redstone dust here powers this
bone block and then we power the power

808
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:55,829
bone block and then we power the power
 

809
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:57,799
bone block and then we power the power
rail to update the dropper so that it

810
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:57,809
rail to update the dropper so that it
 

811
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,389
rail to update the dropper so that it
knows it's getting powered diagonally

812
00:16:59,389 --> 00:16:59,399
knows it's getting powered diagonally
 

813
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,299
knows it's getting powered diagonally
here and then I also set this the one

814
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:02,309
here and then I also set this the one
 

815
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:04,579
here and then I also set this the one
down here instead of two just to try get

816
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:04,589
down here instead of two just to try get
 

817
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,169
down here instead of two just to try get
this working a little bit quicker

818
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:06,179
this working a little bit quicker
 

819
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:09,590
this working a little bit quicker
and now let's try a test here so we're

820
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
and now let's try a test here so we're
 

821
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,360
and now let's try a test here so we're
gonna put a bunch of stuff in here let's

822
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:11,370
gonna put a bunch of stuff in here let's
 

823
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,129
gonna put a bunch of stuff in here let's
put the stone in let's put some more

824
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:13,139
put the stone in let's put some more
 

825
00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:15,319
put the stone in let's put some more
potions and chanted book and hopefully

826
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:15,329
potions and chanted book and hopefully
 

827
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,730
potions and chanted book and hopefully
everything ends up where it's supposed

828
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:16,740
everything ends up where it's supposed
 

829
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:25,039
everything ends up where it's supposed
to go alright first potion in oh it

830
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,049
to go alright first potion in oh it
 

831
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:26,389
to go alright first potion in oh it
worked through the stone I think yet

832
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:26,399
worked through the stone I think yet
 

833
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:28,759
worked through the stone I think yet
stones in there potions in here

834
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:28,769
stones in there potions in here
 

835
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:31,759
stones in there potions in here
oh one guy in there okay I think we got

836
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:31,769
oh one guy in there okay I think we got
 

837
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:32,629
oh one guy in there okay I think we got
it here now

838
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:32,639
it here now
 

839
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:34,279
it here now
same kind of issue I think two items

840
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:34,289
same kind of issue I think two items
 

841
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:35,570
same kind of issue I think two items
were going in the dropper at the same

842
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:35,580
were going in the dropper at the same
 

843
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,539
were going in the dropper at the same
time and that was messing it up so now

844
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:37,549
time and that was messing it up so now
 

845
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:40,039
time and that was messing it up so now
replace the block there with a target

846
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:40,049
replace the block there with a target
 

847
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,600
replace the block there with a target
block so that this will point out it

848
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:41,610
block so that this will point out it
 

849
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,879
block so that this will point out it
still and then we branched off here we

850
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:43,889
still and then we branched off here we
 

851
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:46,100
still and then we branched off here we
got a two tick delay to lock this hopper

852
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,110
got a two tick delay to lock this hopper
 

853
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,039
got a two tick delay to lock this hopper
so it'll give this time to get the item

854
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:49,049
so it'll give this time to get the item
 

855
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:51,499
so it'll give this time to get the item
out before another one goes in and as

856
00:17:51,499 --> 00:17:51,509
out before another one goes in and as
 

857
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:52,850
out before another one goes in and as
far as I can tell I've tested it a few

858
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:52,860
far as I can tell I've tested it a few
 

859
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,129
far as I can tell I've tested it a few
times now it seems to be okay a bunch of

860
00:17:55,129 --> 00:17:55,139
times now it seems to be okay a bunch of
 

861
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:57,950
times now it seems to be okay a bunch of
stuff in here unlock that so it starts

862
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:57,960
stuff in here unlock that so it starts
 

863
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,529
stuff in here unlock that so it starts
sorting you see they're going into the

864
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:00,539
sorting you see they're going into the
 

865
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,149
sorting you see they're going into the
brewing stand some stuff should be going

866
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:02,159
brewing stand some stuff should be going
 

867
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,080
brewing stand some stuff should be going
down here yeah potions in there grass

868
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,090
down here yeah potions in there grass
 

869
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,539
down here yeah potions in there grass
blocks in there so that will leave us

870
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:08,549
blocks in there so that will leave us
 

871
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:10,490
blocks in there so that will leave us
with books and boots in one of the

872
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:10,500
with books and boots in one of the
 

873
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,049
with books and boots in one of the
chests and then the tune-up and fire

874
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:12,059
chests and then the tune-up and fire
 

875
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,990
chests and then the tune-up and fire
resistant potions in the other one now

876
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,000
resistant potions in the other one now
 

877
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,869
resistant potions in the other one now
we might want to refine this further I

878
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:17,879
we might want to refine this further I
 

879
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:18,889
we might want to refine this further I
haven't decided yet

880
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:18,899
haven't decided yet
 

881
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:23,029
haven't decided yet
we might void the splash ones just so

882
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
we might void the splash ones just so
 

883
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,730
we might void the splash ones just so
it's all the same type of potion because

884
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:25,740
it's all the same type of potion because
 

885
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,930
it's all the same type of potion because
we're gonna be getting a lot of potions

886
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:26,940
we're gonna be getting a lot of potions
 

887
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,080
we're gonna be getting a lot of potions
and it might just be a good idea I don't

888
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,090
and it might just be a good idea I don't
 

889
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,240
and it might just be a good idea I don't
know so like one way we can do that is

890
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,250
know so like one way we can do that is
 

891
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,389
know so like one way we can do that is
to get them all going into the dispenser

892
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:35,399
to get them all going into the dispenser
 

893
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:37,220
to get them all going into the dispenser
the non splash ones should just shoot

894
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,230
the non splash ones should just shoot
 

895
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,379
the non splash ones should just shoot
into the hopper and other ones will get

896
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:39,389
into the hopper and other ones will get
 

897
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:42,259
into the hopper and other ones will get
destroyed that's how we can clean that

898
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:42,269
destroyed that's how we can clean that
 

899
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:45,529
destroyed that's how we can clean that
up if you wanted all uniform and finally

900
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:45,539
up if you wanted all uniform and finally
 

901
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,259
up if you wanted all uniform and finally
we got everything sorted except for the

902
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:48,269
we got everything sorted except for the
 

903
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:48,730
we got everything sorted except for the
boot

904
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:48,740
boot
 

905
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,650
boot
from the books here and how are we gonna

906
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:50,660
from the books here and how are we gonna
 

907
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,840
from the books here and how are we gonna
do that this is probably the most tricky

908
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:52,850
do that this is probably the most tricky
 

909
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,200
do that this is probably the most tricky
one um I thought about it for a bit the

910
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,210
one um I thought about it for a bit the
 

911
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,480
one um I thought about it for a bit the
best method I could think of is didn't

912
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:58,490
best method I could think of is didn't
 

913
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,640
best method I could think of is didn't
use armorstands like maybe there's a way

914
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:00,650
use armorstands like maybe there's a way
 

915
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,440
use armorstands like maybe there's a way
of doing it with mobs like where they

916
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:02,450
of doing it with mobs like where they
 

917
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,030
of doing it with mobs like where they
could pick it up and try to put it on

918
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,040
could pick it up and try to put it on
 

919
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,180
could pick it up and try to put it on
but I don't know how to do it reliably

920
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,190
but I don't know how to do it reliably
 

921
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,020
but I don't know how to do it reliably
so my plan with this is the books and

922
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,030
so my plan with this is the books and
 

923
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,870
so my plan with this is the books and
the boots will go into this dispenser

924
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:13,880
the boots will go into this dispenser
 

925
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,049
the boots will go into this dispenser
and then it's gonna shoot across here if

926
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:17,059
and then it's gonna shoot across here if
 

927
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:18,310
and then it's gonna shoot across here if
it's a book

928
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
it's a book
 

929
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,740
it's a book
it won't go onto the armor stand and

930
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:20,750
it won't go onto the armor stand and
 

931
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,270
it won't go onto the armor stand and
it'll shoot across into these hoppers

932
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:22,280
it'll shoot across into these hoppers
 

933
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,790
it'll shoot across into these hoppers
here if it's boots it'll go onto the

934
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:24,800
here if it's boots it'll go onto the
 

935
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,100
here if it's boots it'll go onto the
armor stand and then we push that armor

936
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,110
armor stand and then we push that armor
 

937
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,110
armor stand and then we push that armor
stand into lava or something down here

938
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,120
stand into lava or something down here
 

939
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,180
stand into lava or something down here
to get rid of it the only downside of

940
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:31,190
to get rid of it the only downside of
 

941
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,370
to get rid of it the only downside of
doing it this way is it's gonna consume

942
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:33,380
doing it this way is it's gonna consume
 

943
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,169
doing it this way is it's gonna consume
our stands every time we try to separate

944
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:35,179
our stands every time we try to separate
 

945
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:38,740
our stands every time we try to separate
the two but armor stands are cheap so it

946
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:38,750
the two but armor stands are cheap so it
 

947
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,680
the two but armor stands are cheap so it
might be okay oh and I can't stand here

948
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:41,690
might be okay oh and I can't stand here
 

949
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,950
might be okay oh and I can't stand here
because I'm gonna grab it alright

950
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:44,960
because I'm gonna grab it alright
 

951
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,910
because I'm gonna grab it alright
alright so you see they got the the pair

952
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:48,920
alright so you see they got the the pair
 

953
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,820
alright so you see they got the the pair
of boots on there but if it's if it's

954
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:51,830
of boots on there but if it's if it's
 

955
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:58,120

books goes into the hoppers here in good

956
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,130
books goes into the hoppers here in good
 

957
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,070
books goes into the hoppers here in good
step so I think we got every single

958
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080
step so I think we got every single
 

959
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,350
step so I think we got every single
piece figured out the system now we just

960
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:02,360
piece figured out the system now we just
 

961
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,140
piece figured out the system now we just
gotta put it all together which is gonna

962
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,150
gotta put it all together which is gonna
 

963
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,810
gotta put it all together which is gonna
take a little bit of finishing and

964
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:06,820
take a little bit of finishing and
 

965
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,520
take a little bit of finishing and
playing around with it I'm sure now we

966
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:09,530
playing around with it I'm sure now we
 

967
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,560
playing around with it I'm sure now we
are running low on time in this episode

968
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:11,570
are running low on time in this episode
 

969
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,940
are running low on time in this episode
so I think we're gonna have to split it

970
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:12,950
so I think we're gonna have to split it
 

971
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,390
so I think we're gonna have to split it
into another one but before we wrap up

972
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400
into another one but before we wrap up
 

973
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,890
into another one but before we wrap up
here I just want to show you where we're

974
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:17,900
here I just want to show you where we're
 

975
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,630
here I just want to show you where we're
at here so you can see we got the item

976
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:19,640
at here so you can see we got the item
 

977
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,049
at here so you can see we got the item
filters running all around here now and

978
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:23,059
filters running all around here now and
 

979
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:26,500
filters running all around here now and
we did do both sides so again we got

980
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:26,510
we did do both sides so again we got
 

981
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,740
we did do both sides so again we got
item filters on this side as well out of

982
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:29,750
item filters on this side as well out of
 

983
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,430
item filters on this side as well out of
view so that we can get four per item so

984
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,440
view so that we can get four per item so
 

985
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,000
view so that we can get four per item so
we got to fill these all so this is

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,010
we got to fill these all so this is
 

987
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,220

regular style item filters we're going

1030
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:32,550
regular style item filters we're going
 

1031
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,060
regular style item filters we're going
to tear these out on the final two rows

1032
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,070
to tear these out on the final two rows
 

1033
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,700
to tear these out on the final two rows
and set up our other item filters we

1034
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:37,710
and set up our other item filters we
 

1035
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,070
and set up our other item filters we
designed today for the non stackable

1036
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
designed today for the non stackable
 

1037
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,100
designed today for the non stackable
items but then all the stackable items

1038
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,110
items but then all the stackable items
 

1039
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,640
items but then all the stackable items
we have to send into these droppers at

1040
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:46,650
we have to send into these droppers at
 

1041
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,430
we have to send into these droppers at
the end here and ideally we want to be

1042
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
the end here and ideally we want to be
 

1043
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,560
the end here and ideally we want to be
able to split those evenly so half the

1044
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:51,570
able to split those evenly so half the
 

1045
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,330
able to split those evenly so half the
piggelin trades will go into one and

1046
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:53,340
piggelin trades will go into one and
 

1047
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,750
piggelin trades will go into one and
half into the other and when the item

1048
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:56,760
half into the other and when the item
 

1049
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,460
half into the other and when the item
goes into these droppers we want the

1050
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:58,470
goes into these droppers we want the
 

1051
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,830
goes into these droppers we want the
clock to activate so we'll just do it

1052
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:00,840
clock to activate so we'll just do it
 

1053
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,480
clock to activate so we'll just do it
manually for now to show you the speed

1054
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:02,490
manually for now to show you the speed
 

1055
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,100
manually for now to show you the speed
of this so we put four stacks of soul

1056
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,110
of this so we put four stacks of soul
 

1057
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,010
of this so we put four stacks of soul
sand in and that should make its way

1058
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,020
sand in and that should make its way
 

1059
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,030
sand in and that should make its way
down to here and it did so it's filling

1060
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,040
down to here and it did so it's filling
 

1061
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,440
down to here and it did so it's filling
up at a very nice speed and we're

1062
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:15,450
up at a very nice speed and we're
 

1063
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,930
up at a very nice speed and we're

1072
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:26,220
end here so they're all going into the
 

1073
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:32,890
end here so they're all going into the
filters they're keeping up the problem

1074
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:32,900

1091
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,730
to the ender Porter I recall there was
an issue with the loading of chunks but

1092
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:04,740
an issue with the loading of chunks but
 

1093
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,890
an issue with the loading of chunks but
with how nether portal chunk loaders

1094
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:06,900
with how nether portal chunk loaders
 

1095
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,320
with how nether portal chunk loaders
work now would it be more possible now

1096
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:11,330
work now would it be more possible now
 

1097
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,340

I'm not quite sure I know exactly what

1098
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:15,350
I'm not quite sure I know exactly what

he means by nether portal chunk loaders

1100
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:17,029
he means by nether portal chunk loaders

I'm assuming something that shoots items

1102
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:19,249
I'm assuming something that shoots items
 

1103
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:22,509
I'm assuming something that shoots items
through constantly I don't think that

1104
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:22,519
through constantly I don't think that
 

1105
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,519
through constantly I don't think that
really will work in a single-player

1106
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:24,529
really will work in a single-player
 

1107
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:27,369
really will work in a single-player
world maybe on a server for keeping the

1108
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:27,379
world maybe on a server for keeping the
 

1109
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:28,659
world maybe on a server for keeping the
chunks loaded because as soon as I close

1110
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:28,669
chunks loaded because as soon as I close
 

1111
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:30,430
chunks loaded because as soon as I close
my game and come back I think it's gonna

1112
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:30,440
my game and come back I think it's gonna
 

1113
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,930
my game and come back I think it's gonna
reload them no matter what all right I

1114
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:33,940
reload them no matter what all right I
 

1115
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,129
reload them no matter what all right I
don't like the idea of keeping chunks

1116
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:36,139
don't like the idea of keeping chunks
 

1117
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:38,169
don't like the idea of keeping chunks
loaded either because that's gonna like

1118
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:38,179
loaded either because that's gonna like
 

1119
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:40,450
loaded either because that's gonna like
my world as I'm playing constantly and I

1120
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:40,460
my world as I'm playing constantly and I
 

1121
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,710
my world as I'm playing constantly and I
don't think it's really worth it

1122
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:41,720
don't think it's really worth it
 

1123
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,899
don't think it's really worth it
now let's let's just talk about the end

1124
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:43,909
now let's let's just talk about the end
 

1125
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:45,639
now let's let's just talk about the end
reporter real quick cuz a lot of people

1126
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:45,649
reporter real quick cuz a lot of people
 

1127
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:47,710
reporter real quick cuz a lot of people
get confused about this the issue isn't

1128
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:47,720
get confused about this the issue isn't
 

1129
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,619
get confused about this the issue isn't
that we can't keep the ender pearl

1130
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:49,629
that we can't keep the ender pearl
 

1131
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,389
that we can't keep the ender pearl
suspended that's actually fairly easy to

1132
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:52,399
suspended that's actually fairly easy to
 

1133
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:57,190
suspended that's actually fairly easy to
do still I say that in the tails then I

1134
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
do still I say that in the tails then I
 

1135
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,389
do still I say that in the tails then I
fall through yeah I never did perfect

1136
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:01,399
fall through yeah I never did perfect
 

1137
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:08,289
fall through yeah I never did perfect
the setting of this oh come on there we

1138
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:08,299
the setting of this oh come on there we
 

1139
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:10,090
the setting of this oh come on there we
go so it's bouncing on the slime block

1140
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:10,100
go so it's bouncing on the slime block
 

1141
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,460
go so it's bouncing on the slime block
and as as long as it does that it should

1142
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:12,470
and as as long as it does that it should
 

1143
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,830
and as as long as it does that it should
be fine but the issue is if I die and I

1144
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
be fine but the issue is if I die and I
 

1145
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
be fine but the issue is if I die and I
leave the area or if I go through the

1146
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:19,850
leave the area or if I go through the
 

1147
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,330
leave the area or if I go through the
nether or if I just fly a few hundred

1148
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:22,340
nether or if I just fly a few hundred
 

1149
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,960
nether or if I just fly a few hundred
blocks away and come back the chunks

1150
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:24,970
blocks away and come back the chunks
 

1151
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,180
blocks away and come back the chunks
unload and then when we reload them we

1152
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,190
unload and then when we reload them we
 

1153
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,389
unload and then when we reload them we
teleport that's why it's broken I have

1154
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:31,399
teleport that's why it's broken I have
 

1155
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,450
teleport that's why it's broken I have
not found a way to fix that see it

1156
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:34,460
not found a way to fix that see it
 

1157
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,940
not found a way to fix that see it
activated unintentionally there that's

1158
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:36,950
activated unintentionally there that's
 

1159
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,389
activated unintentionally there that's
the big issue with it but I have thought

1160
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:40,399
the big issue with it but I have thought
 

1161
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:43,180
the big issue with it but I have thought
of another teleportation system that's a

1162
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,190
of another teleportation system that's a
 

1163
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,249
of another teleportation system that's a
lot easier to do I think we're gonna do

1164
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:45,259
lot easier to do I think we're gonna do
 

1165
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:48,970
lot easier to do I think we're gonna do
that as a project pretty soon yeah I

1166
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:48,980
that as a project pretty soon yeah I
 

1167
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,759
that as a project pretty soon yeah I
think I think it's gonna be cool so look

1168
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:51,769
think I think it's gonna be cool so look
 

1169
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:53,019
think I think it's gonna be cool so look

00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:57,169
should finish the bartering system but
 

1175
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:58,960
should finish the bartering system but
yeah that's gonna do it for today's

1176
