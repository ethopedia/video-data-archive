00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
i kind of want to make like a villager
 

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,030
i kind of want to make like a villager
separator the zombie villager separator

24
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
separator the zombie villager separator
 

25
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,590
separator the zombie villager separator
thingy

26
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
thingy
 

27
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,030
thingy
majig because it a zombie spawner will

28
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
majig because it a zombie spawner will
 

29
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,069
majig because it a zombie spawner will
spawn both zombies

30
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
spawn both zombies
 

31
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,670
spawn both zombies
and the zombie villagers

32
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680

 

33
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,670

which is pretty cool now there is a new

34
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
which is pretty cool now there is a new
 

35
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,029
which is pretty cool now there is a new
snapshot out

36
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
snapshot out
 

37
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,189
snapshot out
and the 39a i'm still using 38b though

38
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
and the 39a i'm still using 38b though
 

39
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,709
and the 39a i'm still using 38b though
they've done a lot of changes with the

40
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
they've done a lot of changes with the
 

41
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,869
they've done a lot of changes with the
lighting engine

42
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
lighting engine
 

43
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,869
lighting engine
and i thought it was just going to be

44
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
and i thought it was just going to be
 

45
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,349
and i thought it was just going to be
visual stuff but apparently they've

46
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
visual stuff but apparently they've
 

47
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,750
visual stuff but apparently they've
changed game mechanics like lighting

48
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
changed game mechanics like lighting
 

49
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,429
changed game mechanics like lighting
lighting mechanics in the game so i

50
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
lighting mechanics in the game so i
 

51
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,230
lighting mechanics in the game so i
think

52
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
think
 

53
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,149
think
hasslab stuff like this is not going to

54
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
hasslab stuff like this is not going to
 

55
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,670
hasslab stuff like this is not going to
work anymore

56
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680
work anymore
 

57
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,550
work anymore
and i have a lot of stuff to fix so i

58
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
and i have a lot of stuff to fix so i
 

59
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,910
and i have a lot of stuff to fix so i
want to make sure they're

60
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
want to make sure they're
 

61
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,190
want to make sure they're
they're certain what they're doing

62
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
they're certain what they're doing
 

63
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,749
they're certain what they're doing
before i start switching things around

64
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
before i start switching things around
 

65
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,230
before i start switching things around
so

66
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
so
 

67
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,910
so
i'm going to wait a little while on that

68
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
i'm going to wait a little while on that
 

69
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,749
i'm going to wait a little while on that
maybe next snapshot i'll

70
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
maybe next snapshot i'll
 

71
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,070
maybe next snapshot i'll
switch over um

72
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
switch over um
 

73
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,590
switch over um
but yeah i'm going to make

74
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
but yeah i'm going to make
 

75
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,429
but yeah i'm going to make
kind of drew some rough plans on paper

76
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
kind of drew some rough plans on paper
 

77
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,390
kind of drew some rough plans on paper
here i'm going to

78
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400

 

79
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,670

have like a a door junction probably

80
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
have like a a door junction probably
 

81
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,630
have like a a door junction probably
here

82
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
here
 

83
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,270
here
or a piston junction with water streams

84
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
or a piston junction with water streams
 

85
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,310
or a piston junction with water streams
one

86
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
one
 

87
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,670
one
one way or one

88
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
one way or one
 

89
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,749
one way or one
one path of the junction will go for

90
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
one path of the junction will go for
 

91
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,429
one path of the junction will go for
zombie villagers and one path will just

92
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
zombie villagers and one path will just
 

93
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,190
zombie villagers and one path will just
go for regular zombies so

94
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
go for regular zombies so
 

95
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,990
go for regular zombies so
we're gonna split them manually i don't

96
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
we're gonna split them manually i don't
 

97
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,670
we're gonna split them manually i don't
think there's any other way to do it

98
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
think there's any other way to do it
 

99
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,469
think there's any other way to do it
oh there's one right there

100
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479

 

101
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,350

hey he stole my box that guy

102
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
hey he stole my box that guy
 

103
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,270
hey he stole my box that guy
um yeah i don't think there's any way to

104
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
um yeah i don't think there's any way to
 

105
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,670
um yeah i don't think there's any way to
automatically do it that i can think of

106
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
automatically do it that i can think of
 

107
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,150
automatically do it that i can think of
right now anyway so we'll have a manual

108
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
right now anyway so we'll have a manual
 

109
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,150
right now anyway so we'll have a manual
splitter and then i want to do some

110
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
splitter and then i want to do some
 

111
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,070
splitter and then i want to do some
fancy thing with carts just for the fun

112
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
fancy thing with carts just for the fun
 

113
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,790
fancy thing with carts just for the fun
of it so

114
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
of it so
 

115
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,949
of it so
gonna go get glass and all that fun

116
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959
gonna go get glass and all that fun
 

117
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:41,670
gonna go get glass and all that fun
stuff and we'll get going here

118
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680

 

119
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,150

actually you know what it occurred to me

120
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
actually you know what it occurred to me
 

121
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,830
actually you know what it occurred to me
i should

122
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840

 

123
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,470

no

124
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
no
 

125
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,350
no
okay are you still in the minecart

126
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360

 

127
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,550

dang that really messed up my test

128
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
dang that really messed up my test
 

129
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,550
dang that really messed up my test
i think he is i was trying to see what

130
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
i think he is i was trying to see what
 

131
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,509
i think he is i was trying to see what
happens

132
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
happens
 

133
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,869
happens
when he converts if he'll stay in the

134
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
when he converts if he'll stay in the
 

135
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,229
when he converts if he'll stay in the
mine cart or not

136
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239

 

137
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,550

oh no he he is not in the mine cart so

138
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
oh no he he is not in the mine cart so
 

139
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,309
oh no he he is not in the mine cart so
when he converts he gets

140
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
when he converts he gets
 

141
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,630
when he converts he gets
put out of it so that might affect

142
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
put out of it so that might affect
 

143
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:23,110
put out of it so that might affect
my design choice here it's good to know

144
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120

 

145
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,710

ah this thing's still spawning zombies

146
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
ah this thing's still spawning zombies
 

147
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,229
ah this thing's still spawning zombies
so i'm gonna move the lighting around

148
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
so i'm gonna move the lighting around
 

149
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,990
so i'm gonna move the lighting around
we have it in a square shape like that

150
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
we have it in a square shape like that
 

151
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,070
we have it in a square shape like that
if we do if we just move them a little

152
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
if we do if we just move them a little
 

153
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,750
if we do if we just move them a little
bit i think we can stop it completely

154
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
bit i think we can stop it completely
 

155
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,670
bit i think we can stop it completely
but yeah we figured out a few things in

156
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
but yeah we figured out a few things in
 

157
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,670
but yeah we figured out a few things in
creative mode there

158
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
creative mode there
 

159
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,789
creative mode there
um let's see

160
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
um let's see
 

161
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,309
um let's see
if we i think if we move the lamps to

162
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
if we i think if we move the lamps to
 

163
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,350
if we i think if we move the lamps to
there that should work

164
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
there that should work
 

165
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,949
there that should work
yeah they go out of the carts um

166
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
yeah they go out of the carts um
 

167
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,190
yeah they go out of the carts um
when they convert i also did a few other

168
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
when they convert i also did a few other
 

169
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,869
when they convert i also did a few other
tests like i wanted to see how long it

170
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
tests like i wanted to see how long it
 

171
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,869
tests like i wanted to see how long it
takes them to convert so i

172
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
takes them to convert so i
 

173
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,229
takes them to convert so i
i set up four guys and time them

174
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
i set up four guys and time them
 

175
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,309
i set up four guys and time them
all four of them and it seems like it's

176
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
all four of them and it seems like it's
 

177
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,550
all four of them and it seems like it's
a random amount of time like they didn't

178
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
a random amount of time like they didn't
 

179
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,270
a random amount of time like they didn't
all change at the same time

180
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
all change at the same time
 

181
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,949
all change at the same time
but it was about three to four minutes

182
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
but it was about three to four minutes
 

183
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,590
but it was about three to four minutes
is how long it takes them

184
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
is how long it takes them
 

185
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,590
is how long it takes them
um also if you

186
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600

 

187
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,070

if they have if the zombie villagers

188
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
if they have if the zombie villagers
 

189
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,629
if they have if the zombie villagers
have armor on and they convert

190
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
have armor on and they convert
 

191
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,150
have armor on and they convert
they lose it when they switch to

192
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
they lose it when they switch to
 

193
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,469
they lose it when they switch to
villagers so it's another thing i

194
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
villagers so it's another thing i
 

195
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,390
villagers so it's another thing i
figured out that's too bad it would be

196
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
figured out that's too bad it would be
 

197
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,590
figured out that's too bad it would be
cool if you could have

198
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
cool if you could have
 

199
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,469
cool if you could have
villagers with like swords and and armor

200
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
villagers with like swords and and armor
 

201
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,030
villagers with like swords and and armor
and

202
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
and
 

203
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,710
and
like enchanted armor or something that

204
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
like enchanted armor or something that
 

205
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,189
like enchanted armor or something that
would be cool

206
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
would be cool
 

207
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,590
would be cool
i think that'll stop him

208
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600

 

209
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,510

[Music]

210
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
[Music]
 

211
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,830
[Music]
whoa there's a lot of zombies down here

212
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
whoa there's a lot of zombies down here
 

213
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,070
whoa there's a lot of zombies down here
already

214
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080

 

215
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,350

and what else what else

216
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
and what else what else
 

217
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,270
and what else what else
yeah i'm also i didn't try this but i'm

218
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
yeah i'm also i didn't try this but i'm
 

219
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,950
yeah i'm also i didn't try this but i'm
guessing like if you

220
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
guessing like if you
 

221
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,590
guessing like if you
if you heard a zombie villager and like

222
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
if you heard a zombie villager and like
 

223
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,870
if you heard a zombie villager and like
get them down to half heart and they

224
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
get them down to half heart and they
 

225
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,749
get them down to half heart and they
convert

226
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
convert
 

227
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,430
convert
when they convert the villagers will

228
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
when they convert the villagers will
 

229
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,189
when they convert the villagers will
have full life but i'm just

230
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
have full life but i'm just
 

231
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,710
have full life but i'm just
assuming that i haven't i didn't

232
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
assuming that i haven't i didn't
 

233
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,070
assuming that i haven't i didn't
actually try it

234
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080

 

235
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,390

but anyway to get this thing going

236
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400

 

237
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,230

we need to move the zombies at least

238
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
we need to move the zombies at least
 

239
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,150
we need to move the zombies at least
eight blocks away from the spawner

240
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160

 

241
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,510

so let's see where we at

242
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
so let's see where we at
 

243
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,710
so let's see where we at
one two three

244
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720
one two three
 

245
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,990
one two three
four five

246
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
four five
 

247
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,189
four five
six seven eight so we need them to come

248
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
six seven eight so we need them to come
 

249
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,390
six seven eight so we need them to come
to at least here so that they'll they'll

250
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
to at least here so that they'll they'll
 

251
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,710
to at least here so that they'll they'll
keep

252
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
keep
 

253
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,629
keep
spawning from that spawner there

254
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639

 

255
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,909

something like this should work out

256
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
something like this should work out
 

257
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,870
something like this should work out
pretty good so we'll just put

258
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
pretty good so we'll just put
 

259
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,150
pretty good so we'll just put
signs to hold our water

260
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
signs to hold our water
 

261
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,790
signs to hold our water
water will go there and there

262
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800

 

263
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,070

oh you know what i just realized

264
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
oh you know what i just realized
 

265
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,950
oh you know what i just realized
something um

266
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
something um
 

267
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,710
something um
i was going to put another ice block

268
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
i was going to put another ice block
 

269
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,469
i was going to put another ice block
right here but i'll make an infinite

270
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
right here but i'll make an infinite
 

271
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,510
right here but i'll make an infinite
spring

272
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520

 

273
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,590

unless i put it back further

274
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600

 

275
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,189

all right anyway uh we'll put our signs

276
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
all right anyway uh we'll put our signs
 

277
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:19,590
all right anyway uh we'll put our signs
down

278
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
down
 

279
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,189
down
there and one there

280
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199

 

281
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,350

get some glass going we'll so we'll

282
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
get some glass going we'll so we'll
 

283
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,550
get some glass going we'll so we'll
we'll probably stand around here we have

284
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
we'll probably stand around here we have
 

285
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,710
we'll probably stand around here we have
to be close enough to the spawner

286
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
to be close enough to the spawner
 

287
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,189
to be close enough to the spawner
that it will keep going and

288
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
that it will keep going and
 

289
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,790
that it will keep going and
would kind of like to set up a control

290
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
would kind of like to set up a control
 

291
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,710
would kind of like to set up a control
panel somewhere for this but we'll we'll

292
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
panel somewhere for this but we'll we'll
 

293
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,909
panel somewhere for this but we'll we'll
get to that later

294
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919

 

295
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,590

i have to adjust this a bit yet

296
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
i have to adjust this a bit yet
 

297
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,029
i have to adjust this a bit yet
break that wait

299
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,150

break this one uh let's see how's this

300
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
break this one uh let's see how's this
 

301
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,670
break this one uh let's see how's this
gonna go for the zombies

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,990

one more back here

344
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
one more back here
 

345
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,589
one more back here
we just want we want a diagonal water

346
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
we just want we want a diagonal water
 

347
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,430
we just want we want a diagonal water
stream going here so that we can set up

348
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
stream going here so that we can set up
 

349
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,909
stream going here so that we can set up
a junction

350
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
a junction
 

351
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,670
a junction
we're doing it we're doing it the old

352
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
we're doing it we're doing it the old
 

353
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,110
we're doing it we're doing it the old
school way here

354
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120

 

355
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,390

all right i need that okay um

356
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,400
all right i need that okay um
 

357
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,189
all right i need that okay um
it's been a while since i've done this i

358
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
it's been a while since i've done this i
 

359
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:31,909
it's been a while since i've done this i
need to go back

360
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
need to go back
 

361
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:38,829
need to go back
one more

362
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839

 

363
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:47,110

see let's put glass for now

364
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120

 

365
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,829

and that's

366
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:52,839

 

367
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,509

that there

368
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
that there
 

369
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,990
that there
okay that should work now

370
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000

 

371
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,430

so when they'll meet it'll make a

372
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
so when they'll meet it'll make a
 

373
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,230
so when they'll meet it'll make a
diagonal water

374
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
diagonal water
 

375
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,829
diagonal water
okay and now we need to set up our

376
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839
okay and now we need to set up our
 

377
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,230
okay and now we need to set up our
switch

378
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
switch
 

379
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,750
switch
i had this big plan for what i want to

380
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
i had this big plan for what i want to
 

381
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,430
i had this big plan for what i want to
do with the mine carts but if they

382
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
do with the mine carts but if they
 

383
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,710
do with the mine carts but if they
if they go out of the mine carts when

384
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
if they go out of the mine carts when
 

385
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,550
if they go out of the mine carts when
they convert i might have to rethink

386
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
they convert i might have to rethink
 

387
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,990
they convert i might have to rethink
that all

388
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000

 

389
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,910

or simplify it or do something else i

390
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
or simplify it or do something else i
 

391
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,750
or simplify it or do something else i
don't know

392
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
don't know
 

393
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,190
don't know
that's a great way of like detecting

394
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
that's a great way of like detecting
 

395
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,230
that's a great way of like detecting
when they change though because you can

396
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
when they change though because you can
 

397
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,990
when they change though because you can
like you can have a minecart on top of a

398
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
like you can have a minecart on top of a
 

399
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,910
like you can have a minecart on top of a
painting

400
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
painting
 

401
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,430
painting
with a hole below and when they convert

402
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
with a hole below and when they convert
 

403
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,110
with a hole below and when they convert
they'll fall through and land on a

404
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
they'll fall through and land on a
 

405
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,230
they'll fall through and land on a
pressure plate or

406
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
pressure plate or
 

407
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,030
pressure plate or
tripwire or something and you can know

408
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
tripwire or something and you can know
 

409
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,590
tripwire or something and you can know
when they

410
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
when they
 

411
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,870
when they
when they switch over

412
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880

 

413
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,030

um okay so so one path will go this way

414
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
um okay so so one path will go this way
 

415
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,470
um okay so so one path will go this way
one path will go straight will make the

416
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
one path will go straight will make the
 

417
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,990
one path will go straight will make the
zombie villagers go straight

418
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
zombie villagers go straight
 

419
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,670
zombie villagers go straight
here

420
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680

 

421
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,430

and the zombies the regular ones will go

422
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
and the zombies the regular ones will go
 

423
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,030
and the zombies the regular ones will go
over here we're going to use i think

424
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
over here we're going to use i think
 

425
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,949
over here we're going to use i think
trapdoors for our junction

426
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
trapdoors for our junction
 

427
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,470
trapdoors for our junction
so give me a second to set that up

428
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
so give me a second to set that up
 

429
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,590
so give me a second to set that up
because that will probably take me a

430
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
because that will probably take me a
 

431
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,790
because that will probably take me a
little bit

432
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800

 

433
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,829

oh yeah we got some stuff done here now

434
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
oh yeah we got some stuff done here now
 

435
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,190
oh yeah we got some stuff done here now
so this is the junction

436
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200

 

437
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,269

this is a hole this is the junction

438
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
this is a hole this is the junction
 

439
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,470
this is a hole this is the junction
just a trap door thing

440
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
just a trap door thing
 

441
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,069
just a trap door thing
so yeah if it's closed if they're both

442
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
so yeah if it's closed if they're both
 

443
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,990
so yeah if it's closed if they're both
closed uh

444
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
closed uh
 

445
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,190
closed uh
the mobs will get stuck here

446
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
the mobs will get stuck here
 

447
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,190
the mobs will get stuck here
it's important that it opens to the left

448
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
it's important that it opens to the left
 

449
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,710
it's important that it opens to the left
here so that i don't get

450
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
here so that i don't get
 

451
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,630
here so that i don't get
or the the mob stone gets stuck on this

452
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
or the the mob stone gets stuck on this
 

453
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,110
or the the mob stone gets stuck on this
little little piece of the trapdoor

454
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
little little piece of the trapdoor
 

455
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,190
little little piece of the trapdoor
they'll be on aligned to the right side

456
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
they'll be on aligned to the right side
 

457
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,470
they'll be on aligned to the right side
here and should go through

458
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
here and should go through
 

459
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,470
here and should go through
and same with this one it opens to the

460
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
and same with this one it opens to the
 

461
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,750
and same with this one it opens to the
right

462
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
right
 

463
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,949
right
so away from where the water is pushing

464
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
so away from where the water is pushing
 

465
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,150
so away from where the water is pushing
and they can go this way and i got that

466
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
and they can go this way and i got that
 

467
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,110
and they can go this way and i got that
neatly

468
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
neatly
 

469
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,310
neatly
wired up to over here

470
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
wired up to over here
 

471
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,389
wired up to over here
so one of them will always be open and

472
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
so one of them will always be open and
 

473
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,230
so one of them will always be open and
one will always be closed

474
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
one will always be closed
 

475
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,150
one will always be closed
to pick the path

476
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160

 

477
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,910

and sort as they come through here i can

478
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:03,920
and sort as they come through here i can
 

479
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,230
and sort as they come through here i can
eyeball is it is it a zombie villager or

480
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
eyeball is it is it a zombie villager or
 

481
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,430
eyeball is it is it a zombie villager or
is it a zombie

482
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
is it a zombie
 

483
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,949
is it a zombie
and up for villager that will make them

484
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
and up for villager that will make them
 

485
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,150
and up for villager that will make them
go straight

486
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
go straight
 

487
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,670
go straight
into this this path here see the doors

488
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
into this this path here see the doors
 

489
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,430
into this this path here see the doors
open

490
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
open
 

491
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,790
open
or if it's down they will come through

492
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800
or if it's down they will come through
 

493
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,910
or if it's down they will come through
this way

494
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
this way
 

495
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,870
this way
and still got to set up paths for them

496
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
and still got to set up paths for them
 

497
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,110
and still got to set up paths for them
though

498
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120

 

499
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,630

all right um i guess i'll show you the

500
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
all right um i guess i'll show you the
 

501
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,430
all right um i guess i'll show you the
wiring real

502
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
wiring real
 

503
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,030
wiring real
quick

504
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040

 

505
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,470

are people finding me

torches that come up from below there

516
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279

 

517

um yeah let's see
 

519
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,509
um yeah let's see
the lever's there redstone wire comes

520
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
the lever's there redstone wire comes
 

521
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,790
the lever's there redstone wire comes
all the way to

522
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
all the way to
 

523
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:15,269
all the way to
here then up to here redstone torches

524
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279

 

525
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,829

then to the repeater to this this block

526
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
then to the repeater to this this block
 

527
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,430
then to the repeater to this this block
here

528
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
here
 

529
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,470
here

also has wire that goes to this
inverter and then to there which is

534
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
inverter and then to there which is
 

535
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,190
inverter and then to there which is
above the door

536
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
above the door
 

537
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,870

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,110

okay

688
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
okay
 

689
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,470
okay

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,269
let's try this one more time last one
i want a real creeper

692
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279

there we go yeah game mode

696
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959

 

697
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,829

i guess i could just punch him either

698
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839

 

699
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,069

way

700
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
way
 

701
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,189
way
yeah creepers can definitely take it out

702
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
yeah creepers can definitely take it out
 

703
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,550
yeah creepers can definitely take it out
okay so we know that now i want to see

704
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
okay so we know that now i want to see
 

705
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,829
okay so we know that now i want to see
like the effects

706
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
like the effects
 

707
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,430
like the effects
the thing that i'm really excited about

708
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:45,440
the thing that i'm really excited about
 

709
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,110
the thing that i'm really excited about
with these is the speed

710
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120
with these is the speed
 

711
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,590
with these is the speed
the speed boost you can get and also

712
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:53,600

 

713
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,509

the the haste because there's no other

714
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
the the haste because there's no other
 

715
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,350
the the haste because there's no other
way of doing haste in this game

716
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
way of doing haste in this game
 

717
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,870
way of doing haste in this game
where you mine quicker

718
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880

 

719
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,189

so i think let's just do

720
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199

 

721
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,390

a full-blown one i think five by five

722
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
a full-blown one i think five by five
 

723
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,669
a full-blown one i think five by five
five by five is right i think it needs

724
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
five by five is right i think it needs
 

725
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,429
five by five is right i think it needs
to be solid

726
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
to be solid
 

727
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,870
to be solid
oh wait no i think it can get bigger

728
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:24,880

 

729
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,430

yeah i think this is only a level two

730
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440

 

731
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,590

all right so if we i think we have to

732
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
all right so if we i think we have to
 

733
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,070
all right so if we i think we have to
feed it

734
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,080

 

735
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,669

okay there's regeneration regeneration

736
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
okay there's regeneration regeneration
 

737
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,870
okay there's regeneration regeneration
is always on we don't have the choice

738
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
is always on we don't have the choice
 

739
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,750
is always on we don't have the choice
for strength

740
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
for strength
 

741
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,870
for strength
we yeah we only have this level

742
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:48,880

 

743
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,590

so if i go to survival

744
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,600

 

745
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,390

i am not being affected by it so i think

746
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
i am not being affected by it so i think
 

747
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,110
i am not being affected by it so i think
we have to

748
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120
we have to
 

749
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,909
we have to
power it

750
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919

 

751
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,110

as far as i know it doesn't matter what

752
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
as far as i know it doesn't matter what
 

753
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,230
as far as i know it doesn't matter what
you power it with so let's

754
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
you power it with so let's
 

755
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,909
you power it with so let's
oh yeah there's jump boost i forgot

756
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
oh yeah there's jump boost i forgot
 

757
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,430
oh yeah there's jump boost i forgot
about jump boost

758
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
about jump boost
 

759
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,510
about jump boost
oh this is like all stuff you can't get

760
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
oh this is like all stuff you can't get
 

761
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,190
oh this is like all stuff you can't get
resistance jump boost taste

762
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
resistance jump boost taste
 

763
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,870
resistance jump boost taste
very cool uh let's pick

764
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:22,880
very cool uh let's pick
 

765
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,870
very cool uh let's pick
let's pick the haste one out haste two

766
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
let's pick the haste one out haste two
 

767
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:35,669
let's pick the haste one out haste two
can we pick more than one no

768
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679

 

769
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,270

that is awesome oh i gotta try this out

770
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280
that is awesome oh i gotta try this out
 

771
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,430
that is awesome oh i gotta try this out
we're just gonna use a regular diamond

772
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
we're just gonna use a regular diamond
 

773
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,950
we're just gonna use a regular diamond
pick

774
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960

 

775
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,990

so i guess

776
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000

 

777
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,029

let me think how's that work

778
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
let me think how's that work
 

779
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,590
let me think how's that work
though the bigger you make it i know the

780
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
though the bigger you make it i know the
 

781
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,029
though the bigger you make it i know the
further the range is

782
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
further the range is
 

783
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,070
further the range is
on it i wonder if you get more choices

784
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
on it i wonder if you get more choices
 

785
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,510
on it i wonder if you get more choices
too because i see strengths

786
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520
too because i see strengths
 

787
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,230
too because i see strengths
not an option i think you gotta go up

788
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
not an option i think you gotta go up
 

789
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,830
not an option i think you gotta go up
one higher for that

790
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:08,840

 

791
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,909

um all right game mode well what should

792
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
um all right game mode well what should
 

793
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,150
um all right game mode well what should
we break let's break

794
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
we break let's break
 

795
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,990
we break let's break
let's just break some stone

796
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,000

 

797
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,070

and then we'll try we'll try mine this

798
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080
and then we'll try we'll try mine this
 

799
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,750
and then we'll try we'll try mine this
again afterward and see if we can pick

800
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:23,760
again afterward and see if we can pick
 

801
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:23,990
again afterward and see if we can pick
it

802
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
it
 

803
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,549
it
up and that's about all i wanted to

804
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
up and that's about all i wanted to
 

805
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,909
up and that's about all i wanted to
check out

806
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919

 

807
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,830

oh yeah that's that's quite a bit

808
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840

 

809
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,150

quicker

810
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160

 

811
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,190

pretty cool let's see how far away it

812
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200
pretty cool let's see how far away it
 

813
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,669
pretty cool let's see how far away it
works

814
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
works
 

815
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:52,070
works
at level two

816
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
at level two
 

817
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,350
at level two
where is it it's up there

818
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360

 

819
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,630

i think that like the max level it works

820
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
i think that like the max level it works
 

821
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,390
i think that like the max level it works
it has like a diameter of 80 blocks

822
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
it has like a diameter of 80 blocks
 

823
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,830
it has like a diameter of 80 blocks
which is pretty

824
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:04,840

 

825
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,390

awesome

826
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:06,400
awesome
 

827
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,950
awesome
uh yeah we're pretty close to it now

828
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
uh yeah we're pretty close to it now
 

829
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,310
uh yeah we're pretty close to it now
it's still not giving it to us

830
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320

 

831
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,990

there it is huh

832
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
there it is huh

minecraft server i'm digging that hole
it might be cool to set one of these up

842
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:28,159
it might be cool to set one of these up
 

843
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,870
it might be cool to set one of these up
there to speed that up too

844
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880

 

845
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,029

00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
anyway back to the lp world that was
 

847
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,190
anyway back to the lp world that was
cool to check out

848
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200

 

849
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,590

okay so i set up a full-blown pyramid

850
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:41,600
okay so i set up a full-blown pyramid
 

851
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,350
okay so i set up a full-blown pyramid
now i just wanted to see if it would

852
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,360
now i just wanted to see if it would
 

853
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,230
now i just wanted to see if it would
change

854
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
change
 

855
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,710

five attributes i'm just
a tad too far away to get two of them

860
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:52,799

 

861
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,990

there we go all five

862
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
there we go all five
 

863
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,430
there we go all five
uh it is it's an 80 diameter

864
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,440
uh it is it's an 80 diameter
 

865
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,310
uh it is it's an 80 diameter
cube around with the the beacon at the

866
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
cube around with the the beacon at the
 

867
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,190
cube around with the the beacon at the
center

868
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,200
center
 

869
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,510
center
it seems so even diagonally 40 blocks

870
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,520
it seems so even diagonally 40 blocks
 

871
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,630
it seems so even diagonally 40 blocks
both directions it works it's not a

872
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
both directions it works it's not a
 

873
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,830
both directions it works it's not a
not circle shaped uh

874
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
not circle shaped uh
 

875
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,990
not circle shaped uh
it's pretty cool man

876
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000

 

877
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,390

so if you wanted to keep it symmetrical

878
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
so if you wanted to keep it symmetrical
 

879
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,669
so if you wanted to keep it symmetrical
you would

880
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
you would
 

881
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,350
you would
do an odd odd number like this

882
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,360
do an odd odd number like this
 

883
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,950
do an odd odd number like this
they can share share blocks with each

884
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:28,960
they can share share blocks with each
 

885
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,230
they can share share blocks with each
other

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,750
other
obviously though the best way of doing

888
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
obviously though the best way of doing
 

889
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,350
obviously though the best way of doing
it is just to do

890
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
it is just to do
 

891
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,510
it is just to do
a two by two thing of beacons and just

892
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:35,520
a two by two thing of beacons and just
 

893
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,350
a two by two thing of beacons and just
forget one of the traits

894
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
forget one of the traits
 

895
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,950
forget one of the traits
probably strength you don't really need

896
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
probably strength you don't really need
 

897
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,710
probably strength you don't really need
strength

898
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720

 

899
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,510

but like on on the minecraft server my

900
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
but like on on the minecraft server my
 

901
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,350
but like on on the minecraft server my
my room is 75

902
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
my room is 75
 

903
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,590
my room is 75
in diameter so this is perfect if i had

904
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:49,600
in diameter so this is perfect if i had
 

905
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,549
in diameter so this is perfect if i had
in the center

906
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:52,559

 

907
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,430

um i would probably do it like this

908
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
um i would probably do it like this
 

909
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,950
um i would probably do it like this
another option would be to hide it

910
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
another option would be to hide it
 

911
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,630
another option would be to hide it
hide them in the walls so you couldn't

912
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:58,640
hide them in the walls so you couldn't
 

913
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,789
hide them in the walls so you couldn't
even see them and that could be pretty

914
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
even see them and that could be pretty
 

915
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,390
even see them and that could be pretty
cool too

916
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
cool too
 

917
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,390
cool too
like behind walls

918
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,400

 

919
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,950

and i tried like getting a better pick

920
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
and i tried like getting a better pick
 

921
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,310
and i tried like getting a better pick
to see if it would still

922
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
to see if it would still
 

923
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,590
to see if it would still
get the effects of the haste

924
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
get the effects of the haste
 

925
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,270
get the effects of the haste
and and none of the attributes are

926
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,280
and and none of the attributes are
 

927
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,110
and and none of the attributes are
improved like they're all still level

928
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,120
improved like they're all still level
 

929
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,830
improved like they're all still level
one speed

930
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
one speed
 

931
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,270
one speed
level one haste even though it says

932
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,280
level one haste even though it says
 

933
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,430
level one haste even though it says
level two on the beacon

934
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
level two on the beacon
 

935
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,669
level two on the beacon
it seems to be level one where is it

936
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679
it seems to be level one where is it
 

937
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,990
it seems to be level one where is it
there it says haste two but i think it's

938
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,000
there it says haste two but i think it's
 

939
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,549
there it says haste two but i think it's
really only haste one

940
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
really only haste one
 

941
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,630
really only haste one
strength jump boost jump boost only lets

942
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,640
strength jump boost jump boost only lets
 

943
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,149
strength jump boost jump boost only lets
you jump

944
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
you jump
 

945
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,470
you jump
uh an extra half block in height like

946
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,480
uh an extra half block in height like
 

947
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,470
uh an extra half block in height like
you can't even jump two blocks

948
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,480
you can't even jump two blocks
 

949
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,190
you can't even jump two blocks
it's kinda sad but you jump one and a

950
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
it's kinda sad but you jump one and a
 

951
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,710
it's kinda sad but you jump one and a
half at least

952
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,720

 

953
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,390

and what else yeah i'll show you this

954
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400

 

955
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,789

that's the speed with the efficiency 4

956
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:52,799
that's the speed with the efficiency 4
 

957
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,350
that's the speed with the efficiency 4
and haste one

958
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
and haste one
 

959
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,870
and haste one
it is quicker than than without it

960
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:00,880

 

961
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,270

that is for sure let's let's go over

962
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
that is for sure let's let's go over
 

963
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,950
that is for sure let's let's go over
here i'll show you

964
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,960
here i'll show you
 

965
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,669
here i'll show you
should wear off around here it's pretty

966
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:11,679
should wear off around here it's pretty
 

967
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,190
should wear off around here it's pretty
good range

968
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
good range
 

969
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,789
good range
but it would take a lot of iron in that

970
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799
but it would take a lot of iron in that
 

971
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:24,549
but it would take a lot of iron in that
oh i'm floating

972
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:24,559

 

973
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,549

wait a minute maybe it's not that much

974
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:28,559
wait a minute maybe it's not that much
 

975
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,830
wait a minute maybe it's not that much
faster that seems

976
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:29,840
faster that seems
 

977
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,789
faster that seems
pretty similar

978
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:34,799

 

979
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,870

it's hard to say it's not it's not as

980
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
it's hard to say it's not it's not as
 

981
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,149
it's hard to say it's not it's not as
noticeable as i would have liked

982
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:40,159
noticeable as i would have liked
 

983
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,470
noticeable as i would have liked
you notice it more with an unenchanted

984
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
you notice it more with an unenchanted
 

985
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,950
you notice it more with an unenchanted
pick i would say

986
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:44,960
pick i would say
 

987
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,070
pick i would say
okay let's try it again

988
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
okay let's try it again
 

989
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,350
okay let's try it again
yeah you know what i think that's the

990
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
yeah you know what i think that's the
 

991
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,669
yeah you know what i think that's the
same speed

992
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679
same speed
 

993
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,950
same speed
um that's disappointing

994
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:58,960

 

995
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,590

oh well anyway uh the main the main

996
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:01,600
oh well anyway uh the main the main
 

997
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,310
oh well anyway uh the main the main
effect i like is the speed one

998
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320
effect i like is the speed one
 

999
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,070
effect i like is the speed one
um it would have been cool if haste was

1000
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,080
um it would have been cool if haste was
 

1001
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,590
um it would have been cool if haste was
better but

1002
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600
better but
 

1003
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,909
better but
it is what it is

1004
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919

 

1005
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,789

uh huh all right we're back in lp world

1006
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
uh huh all right we're back in lp world
 

1007
