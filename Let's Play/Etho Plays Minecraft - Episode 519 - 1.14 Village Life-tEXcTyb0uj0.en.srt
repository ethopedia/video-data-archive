which is weird because I feel like

162
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:49,199
which is weird because I feel like
 

163
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,960
which is weird because I feel like
they're gonna change that again in the

164
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:50,970
they're gonna change that again in the
 

165
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,110
they're gonna change that again in the
future like this is the easy fix just

166
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,120
future like this is the easy fix just
 

167
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,409
future like this is the easy fix just
doing that well I know in a future patch

168
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:57,419
doing that well I know in a future patch
 

169
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,089
doing that well I know in a future patch
that's not gonna work right well

170
00:03:59,089 --> 00:03:59,099
that's not gonna work right well
 

171
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,189
that's not gonna work right well

laggy there's something wrong with the
 

197
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,420
laggy there's something wrong with the

don't look better than the Pistons for

204
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,560
don't look better than the Pistons for
 

205
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,710
don't look better than the Pistons for
sure well I'll probably try to do is

206
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:57,720
sure well I'll probably try to do is
 

207
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,060
sure well I'll probably try to do is
hide some lighting and the leaves above

208
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,070
hide some lighting and the leaves above
 

209
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,070
hide some lighting and the leaves above
and then get rid of get rid of all these

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,080
and then get rid of get rid of all these
 

211
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,900
and then get rid of get rid of all these
on on the ground but this is just the

on on the ground but this is just the
 

213
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,290
on on the ground but this is just the
fix for today so we don't get overrun by

214
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:05,300
fix for today so we don't get overrun by
 

215
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,140
fix for today so we don't get overrun by
creepers and stuff in here yeah we got

think the cats they stand up like when
 

229
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,680
think the cats they stand up like when
you get attacked and then they go places

230
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:33,690
you get attacked and then they go places
 

231
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,420
you get attacked and then they go places
you don't want them to go like on on the

232
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,430
you don't want them to go like on on the
 

233
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,760
you don't want them to go like on on the
pressure plates okay we got a dark spot

234
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:37,770
pressure plates okay we got a dark spot
 

235
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,839
pressure plates okay we got a dark spot
up here I started making a list as well

236
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:41,849
up here I started making a list as well
 

237
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:43,550
up here I started making a list as well
by the way so if we decide to mix the

238
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:43,560
by the way so if we decide to mix the
 

239
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,589
by the way so if we decide to mix the
two texture packs together these are the

240
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:45,599
two texture packs together these are the
 

241
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,570
two texture packs together these are the
ugly blocks that we'll probably want to

242
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:47,580
ugly blocks that we'll probably want to
 

243
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,600
ugly blocks that we'll probably want to
replace in my opinion but I want to see

244
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:50,610
replace in my opinion but I want to see
 

245
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,029
replace in my opinion but I want to see
what you guys say about the whole idea

246
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:52,039
what you guys say about the whole idea
 

247
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:58,100
what you guys say about the whole idea
before we do anything let's actually

248
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,110
before we do anything let's actually
 

249
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,180
before we do anything let's actually
check out the ugly brick thing how does

250
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,190
check out the ugly brick thing how does
 

251
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,250
check out the ugly brick thing how does
brick look in this texture pack ooh nice

252
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:07,260
brick look in this texture pack ooh nice
 

253
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,480
brick look in this texture pack ooh nice
thing about this is we're eating free

254
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,490
thing about this is we're eating free
 

255
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:17,320
thing about this is we're eating free
Pistons you know the ugly brick thing

256
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:17,330
Pistons you know the ugly brick thing
 

257
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,629
Pistons you know the ugly brick thing
did it think you could get worse but I

258
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
did it think you could get worse but I
 

259
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,480
did it think you could get worse but I
think it got worse we might we might be

260
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,490
think it got worse we might we might be
 

261
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,230
think it got worse we might we might be
adding a bricks to the list here

262
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
adding a bricks to the list here
 

263
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,629
adding a bricks to the list here
yeah this is nice too by the way they

264
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:29,639
yeah this is nice too by the way they
 

265
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,100
yeah this is nice too by the way they
change books so now you can actually

266
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,110
change books so now you can actually
 

267
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,529
change books so now you can actually
like you have a cursory you move around

268
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:33,539
like you have a cursory you move around
 

269
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:34,399
like you have a cursory you move around
and edit

270
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:34,409
and edit
 

271
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,320
and edit
instead of only being able to edit the

272
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,330
instead of only being able to edit the
 

273
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,089
instead of only being able to edit the
into the page which was super annoying

274
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:38,099
into the page which was super annoying
 

275
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:39,800
into the page which was super annoying
before if you ever had to change

276
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:39,810
before if you ever had to change
 

277
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,249
before if you ever had to change
something in your book oh yeah there's a

278
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:43,259
something in your book oh yeah there's a
 

279
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,510
something in your book oh yeah there's a
piston yeah this was always a dark spot

280
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
piston yeah this was always a dark spot
 

281
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,920
piston yeah this was always a dark spot
in the cave like right over here I never

282
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:48,930
in the cave like right over here I never
 

283
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,959
in the cave like right over here I never
could figure out a way to hide lighting

284
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:50,969
could figure out a way to hide lighting
 

285
00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:54,770
could figure out a way to hide lighting
that reached up to that point also with

286
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:54,780
that reached up to that point also with
 

287
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,439
that reached up to that point also with
the slabs it looks like they do let

288
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:57,449
the slabs it looks like they do let
 

289
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,529
the slabs it looks like they do let
light through if it makes sense like if

290
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:00,539
light through if it makes sense like if
 

291
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,119
light through if it makes sense like if
we have that little gap there then it

292
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:02,129
we have that little gap there then it
 

293
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,450
we have that little gap there then it
lets light through through the half slab

294
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:05,460
lets light through through the half slab
 

295
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,520
lets light through through the half slab
area which is pretty cool that's a nice

296
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:07,530
area which is pretty cool that's a nice
 

297
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,040
area which is pretty cool that's a nice
way of doing it all right it's very good

298
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,050
way of doing it all right it's very good
 

299
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,959
way of doing it all right it's very good
very good so we lit up most of the cave

300
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:11,969
very good so we lit up most of the cave
 

301
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:14,059
very good so we lit up most of the cave
now you have adverted disaster and we

302
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:14,069
now you have adverted disaster and we
 

303
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:15,619
now you have adverted disaster and we
can get to some of the some of the fun

304
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:15,629
can get to some of the some of the fun
 

305
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:18,170
can get to some of the some of the fun
stuff I did decide to add melons to the

306
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:18,180
stuff I did decide to add melons to the
 

307
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,920
stuff I did decide to add melons to the
list as well

308
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:18,930
list as well
 

309
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,990
list as well
I don't know that yellow is not it's not

310
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't know that yellow is not it's not
 

311
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,350
I don't know that yellow is not it's not
doing it for me it's pretty stripey

312
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
doing it for me it's pretty stripey
 

313
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,790
doing it for me it's pretty stripey
so I decided to add those and I think

314
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:25,800
so I decided to add those and I think
 

315
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,200
so I decided to add those and I think
that where we might want to change the

316
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,210
that where we might want to change the
 

317
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,129
that where we might want to change the
bark like if we do a mixed pack this new

318
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:31,139
bark like if we do a mixed pack this new
 

319

Brown I don't think it's that bad

482
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:19,260

things where I think we don't like
 

487
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:27,470
things where I think we don't like
change our initial reaction to change is

488
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:27,480
change our initial reaction to change is
 

489
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,360
change our initial reaction to change is
always like oh I don't like that why

490
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,370

492
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:30,779
don't you just keep the way it was
 

493
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,440
don't you just keep the way it was
originally but after a while of using

494
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,450
originally but after a while of using
 

495
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,090
originally but after a while of using
something you get used to it and then

496
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:35,100
something you get used to it and then
 

497
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,579
something you get used to it and then
you're kind of like I guess this this

498
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:37,589
you're kind of like I guess this this
 

499
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:38,840
you're kind of like I guess this this
new thing was actually better than the

500
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:38,850
new thing was actually better than the
 

501
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,389
new thing was actually better than the
old I kind of think it's like that with

502
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:41,399
old I kind of think it's like that with
 

503
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,269
old I kind of think it's like that with
some of these things like it's really

504
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:44,279
some of these things like it's really
 

505
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,130
some of these things like it's really
jarring looking at this right now but I

506
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:46,140
jarring looking at this right now but I
 

507
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,960
jarring looking at this right now but I
think we could get used to it and maybe

508
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:47,970
think we could get used to it and maybe
 

509
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,610
think we could get used to it and maybe
even liked it more because I've always

510
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:49,620
even liked it more because I've always
 

511
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,870
even liked it more because I've always
wished sandstone was a bit more Brown

512
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
wished sandstone was a bit more Brown
 

513
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,740
wished sandstone was a bit more Brown

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,400
mentioning in this update I think
they've made some major performance

520
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:04,410
they've made some major performance
 

521
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,850
they've made some major performance
improvements like a lie a lot of times

522
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:07,860
improvements like a lie a lot of times

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,019
improvements like a lie a lot of times
when you guys see my frame rate you're

524
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:09,029
when you guys see my frame rate you're
 

525
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,449
when you guys see my frame rate you're
like wow itto get an upgrade already but

526
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:11,459
like wow itto get an upgrade already but
 

527
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,730
like wow itto get an upgrade already but
honestly it's the manty the mancave is

528
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:13,740
honestly it's the manty the mancave is
 

529
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,360
honestly it's the manty the mancave is
extremely laggy for anybody if you were

530
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,370
extremely laggy for anybody if you were
 

531
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,829
extremely laggy for anybody if you were
to load up my world and you'd go to the

532
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:18,839
to load up my world and you'd go to the
 

533
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,300
to load up my world and you'd go to the
man cave you'd be like what is going on

534
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:20,310
man cave you'd be like what is going on
 

535
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,300
man cave you'd be like what is going on
in here it's it's pretty bad but with

536
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,310
in here it's it's pretty bad but with
 

537
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,689
in here it's it's pretty bad but with
this updates like normally it goes down

538
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:26,699
this updates like normally it goes down
 

539
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:28,550
this updates like normally it goes down
to maybe 30 FPS if you look at the top

540
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
to maybe 30 FPS if you look at the top
 

541
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,069
to maybe 30 FPS if you look at the top
left there where it's 60 65 it jumped up

542
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:31,079
left there where it's 60 65 it jumped up
 

543
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,699
left there where it's 60 65 it jumped up
to 90 it kind of goes by 30 or intervals

544
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:34,709
to 90 it kind of goes by 30 or intervals
 

545
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:36,650
to 90 it kind of goes by 30 or intervals
so if you can do 90 plus it'll go up to

546
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:36,660
so if you can do 90 plus it'll go up to
 

547
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,939
so if you can do 90 plus it'll go up to
90 if it's 60 plus it'll it'll go to 60

548
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:40,949
90 if it's 60 plus it'll it'll go to 60
 

549
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:41,569
90 if it's 60 plus it'll it'll go to 60
kind of thing

550
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:41,579
kind of thing
 

551
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,870
kind of thing
so normally we're getting around like 60

552
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
so normally we're getting around like 60
 

553
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,579
so normally we're getting around like 60
over here probably and we're getting 90

554
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:46,589
over here probably and we're getting 90
 

555
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:50,180
over here probably and we're getting 90
now so that's pretty major things are

556
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,190
now so that's pretty major things are
 

557
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,389
now so that's pretty major things are
loading a lot quicker like when you when

558
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:53,399
loading a lot quicker like when you when
 

559
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,949
loading a lot quicker like when you when
you change resource packs and stuff that

560
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
you change resource packs and stuff that
 

561
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,560
you change resource packs and stuff that
happens so much faster if you exit the

562
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:57,570
happens so much faster if you exit the
 

563
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,380
happens so much faster if you exit the
game and stuff that happens quicker one

564
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:00,390
game and stuff that happens quicker one
 

565
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,970
game and stuff that happens quicker one
thing I did notice though while flying

566
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:01,980
thing I did notice though while flying
 

567
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,540
thing I did notice though while flying
around

568
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:02,550
around
 

569
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,100
around
I don't think slowed faster I think

570
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,110
I don't think slowed faster I think
 

571
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,850
I don't think slowed faster I think
they're slower for whatever reason like

572
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:07,860
they're slower for whatever reason like
 

573
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,600
they're slower for whatever reason like
we're getting a lot of invisible chunks

574
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:10,610
we're getting a lot of invisible chunks
 

575
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,710
we're getting a lot of invisible chunks
normally this was able to keep up like

576
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
normally this was able to keep up like
 

577
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,199
normally this was able to keep up like
in the last update everything would kind

578
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:15,209
in the last update everything would kind
 

579
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:16,770
in the last update everything would kind
of load as you go

580
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:16,780
of load as you go
 

581
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,560
of load as you go
so hopefully that gets taken care of in

582
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:19,570
so hopefully that gets taken care of in
 

583
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,690
so hopefully that gets taken care of in
future minor patches but anyways guys I

584
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:24,700
future minor patches but anyways guys I
 

585
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,640
future minor patches but anyways guys I
think we're gonna go do some exploring

586
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:26,650
think we're gonna go do some exploring
 

587
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,800
think we're gonna go do some exploring
now so we're actually twelve thousand

588
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:28,810
now so we're actually twelve thousand
 

589
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,960
now so we're actually twelve thousand
thirteen thousand blocks out now in

590
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:30,970
thirteen thousand blocks out now in
 

591
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,690
thirteen thousand blocks out now in
brand-new terrain and we're gonna start

592
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:33,700
brand-new terrain and we're gonna start
 

593
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,810
brand-new terrain and we're gonna start
looking for some of the new features

594
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:35,820
looking for some of the new features
 

595
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,930
looking for some of the new features

hurt a lot I think yeah we took half a
 

641
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,770
hurt a lot I think yeah we took half a
heart that's it doesn't hurt as much as

heart that's it doesn't hurt as much as
I thought

644
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,260

00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:51,579
just
transform because he's got an eyepatch

1414
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:51,589
transform because he's got an eyepatch
 

1415
00:32:51,589 --> 00:32:54,099
transform because he's got an eyepatch
and stuff now anyways guys I think we're

1416
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:54,109
and stuff now anyways guys I think we're
 

1417
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:55,869
and stuff now anyways guys I think we're
gonna have to wrap up our episode here

1418
00:32:55,869 --> 00:32:55,879
gonna have to wrap up our episode here
 

1419
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:58,389
gonna have to wrap up our episode here
for today and next time we'll spend a

1420
00:32:58,389 --> 00:32:58,399
for today and next time we'll spend a
 

1421
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,889
for today and next time we'll spend a
little bit more time in this village and

1422
00:32:59,889 --> 00:32:59,899
little bit more time in this village and
 

1423
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:01,239
little bit more time in this village and
then will trigger the raid and probably

1424
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:01,249
then will trigger the raid and probably
 

1425
00:33:01,249 --> 00:33:02,589
then will trigger the raid and probably
head back and start doing some more

1426
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:02,599
head back and start doing some more
 

1427
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:04,779
head back and start doing some more
technical things with the new updates or

1428
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:04,789
technical things with the new updates or
 

1429
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:07,959
technical things with the new updates or
checking out new contents but I thought

1430
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:07,969
checking out new contents but I thought
 

1431
00:33:07,969 --> 00:33:09,639
checking out new contents but I thought
this would be a fun little goofy thing

1432
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:09,649
this would be a fun little goofy thing
 

1433
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:11,199
this would be a fun little goofy thing
because I kind of I'm kind of curious

1434
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:11,209
because I kind of I'm kind of curious
 

1435
00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:12,669
because I kind of I'm kind of curious
like how hard it is to start up a

1436
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:12,679
like how hard it is to start up a
 

1437
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:15,190
like how hard it is to start up a
village now that it's changed then with

1438
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,200
village now that it's changed then with
 

1439
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,849
village now that it's changed then with
the new system yeah anyways let's get to

1440
00:33:18,849 --> 00:33:18,859
the new system yeah anyways let's get to
 

1441
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:20,169
the new system yeah anyways let's get to
it here so the comment of the day it

1442
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:20,179
it here so the comment of the day it
 

1443
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:22,719
it here so the comment of the day it
says etho have you ever needed to know

1444
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:22,729
says etho have you ever needed to know
 

1445
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:25,119
says etho have you ever needed to know
something about your own base and

1446
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:25,129
something about your own base and
 

1447
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:26,709
something about your own base and
instead of checking it directly in

1448
00:33:26,709 --> 00:33:26,719
instead of checking it directly in
 

1449
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:29,859
instead of checking it directly in
Minecraft you Google it's let's say you

1450
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:29,869
Minecraft you Google it's let's say you
 

1451
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,719
Minecraft you Google it's let's say you
are doing redstone in a very cramped

1452
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:31,729
are doing redstone in a very cramped
 

1453
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:33,699
are doing redstone in a very cramped
space and you need to remember how you

1454
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:33,709
space and you need to remember how you
 

1455
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:36,699
space and you need to remember how you
did certain circuits in another part of

1456
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:36,709
did certain circuits in another part of
 

1457
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:39,099
did certain circuits in another part of
your base so you just google it instead

1458
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:39,109
your base so you just google it instead
 

1459
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:40,989
your base so you just google it instead
of go and check it for yourself

1460
00:33:40,989 --> 00:33:40,999
of go and check it for yourself
 

1461
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:43,869
of go and check it for yourself
haha I have actually done that a few

1462
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:43,879
haha I have actually done that a few
 

1463
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:45,069
haha I have actually done that a few
times like I'll check the video

1464
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:45,079
times like I'll check the video
 

1465
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,810
times like I'll check the video
especially for coordinates and stuff

1466
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:46,820
especially for coordinates and stuff
 

1467
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,680
especially for coordinates and stuff
sometimes

1468
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:47,690
sometimes
 

1469
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,959
sometimes
I'll have no idea and I'll remember I

1470
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:49,969
I'll have no idea and I'll remember I
 

1471
00:33:49,969 --> 00:33:52,029
I'll have no idea and I'll remember I
showed it in a video in the past or

1472
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:52,039
showed it in a video in the past or
 

1473
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:52,690
showed it in a video in the past or
something and all

1474
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:52,700
something and all
 

1475
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,879
something and all
I'll get the coordinates that way uh

1476
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:54,889
I'll get the coordinates that way uh
 

1477
00:33:54,889 --> 00:33:57,219
I'll get the coordinates that way uh
generally though if I want to see how

1478
00:33:57,219 --> 00:33:57,229
generally though if I want to see how
 

1479
00:33:57,229 --> 00:33:59,379
generally though if I want to see how
something is built it's a lot easier to

1480
00:33:59,379 --> 00:33:59,389
something is built it's a lot easier to
 

1481
00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:01,949
something is built it's a lot easier to
do it in the world than to see the video

1482
00:34:01,949 --> 00:34:01,959
do it in the world than to see the video
 

1483
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:04,989
do it in the world than to see the video
which is unfortunate for you guys so

1484
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:04,999
which is unfortunate for you guys so
 

1485
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:07,479
which is unfortunate for you guys so
what I do we're getting out of your

1486
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:07,489
what I do we're getting out of your
 

1487
00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:10,269

villager talk to you later I'm actually

1488
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:10,279
villager talk to you later I'm actually
 

1489
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:12,639
villager talk to you later I'm actually
surprised I've shown this before several

1490
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:12,649
surprised I've shown this before several
 

1491
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:13,990
surprised I've shown this before several
times and none of you have asked about

1492
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,000
times and none of you have asked about
 

1493
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,690
times and none of you have asked about
this world this is the world I've had

1494
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:16,700
this world this is the world I've had
 

1495
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:22,720
this world this is the world I've had
for a very long time so this is planning

1496
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:22,730
for a very long time so this is planning
 

1497
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,720
for a very long time so this is planning
LP okay it's different from our regular

1498
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:25,730
LP okay it's different from our regular
 

1499
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,919
LP okay it's different from our regular
LP it's basically our LP world copied a

1500
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:29,929
LP it's basically our LP world copied a
 

1501
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:32,919
LP it's basically our LP world copied a
long time ago and I've just been using

1502
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:32,929
long time ago and I've just been using
 

1503
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,960
long time ago and I've just been using
it as like a creative worlds and every

1504
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:34,970
it as like a creative worlds and every
 

1505
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,319
it as like a creative worlds and every
now and then like it's way behind our

1506
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:38,329
now and then like it's way behind our
 

1507
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:43,059
now and then like it's way behind our
current LP world bye bye probably two

1508
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:43,069
current LP world bye bye probably two
 

1509
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:46,809
current LP world bye bye probably two
three years at least I think but like

1510
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:46,819
three years at least I think but like
 

1511
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:49,809
three years at least I think but like
whenever I have an idea for a project or

1512
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:49,819
whenever I have an idea for a project or
 

1513
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:51,369
whenever I have an idea for a project or
something usually I do the creative work

1514
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:51,379
something usually I do the creative work
 

1515
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:53,039
something usually I do the creative work
in here and I'll just do like a little

1516
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:53,049
in here and I'll just do like a little
 

1517
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,649
in here and I'll just do like a little
whatever there's lots of little random

1518
00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:55,659
whatever there's lots of little random
 

1519
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:58,420
whatever there's lots of little random
garbage gizmos all over the place that

1520
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:58,430
garbage gizmos all over the place that
 

1521
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,890
garbage gizmos all over the place that
don't really do anything you can see the

1522
00:34:59,890 --> 00:34:59,900
don't really do anything you can see the
 

1523
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,780
don't really do anything you can see the
start of our

1524
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:02,790

 

1525
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,570

mastermind game here and some of the the

1526
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:06,580
mastermind game here and some of the the
 

1527
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,340
mastermind game here and some of the the
technical things like I'll go into this

1528
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:08,350
technical things like I'll go into this
 

1529
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,480
technical things like I'll go into this
world and work it out because the

1530
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:09,490
world and work it out because the
 

1531
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,070
world and work it out because the
redstone is free here and stuff you know

1532
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,080
redstone is free here and stuff you know
 

1533
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,200
redstone is free here and stuff you know
it's easy to to build things when you're

1534
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,210
it's easy to to build things when you're
 

1535
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,870
it's easy to to build things when you're
in creative and then if I ever need to

1536
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:15,880
in creative and then if I ever need to
 

1537
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,460
in creative and then if I ever need to
check something that I've built in the

1538
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:17,470
check something that I've built in the
 

1539
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,290
check something that I've built in the
past I can just go into spectator mode

1540
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:19,300
past I can just go into spectator mode
 

1541
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,110
past I can just go into spectator mode
and like check out something I've made

1542
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:22,120
and like check out something I've made
 

1543
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,810
and like check out something I've made
before but yeah this place is just

1544
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:24,820
before but yeah this place is just
 

1545
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,140
before but yeah this place is just
littered with all kinds of random things

1546
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,150
littered with all kinds of random things
 

1547
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,670
littered with all kinds of random things
some of them that got built some of them

1548
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:29,680
some of them that got built some of them
 

1549
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,880
some of them that got built some of them
that never got built sore that aren't

1550
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:32,890
that never got built sore that aren't
 

1551
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,310
that never got built sore that aren't
really refined in this world there's

1552
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:35,320
really refined in this world there's
 

1553
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,880
really refined in this world there's
lots of lots of crazy gizmos you can see

1554
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:38,890
lots of lots of crazy gizmos you can see
 

1555
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,380
lots of lots of crazy gizmos you can see
I'm having really bad chunk loading

1556
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,390
I'm having really bad chunk loading
 

1557
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:44,700
I'm having really bad chunk loading
issues uh-huh maybe someday maybe

1558
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:44,710
issues uh-huh maybe someday maybe
 

1559
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,090
issues uh-huh maybe someday maybe
someday this will get built I'll just

1560
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:48,100
someday this will get built I'll just
 

1561
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,500
someday this will get built I'll just
goof around with random stuff here I

1562
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:49,510
goof around with random stuff here I
 

1563
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,310
goof around with random stuff here I
think this was part of the Simon Says

1564
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,320
think this was part of the Simon Says
 

1565
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,550
think this was part of the Simon Says

this was an alternate version of the

1568
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:58,990
