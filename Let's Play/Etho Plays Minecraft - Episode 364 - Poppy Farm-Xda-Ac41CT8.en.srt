00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:25,140
I walk you see that oh what is happening
 

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,050
I walk you see that oh what is happening
what is happening the bridge is alive

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,060
what is happening the bridge is alive
 

13
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,030
what is happening the bridge is alive
it's a it just happens when I'm in f5

14
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,040
it's a it just happens when I'm in f5
 

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,130
it's a it just happens when I'm in f5
mode it's like that the glass is

16
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,140
mode it's like that the glass is
 

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,280
mode it's like that the glass is
fighting for draw order or something and

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,290
fighting for draw order or something and
 

19
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,119
fighting for draw order or something and
it changes as I move it's kind of cool

20
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:40,129
it changes as I move it's kind of cool
 

21
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:43,940
it changes as I move it's kind of cool
anyway so I'm still working on this

22
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:43,950
anyway so I'm still working on this
 

23
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,299
anyway so I'm still working on this
thing I let's see what did I do

24
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:47,309
thing I let's see what did I do
 

25
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,900
thing I let's see what did I do
I've added the border all along here

26
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:49,910
I've added the border all along here
 

27
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,760
I've added the border all along here
goes all the way to the Enderman farm

28
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:52,770
goes all the way to the Enderman farm
 

29
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,170
goes all the way to the Enderman farm
and it is deceptively far like you see

30
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:57,180
and it is deceptively far like you see
 

31
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,910
and it is deceptively far like you see
the farm out in the distance there and

32
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:58,920
the farm out in the distance there and
 

33
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,760
the farm out in the distance there and
you walk towards it and it it's like it

34
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:01,770
you walk towards it and it it's like it
 

35
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,439
you walk towards it and it it's like it
doesn't get any closer you just keep

36
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:03,449
doesn't get any closer you just keep
 

37
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,899
doesn't get any closer you just keep
walking and walking and watching and

38
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:05,909
walking and walking and watching and
 

39
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,130
walking and walking and watching and
watching and it's still really far away

40
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:09,140
watching and it's still really far away
 

41
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,990
watching and it's still really far away
so that's a pretty long pretty long path

42
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
so that's a pretty long pretty long path
 

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,990
so that's a pretty long pretty long path
here I just wanted to try a few things

44
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,000
here I just wanted to try a few things
 

45
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,940
here I just wanted to try a few things
with you guys and then I'll finish the

46
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:16,950
with you guys and then I'll finish the
 

47
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,710
with you guys and then I'll finish the
rest of this off-camera but I do like it

48
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:21,720
rest of this off-camera but I do like it
 

49
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,020
rest of this off-camera but I do like it
with the borders on the sides makes me

50
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,030
with the borders on the sides makes me
 

51
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,520
with the borders on the sides makes me
feel a little safer on here too because

52
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:25,530
feel a little safer on here too because
 

53
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,530
feel a little safer on here too because
every now and then Enderman like to

54
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:27,540
every now and then Enderman like to
 

55
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,899
every now and then Enderman like to
teleport into that spot specifically

56
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:29,909
teleport into that spot specifically
 

57
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,319
teleport into that spot specifically
right over there from the island I think

58
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:33,329
right over there from the island I think
 

59
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,260
right over there from the island I think
it has to do with the way they're

60
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:35,270
it has to do with the way they're
 

61
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,179
it has to do with the way they're
teleportation code works there's some

62
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:38,189
teleportation code works there's some
 

63
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,620
teleportation code works there's some
priority to that spot for some reason

64
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:41,630
priority to that spot for some reason
 

65
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,859
priority to that spot for some reason
it's kind of interesting but let's see

66
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:45,869
it's kind of interesting but let's see
 

67
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,270
it's kind of interesting but let's see
what did I want to try I wanted to add

68
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
what did I want to try I wanted to add
 

69
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,240
what did I want to try I wanted to add
some lighting to this glowstone wouldn't

70
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,250
some lighting to this glowstone wouldn't
 

71
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,590
some lighting to this glowstone wouldn't
really work too well with this and

72
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
really work too well with this and
 

73
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,749
really work too well with this and
torches wouldn't work really good but

74
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
torches wouldn't work really good but
 

75
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,149
torches wouldn't work really good but
these sea lanterns are the perfect color

76
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
these sea lanterns are the perfect color
 

77
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,240
these sea lanterns are the perfect color
I think let's just see what they would

78
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,250
I think let's just see what they would
 

79
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,359
I think let's just see what they would
look like as planning on having like

80
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:02,369
look like as planning on having like
 

81
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,590
look like as planning on having like
three of them overtopped every so often

82
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
three of them overtopped every so often
 

83
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,390
three of them overtopped every so often
that is not a seed Lantern there we go

84
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:10,400
that is not a seed Lantern there we go
 

85
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,030
that is not a seed Lantern there we go
maybe like that

86
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
maybe like that
 

87
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,500
maybe like that
because it's really dark in the end I

88
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:15,510
because it's really dark in the end I
 

89
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,559
because it's really dark in the end I
kind of want some light oh yeah and they

90
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:18,569
kind of want some light oh yeah and they
 

91
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:20,240
kind of want some light oh yeah and they
they're animated I forgot that looks

92
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,250
they're animated I forgot that looks
 

93
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,240
they're animated I forgot that looks
cool what else could we do we we should

94
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,250
cool what else could we do we we should
 

95
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:30,410
cool what else could we do we we should
have some way of attaching them to mmm

96
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:30,420
have some way of attaching them to mmm
 

97
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,170
have some way of attaching them to mmm
crafting table there we go here we go

98
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:33,180
crafting table there we go here we go
 

99
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,130
crafting table there we go here we go
this is what we're doing let's try to

100
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,140
this is what we're doing let's try to
 

101
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,420
this is what we're doing let's try to
see what it would look like if we made

102
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,430
see what it would look like if we made
 

103
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:46,580
see what it would look like if we made
it out of panes we had like this is that

104
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:46,590
it out of panes we had like this is that
 

105
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,390
it out of panes we had like this is that
a good idea maybe hmm

106
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:53,400
a good idea maybe hmm
 

107
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,240
a good idea maybe hmm
I'm not sure if I like that all right

108
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,250
I'm not sure if I like that all right
 

109
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,530
I'm not sure if I like that all right
anyway I'll think about I want to do

110
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:57,540
anyway I'll think about I want to do
 

111
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,520
anyway I'll think about I want to do
something like that all the way down

112
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:58,530
something like that all the way down
 

113
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,259
something like that all the way down
maybe like a light every 16 blocks or so

114
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:02,269
maybe like a light every 16 blocks or so
 

115
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:05,569
maybe like a light every 16 blocks or so
so I'm going to be adding the water

116
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:05,579
so I'm going to be adding the water
 

117
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:07,490
so I'm going to be adding the water
stream here I don't like having the

118
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:07,500
stream here I don't like having the
 

119
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,179
stream here I don't like having the
second line of glass like this one here

120
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:11,189
second line of glass like this one here
 

121
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,099
second line of glass like this one here
so I'm gonna try to do it without that

122
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:13,109
so I'm gonna try to do it without that
 

123
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,990
so I'm gonna try to do it without that
and we have to do some trickery with the

124
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,000
and we have to do some trickery with the
 

125
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,309
and we have to do some trickery with the
water if we want to do it that way well

126
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:19,319
water if we want to do it that way well
 

127
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,680
water if we want to do it that way well
spooky sound okay here is here's what we

128
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:21,690
spooky sound okay here is here's what we
 

129
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,689
spooky sound okay here is here's what we
got to do I think we got to place a line

130
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:23,699
got to do I think we got to place a line
 

131
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,650
got to do I think we got to place a line
of blocks next to this ice level three

132
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:27,660
of blocks next to this ice level three
 

133
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,960
of blocks next to this ice level three
four five six seven eight

134
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:29,970
four five six seven eight
 

135
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,270
four five six seven eight
build that up one so it'll hold the

136
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,280
build that up one so it'll hold the
 

137
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,860
build that up one so it'll hold the
water end place the water good and then

138
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:39,870
water end place the water good and then
 

139
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,140
water end place the water good and then
we have to be really tricky here we have

140
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,150
we have to be really tricky here we have
 

141
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,379
we have to be really tricky here we have
to play around the way water updates so

142
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:45,389
to play around the way water updates so
 

143
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:48,740
to play around the way water updates so
I forget rid of this unfortunately a lot

144
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:48,750
I forget rid of this unfortunately a lot
 

145
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,569
I forget rid of this unfortunately a lot
of this ice is gonna go to waste though

146
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:50,579
of this ice is gonna go to waste though
 

147
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,250
of this ice is gonna go to waste though
because I shouldn't have placed it

148
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:52,260
because I shouldn't have placed it
 

149
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,670
because I shouldn't have placed it
already then I think we're free to

150
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
already then I think we're free to
 

151
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,580
already then I think we're free to
remove this because the water's gonna

152
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:58,590
remove this because the water's gonna
 

153
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,589
remove this because the water's gonna
get priority to flowing downward there

154
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:00,599
get priority to flowing downward there
 

155
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,809
get priority to flowing downward there
or it's gonna try to to float towards

156
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:02,819
or it's gonna try to to float towards
 

157
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,699
or it's gonna try to to float towards
those holes I just made and like this

158
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:07,709
those holes I just made and like this
 

159
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,979
those holes I just made and like this
block here it sees this hole over here

160
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:09,989
block here it sees this hole over here
 

161
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:11,869
block here it sees this hole over here
so that is closer than if it was to try

162
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:11,879
so that is closer than if it was to try
 

163
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,780
so that is closer than if it was to try
to flow over the edge this way and then

164
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:14,790
to flow over the edge this way and then
 

165
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,120
to flow over the edge this way and then
if we put that there it's again this

166
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,130
if we put that there it's again this
 

167
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,310
if we put that there it's again this
hole over here is closer than the edge

168
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:19,320
hole over here is closer than the edge
 

169
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,610
hole over here is closer than the edge
so it doesn't it doesn't flow that way

170
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:22,620
so it doesn't it doesn't flow that way
 

171
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,580
so it doesn't it doesn't flow that way
and it does that all the way along if we

172
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:26,590
and it does that all the way along if we
 

173
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,640
and it does that all the way along if we
add it that way okay and then we're free

174
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:29,650
add it that way okay and then we're free
 

175
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:36,060
add it that way okay and then we're free
to remove this cool and yeah that's

176
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,070
to remove this cool and yeah that's
 

177

215
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,180
this stuff okay go over here I'm adding
in an ejector thing for the ender pearls

216
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,190
in an ejector thing for the ender pearls
 

217
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,940
in an ejector thing for the ender pearls
and I wash it away some of my redstone

218
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:01,950
and I wash it away some of my redstone
 

219
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,159

let's see places oh I can't cuz of the

220
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:05,169
let's see places oh I can't cuz of the
 

221
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,159
let's see places oh I can't cuz of the
hopper here do I dare waste the hopper

222
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:08,169
hopper here do I dare waste the hopper
 

223
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,430
hopper here do I dare waste the hopper
here I think I do is this way easier if

excellent that is going back here I just
 

239
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,320
excellent that is going back here I just
have one more water stream to add oh

240
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,330

 

241
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,390

yeah we are done in the end guys the

242
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:49,400
yeah we are done in the end guys the
 

243
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,270
yeah we are done in the end guys the
project is done you can go do something

244
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:52,280
project is done you can go do something
 

245
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,850

else finally this started out as a

246
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:54,860
else finally this started out as a
 

247
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,500
else finally this started out as a
simple idea it's like oh I'm just gonna

248
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:56,510
simple idea it's like oh I'm just gonna
 

249
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,540
simple idea it's like oh I'm just gonna
add a water stream next to the path and

250
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:58,550
add a water stream next to the path and
 

251
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,400
add a water stream next to the path and
I'll be able to transport enderpearls

252
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,410
I'll be able to transport enderpearls
 

253
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,490
I'll be able to transport enderpearls
really easily six to eight hours later

254
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:03,500
really easily six to eight hours later
 

255
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,710
really easily six to eight hours later
we are done it's a big project actually

256
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:07,720
we are done it's a big project actually
 

257
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,880
we are done it's a big project actually
but it looks cool it's gonna be really

258
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:09,890
but it looks cool it's gonna be really
 

259
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,400
but it looks cool it's gonna be really
useful so to get you up to speed

260
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:12,410
useful so to get you up to speed
 

261
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,520
useful so to get you up to speed
Casey missed last episode the idea is we

262
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:15,530
Casey missed last episode the idea is we
 

263
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:22,290
Casey missed last episode the idea is we
are going to get our enderpearls I've I

264
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:22,300
are going to get our enderpearls I've I
 

265
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,280
are going to get our enderpearls I've I
use enderpearls all the time right and I

266
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,290
use enderpearls all the time right and I
 

267
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,110
use enderpearls all the time right and I
keep running out and I have to come here

268
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
keep running out and I have to come here
 

269
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,659
keep running out and I have to come here
and transport them manually and it's a

270
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:31,669
and transport them manually and it's a
 

271
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,800
and transport them manually and it's a
real pain so now we have sort of an

272
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:35,810
real pain so now we have sort of an
 

273
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,870
real pain so now we have sort of an
automated system of getting enderpearls

274
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:37,880
automated system of getting enderpearls
 

275
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,300
automated system of getting enderpearls
back to our home basically this will

276
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,310
back to our home basically this will
 

277
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,370
back to our home basically this will
shoot them out and the water stream

278
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:45,380
shoot them out and the water stream
 

279
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,779
shoot them out and the water stream
carries them all the way to the end

280
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:49,789
carries them all the way to the end
 

281
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:53,380
carries them all the way to the end
portal those go through the end portal

282
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:53,390
portal those go through the end portal
 

283
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,159
portal those go through the end portal
and end up in a hopper in the overworld

284
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,169
and end up in a hopper in the overworld
 

285
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:59,380
and end up in a hopper in the overworld
right by our man cave so it's really

286
00:07:59,380 --> 00:07:59,390
right by our man cave so it's really
 

287
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,330
right by our man cave so it's really
really cool and hopefully there's no no

288
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:04,340
really cool and hopefully there's no no
 

289
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,159
really cool and hopefully there's no no
problems with this I do actually really

290
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:06,169
problems with this I do actually really
 

291
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,900
problems with this I do actually really
like these lights now now that I got

292
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:07,910
like these lights now now that I got
 

293
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,070
like these lights now now that I got
them all set up I think they're pretty

294
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,080
them all set up I think they're pretty
 

295
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,870
them all set up I think they're pretty
cool look how far this path is like oh

296
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:13,880
cool look how far this path is like oh
 

297
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,040
cool look how far this path is like oh
man I really want to get some beacons or

298
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,050
man I really want to get some beacons or

the other side I'll have a an ice stream

302
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,000
the other side I'll have a an ice stream
 

303
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,170
the other side I'll have a an ice stream
that I can jump in you know where it's

304
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:26,180
that I can jump in you know where it's
 

305
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,900
that I can jump in you know where it's
like you jump on the ice and you move

306
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:28,910
like you jump on the ice and you move
 

307
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,180
like you jump on the ice and you move
really quick type of thing I might do

308
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,190
really quick type of thing I might do
 

309
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,930
really quick type of thing I might do
that just getting around the bend okay

310
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:33,940
that just getting around the bend okay
 

311
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,909
that just getting around the bend okay
yeah it looks good I think they're going

312
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:36,919
yeah it looks good I think they're going
 

313
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,839
yeah it looks good I think they're going
up the item elevator okay yeah I some go

314
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:40,849
up the item elevator okay yeah I some go
 

315
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:45,519
up the item elevator okay yeah I some go
up good so I think we're good here

316

flower farm we are going to be building

388
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,050

 

389
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,460

see how to explain it to explain it it

390
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:00,470
see how to explain it to explain it it
 

391
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,190
see how to explain it to explain it it
so we built that flower farm in the

392
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,200
so we built that flower farm in the
 

393
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,590
so we built that flower farm in the
amplified terrain recently right I tried

394
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:06,600
amplified terrain recently right I tried
 

395
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,580
amplified terrain recently right I tried
to make it so we could get poppies but

396
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:09,590
to make it so we could get poppies but
 

397
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,960
to make it so we could get poppies but
really we weren't getting many poppies

398
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:11,970
really we weren't getting many poppies
 

399
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,200
really we weren't getting many poppies
from it so we are missing that type of

400
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,210
from it so we are missing that type of
 

401
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,720
from it so we are missing that type of
flower from our collection so I am

402
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:17,730
flower from our collection so I am
 

403
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,640
flower from our collection so I am
building a puppy farm here and my plan

404
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:22,650
building a puppy farm here and my plan
 

405
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,390
building a puppy farm here and my plan
on how to do that is to build like a sky

406
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:26,400
on how to do that is to build like a sky
 

407
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,720
on how to do that is to build like a sky
village with at least ten villagers in

408
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:29,730
village with at least ten villagers in
 

409
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,060
village with at least ten villagers in
it and we're gonna make a trap in the

410
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,070
it and we're gonna make a trap in the
 

411
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,220
it and we're gonna make a trap in the
middle and every now and then it should

412
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,230
middle and every now and then it should
 

413
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,310
middle and every now and then it should
spawn iron golems that will will fall

414
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
spawn iron golems that will will fall
 

415
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,160
spawn iron golems that will will fall
down and then we can kill them and get

416
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,170
down and then we can kill them and get
 

417
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,720
down and then we can kill them and get
their poppies yeah and I'm not gonna go

418
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:47,730
their poppies yeah and I'm not gonna go
 

419
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,190
their poppies yeah and I'm not gonna go
into too much detail about the build

420
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
into too much detail about the build
 

421
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,560
into too much detail about the build
here because this isn't really this

422
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:51,570
here because this isn't really this
 

423
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,490
here because this isn't really this
isn't my design at all I'm copying

424
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:54,500
isn't my design at all I'm copying
 

425
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,320
isn't my design at all I'm copying
documents that Oreo lots of people that

426
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,330
documents that Oreo lots of people that
 

427
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:03,170
documents that Oreo lots of people that
have made these types of farms and yeah

428
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:03,180
have made these types of farms and yeah
 

429
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,670
have made these types of farms and yeah
I'm not the best guy to explain them so

430
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:04,680
I'm not the best guy to explain them so
 

431
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,960
I'm not the best guy to explain them so
I'm just gonna go ahead and build it

432
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:05,970
I'm just gonna go ahead and build it
 

433
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,560
I'm just gonna go ahead and build it
here and maybe I'll give you a few more

434
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:09,570
here and maybe I'll give you a few more
 

435
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:14,600
here and maybe I'll give you a few more
details as we go here ah you know what

436
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:14,610
details as we go here ah you know what
 

437
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,000
details as we go here ah you know what
guys I don't actually know how iron

438
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,010
guys I don't actually know how iron
 

439
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,100
guys I don't actually know how iron
golems spawn like I don't know like if I

440
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,110
golems spawn like I don't know like if I
 

441
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,650
golems spawn like I don't know like if I
put water over this ice if they could

442
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:21,660
put water over this ice if they could
 

443
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,640
put water over this ice if they could
spawn in this spot so just the air on

444
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:25,650
spawn in this spot so just the air on
 

445
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,230
spawn in this spot so just the air on
the side of safety I'm gonna put a layer

446
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,240
the side of safety I'm gonna put a layer
 

447
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,170
the side of safety I'm gonna put a layer
of snow here maybe I will adjust it if I

448
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:30,180
of snow here maybe I will adjust it if I
 

449
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,650
of snow here maybe I will adjust it if I
find out later that they can because I

450
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:33,660
find out later that they can because I
 

451
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,180
find out later that they can because I
think it would look better if we could

452
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:35,190
think it would look better if we could
 

453
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,360
think it would look better if we could
see through this ice still from below

454
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,370
see through this ice still from below
 

455
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,780
see through this ice still from below
but yeah I think just to be safe will

456
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:41,790
but yeah I think just to be safe will
 

457
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,940
but yeah I think just to be safe will
cover

458

you know I often have people ask why I

460
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:45,750
you know I often have people ask why I
 

461
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,050
you know I often have people ask why I
would why I don't build an iron farm

462
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,060
would why I don't build an iron farm
 

463
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,440
would why I don't build an iron farm
what's the reason for it and it's just

464
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,450
what's the reason for it and it's just
 

465
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,080
what's the reason for it and it's just
something I decided I didn't really want

466
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,090
something I decided I didn't really want
 

467
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,850
something I decided I didn't really want
to build because I thought it would take

468
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:55,860
to build because I thought it would take
 

469
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,510
to build because I thought it would take
away some of the fun of the game for me

470
00:12:59,510 --> 00:12:59,520
away some of the fun of the game for me
 

471
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,710
away some of the fun of the game for me
because currently if I if I need

because currently if I if I need
 

473
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,750
because currently if I if I need
redstone I go speed mining I get tons of

to go caving for is iron currently and I
 

491
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,910
to go caving for is iron currently and I
kind of like that it gives me a reason

kind of like that it gives me a reason
 

493
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,980
kind of like that it gives me a reason
to go taping every now and then it's not

494
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:36,990
to go taping every now and then it's not
 

495
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,720
to go taping every now and then it's not
like I got to do it all the time but

496
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:38,730
like I got to do it all the time but
 

497
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,220
like I got to do it all the time but
it's just it's really a good bounce I

498
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,230
it's just it's really a good bounce I
 

499
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,320
it's just it's really a good bounce I
find the way I do it currently and if I

500
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,330
find the way I do it currently and if I
 

501
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,170
find the way I do it currently and if I
had the an iron farm I don't think I

502
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:48,180
had the an iron farm I don't think I
 

503
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,850
had the an iron farm I don't think I
would go caving any more that being said

504
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:52,860
would go caving any more that being said
 

505
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,130
would go caving any more that being said
though there are times when I kind of

506
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,140
though there are times when I kind of
 

507
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,660
though there are times when I kind of
wish I had an iron farm like I've done

508
00:13:59,660 --> 00:13:59,670
wish I had an iron farm like I've done
 

509
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,790
wish I had an iron farm like I've done
this before in an episode where I will

510
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:01,800
this before in an episode where I will
 

511
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,480
this before in an episode where I will
just rind caving like I'll go caving for

512
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:05,490
just rind caving like I'll go caving for
 

513
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,190
just rind caving like I'll go caving for
hours and hours just to like get a

514
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:07,200
hours and hours just to like get a
 

515
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,190
hours and hours just to like get a
beacon or something and that kind of

516
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:10,200
beacon or something and that kind of
 

517
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,060
beacon or something and that kind of
stinks that's not very fun and then when

518
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,070
stinks that's not very fun and then when
 

519
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,820
stinks that's not very fun and then when
I go to record the episode it's like I

520
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:16,830
I go to record the episode it's like I
 

521
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,340
I go to record the episode it's like I
am so out of time and so worn out from

522
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,350
am so out of time and so worn out from
 

523
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,800
am so out of time and so worn out from
all the caving that I have to like

524
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:21,810
all the caving that I have to like
 

525
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,680
all the caving that I have to like
record a bad episode so that kind of

526
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:24,690
record a bad episode so that kind of
 

527
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,020
record a bad episode so that kind of
stinks so that's one instance where I

528
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,030
stinks so that's one instance where I
 

529
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,070
stinks so that's one instance where I
would possibly consider having an iron

530
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,080
would possibly consider having an iron
 

531
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,590
would possibly consider having an iron
farm also maybe if I had a large project

532
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:36,600
farm also maybe if I had a large project
 

533
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,550
farm also maybe if I had a large project
in mind that required a lot of iron that

534
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:40,560
in mind that required a lot of iron that
 

535
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,710
in mind that required a lot of iron that
I didn't want to go grind for I might

536
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:42,720
I didn't want to go grind for I might
 

537
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,930
I didn't want to go grind for I might
also want an iron farm in that case hmm

538
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:49,940
also want an iron farm in that case hmm
 

539
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,460
also want an iron farm in that case hmm
okay so one of the things that might

540
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:52,470
okay so one of the things that might
 

541
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,800
okay so one of the things that might
prevent us from finishing our puppy farm

542
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:54,810
prevent us from finishing our puppy farm
 

543
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,900

00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,220
breeding I think when villagers run
 

553
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,770
breeding I think when villagers run
really quick like that that's when

554
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:09,780
really quick like that that's when
 

555
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,170
really quick like that that's when
they're they're okay to breed if they're

556
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:12,180
they're they're okay to breed if they're
 

557
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,960
they're they're okay to breed if they're

00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,120
think about building it because when I
start building it I want it to go super

634
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,130
start building it I want it to go super
 

635
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,439
start building it I want it to go super

for materials so I want to try collect

638
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:17,820
for materials so I want to try collect
 

639
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,510
for materials so I want to try collect
stuff beforehand and this is like the

640
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:20,520
stuff beforehand and this is like the
 

641
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,579
stuff beforehand and this is like the
minimum of what I expect we're gonna

642
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:22,589
minimum of what I expect we're gonna
 

643
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,920
minimum of what I expect we're gonna
need for certain things so I want to

while ago like several months actually I
 

659
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,540
while ago like several months actually I
brought up three big build ideas that we

660
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:47,550
brought up three big build ideas that we
 

661
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,280
brought up three big build ideas that we
might do in our world here one of them

662
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,290
might do in our world here one of them
 

663
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,480
might do in our world here one of them
was like a redstone Castle idea another

664
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:53,490
was like a redstone Castle idea another
 

665
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,350
was like a redstone Castle idea another
one was a zoo idea and then the Nexus

666
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
one was a zoo idea and then the Nexus
 

667
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,760
one was a zoo idea and then the Nexus
the Nexus is like a giant crazy storage

668
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:01,770
the Nexus is like a giant crazy storage
 

669
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,750
the Nexus is like a giant crazy storage

done before I wanted something that
 

687
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,700

would make it unique or cooler or had

688
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:31,710
would make it unique or cooler or had
 

689
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,090
would make it unique or cooler or had
some kind of trick to it that's that

690

made it special I don't know something
 

693
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,030
made it special I don't know something
it needed something you know to make it

694
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,040
it needed something you know to make it
 

695
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,640
it needed something you know to make it
worthwhile and I have that idea now I

696
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:43,650
worthwhile and I have that idea now I
 

697
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,770
worthwhile and I have that idea now I
know what I want to do and I've spent

698
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:45,780
know what I want to do and I've spent
 

699
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,600
know what I want to do and I've spent
some time experimenting with the idea

700
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:47,610
some time experimenting with the idea
 

701
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,700
some time experimenting with the idea
and I know how to do it with redstone

702
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:51,710
and I know how to do it with redstone
 

703
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,580
and I know how to do it with redstone
the only thing I need to do yet is to

704
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:55,590
the only thing I need to do yet is to
 

705
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,650
the only thing I need to do yet is to
organize how I want the storage room

706
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:57,660
organize how I want the storage room
 

707
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,030
organize how I want the storage room
because there's going to be lots of

708
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,040
because there's going to be lots of
 

709
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,760
because there's going to be lots of
different materials in the game right

710
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:01,770
different materials in the game right
 

711
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,200
different materials in the game right
like obviously I wouldn't want to have a

712
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,210
like obviously I wouldn't want to have a
 

713
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,460
like obviously I wouldn't want to have a
double chest for for dragon eggs because

714
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:07,470
double chest for for dragon eggs because
 

715
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,070
double chest for for dragon eggs because
there's only one so I have to decide how

716
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
there's only one so I have to decide how
 

717
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,600
there's only one so I have to decide how
much storage space I want for the

718
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:11,610
much storage space I want for the
 

719
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,490
much storage space I want for the
different items what I want to store and

720
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:13,500
different items what I want to store and
 

721
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,930
different items what I want to store and
that kind of stuff because not

722
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:14,940
that kind of stuff because not
 

723
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,140
that kind of stuff because not
everything is equal

724
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,150
everything is equal
 

725
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,770
everything is equal
minecraft and then I also have to figure

726
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:19,780
minecraft and then I also have to figure
 

727
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,170
minecraft and then I also have to figure
out how I I can best lay out everything

728
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:22,180
out how I I can best lay out everything
 

729
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:28,370
out how I I can best lay out everything
I'm gonna do and we need the materials

730
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:28,380

 

731
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,030

this is not a small list stack of or a

I will get a little bit of iron from it

748
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,110
I will get a little bit of iron from it
 

749
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,590
I will get a little bit of iron from it
as well uh-huh

750

normal iron and this is just for me this
 

765
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,490
normal iron and this is just for me this
is so the game is fun for me

about maybe we'll go over this list a
 

777
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,860
about maybe we'll go over this list a
little bit more so three chests of iron

778

little bit more so three chests of iron
 

779
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,470
little bit more so three chests of iron
it's a ton of iron to two chests of

780
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
it's a ton of iron to two chests of
 

781
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,120
it's a ton of iron to two chests of
glass that's not gonna be too tough ice

we might even have already stone is easy

784
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
we might even have already stone is easy
 

785
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,480
we might even have already stone is easy
droppers the only other one that's gonna

786
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:42,490
droppers the only other one that's gonna
 

787
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,010
droppers the only other one that's gonna
give us trouble is this chest of

788
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,020
give us trouble is this chest of
 

789
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,410
give us trouble is this chest of
redstone there was enough space to write

790

redstone there was enough space to write
 

791
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,660
redstone there was enough space to write

in per side or maybe two sides you can
 

819
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,430
in per side or maybe two sides you can
have two and the other two need three

820
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:32,440
have two and the other two need three
 

821

spruce trees and this is the results we

946
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:02,680
spruce trees and this is the results we
 

947
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,370
spruce trees and this is the results we
got so it takes 16 saplings to grow

948
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:05,380
got so it takes 16 saplings to grow
 

949
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,580
got so it takes 16 saplings to grow

952
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:11,490
it's pretty obvious we got a decent
 

953
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,950
it's pretty obvious we got a decent
really good profit from that actually

954
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:13,960
really good profit from that actually
 

955

with the exception of the fourth tree it

956
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:16,780
with the exception of the fourth tree it
 

957
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,960
with the exception of the fourth tree it
was just by chance a lot shorter than

958
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:18,970
was just by chance a lot shorter than
 

959
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,000
was just by chance a lot shorter than
the other ones and we only got 15

960
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,010
the other ones and we only got 15
 

961
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,030
the other ones and we only got 15
saplings so it was one short of breaking

962
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,040
saplings so it was one short of breaking
 

963
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,270
saplings so it was one short of breaking

I expected and probably do a 6 by 6 or 8

966
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:30,610
I expected and probably do a 6 by 6 or 8
 

967
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,780
I expected and probably do a 6 by 6 or 8
by 8 tree and breakeven which is pretty

968
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:33,790
by 8 tree and breakeven which is pretty
 

969
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,620
by 8 tree and breakeven which is pretty
cool so I'm gonna try that out later

970
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:36,630
cool so I'm gonna try that out later
 

971
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,500
cool so I'm gonna try that out later
again we need this wood for the Nexus

972
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:40,510
again we need this wood for the Nexus
 

973
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,420
again we need this wood for the Nexus
and so I'm gonna start saving up wood

974
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:42,430
and so I'm gonna start saving up wood
 

975
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,180
and so I'm gonna start saving up wood
and we'll have to get redstone and and

976
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,190
and we'll have to get redstone and and
 

977
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,090
and we'll have to get redstone and and
then eventually gonna have to try finish

978
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:48,100
then eventually gonna have to try finish
 

979
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,220
then eventually gonna have to try finish
that as soon as possible so we can start

980
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:50,230
that as soon as possible so we can start
 

981
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,230
that as soon as possible so we can start
getting some iron because it's not like

982
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,240
getting some iron because it's not like
 

983
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,790
getting some iron because it's not like
we're gonna get iron the rate when we

984
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:53,800
we're gonna get iron the rate when we
 

985
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,140
we're gonna get iron the rate when we
finish it it's gonna take a long time so

986
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,150
finish it it's gonna take a long time so
 

987
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,190
finish it it's gonna take a long time so
probably we'll have to do some caving

988
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,200
probably we'll have to do some caving
 

989
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,520
probably we'll have to do some caving

00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:06,270
still even with that just so we can
speed up the process but anyway here is

992
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:06,280
