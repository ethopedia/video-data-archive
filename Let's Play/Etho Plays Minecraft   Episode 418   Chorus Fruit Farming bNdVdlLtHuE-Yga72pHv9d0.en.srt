00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
the last couple episodes
 

27
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,709
the last couple episodes
and we just haven't had time so today's

28
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
and we just haven't had time so today's
 

29
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,110
and we just haven't had time so today's
the day

30
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
the day
 

31
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,590
the day
let's talk about this uh what the plan

32
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
let's talk about this uh what the plan
 

33
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,950
let's talk about this uh what the plan
is

34
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
is
 

35
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,350
is
so okay i've been trying to figure out

36
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,360
so okay i've been trying to figure out
 

37
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,869
so okay i've been trying to figure out
the design for this um one of the big

38
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
the design for this um one of the big
 

39
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,069
the design for this um one of the big
problems with the chorus fruits

40
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
problems with the chorus fruits
 

41
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,790
problems with the chorus fruits
is you need these seeds and i just

42
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
is you need these seeds and i just
 

43
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,869
is you need these seeds and i just
planted some of them over here last time

44
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:52,879
planted some of them over here last time
 

45
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,310
planted some of them over here last time
this is how they grow they grow all

46
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
this is how they grow they grow all
 

47
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,790
this is how they grow they grow all
crazy and chaotically like that

48
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
crazy and chaotically like that
 

49
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,630
crazy and chaotically like that
in order to actually get these seeds you

50
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640
in order to actually get these seeds you
 

51
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,389
in order to actually get these seeds you
have to break

52
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
have to break
 

53
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,549
have to break
the seed pod over here if you like break

54
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
the seed pod over here if you like break
 

55
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,189
the seed pod over here if you like break
the stem over here

56
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
the stem over here
 

57
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,109
the stem over here
you don't get any seeds and then you you

58
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
you don't get any seeds and then you you
 

59
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,030
you don't get any seeds and then you you
have nothing to replant it with

60
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
have nothing to replant it with
 

61
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,070
have nothing to replant it with
okay that's our first challenge

62
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
okay that's our first challenge
 

63
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,590
okay that's our first challenge
um so when they're way up in the air

64
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
um so when they're way up in the air
 

65
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,190
um so when they're way up in the air
like that there's not really any good

66
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
like that there's not really any good
 

67
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,670
like that there's not really any good
way of

68
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
way of
 

69
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,870
way of
of getting the seeds harvested even if

70
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
of getting the seeds harvested even if
 

71
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,429
of getting the seeds harvested even if
you built like a platform to

72
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:21,439
you built like a platform to
 

73
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,270
you built like a platform to
kind of stand on up there it's still

74
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
kind of stand on up there it's still
 

75
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,950
kind of stand on up there it's still
kind of crazy and chaotic

76
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
kind of crazy and chaotic
 

77
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,789
kind of crazy and chaotic
so something a lot of people are doing

78
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
so something a lot of people are doing
 

79
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,950
so something a lot of people are doing
i've seen i think azuma even had a

80
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
i've seen i think azuma even had a
 

81
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,030
i've seen i think azuma even had a
a tutorial on this is you just uh

82
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
a tutorial on this is you just uh
 

83
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,710
a tutorial on this is you just uh
you kind of block their their growth

84
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
you kind of block their their growth
 

85
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,030
you kind of block their their growth
by putting a ceiling over top them like

86
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
by putting a ceiling over top them like
 

87
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,710
by putting a ceiling over top them like
three blocks up here

88
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
three blocks up here
 

89
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,550
three blocks up here
and they'll still split into multiple

90
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
and they'll still split into multiple
 

91
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,310
and they'll still split into multiple
seeds so this one has three

92
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
seeds so this one has three
 

93
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,550
seeds so this one has three
three seed pods for example you easily

94
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
three seed pods for example you easily
 

95
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,910
three seed pods for example you easily
harvest them because there are

96
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
harvest them because there are
 

97
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,270
harvest them because there are
at eye level here which is kind of nice

98
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
at eye level here which is kind of nice
 

99
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,149
at eye level here which is kind of nice
i think that's

100
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
i think that's
 

101
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,749
i think that's
one thing we're going to do for sure

102
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
one thing we're going to do for sure
 

103
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,030
one thing we're going to do for sure
that way we don't have to worry about

104
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
that way we don't have to worry about
 

105
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,749
that way we don't have to worry about
getting more of these seeds

106
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
getting more of these seeds
 

107
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,590
getting more of these seeds
and trying to figure out a way of of

108
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
and trying to figure out a way of of
 

109
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,670
and trying to figure out a way of of
collecting them easily

110
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
collecting them easily
 

111
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,910
collecting them easily
uh the thing to note about these plants

112
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
uh the thing to note about these plants
 

113
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,190
uh the thing to note about these plants
though they're kind of

114
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
though they're kind of
 

115
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,949
though they're kind of
interesting if you want to get these

116
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
interesting if you want to get these
 

117
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,470
interesting if you want to get these
seed pods you can't just oh

118
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
seed pods you can't just oh
 

119
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,229
seed pods you can't just oh
yeah you can't just like push them with

120
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
yeah you can't just like push them with
 

121
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,390
yeah you can't just like push them with
a piston unfortunately

122
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
a piston unfortunately
 

123
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,550
a piston unfortunately
uh they don't like having any blocks

124
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
uh they don't like having any blocks
 

125
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,750
uh they don't like having any blocks
next to them

126
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
next to them
 

127
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,710
next to them
if uh if you do that it just it just

128
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
if uh if you do that it just it just
 

129
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,430
if uh if you do that it just it just
destroys the plant like you saw

130
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
destroys the plant like you saw
 

131
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,110
destroys the plant like you saw
here let's try this um

132
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
here let's try this um
 

133
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,550
here let's try this um
oh i do have levers excellent

134
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
oh i do have levers excellent
 

135
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,150
oh i do have levers excellent
okay so yeah as soon as a another

136
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
okay so yeah as soon as a another
 

137
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,309
okay so yeah as soon as a another
something like another block or piston

138
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
something like another block or piston
 

139
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,070
something like another block or piston
head or anything gets next to it it just

140
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
head or anything gets next to it it just
 

141
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,750
head or anything gets next to it it just
breaks and you don't get the seed out of

142
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
breaks and you don't get the seed out of
 

143
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,790
breaks and you don't get the seed out of
it

144
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
it
 

145
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,750
it
so that's kind of challenging there's no

146
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
so that's kind of challenging there's no
 

147
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,589
so that's kind of challenging there's no
way of automating it that means

148
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
way of automating it that means
 

149
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,710
way of automating it that means
so you got to manually break them the

150
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
so you got to manually break them the
 

151
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,990
so you got to manually break them the
other thing is if we want to

152
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
other thing is if we want to
 

153
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,150
other thing is if we want to
break the plant there's a couple ways we

154
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
break the plant there's a couple ways we
 

155
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,830
break the plant there's a couple ways we
can do it like if you break the stem

156
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
can do it like if you break the stem
 

157
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,949
can do it like if you break the stem
everything above that gets broken you

158
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
everything above that gets broken you
 

159
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,149
everything above that gets broken you
can put a block next to the stems

160
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
can put a block next to the stems
 

161
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,589
can put a block next to the stems
and then if you if you destroy that

162
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
and then if you if you destroy that
 

163
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,350
and then if you if you destroy that
the whole plant gets destroyed and drops

164
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
the whole plant gets destroyed and drops
 

165
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,670
the whole plant gets destroyed and drops
all the fruits that's one way you can do

166
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
all the fruits that's one way you can do
 

167
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,990
all the fruits that's one way you can do
it

168
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
it
 

169
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,390
it
another way you could do it is to

170
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400

 

171
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,710

move the the end stone that it's planted

172
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
move the the end stone that it's planted
 

173
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,070
move the the end stone that it's planted
on

174
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
on
 

175
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,630
on
so for example if you do this the whole

176
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
so for example if you do this the whole
 

177
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,470
so for example if you do this the whole
plant gets destroyed

178
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
plant gets destroyed
 

179
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,430
plant gets destroyed
and finally another way well there might

180
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
and finally another way well there might
 

181
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:27,830
and finally another way well there might
be

182
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
be
 

183
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,430
be
even more ways i'm not sure if you

184
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
even more ways i'm not sure if you
 

185
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,910
even more ways i'm not sure if you
if you wash away with water

186
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920

 

187
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,430

that also will break the plant so

188
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
that also will break the plant so
 

189
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,190
that also will break the plant so
there's a couple different ways of doing

190
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
there's a couple different ways of doing
 

191
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,070
there's a couple different ways of doing
it

192
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080

 

193
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,309

okay well anyways that's the general

194
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
okay well anyways that's the general
 

195
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,550
okay well anyways that's the general
idea to how these plants work

196
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
idea to how these plants work
 

197
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,070
idea to how these plants work
what we're going to be doing today i

198
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
what we're going to be doing today i
 

199
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,470
what we're going to be doing today i
want to build both a seed farm

200
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
want to build both a seed farm
 

201
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,990
want to build both a seed farm
so something similar to this we're going

202
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
so something similar to this we're going
 

203
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,030
so something similar to this we're going
to try optimize it as best as we can

204
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
to try optimize it as best as we can
 

205
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,990
to try optimize it as best as we can
so we get seeds very quickly and then

206
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
so we get seeds very quickly and then
 

207
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,110
so we get seeds very quickly and then
we're going to have another

208
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
we're going to have another
 

209
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,509
we're going to have another
a second farm for growing the full-blown

210
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
a second farm for growing the full-blown
 

211
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,869
a second farm for growing the full-blown
plants like this

212
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
plants like this
 

213
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,350
plants like this
the the bigger the plant is the more

214
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
the the bigger the plant is the more
 

215
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,990
the the bigger the plant is the more
fruits

216
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
fruits
 

217
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,070
fruits
the more of this fruit you get and more

218
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
the more of this fruit you get and more
 

219
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,869
the more of this fruit you get and more
fruit you get the more

220
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
fruit you get the more
 

221
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,509
fruit you get the more
perper blocks you get so we want we want

222
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
perper blocks you get so we want we want
 

223
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,550
perper blocks you get so we want we want
to collect as much as we can as the idea

224
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
to collect as much as we can as the idea
 

225
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,270
to collect as much as we can as the idea
um when we build our farm we're going to

226
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
um when we build our farm we're going to
 

227
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,710
um when we build our farm we're going to
try to automatically

228
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
try to automatically
 

229
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,310
try to automatically
collect the fruit and we're going to try

230
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
collect the fruit and we're going to try
 

231
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,469
collect the fruit and we're going to try
to automatically smelt it in a furnace

232
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
to automatically smelt it in a furnace
 

233
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,790
to automatically smelt it in a furnace
is what i want to do

234
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
is what i want to do
 

235
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,030
is what i want to do
now i had one idea originally i was

236
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
now i had one idea originally i was
 

237
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,469
now i had one idea originally i was
gonna do something like

238
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
gonna do something like
 

239
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,390
gonna do something like
this um so we have these fence gates

240
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
this um so we have these fence gates
 

241
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,749
this um so we have these fence gates
right

242
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
right
 

243
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,070
right
these create an opening where the fruit

244
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
these create an opening where the fruit
 

245
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,830
these create an opening where the fruit
could fall down into a water stream

246
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
could fall down into a water stream
 

247
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,870
could fall down into a water stream
below and then they get

248
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
below and then they get
 

249
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,070
below and then they get
collected together into one spot

250
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
collected together into one spot
 

251
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,510
collected together into one spot
um the piston would move the end stone

252
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
um the piston would move the end stone
 

253
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,469
um the piston would move the end stone
block so the whole

254
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
block so the whole
 

255
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,469
block so the whole
plant breaks i'll show you i'll show you

256
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
plant breaks i'll show you i'll show you
 

257
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,390
plant breaks i'll show you i'll show you
how it works

258
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
how it works
 

259
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,430
how it works
all right

260
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440

 

261
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,430

kind of like that so everything breaks

262
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
kind of like that so everything breaks
 

263
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,670
kind of like that so everything breaks
if any of them land on the end stone

264
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
if any of them land on the end stone
 

265
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,670
if any of them land on the end stone
like this one for example

266
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
like this one for example
 

267
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,990
like this one for example
when we trigger it back into place

268
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
when we trigger it back into place
 

269
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,710
when we trigger it back into place
over here like we would have a smart

270
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
over here like we would have a smart
 

271
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,749
over here like we would have a smart
piston set up

272
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
piston set up
 

273
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,469
piston set up
probably um any that land on top of the

274
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
probably um any that land on top of the
 

275
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,390
probably um any that land on top of the
blocks will get

276
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
blocks will get
 

277
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,070
blocks will get
they'll fall through basically into the

278
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
they'll fall through basically into the
 

279
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,230
they'll fall through basically into the
water below and

280
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
water below and
 

281
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,670
water below and
100 collection rate i believe

282
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
100 collection rate i believe
 

283
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,430
100 collection rate i believe
and then the reason for this minecart

284
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
and then the reason for this minecart
 

285
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,110
and then the reason for this minecart
track is uh

286
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
track is uh
 

287
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,310
track is uh
you kind of go along and

288
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
you kind of go along and
 

289
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,950
you kind of go along and
you know i never made mine cart i can't

290
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
you know i never made mine cart i can't
 

291
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,390
you know i never made mine cart i can't
really demonstrate it but yeah

292
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
really demonstrate it but yeah
 

293
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,390
really demonstrate it but yeah
it would help to speed up the replanting

294
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
it would help to speed up the replanting
 

295
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,990
it would help to speed up the replanting
because you just kind of go along

296
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
because you just kind of go along
 

297
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,350
because you just kind of go along
like that uh the only thing is if you

298
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
like that uh the only thing is if you
 

299
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,150
like that uh the only thing is if you
right click on a fence

300
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
right click on a fence
 

301
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,230
right click on a fence
it's going to open it or close it which

302
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
it's going to open it or close it which
 

303
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,629
it's going to open it or close it which
would be annoying

304
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
would be annoying
 

305
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,950
would be annoying
now the other idea i had was just to do

306
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
now the other idea i had was just to do
 

307
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,469
now the other idea i had was just to do
something like this and i think this is

308
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
something like this and i think this is
 

309
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,990
something like this and i think this is
what we're going to do

310
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
what we're going to do
 

311
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,469
what we're going to do
because that minecart idea is so

312
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
because that minecart idea is so
 

313
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,550
because that minecart idea is so
intricate to set up and so complicated

314
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
intricate to set up and so complicated
 

315
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,390
intricate to set up and so complicated
and expensive and

316
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
and expensive and
 

317
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,230
and expensive and
sometimes you know i like doing things

318
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
sometimes you know i like doing things
 

319
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,469
sometimes you know i like doing things
complicated but sometimes simpler is

320
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
complicated but sometimes simpler is
 

321
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,830
complicated but sometimes simpler is
actually better and

322
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
actually better and
 

323
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,950
actually better and
and this seems to be a pretty good idea

324
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
and this seems to be a pretty good idea
 

325
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,590
and this seems to be a pretty good idea
so anyway anywhere there's a end stone

326
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
so anyway anywhere there's a end stone
 

327
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,110
so anyway anywhere there's a end stone
block is where i would put the chorus

328
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
block is where i would put the chorus
 

329
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,909
block is where i would put the chorus
fruits right

330
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
fruits right
 

331
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,950
fruits right
and you just every every six blocks go

332
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
and you just every every six blocks go
 

333
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,309
and you just every every six blocks go
up a step

334
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
up a step
 

335
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,749
up a step
and then the water will flow down and

336
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
and then the water will flow down and
 

337
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,029
and then the water will flow down and
harvest all the course fruit

338
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
harvest all the course fruit
 

339
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,629
harvest all the course fruit
automatically and collect it all

340
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
automatically and collect it all
 

341
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,430
automatically and collect it all
together at the bottom

342
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440

 

343
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,350

oh oh yeah okay

344
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
oh oh yeah okay
 

345
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,670
oh oh yeah okay
so when we release it we're gonna need a

346
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
so when we release it we're gonna need a
 

347
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,790
so when we release it we're gonna need a
longer

348
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
longer
 

349
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,110
longer
strip here at the start but yeah

350
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
strip here at the start but yeah
 

351
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,870
strip here at the start but yeah
basically all the coarse fruit is going

352
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
basically all the coarse fruit is going
 

353
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,390
basically all the coarse fruit is going
to flow down to the bottom where these

354
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
to flow down to the bottom where these
 

355
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,430
to flow down to the bottom where these
seeds are

356
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
seeds are
 

357
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,110
seeds are
and then we can just collect it and then

358
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
and then we can just collect it and then
 

359
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,189
and then we can just collect it and then
bring it to a furnace and

360
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
bring it to a furnace and
 

361
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,550
bring it to a furnace and
and automatically smelt it so that seems

362
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
and automatically smelt it so that seems
 

363
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,550
and automatically smelt it so that seems
like a pretty good way of doing it

364
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
like a pretty good way of doing it
 

365
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,589
like a pretty good way of doing it
i gotta find a spot to set it up and

366
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
i gotta find a spot to set it up and
 

367
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,390
i gotta find a spot to set it up and
then we can

368
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
then we can
 

369
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,950
then we can
uh probably get going here

370
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960

 

371
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,790

all right well i've looked around our

372
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
all right well i've looked around our
 

373
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,309
all right well i've looked around our
world here quite a bit guys

374
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
world here quite a bit guys
 

375
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,790
world here quite a bit guys
and the one spot that's standing out the

376
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
and the one spot that's standing out the
 

377
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,909
and the one spot that's standing out the
most to me is uh

378
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
most to me is uh
 

379
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,830
most to me is uh
up behind the village uh we have quite a

380
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
up behind the village uh we have quite a
 

381
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,870
up behind the village uh we have quite a
bit of

382
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
bit of
 

383
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,629
bit of
open field here that we haven't done

384
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
open field here that we haven't done
 

385
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,710
open field here that we haven't done
anything with so far

386
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
anything with so far
 

387
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,550
anything with so far
so i would like to fill it up if we can

388
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
so i would like to fill it up if we can
 

389
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,150
so i would like to fill it up if we can
this area

390
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
this area
 

391
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,909
this area
and i want to build it somewhere that

392
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
and i want to build it somewhere that
 

393
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,270
and i want to build it somewhere that
we're going to frequent like somewhere

394
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
we're going to frequent like somewhere
 

395
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,270
we're going to frequent like somewhere
we're going to travel quite a bit so the

396
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
we're going to travel quite a bit so the
 

397
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,710
we're going to travel quite a bit so the
plants will actually grow and we don't

398
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
plants will actually grow and we don't
 

399
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,390
plants will actually grow and we don't
have to afk in the chunks

400
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
have to afk in the chunks
 

401
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,150
have to afk in the chunks
you know to get our fruit growing here

402
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
you know to get our fruit growing here
 

403
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,670
you know to get our fruit growing here
so yeah maybe right behind

404
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
so yeah maybe right behind
 

405
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,830
so yeah maybe right behind
behind here would be good you see how it

406
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
behind here would be good you see how it
 

407
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,830
behind here would be good you see how it
kind of gradually slopes downward

408
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
kind of gradually slopes downward
 

409
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,909
kind of gradually slopes downward
uh and then there's this big cliff here

410
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
uh and then there's this big cliff here
 

411
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,430
uh and then there's this big cliff here
i think we'll try to take advantage of

412
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
i think we'll try to take advantage of
 

413
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,430
i think we'll try to take advantage of
that if we can

414
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
that if we can
 

415
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,270
that if we can
and i'm planning on maybe

416
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
and i'm planning on maybe
 

417
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,430
and i'm planning on maybe
having a path or a river running down at

418
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
having a path or a river running down at
 

419
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,830
having a path or a river running down at
the bottom of this cliff

420
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
the bottom of this cliff
 

421
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,390
the bottom of this cliff
so let's see wait a second

422
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
so let's see wait a second
 

423
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,830
so let's see wait a second
wait a second maybe uh let's give a

424
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
wait a second maybe uh let's give a
 

425
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,710
wait a second maybe uh let's give a
little bit of space

426
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720

 

427
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,230

yeah let's plan to put a line like right

428
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
yeah let's plan to put a line like right
 

429
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,510
yeah let's plan to put a line like right
over here

430
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
over here
 

431
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,790
over here
okay so we'll cut all this land away

432
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
okay so we'll cut all this land away
 

433
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,309
okay so we'll cut all this land away
all the coarse fruit is going to

434
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
all the coarse fruit is going to
 

435
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,790
all the coarse fruit is going to
probably drop off into a water stream

436
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
probably drop off into a water stream
 

437
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,469
probably drop off into a water stream
over here so we'll either make a fake

438
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
over here so we'll either make a fake
 

439
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,830
over here so we'll either make a fake
river or maybe a one wide

440
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
river or maybe a one wide
 

441
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,749
river or maybe a one wide
water stream and then a path beside it

442
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
water stream and then a path beside it
 

443
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,510
water stream and then a path beside it
type of thing

444
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
type of thing
 

445
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,350
type of thing
maybe eventually we'll reinforce this

446
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
maybe eventually we'll reinforce this
 

447
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,869
maybe eventually we'll reinforce this
cliff to make it look like it's

448
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
cliff to make it look like it's
 

449
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,469
cliff to make it look like it's
being held in place properly

450
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
being held in place properly
 

451
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,509
being held in place properly
i'm going to fill this water in

452
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
i'm going to fill this water in
 

453
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,509
i'm going to fill this water in
and we want this first step to be eight

454
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
and we want this first step to be eight
 

455
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:39,990
and we want this first step to be eight
blocks

456
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
blocks
 

457
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,589
blocks
long so four five six seven

458
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
long so four five six seven
 

459
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,949
long so four five six seven
eight all right

460
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
eight all right
 

461
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,190
eight all right
and then this one will be six and then

462
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
and then this one will be six and then
 

463
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,870
and then this one will be six and then
all the other ones will be six from

464
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
all the other ones will be six from
 

465
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,110
all the other ones will be six from
from here on you're you're gonna watch

466
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
from here on you're you're gonna watch
 

467
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,630
from here on you're you're gonna watch
in a cactus i know it's

468
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
in a cactus i know it's
 

469
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,509
in a cactus i know it's
i know it i'm so used to playing arc and

470
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
i know it i'm so used to playing arc and
 

471
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,550
i know it i'm so used to playing arc and
i just want to

472

i just want to
 

473
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,630
i just want to
uh press uh the whistle button when i

474
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
uh press uh the whistle button when i
 

475
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,470

get off my horse here so it doesn't move

476
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
get off my horse here so it doesn't move
 

477
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,110

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
oh yeah check it out everybody things
 

479
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,310
oh yeah check it out everybody things
are coming together now

480
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
are coming together now
 

481
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,990
are coming together now
they're taking shape i've been at this

482
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
they're taking shape i've been at this
 

483
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,509
they're taking shape i've been at this
for a little while just doing the

484
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
for a little while just doing the
 

485
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,509
for a little while just doing the
terraforming and stuff

486
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
terraforming and stuff
 

487
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,990
terraforming and stuff
i decided to do a test run here too so i

488
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
i decided to do a test run here too so i
 

489
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,550
i decided to do a test run here too so i
planted

490
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
planted
 

491
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,350
planted
whatever seeds i had just to make sure

492
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
whatever seeds i had just to make sure
 

493
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,630
whatever seeds i had just to make sure
they would grow together

494
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
they would grow together
 

495
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,269
they would grow together
uh where i put them here and it looks

496
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
uh where i put them here and it looks
 

497
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,070
uh where i put them here and it looks
like they get to

498
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
like they get to
 

499
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,310
like they get to
the full height for the most part like

500
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
the full height for the most part like
 

501
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,070
the full height for the most part like
if you put them too close together they

502
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
if you put them too close together they
 

503
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,350
if you put them too close together they
run into each other and then

504
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
run into each other and then
 

505
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,990
run into each other and then
then they stop growing you can see maybe

506
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
then they stop growing you can see maybe
 

507
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,190
then they stop growing you can see maybe
a few of these

508
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
a few of these
 

509
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,949
a few of these
that kind of happen when they turn black

510
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
that kind of happen when they turn black
 

511
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,710
that kind of happen when they turn black
like that

512
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
like that
 

513
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,269
like that
but uh generally speaking i think uh i

514
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:39,279
but uh generally speaking i think uh i
 

515
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,630
but uh generally speaking i think uh i
think it's a pretty good pattern

516
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
think it's a pretty good pattern
 

517
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,750
think it's a pretty good pattern
for the floor here and i got maybe a

518
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
for the floor here and i got maybe a
 

519
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,430
for the floor here and i got maybe a
little carried away with the size of

520
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
little carried away with the size of
 

521
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,110
little carried away with the size of
this thing

522
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
this thing
 

523
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,470
this thing
check it out like from up here um

524
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
check it out like from up here um
 

525
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,590
check it out like from up here um
there's about 30 per per step

526
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
there's about 30 per per step
 

527
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,110
there's about 30 per per step
and there's five steps total so that's

528
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
and there's five steps total so that's
 

529
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,710
and there's five steps total so that's
like 150

530
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
like 150
 

531
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,590
like 150
plants if each of them dropped one

532
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
plants if each of them dropped one
 

533
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,750
plants if each of them dropped one
course fruit that's 150 blocks per

534
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
course fruit that's 150 blocks per
 

535
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,870
course fruit that's 150 blocks per
harvest

536
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
harvest
 

537
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,590
harvest
like 150 per per blocks we'll get but

538
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
like 150 per per blocks we'll get but
 

539
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,269
like 150 per per blocks we'll get but
we're probably gonna get at least

540
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
we're probably gonna get at least
 

541
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,430
we're probably gonna get at least
three or four fruits so that's that's a

542
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
three or four fruits so that's that's a
 

543
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,389
three or four fruits so that's that's a
lot of blocks

544
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
lot of blocks
 

545
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,590
lot of blocks
per per thing here uh to make things a

546
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
per per thing here uh to make things a
 

547
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,430
per per thing here uh to make things a
little easier on myself i just set up a

548
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
little easier on myself i just set up a
 

549
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,550
little easier on myself i just set up a
beacon here we got

550
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
beacon here we got
 

551
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,150
beacon here we got
we got uh haste and speed

552
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
we got uh haste and speed
 

553
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,509
we got uh haste and speed
which will make uh replanting faster too

554
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
which will make uh replanting faster too
 

555
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,670
which will make uh replanting faster too
because we'll be able to to get around

556
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
because we'll be able to to get around
 

557
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,110
because we'll be able to to get around
quicker

558
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
quicker
 

559
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,030
quicker
and i think we'll probably stop

560
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
and i think we'll probably stop
 

561
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,630
and i think we'll probably stop
around there we're gonna have to do a

562
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
around there we're gonna have to do a
 

563
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,389
around there we're gonna have to do a
bit of work in this area to make that

564
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
bit of work in this area to make that
 

565
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,949
bit of work in this area to make that
look natural like i don't really like

566
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
look natural like i don't really like
 

567
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,230
look natural like i don't really like
this grass

568
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
this grass
 

569
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,310
this grass
next to the end stone the green and

570
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
next to the end stone the green and
 

571
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,430
next to the end stone the green and
yellow and purple

572
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
yellow and purple
 

573
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,470
yellow and purple
isn't really doing it for me uh i was

574
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
isn't really doing it for me uh i was
 

575
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,030
isn't really doing it for me uh i was
thinking

576
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
thinking
 

577
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,509
thinking
maybe we switch out the grass with uh

578
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
maybe we switch out the grass with uh
 

579
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,949
maybe we switch out the grass with uh
mycelium because

580
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
mycelium because
 

581
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,910
mycelium because
it's purple as well or or maybe a

582
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
it's purple as well or or maybe a
 

583
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,430
it's purple as well or or maybe a
hardened clay of some kind would look

584
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
hardened clay of some kind would look
 

585
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,430
hardened clay of some kind would look
good i'm not sure

586
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
good i'm not sure
 

587
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,750
good i'm not sure
we'll have to think of something though

588
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
we'll have to think of something though
 

589
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,750
we'll have to think of something though
um

590
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
um
 

591
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,829
um
but in order to fill this farm we're

592
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
but in order to fill this farm we're
 

593
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,269
but in order to fill this farm we're
going to need a lot of these

594
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
going to need a lot of these
 

595
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,509
going to need a lot of these
of the coarse fruit seeds so maybe we

596
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
of the coarse fruit seeds so maybe we
 

597
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,710
of the coarse fruit seeds so maybe we
should get going on the seed farm to

598
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
should get going on the seed farm to
 

599
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,150
should get going on the seed farm to
get out of my way i was going to put it

600
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
get out of my way i was going to put it
 

601
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,310
get out of my way i was going to put it
right next to this so on the opposite

602
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
right next to this so on the opposite
 

603
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,430
right next to this so on the opposite
side

604
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
side
 

605
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,110
side
underneath the village maybe we'll just

606
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
underneath the village maybe we'll just
 

607
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,310
underneath the village maybe we'll just
dig a hole around here

608
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
dig a hole around here
 

609
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,829
dig a hole around here
all we really need is like a too high

610
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
all we really need is like a too high
 

611
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,990
all we really need is like a too high
space basically so maybe all along the

612
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
space basically so maybe all along the
 

613
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,910
space basically so maybe all along the
farm

614
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
farm
 

615
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,350
farm
we will start to

616
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
we will start to
 

617
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,430
we will start to
chiseling out the land here and then

618
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
chiseling out the land here and then
 

619
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,350
chiseling out the land here and then
we'll like put end stone down here and

620
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
we'll like put end stone down here and
 

621
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,949
we'll like put end stone down here and
stuff

622
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
stuff
 

623
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,550
stuff
try to put lights in the ceiling and

624
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
try to put lights in the ceiling and
 

625
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,630
try to put lights in the ceiling and
like some way of releasing water as well

626
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
like some way of releasing water as well
 

627
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,310
like some way of releasing water as well
down here so that we can

628
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
down here so that we can
 

629
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,230
down here so that we can
quickly clean up any scrap that gets

630
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
quickly clean up any scrap that gets
 

631
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:54,389
quickly clean up any scrap that gets
left behind would be a good idea

632
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399

 

633
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,990

okay so now i'm just doing some

634
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
okay so now i'm just doing some
 

635
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,990
okay so now i'm just doing some
experiments with this seed farm trying

636
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
experiments with this seed farm trying
 

637
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,829
experiments with this seed farm trying
to find the ideal way of uh

638
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
to find the ideal way of uh
 

639
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,790
to find the ideal way of uh
setting it up here uh ideally i would

640
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
setting it up here uh ideally i would
 

641
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,870
setting it up here uh ideally i would
like them all to grow like this plant

642
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:04,880
like them all to grow like this plant
 

643
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,870
like them all to grow like this plant
here where it has one on the left one on

644
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
here where it has one on the left one on
 

645
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,509
here where it has one on the left one on
the right

646
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
the right
 

647
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,069
the right
then you could have them together like

648
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
then you could have them together like
 

649
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,550
then you could have them together like
just one block space in between

650
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
just one block space in between
 

651
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,590
just one block space in between
and you could just run down a long a

652
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
and you could just run down a long a
 

653
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,190
and you could just run down a long a
long path you know with your axe

654
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
long path you know with your axe
 

655
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,269
long path you know with your axe
just go get get a ton of seeds

656
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
just go get get a ton of seeds
 

657
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,870
just go get get a ton of seeds
because each plant would split into two

658
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
because each plant would split into two
 

659
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,230
because each plant would split into two
but i don't know if there's any way to

660
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
but i don't know if there's any way to
 

661
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,990
but i don't know if there's any way to
actually force it to grow

662
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,000
actually force it to grow
 

663
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,990
actually force it to grow
like this one this one just happened by

664
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
like this one this one just happened by
 

665
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,030
like this one this one just happened by
chance

666
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
chance
 

667

chance
some of them like they went to the

668
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
some of them like they went to the
 

669
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,269
some of them like they went to the
rights a lot of these ones did i wonder

670
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:35,279
rights a lot of these ones did i wonder
 

671
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,870
rights a lot of these ones did i wonder
if we give it enough time if it's gonna

672
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
if we give it enough time if it's gonna
 

673
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,150
if we give it enough time if it's gonna
grow a seed over

674
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
grow a seed over
 

675
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,910
grow a seed over
over here or if it's if it's just done

676
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:41,920
over here or if it's if it's just done
 

677
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,509
over here or if it's if it's just done
growing i'm not sure we're just going to

678
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
growing i'm not sure we're just going to
 

679
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,030
growing i'm not sure we're just going to
let that sit for a little bit

680
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040

 

681
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,710

i just realized you know i have no idea

682
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
i just realized you know i have no idea
 

683
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,150
i just realized you know i have no idea
if these plants are flammable

684
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,160
if these plants are flammable
 

685
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,230
if these plants are flammable
i have no idea what tnt does to them so

686
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
i have no idea what tnt does to them so
 

687
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,710
i have no idea what tnt does to them so
we're going to have some fun here

688
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
we're going to have some fun here
 

689
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,389
we're going to have some fun here
just want to see if they burn down or

690
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
just want to see if they burn down or
 

691
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,949
just want to see if they burn down or
what

692
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959

 

693
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,150

usually mo jing doesn't uh remember to

694
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
usually mo jing doesn't uh remember to
 

695
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,230
usually mo jing doesn't uh remember to
do stuff like that though when they

696
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
do stuff like that though when they
 

697
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,750
do stuff like that though when they
introduce a new thing

698
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760

 

699
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,430

because it's a plant it should be

700
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
because it's a plant it should be
 

701
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,990
because it's a plant it should be
flammable right

702
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
flammable right
 

703
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,629
flammable right
but yeah it doesn't look like it is okay

704
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
but yeah it doesn't look like it is okay
 

705
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,509
but yeah it doesn't look like it is okay
i want to see

706
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
i want to see
 

707
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,870
i want to see
what tnt does too if it's gonna harvest

708
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
what tnt does too if it's gonna harvest
 

709
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,870
what tnt does too if it's gonna harvest
the seeds or not

710
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
the seeds or not
 

711
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,150
the seeds or not
that would be interesting

712
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160

 

713
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,910

all right let's put it right up

714
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
all right let's put it right up
 

715
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,790
all right let's put it right up
in the middle here it's really weird

716
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:32,800
in the middle here it's really weird
 

717
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,310
in the middle here it's really weird
like i tried jumping around on the top

718
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
like i tried jumping around on the top
 

719
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,310
like i tried jumping around on the top
here it's actually not too difficult to

720
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
here it's actually not too difficult to
 

721
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,190
here it's actually not too difficult to
harvest the see

722
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
harvest the see
 

723
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,430
harvest the see
seed pods just by climbing around on

724
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
seed pods just by climbing around on
 

725
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,509
seed pods just by climbing around on
here i was a little surprised

726
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519

 

727
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,710

all right oh

728
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720

 

729
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,430

there we go okay let's see what happens

730
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440

 

731
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,670

and did we get any seed pods

732
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
and did we get any seed pods
 

733
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,710
and did we get any seed pods
coarse fruit coarse fruits

734
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720

 

735
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,230

nope no see pods

736
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240

 

737
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,990

all right well i left these for a little

738
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
all right well i left these for a little
 

739
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,629
all right well i left these for a little
while and nothing has really changed so

740
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
while and nothing has really changed so
 

741
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,110
while and nothing has really changed so
it seems like it's kind of just like

742
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
it seems like it's kind of just like
 

743
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,350
it seems like it's kind of just like
randomly chooses if it's gonna grow

744
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
randomly chooses if it's gonna grow
 

745
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,389
randomly chooses if it's gonna grow
a seed here or not here or not you're

746
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
a seed here or not here or not you're
 

747
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,030
a seed here or not here or not you're
not

748
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
not
 

749
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,350
not
if you block those spots it just

750
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
if you block those spots it just
 

751
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,870
if you block those spots it just
decreases your odds of getting more

752
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
decreases your odds of getting more
 

753
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,230
decreases your odds of getting more
seeds that's why a lot of these only

754
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
seeds that's why a lot of these only
 

755
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,750
seeds that's why a lot of these only
have one

756
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
have one
 

757
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,949
have one
instead of two or more so yeah i think

758
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
instead of two or more so yeah i think
 

759
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,829
instead of two or more so yeah i think
probably the best arrangement is gonna

760
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839
probably the best arrangement is gonna
 

761
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,509
probably the best arrangement is gonna
be

762
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
be
 

763
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,110
be
like we have over here alternate like

764
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
like we have over here alternate like
 

765
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,430
like we have over here alternate like
this

766
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
this
 

767
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,110
this
you still have a straight line like you

768
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
you still have a straight line like you
 

769
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,629
you still have a straight line like you
can run down like this

770
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
can run down like this
 

771
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,150
can run down like this
get the seed pods the only ones you

772
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
get the seed pods the only ones you
 

773
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,269
get the seed pods the only ones you
aren't going to get are the ones that

774
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
aren't going to get are the ones that
 

775
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,069
aren't going to get are the ones that
grow in between

776
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
grow in between
 

777
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,430
grow in between
these two blocks might be a bit

778
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440
these two blocks might be a bit
 

779
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,670
these two blocks might be a bit
bit tricky i had an idea though we're

780
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
bit tricky i had an idea though we're
 

781
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,910
bit tricky i had an idea though we're
going to try another thing here

782
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
going to try another thing here
 

783
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,750
going to try another thing here
maybe the secrets to coarse fruit farms

784
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
maybe the secrets to coarse fruit farms
 

785
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,189
maybe the secrets to coarse fruit farms
is the horse you know what

786
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
is the horse you know what
 

787
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,550
is the horse you know what
i actually have a good feeling about

788
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
i actually have a good feeling about
 

789
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,870
i actually have a good feeling about
this because we uh i tried jumping

790
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
this because we uh i tried jumping
 

791
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,550
this because we uh i tried jumping
around on top of these it wasn't

792
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
around on top of these it wasn't
 

793
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,350
around on top of these it wasn't
too too bad but if we have a horse

794
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360

 

795
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,629

like you're not going to fall through

796
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:10,639
like you're not going to fall through
 

797
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,310
like you're not going to fall through
the spaces then right if you have a

798
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:12,320
the spaces then right if you have a
 

799
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,509
the spaces then right if you have a
jumping horses

800
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:13,519
jumping horses
 

801
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,069
jumping horses
especially maybe with jumping potions

802
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
especially maybe with jumping potions
 

803
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,470
especially maybe with jumping potions
like look how easy it is to get around

804
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480
like look how easy it is to get around
 

805
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,990
like look how easy it is to get around
this is the way to do it

806
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
this is the way to do it
 

807
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,350
this is the way to do it
right harvest

808
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
right harvest
 

809
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,030
right harvest
harvesting speed is slower if you're on

810
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
harvesting speed is slower if you're on
 

811
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,110
harvesting speed is slower if you're on
a horse cuts it in half but

812
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
a horse cuts it in half but
 

813
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,749
a horse cuts it in half but
still

814
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:33,759

 

815
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,749

i don't know though i think maybe a seed

816
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:35,759
i don't know though i think maybe a seed
 

817
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,230
i don't know though i think maybe a seed
farm would be faster

818
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
farm would be faster
 

819
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,310
farm would be faster
because it's about two three seconds

820
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
because it's about two three seconds
 

821
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,870
because it's about two three seconds
between each one i'm i'm picking here

822
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:44,880

 

823
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,550

but while with the seed farm you could

824
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
but while with the seed farm you could
 

825
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,870
but while with the seed farm you could
probably just run down and get them all

826
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880

 

827
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,710

all right anyways let's uh let's get

828
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:52,720
all right anyways let's uh let's get
 

829
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,230
all right anyways let's uh let's get
back to building here so one thing i'm

830
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
back to building here so one thing i'm
 

831
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,030
back to building here so one thing i'm
gonna do

832
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,040
gonna do
 

833
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,389
gonna do
is try the mycelium outs i don't have a

834
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399
is try the mycelium outs i don't have a
 

835
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,870
is try the mycelium outs i don't have a
lot of this stuff though

836

839
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,550
i think that's cool right like they're
pretty close in color uh to get rid of

840
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
pretty close in color uh to get rid of
 

841
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,069
pretty close in color uh to get rid of
the grass i'm just gonna go by with the

it should turn back to dirt over time

846
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
it should turn back to dirt over time
 

847
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,629
it should turn back to dirt over time
and then my ceiling won't be able to

848
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:10,639
and then my ceiling won't be able to
 

849
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,949
and then my ceiling won't be able to
spread to it i hope

850
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959

 

851
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,110

um the edges here though we got to watch

852
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
um the edges here though we got to watch
 

853
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,470
um the edges here though we got to watch
out because i think enderman will be

854
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
out because i think enderman will be
 

855
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,990
out because i think enderman will be
able to pick up these blocks we might

856
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000
able to pick up these blocks we might
 

857
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,870
able to pick up these blocks we might
need

858
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880
need
 

859
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,790
need
some special block on the edges that

860
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
some special block on the edges that
 

861
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,550
some special block on the edges that
they can't grab

862
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
they can't grab
 

863
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,150
they can't grab
and also lighting on the ground would be

864
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
and also lighting on the ground would be
 

865
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,670
and also lighting on the ground would be
nice too so this is

866
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
nice too so this is
 

867
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,030
nice too so this is
lit up at night

868
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040

 

869
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,910

man i can't believe this guys i just

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,790
man i can't believe this guys i just
realized

872
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
realized
 

873
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,230
realized
the dumbest thing this is probably

874
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
the dumbest thing this is probably
 

875
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,829
the dumbest thing this is probably
common knowledge but i just

876
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
common knowledge but i just
 

877
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,310
common knowledge but i just
i just thought of it horse pillars

878
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
i just thought of it horse pillars
 

879
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,670
i just thought of it horse pillars
oh man the greatest thing ever you know

880
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
oh man the greatest thing ever you know
 

881
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,269
oh man the greatest thing ever you know
i'm pretty sure that black horse died by

882
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279
i'm pretty sure that black horse died by
 

883
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,110
i'm pretty sure that black horse died by
the way i think he jumped into a jacket

884
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120
the way i think he jumped into a jacket
 

885
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,310
the way i think he jumped into a jacket
so i was trying to figure out what to do

886
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
so i was trying to figure out what to do
 

887
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,509
so i was trying to figure out what to do
with this guy

888
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
with this guy
 

889
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,350
with this guy
and it just hit me why don't i just

890
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
and it just hit me why don't i just
 

891
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,949
and it just hit me why don't i just
build a pillar that's four blocks tall

892
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
build a pillar that's four blocks tall
 

893
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:55,430
build a pillar that's four blocks tall
because

894
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
because
 

895
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,189
because
the ai in the game won't fall if it's uh

896
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
the ai in the game won't fall if it's uh
 

897
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,710
the ai in the game won't fall if it's uh
it only falls if it's three blocks or

898
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
it only falls if it's three blocks or
 

899
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,150
it only falls if it's three blocks or
less sort of thing so if it's four

900
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
less sort of thing so if it's four
 

901
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,030
less sort of thing so if it's four
blocks

902
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
blocks
 

903
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,110
blocks
they just stay there they can't path

904
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
they just stay there they can't path
 

905
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,710
they just stay there they can't path
find their way down

906
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
find their way down
 

907
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,549
find their way down
so yeah why don't i just do that

908
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
so yeah why don't i just do that
 

909
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,110
so yeah why don't i just do that
i i have no idea usually what i would do

910
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,120
i i have no idea usually what i would do
 

911
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,110
i i have no idea usually what i would do
before that if i just wanted a quick

912
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
before that if i just wanted a quick
 

913
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,590
before that if i just wanted a quick
stopping point for a horse i would dig a

914
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:17,600
stopping point for a horse i would dig a
 

915
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,230
stopping point for a horse i would dig a
hole like this a two by two

916
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
hole like this a two by two
 

917
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,630
hole like this a two by two
right oops park the horse down here

918
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
right oops park the horse down here
 

919
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,390
right oops park the horse down here
then i'd i'd take away one block so i

920
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
then i'd i'd take away one block so i
 

921
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,630
then i'd i'd take away one block so i
can get out myself the problem with this

922
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
can get out myself the problem with this
 

923
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,909
can get out myself the problem with this
though is i often found

924
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919
though is i often found
 

925
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,669
though is i often found
my horses were glitching into the blocks

926
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
my horses were glitching into the blocks
 

927
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,110
my horses were glitching into the blocks
and suffocating

928
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
and suffocating
 

929
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,270
and suffocating
and also if i tried to find my horse

930
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
and also if i tried to find my horse
 

931
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,350
and also if i tried to find my horse
again a lot of times i couldn't because

932
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
again a lot of times i couldn't because
 

933
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,430
again a lot of times i couldn't because
they're below ground right you can't see

934
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,440
they're below ground right you can't see
 

935
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,390
they're below ground right you can't see
them too well

936
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,400
them too well
 

937
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,830
them too well
if they're up on a pillar though it's

938
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:41,840
if they're up on a pillar though it's
 

939
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,590
if they're up on a pillar though it's
just like oh

940
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
just like oh
 

941
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,590
just like oh
i'm over here oh snap i'm gonna be doing

942
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
i'm over here oh snap i'm gonna be doing
 

943
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,830
i'm over here oh snap i'm gonna be doing
that a lot

944
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
that a lot
 

945
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,909
that a lot
from now on yes greatest thing okay back

946
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
from now on yes greatest thing okay back
 

947
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,270
from now on yes greatest thing okay back
to the course fruit farm so i got the

948
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
to the course fruit farm so i got the
 

949
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,950
to the course fruit farm so i got the
mycelium spreading

950
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
mycelium spreading
 

951
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,710
mycelium spreading
uh what we're gonna do this is the very

952
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
uh what we're gonna do this is the very
 

953
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,230
uh what we're gonna do this is the very
edge here this is where the water is

954
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
edge here this is where the water is
 

955
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,270
edge here this is where the water is
going to end

956
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
going to end
 

957
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,190
going to end
at this block we're removing right now

958
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200

 

959
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,190

so let's get rid of this we'll change it

960
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,200
so let's get rid of this we'll change it
 

961
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,630
so let's get rid of this we'll change it
out with something more

962
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
out with something more
 

963
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,310
out with something more
permanent let's use stone bricks

964
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
permanent let's use stone bricks
 

965
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,390
permanent let's use stone bricks
i like these with my celium as well so

966
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
i like these with my celium as well so
 

967
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,150
i like these with my celium as well so
if assuming this is what we're going to

968
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
if assuming this is what we're going to
 

969
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,190
if assuming this is what we're going to
keep

970
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
keep
 

971
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,950
keep
i think stone brick is a good match with

972
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
i think stone brick is a good match with
 

973
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,270
i think stone brick is a good match with
mycelium

974
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280
mycelium
 

975
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,150
mycelium
all right so water ends on this block

976
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
all right so water ends on this block
 

977
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,590
all right so water ends on this block
then the coarse fruit is going to fall

978
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
then the coarse fruit is going to fall
 

979
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:27,990
then the coarse fruit is going to fall
down to

980
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
down to
 

981
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,110
down to
this this row here let's uh balance it

982
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120
this this row here let's uh balance it
 

983
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,789
this this row here let's uh balance it
out by putting more bricks on the other

984
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
out by putting more bricks on the other
 

985
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,870
out by putting more bricks on the other
side

986
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:34,880
side
 

987
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,870
side
and then in between here we're going to

988
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
and then in between here we're going to
 

989
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,110
and then in between here we're going to
run water streams or possibly a hopper

990
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
run water streams or possibly a hopper
 

991
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,470
run water streams or possibly a hopper
minecart i haven't cited yet

992
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
minecart i haven't cited yet
 

993
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,510
minecart i haven't cited yet
oops and then over here we got

994
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
oops and then over here we got
 

995
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,270
oops and then over here we got
i i measured it out so we would have

996
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
i i measured it out so we would have
 

997
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,029
i i measured it out so we would have
five blocks

998
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
five blocks
 

999
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,909
five blocks
and then the stone brick on both sides

1000
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:51,919
and then the stone brick on both sides
 

1001
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,190
and then the stone brick on both sides
right

1002
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
right
 

1003
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,230
right
this i may make into the new path block

1004
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
this i may make into the new path block
 

1005
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,549
this i may make into the new path block
i'm not sure

1006
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559

 

1007
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,110

does that kind of go with the mycelium

1008
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120

 

1009
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,909

i don't know it might be a good idea

1010
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
i don't know it might be a good idea
 

1011
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,549
i don't know it might be a good idea
because we have

1012
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
because we have
 

1013
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,110
because we have
like i want to transform this whole area

1014
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,120
like i want to transform this whole area
 

1015
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,870
like i want to transform this whole area

1016
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
quite a bit not just like this course

it would be nice to do a little bit of

1022
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
it would be nice to do a little bit of
 

1023
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,510
it would be nice to do a little bit of
terraforming

1024
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
terraforming
 

1025
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,590
terraforming
like we have for example a fence over

1026
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
like we have for example a fence over
 

1027
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,190
like we have for example a fence over
here fence over there

1028
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
here fence over there
 

1029
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,710

it would be nice to have a path running

1030
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
it would be nice to have a path running
 

1031
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,390
it would be nice to have a path running
down the middle here so maybe do that

1032
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
down the middle here so maybe do that
 

1033
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,310
down the middle here so maybe do that
out of the path blocks

1034
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
out of the path blocks
 

1035
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,150
out of the path blocks
sort of thing maybe make a nice gate to

1036
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,160
sort of thing maybe make a nice gate to
 

1037
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,590
sort of thing maybe make a nice gate to
our village to get inside

1038
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:33,600

 

1039
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,350

could do a lot of improvements in this

1040
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,360
could do a lot of improvements in this
 

1041
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,510
could do a lot of improvements in this
area

all right uh this i guess would have to

1044
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
all right uh this i guess would have to
 

1045
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,230
all right uh this i guess would have to
go up a block then if this is the level

1046
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240
go up a block then if this is the level
 

1047
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,789
go up a block then if this is the level

because it takes up an extra spot and it

1080
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
because it takes up an extra spot and it
 

1081
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,950
because it takes up an extra spot and it
blocks the screen quite a bit i don't

all that much so i don't think i'm going

1086
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:26,159
all that much so i don't think i'm going
 

1087
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,029
all that much so i don't think i'm going
to be using it just in general play

1088
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,039

 

1089
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,710

i just love watching these things grow

i just love watching these things grow
 

1091
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,549
i just love watching these things grow
after i plant them because they change

1092
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
after i plant them because they change
 

1093
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,029
after i plant them because they change
so quickly like they grow so fast

1094
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,039
so quickly like they grow so fast
 

1095
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,630
so quickly like they grow so fast
it's like non-stop you see things moving

1096
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:40,640
it's like non-stop you see things moving
 

1097
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,510
it's like non-stop you see things moving
it's pretty cool i like it so we got our

1098
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:43,520
it's pretty cool i like it so we got our
 

1099
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,029
it's pretty cool i like it so we got our
path down the middle here

1100
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:45,039
path down the middle here
 

1101
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,190
path down the middle here
and what we're gonna have to do is get a

1102
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200
and what we're gonna have to do is get a
 

1103
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,270
and what we're gonna have to do is get a
water stream at the top

1104
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280
water stream at the top
 

1105
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,430
water stream at the top
that will harvest these and also wash

1106
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440
that will harvest these and also wash
 

1107
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,110
that will harvest these and also wash
all the the coarse fruit

1108

all the the coarse fruit
 

1109
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,950
all the the coarse fruit
down the slope here i put some stairs

1110
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
down the slope here i put some stairs
 

1111
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,430
down the slope here i put some stairs
to separate the layers here i hope this

1112
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,440
to separate the layers here i hope this
 

1113
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,669
to separate the layers here i hope this
works okay i'm not sure if it will

1114
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:01,679
works okay i'm not sure if it will
 

1115
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,430
works okay i'm not sure if it will
i'm worried items might get stuck in

1116
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
i'm worried items might get stuck in
 

1117
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,029
i'm worried items might get stuck in
this little uh

1118
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:05,039
this little uh
 

1119
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,510
this little uh
missing section but i think i think they

1120
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,520
missing section but i think i think they
 

1121
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,270
missing section but i think i think they
just bounce off right

1122
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
just bounce off right
 

1123
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,270
just bounce off right
if i'm not mistaken the nice thing about

1124
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,280
if i'm not mistaken the nice thing about
 

1125
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,190
if i'm not mistaken the nice thing about
using a stair is we can just walk up the

1126
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,200
using a stair is we can just walk up the
 

1127
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,110
using a stair is we can just walk up the
next level too

1128
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120
next level too
 

1129
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,470
next level too
which will be pretty convenient when

1130
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
which will be pretty convenient when
 

1131
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,909
which will be pretty convenient when
we're we're planting that way i don't

1132
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
we're we're planting that way i don't
 

1133
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,909
we're we're planting that way i don't
have to jump all the time

1134
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
have to jump all the time
 

1135
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,950
have to jump all the time
uh i also am getting the seed firm set

1136
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:22,960
uh i also am getting the seed firm set
 

1137
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,470
uh i also am getting the seed firm set
up i'm still on the fence about this

1138
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480
up i'm still on the fence about this
 

1139
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,990
up i'm still on the fence about this
whole idea

1140
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
whole idea
 

1141
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,590
whole idea
i'll tell you what let's go sleep real

1142
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
i'll tell you what let's go sleep real
 

1143
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,430
i'll tell you what let's go sleep real
quick here

1144
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,440
quick here
 

1145
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,029
quick here
yeah i'm not too sure if we're doing the

1146
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:31,039
yeah i'm not too sure if we're doing the
 

1147
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,029
yeah i'm not too sure if we're doing the
seed firm or not

1148
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:33,039
seed firm or not
 

1149
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,710
seed firm or not
we'll try it out in just a second here

1150
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
we'll try it out in just a second here
 

1151
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,110
we'll try it out in just a second here
i feel like it's almost too much work

1152
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,120
i feel like it's almost too much work
 

1153
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,470
i feel like it's almost too much work
for too little return with it

1154
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,480
for too little return with it
 

1155
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,510
for too little return with it
um the horse idea was decent

1156
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
um the horse idea was decent
 

1157
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,350
um the horse idea was decent
the other idea we could try is maybe

1158
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,360
the other idea we could try is maybe
 

1159
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,190
the other idea we could try is maybe
just setting up uh

1160
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
just setting up uh
 

1161
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,510
just setting up uh
one wide paths above the course fruit

1162
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520
one wide paths above the course fruit
 

1163
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,510
one wide paths above the course fruit
farm that we can walk on and hopefully

1164
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:53,520
farm that we can walk on and hopefully
 

1165
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,110
farm that we can walk on and hopefully
reach some of the seeds and

1166
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,120
reach some of the seeds and
 

1167
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,310
reach some of the seeds and
break them before we harvest it

1168
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
break them before we harvest it
 

1169
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,390
break them before we harvest it
i don't know let's go try out the seed

1170
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:00,400
i don't know let's go try out the seed
 

1171
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,230
i don't know let's go try out the seed
farm see if it's got some potential or

1172
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,240
farm see if it's got some potential or
 

1173
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,230
farm see if it's got some potential or
not

1174
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,240
not
 

1175
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,510
not
all right so

1176
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,520

 

1177
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,270

if we look at these how did they do this

1178
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:09,280
if we look at these how did they do this
 

1179
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,830
if we look at these how did they do this
one has two

1180
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:10,840
one has two
 

1181
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,909
one has two
one two

1182
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
one two
 

1183
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,190
one two
one oh no that's a two one one

1184
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,200
one oh no that's a two one one
 

1185
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,029
one oh no that's a two one one
two one it seems like maybe one and a

1186
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:21,039
two one it seems like maybe one and a
 

1187
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,669
two one it seems like maybe one and a
half

1188
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
half
 

1189
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,350
half
profits roughly

1190
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,360
profits roughly
 

1191
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,909
profits roughly
so it's not perfect see what i wanted to

1192
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919
so it's not perfect see what i wanted to
 

1193
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,830
so it's not perfect see what i wanted to
do is just to be able to run down a

1194
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840
do is just to be able to run down a
 

1195
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,390
do is just to be able to run down a
single

1196
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,400
single
 

1197
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,270
single
line here and get all the seeds but we

1198
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,280
line here and get all the seeds but we
 

1199
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,950
line here and get all the seeds but we
would have to do that like four times

1200
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
would have to do that like four times
 

1201
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,710
would have to do that like four times
now

1202
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
now
 

1203
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,110
now
because you'd run down like this

1204
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,120
because you'd run down like this
 

1205
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,909
because you'd run down like this
we got eight from that then you'd run

1206
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
we got eight from that then you'd run
 

1207
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,990
we got eight from that then you'd run
down the middle

1208
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,000
down the middle
 

1209
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,669
down the middle
the middle you get a few more

1210
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679
the middle you get a few more
 

1211
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,830
the middle you get a few more
all right and then you'd run down this

1212
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:52,840
all right and then you'd run down this
 

1213
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,669
all right and then you'd run down this
side

1214
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
side
 

1215
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,789
side
it's a little bit of work see now the

1216
00:22:58,789 --> 00:22:58,799
it's a little bit of work see now the
 

1217
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,230
it's a little bit of work see now the
problem is getting the ones in the

1218
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
problem is getting the ones in the
 

1219
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,669
problem is getting the ones in the
middle

1220
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
middle
 

1221
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,390
middle
uh one thing we could do is just like do

1222
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
uh one thing we could do is just like do
 

1223
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,950
uh one thing we could do is just like do
this

1224
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:04,960
this
 

1225
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,510
this
and hope we get them be like a 50 50

1226
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
and hope we get them be like a 50 50
 

1227
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,149
and hope we get them be like a 50 50
chance

1228
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:10,159

 

1229
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,789

um or we could very meticulously try to

1230
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
um or we could very meticulously try to
 

1231
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,110
um or we could very meticulously try to
get them and make sure we do it

1232
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
get them and make sure we do it
 

1233
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,590
get them and make sure we do it
afterwards uh the best thing to do would

1234
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:17,600
afterwards uh the best thing to do would
 

1235
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,390
afterwards uh the best thing to do would
probably be have

1236
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,400
probably be have
 

1237
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,029
probably be have
water break the remaining stems that way

1238
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
water break the remaining stems that way
 

1239
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,789
water break the remaining stems that way
we don't have to waste time with it

1240
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:24,799

 

1241
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,350

and also uh waste acts durability too

1242
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
and also uh waste acts durability too
 

1243
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,789
and also uh waste acts durability too
that's another thing

1244
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:28,799
that's another thing
 

1245
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,070
that's another thing
with all the the braking you do it

1246
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080
with all the the braking you do it
 

1247
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,909
with all the the braking you do it
actually wears up the axe pretty quick

1248
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:35,919
actually wears up the axe pretty quick
 

1249
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:36,870
actually wears up the axe pretty quick
all right

1250
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
all right
 

1251
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,110
all right
so yeah

1252
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
so yeah
 

1253
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,390
so yeah
that would have netted us maybe 20 seeds

1254
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
that would have netted us maybe 20 seeds
 

1255
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,510
that would have netted us maybe 20 seeds
bonus

1256
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520
bonus
 

1257
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,230
bonus
15 to 20 from that amount to work i

1258
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
15 to 20 from that amount to work i
 

1259
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,590
15 to 20 from that amount to work i
don't know if it's really worth it or

1260
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
don't know if it's really worth it or
 

1261
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,590
don't know if it's really worth it or
not

1262
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,600
not
 

1263
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,110
not
um the other thing we could do

1264
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
um the other thing we could do
 

1265
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,789
um the other thing we could do
is just like have something above the

1266
00:23:58,789 --> 00:23:58,799
is just like have something above the
 

1267
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,190
is just like have something above the
farm

1268
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
farm
 

1269
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,310
farm
and hope it grows around it maybe

1270
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320
and hope it grows around it maybe
 

1271
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,909
and hope it grows around it maybe
like if you had something going like

1272
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:05,919
like if you had something going like
 

1273
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,430
like if you had something going like
this

1274
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
this
 

1275
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,710
this
all the way across you could probably

1276
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,720
all the way across you could probably
 

1277
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,750
all the way across you could probably
reach a lot of the seeds

1278
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:13,760
reach a lot of the seeds
 

1279
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,310
reach a lot of the seeds
oh maybe not like you could get all

1280
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
oh maybe not like you could get all
 

1281
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,630
oh maybe not like you could get all
these easy

1282
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640

 

1283
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,230

i don't know i'm still thinking about

1284
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,240
i don't know i'm still thinking about
 

1285
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,669
i don't know i'm still thinking about
this i'm not sure i've

1286
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:23,679
this i'm not sure i've
 

1287
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,830
this i'm not sure i've
i've hit the right solution solution

1288
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840
i've hit the right solution solution
 

1289
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,230
i've hit the right solution solution
just yet

1290
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,240
just yet
 

1291
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,149
just yet
well anyways guys i think we'll have to

1292
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:30,159
well anyways guys i think we'll have to
 

1293
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,990
well anyways guys i think we'll have to
try to finish this up next episode

1294
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,000
try to finish this up next episode
 

1295
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,990
try to finish this up next episode
we got a little bit left to do on it we

1296
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,000
we got a little bit left to do on it we
 

1297
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,190
we got a little bit left to do on it we
got to do like the

1298
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
got to do like the
 

1299
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,149
got to do like the
the water release and water stream stuff

1300
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
the water release and water stream stuff
 

1301
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,990
the water release and water stream stuff
auto collection

1302
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,000
auto collection
 

1303
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,430
auto collection
we gotta do the auto smelter room or

1304
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:43,440
we gotta do the auto smelter room or
 

1305
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,470
we gotta do the auto smelter room or
whatever

1306
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
whatever
 

1307
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,549
whatever
and just a lot of polish in this area

1308
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:46,559
and just a lot of polish in this area
 

1309
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,669
and just a lot of polish in this area
would be nice

1310
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
would be nice
 

1311
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,149
would be nice
my current thinking is to not do the

1312
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
my current thinking is to not do the
 

1313
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,990
my current thinking is to not do the
seed farm unless you guys have an idea

1314
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
seed farm unless you guys have an idea
 

1315
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,909
seed farm unless you guys have an idea
of how to make it better

1316
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:53,919
of how to make it better
 

1317
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,390
of how to make it better
let me know in the comments if you do

1318
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:56,400
let me know in the comments if you do
 

1319
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,750
let me know in the comments if you do
but instead we'll

1320
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:57,760
but instead we'll
 

1321
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,870
but instead we'll
have to try to figure out some way of

1322
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:58,880
have to try to figure out some way of
 

1323
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,590
have to try to figure out some way of
harvesting those on on the top there

1324
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
harvesting those on on the top there
 

1325
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,430
harvesting those on on the top there
because this is a lot faster to grab

1326
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
because this is a lot faster to grab
 

1327
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,669
because this is a lot faster to grab
those and to to plant those

1328
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
