i cut a line up to the sky there

132
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
i cut a line up to the sky there
 

133
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,509
i cut a line up to the sky there
so sunlight can get down these doors are

134
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
so sunlight can get down these doors are
 

135
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,949
so sunlight can get down these doors are
facing

136
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
facing
 

137
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,190
facing
uh this way here so this is considered

138
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
uh this way here so this is considered
 

139
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,630
uh this way here so this is considered
like the outside

140
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
like the outside
 

141
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,270
like the outside
this area and i know from when we were

142
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
this area and i know from when we were
 

143
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,790
this area and i know from when we were
working on emerald village

144
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
working on emerald village
 

145
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,150
working on emerald village
you only need like a a two block space

146
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
you only need like a a two block space
 

147
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,790
you only need like a a two block space
that's one wide for it to count as a

148
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
that's one wide for it to count as a
 

149
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,430
that's one wide for it to count as a
house

150
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
house
 

151
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,229
house
so i think this will work uh it just

152
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
so i think this will work uh it just
 

153
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,149
so i think this will work uh it just
needs a little bit of space so this is

154
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
needs a little bit of space so this is
 

155
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,869
needs a little bit of space so this is
this is outside here so i think at night

156
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
this is outside here so i think at night
 

157
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,149
this is outside here so i think at night
time they're going to come in

158
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
time they're going to come in
 

159
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,589
time they're going to come in
here and then they'll probably wander

160
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
here and then they'll probably wander
 

161
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,309
here and then they'll probably wander
around the cave but we'll see

162
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
around the cave but we'll see
 

163
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,070
around the cave but we'll see
that's if they recognize these as houses

164
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
that's if they recognize these as houses
 

165
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,470
that's if they recognize these as houses
so i got that one ready

166
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
so i got that one ready
 

167
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,550

a little bit nicer yet too if if this

198
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
a little bit nicer yet too if if this
 

199
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,229
a little bit nicer yet too if if this
works

200
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
works
 

201
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,229
works
but my plan my plan is to

202
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
but my plan my plan is to
 

203
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,710
but my plan my plan is to
free the villagers and then have the

204
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
free the villagers and then have the
 

205
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,229
free the villagers and then have the
zombies chase them down the tunnel and

206
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
zombies chase them down the tunnel and
 

207
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,630
zombies chase them down the tunnel and
hopefully that works

208
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
hopefully that works
 

209
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,830
hopefully that works
um i was not able to have pistons under

210
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
um i was not able to have pistons under
 

211
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,270
um i was not able to have pistons under
these half slabs though because when

212
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
these half slabs though because when
 

213
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,869
these half slabs though because when
they're stepping on the pressure plates

214
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
they're stepping on the pressure plates
 

215
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,309
they're stepping on the pressure plates
it was powering the pistons and i

216
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
it was powering the pistons and i
 

217
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,990
it was powering the pistons and i
couldn't get them to move

218
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
couldn't get them to move
 

219
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,189
couldn't get them to move
when they were in the powered state

220
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
when they were in the powered state
 

221
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,509
when they were in the powered state
uh so to free them i'll just have to do

222
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
uh so to free them i'll just have to do
 

223
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,830
uh so to free them i'll just have to do
it manually

224
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
it manually
 

225
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,189

as i was hoping

296
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
as i was hoping
 

297
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,150
as i was hoping
maybe i made the tunnel too wide it was

298
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
maybe i made the tunnel too wide it was
 

299
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,590
maybe i made the tunnel too wide it was
two blocks wide or

300
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600
two blocks wide or
 

301
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,390
two blocks wide or
less it would work perfect i think

302
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400

 

303
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,870

if they're at the edge like this it's

304
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
if they're at the edge like this it's
 

305
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,710
if they're at the edge like this it's
like they don't want to go sometimes

306
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
like they don't want to go sometimes
 

307
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,990
like they don't want to go sometimes
the zombie can get by them

308
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000

which is fine if they see this as a

376
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
which is fine if they see this as a
 

377
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,189

379
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,710

they have not found this house yet

380
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
they have not found this house yet
 

381
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,670
they have not found this house yet
though and that's what's really

382
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
though and that's what's really
 

383
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,869
though and that's what's really
important that they find

384
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
important that they find
 

385
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,110
important that they find
this one because it has seven more doors

386
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
this one because it has seven more doors
 

387
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,390
this one because it has seven more doors
in

388
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
in
 

389
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,869
in
and in total that would be 14 doors

390
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
and in total that would be 14 doors
 

391
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,869
and in total that would be 14 doors
which would support four villagers but

which would support four villagers but
 

393
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,469
which would support four villagers but
if they only find that one house

394
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
if they only find that one house
 

395
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,830
if they only find that one house
it's only enough to support two

396
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
it's only enough to support two
 

397
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,510

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,710

normally and the mob sorters up there so

514
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
normally and the mob sorters up there so
 

515
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,509
normally and the mob sorters up there so
normally

516
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
normally
 

517
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,430
normally
the mobs will fall down creeper will go

518
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
the mobs will fall down creeper will go
 

519
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,750
the mobs will fall down creeper will go
down this water here and then fall down

520
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
down this water here and then fall down
 

521
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,110
down this water here and then fall down
the hole

522
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
the hole
 

523
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,829
the hole
but we have these piston setups as well

524
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
but we have these piston setups as well
 

525
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,750
but we have these piston setups as well
that allow us to switch the direction

526
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
that allow us to switch the direction
 

527
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,710
that allow us to switch the direction
of the water stream now instead of going

528
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
of the water stream now instead of going
 

529
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,509
of the water stream now instead of going
to the right

530
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
to the right
 

531
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,750
to the right
the water goes to the left that one's

532
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
the water goes to the left that one's
 

533
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,110
the water goes to the left that one's
for the creeper

534
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
for the creeper
 

535
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,470
for the creeper
this one is for the skeleton i believe

536
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480

 

537
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,509

and that will

538
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519

 

539
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,790

let's get some more scaffolding

540
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
let's get some more scaffolding
 

541
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,470
let's get some more scaffolding
that will bring the water or and the

542
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
that will bring the water or and the
 

543
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,710
that will bring the water or and the
mobs up to this point here

544
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
mobs up to this point here
 

545
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,310
mobs up to this point here
i would like them to i think fall down

546
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
i would like them to i think fall down
 

547
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,389
i would like them to i think fall down
over at this place here so let's uh

548
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
over at this place here so let's uh
 

549
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,590
over at this place here so let's uh
set that up

550
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
set that up
 

551
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,230
set that up
like that i don't know if you can hear

552
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
like that i don't know if you can hear
 

553
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,069
like that i don't know if you can hear
the lawnmower outside but it's probably

554
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
the lawnmower outside but it's probably
 

555
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,389
the lawnmower outside but it's probably
gonna get picked up in this video

556
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
gonna get picked up in this video
 

557
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,829
gonna get picked up in this video
it's been going for like an hour

558
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839

 

559
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,310

um

560
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320

 

561
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,269

yeah so why actually no not let's not

562
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:43,279
yeah so why actually no not let's not
 

563
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,629
yeah so why actually no not let's not
use a sign there we're gonna use

564
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
use a sign there we're gonna use
 

565
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,590
use a sign there we're gonna use
trapdoors

566
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
trapdoors
 

567
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,910
trapdoors
uh because we did something similar to

568
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
uh because we did something similar to
 

569
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,190
uh because we did something similar to
this up at the mobs

570
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
this up at the mobs
 

571
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,550
this up at the mobs
order where is that

572
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560

 

573
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,550

where is that yeah over here so what

574
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
where is that yeah over here so what
 

575
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,790
where is that yeah over here so what
we're doing is we're pushing the mobs

576
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
we're doing is we're pushing the mobs
 

577
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,750
we're doing is we're pushing the mobs
uh down this pipe they get to the trap

578
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
uh down this pipe they get to the trap
 

579
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,910
uh down this pipe they get to the trap
door and they stop and then it opens and

580
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:05,920
door and they stop and then it opens and
 

581
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,710
door and they stop and then it opens and
closes

582
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
closes
 

583
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,629
closes
really quick so it only allows one mob

584
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
really quick so it only allows one mob
 

585
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,790
really quick so it only allows one mob
to get through and we got to do the same

586
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
to get through and we got to do the same
 

587
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,470
to get through and we got to do the same
for each of these because we only want

588
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
for each of these because we only want
 

589
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,790
for each of these because we only want
one skeleton and one creeper to get

590
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800
one skeleton and one creeper to get
 

591
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,590
one skeleton and one creeper to get
through at a time

592
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,600
through at a time
 

593
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,949
through at a time
if possible so let's

594
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
if possible so let's
 

595
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:29,750
if possible so let's
let's try to do it the same way

596
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760

 

597
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,110

all right oops

598
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
all right oops
 

599
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,550
all right oops
oops let's place some more glass

600
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
oops let's place some more glass
 

601
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,269
oops let's place some more glass
why not all right

602
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279

 

603
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,629

okay so trapdoors will control allowing

604
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
okay so trapdoors will control allowing
 

605
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,110
okay so trapdoors will control allowing
them

606
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
them
 

607
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,389
them
uh to fall down there let's see what

608
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
uh to fall down there let's see what
 

609
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,910
uh to fall down there let's see what
else

610
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
else
 

611
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,670
else
so i got to extend this water stream

612
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:51,680
so i got to extend this water stream
 

613
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,590
so i got to extend this water stream
with the signs and whatnot

614
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
with the signs and whatnot
 

615
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,470
with the signs and whatnot
here can we put one

616
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480

 

617
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,150

i think we got to put one

618
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160

 

619
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,990

all right and build this up

620
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000

 

621
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,150

and we can get water there i'm going to

622
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
and we can get water there i'm going to
 

623
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,590
and we can get water there i'm going to
work on this just a little bit to get

624
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
work on this just a little bit to get
 

625
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:13,910
work on this just a little bit to get
this

626
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
this
 

627
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,310
this
uh section done it's going to be a bit

628
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
uh section done it's going to be a bit
 

629
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,230
uh section done it's going to be a bit
repetitive

630
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240

 

631
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,310

there we go we got this pipe sorted done

632
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
there we go we got this pipe sorted done
 

633
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,350
there we go we got this pipe sorted done
now

634
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,360
now
 

635
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,590
now
so the water stream continues here

636
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
so the water stream continues here
 

637
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,550
so the water stream continues here
creepers will get pushed down the stream

638
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
creepers will get pushed down the stream
 

639
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,150
creepers will get pushed down the stream
up to the trap door and then this is

640
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
up to the trap door and then this is
 

641
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,509
up to the trap door and then this is
going to be controlled by redstone to

642
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
going to be controlled by redstone to
 

643
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,750
going to be controlled by redstone to
open and close really quick like that

644
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
open and close really quick like that
 

645
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,430
open and close really quick like that
they'll fall down and this is our next

646
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
they'll fall down and this is our next
 

647
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,030
they'll fall down and this is our next
section here

648
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
section here
 

649
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,150
section here
and the skeleton pipe is much the same

650
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
and the skeleton pipe is much the same
 

651
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,550
and the skeleton pipe is much the same
not sure if we can get into it

652
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560

 

653
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,670

let's try here

654
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680

 

655
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,509

this thing just had to be above us so i

656
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
this thing just had to be above us so i
 

657
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,790
this thing just had to be above us so i
can't walk on top

658
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
can't walk on top
 

659
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,990
can't walk on top
here it's not not enough space

660
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
here it's not not enough space
 

661
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,230
here it's not not enough space
um all right so skeletons they take this

662
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
um all right so skeletons they take this
 

663
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,069
um all right so skeletons they take this
route here

664
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
route here
 

665
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,189
route here
water gets extended and goes to this

666
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
water gets extended and goes to this
 

667
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,389
water gets extended and goes to this
trapdoor and then

668
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
trapdoor and then
 

669
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,189
trapdoor and then
same thing in fact we could probably

670
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,199
same thing in fact we could probably
 

671
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,550
same thing in fact we could probably
just set it up

672
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
just set it up
 

673
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,829
just set it up
uh so that we have

674
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
uh so that we have
 

675
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,990
uh so that we have
let's see we'll put a block there

676
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
let's see we'll put a block there
 

677
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,189
let's see we'll put a block there
redstone between the trap door blocks

678
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
redstone between the trap door blocks
 

679
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,629
redstone between the trap door blocks
and then another one and we would just

680
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
and then another one and we would just
 

681
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,110
and then another one and we would just
need a repeater

682
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
need a repeater
 

683
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,710
need a repeater
send power to it and it would go through

684
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
send power to it and it would go through
 

685
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,670
send power to it and it would go through
both and control both at the same time

686
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680

 

687
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,990

that's the way we'll probably do it and

688
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
that's the way we'll probably do it and
 

689
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,509
that's the way we'll probably do it and
then we'll put our redstone over here

690
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
then we'll put our redstone over here
 

691
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,269
then we'll put our redstone over here
somewhere

692
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
somewhere
 

693
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,710
somewhere
um but let's go down this is where the

694
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
um but let's go down this is where the
 

695
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,389
um but let's go down this is where the
complicated stuff is going to come into

696
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
complicated stuff is going to come into
 

697
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:46,949
complicated stuff is going to come into
effect

698
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
effect
 

699
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,590
effect
down here i think i want to make

700
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
down here i think i want to make
 

701
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,749
down here i think i want to make
water streams down here as well

702
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
water streams down here as well
 

703
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,910
water streams down here as well
one there so the mobs will fall in water

704
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
one there so the mobs will fall in water
 

705
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,389
one there so the mobs will fall in water
so they don't take damage or anything

706
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
so they don't take damage or anything
 

707
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,829
so they don't take damage or anything
and let's see

708
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839

 

709
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,829

i think the way i had it before is i had

710
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:07,839
i think the way i had it before is i had
 

711
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,470
i think the way i had it before is i had
a piston here

712
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:10,480
a piston here
 

713
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,990
a piston here
that moves glass up and down to allow

714
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000
that moves glass up and down to allow
 

715
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,550
that moves glass up and down to allow
the mobs through or not

716
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560

 

717
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,990

this gets extended

718
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
this gets extended
 

719
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,350
this gets extended
right so that would mean

720
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,360

 

721
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,189

you guys probably don't remember what

722
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
you guys probably don't remember what
 

723
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,030
you guys probably don't remember what
we're doing here and you have no idea

724
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
we're doing here and you have no idea
 

725
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,310
we're doing here and you have no idea
what i'm talking about

726
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,320
what i'm talking about
 

727
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,949
what i'm talking about
but uh just keep watching it'll make

728
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
but uh just keep watching it'll make
 

729
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,829
but uh just keep watching it'll make
sense in a bit

730
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
sense in a bit
 

731
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,990
sense in a bit
so okay so

732
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
so okay so
 

733
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,710
so okay so
they'll come to here that means they're

734
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:40,720
they'll come to here that means they're
 

735
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,509
they'll come to here that means they're
going to be

736
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
going to be
 

737
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,910
going to be
standing about here when this piston is

738
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
standing about here when this piston is
 

739
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,550
standing about here when this piston is
up

740
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
up
 

741
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,910
up
so we need this a look through area here

742
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
so we need this a look through area here
 

743
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,389
so we need this a look through area here
so the skeleton and creeper

744
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
so the skeleton and creeper
 

745
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,790
so the skeleton and creeper
can have a clear passage to each other

746
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
can have a clear passage to each other
 

747
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,150
can have a clear passage to each other
because we gotta get the skeleton to

748
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
because we gotta get the skeleton to
 

749
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,670
because we gotta get the skeleton to
shoot the creeper to get him

750
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
shoot the creeper to get him
 

751
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,710
shoot the creeper to get him
angry at the skeleton so that when the

752
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720
angry at the skeleton so that when the
 

753
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,829
angry at the skeleton so that when the
two combine they explode

754
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839

 

755
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,029

um okay which

756
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
um okay which
 

757
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,110
um okay which
side does the snow golem go on i think

758
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
side does the snow golem go on i think
 

759
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,470
side does the snow golem go on i think
it's

760
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
it's
 

761
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,150
it's
creepers here snow golem must be over

762
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
creepers here snow golem must be over
 

763
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,829
creepers here snow golem must be over
here then so we need another one of

764
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839
here then so we need another one of
 

765
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,150
here then so we need another one of
these

766
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
these
 

767
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,429
these
sections

768
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439

 

769
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,150

snow golem goes right here yeah that's

770
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
snow golem goes right here yeah that's
 

771
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,630
snow golem goes right here yeah that's
that's right

772
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
that's right
 

773
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,110
that's right
we'll taste that

774
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120

 

775
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,270

i i shouldn't build with this much glass

776
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
i i shouldn't build with this much glass
 

777
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,190
i i shouldn't build with this much glass
it's hard to see stuff

778
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
it's hard to see stuff
 

779
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,430
it's hard to see stuff
oh even for me this this starts to look

780
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
oh even for me this this starts to look
 

781
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,350
oh even for me this this starts to look
really weird

782
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
really weird
 

783
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,310
really weird
um all right so

784
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,320
um all right so
 

785
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,710
um all right so
we're gonna put pistons above here if we

786
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
we're gonna put pistons above here if we
 

787
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,230
we're gonna put pistons above here if we
can hopefully

788
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
can hopefully
 

789
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,549
can hopefully
these trap doors and that redstone up

790
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
these trap doors and that redstone up
 

791
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,789
these trap doors and that redstone up
there's not gonna interfere

792
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:52,799
there's not gonna interfere
 

793
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,230
there's not gonna interfere
i bet you it is yeah it is darn it

794
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
i bet you it is yeah it is darn it
 

795
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,150
i bet you it is yeah it is darn it
yeah i gotta lower this even more at

796
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
yeah i gotta lower this even more at
 

797
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,070
yeah i gotta lower this even more at
least one or two more blocks these these

798
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
least one or two more blocks these these
 

799
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,070
least one or two more blocks these these
pipes need to be extended

800
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080

 

801
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,590

all right i took care of that it's a

802
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
all right i took care of that it's a
 

803
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,029
all right i took care of that it's a
little bit lower now and i don't think

804
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
little bit lower now and i don't think
 

805
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,549
little bit lower now and i don't think
the redstone is going to interfere

806
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559
the redstone is going to interfere
 

807
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,390
the redstone is going to interfere
anymore

808
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
anymore
 

809
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,510
anymore
uh so these these streams when the

810
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,520
uh so these these streams when the
 

811
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,789
uh so these these streams when the
pistons go down

812
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:14,799
pistons go down
 

813
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,669
pistons go down
here we want it so that

814
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
here we want it so that
 

815
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,590
here we want it so that
the mobs will then fall again so i'm

816
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
the mobs will then fall again so i'm
 

817
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,669
the mobs will then fall again so i'm
gonna put a sign here

818
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:23,679
gonna put a sign here
 

819
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,470
gonna put a sign here
keep the water from flowing down and

820
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
keep the water from flowing down and
 

821
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,710
keep the water from flowing down and
we're gonna start another tube

822
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720

 

823
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,630

there and there

824
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:34,640

 

825
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,390

get that over there

826
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400

 

827
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,470

that there okay so now it should be safe

828
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
that there okay so now it should be safe
 

829
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,950
that there okay so now it should be safe
if we

830
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:42,960
if we
 

831
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,070
if we
do this right yeah

832
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
do this right yeah
 

833
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,029
do this right yeah
okay so i'll run you through the steps

834
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
okay so i'll run you through the steps
 

835
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,070
okay so i'll run you through the steps
to this

836
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,080
to this
 

837
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,510
to this
this is what i plan on doing those back

838
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
this is what i plan on doing those back
 

839
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,390
this is what i plan on doing those back
up

840
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
up
 

841
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,750
up
and we might have to go build this in

842
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
and we might have to go build this in
 

843
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,270
and we might have to go build this in
creative i'm not sure it's actually

844
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
creative i'm not sure it's actually
 

845
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,270
creative i'm not sure it's actually
pretty tough to build

846
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
pretty tough to build
 

847
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,950
pretty tough to build
here uh what what i want to do

848
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
here uh what what i want to do
 

849
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,070
here uh what what i want to do
so we got the two streams uh skeleton

850
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
so we got the two streams uh skeleton
 

851
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,390
so we got the two streams uh skeleton
and creeper and then off to the side

852
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400
and creeper and then off to the side
 

853
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,070
and creeper and then off to the side
here there's also going to be

854
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
here there's also going to be
 

855
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,789
here there's also going to be
snow golem so let's get him in there

856
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799

 

857
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,510

and he's staying alive good good this is

858
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
and he's staying alive good good this is
 

859
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,029
and he's staying alive good good this is
river biome

860
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,039

 

861
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,029

some biomes they just die instantly and

862
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
some biomes they just die instantly and
 

863
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,470
some biomes they just die instantly and
so it's a good thing we didn't

864
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
so it's a good thing we didn't
 

865
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,950
so it's a good thing we didn't
get stuck in one of those so

866
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960

 

867
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,230

instead of actually

868
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,240

 

869
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,950

let's go back up here just real quick

870
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
let's go back up here just real quick
 

871
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,549
let's go back up here just real quick
instead of doing this actually where we

872
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
instead of doing this actually where we
 

873
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,150
instead of doing this actually where we
open them both at the same time we'll

874
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
open them both at the same time we'll
 

875
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,789
open them both at the same time we'll
probably do it

876
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
probably do it
 

877
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,789
probably do it
individually first we'll open the

878
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
individually first we'll open the
 

879
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,830
individually first we'll open the
skeleton trapdoor

880
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
skeleton trapdoor
 

881
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,750
skeleton trapdoor
and the skeleton is going to fall down

882
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
and the skeleton is going to fall down
 

883
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,029
and the skeleton is going to fall down
here

884
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:49,039
here
 

885
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,789
here
into this stream and he's going to get

886
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
into this stream and he's going to get
 

887
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,070
into this stream and he's going to get
pushed up to

888
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
pushed up to
 

889
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,710
pushed up to
this wall right and then

890
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:56,720
this wall right and then
 

891
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,789
this wall right and then
once he gets to this place here we need

892
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
once he gets to this place here we need
 

893
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,150
once he gets to this place here we need
these two pistons

894
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,160
these two pistons
 

895
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,710
these two pistons
to retract pull up the glass block

896
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:04,720
to retract pull up the glass block
 

897
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,470
to retract pull up the glass block
so that the snow golem can see the

898
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
so that the snow golem can see the
 

899
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,390
so that the snow golem can see the
skeleton and take a

900
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,400
skeleton and take a
 

901
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,029
skeleton and take a
take a swing at him and then

902
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:13,039

 

903
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,470

the skeleton's gonna get hit by a

904
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:14,480
the skeleton's gonna get hit by a
 

905
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,549
the skeleton's gonna get hit by a
snowball

906
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
snowball
 

907
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,789
snowball
and then we want to knock him onto a

908
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
and then we want to knock him onto a
 

909
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,630
and then we want to knock him onto a
pressure plate

910
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
pressure plate
 

911
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,230
pressure plate
let's set that up here

912
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240

 

913
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,640

do a stone pressure plate

914
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:26,650
do a stone pressure plate
 

915
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,190
do a stone pressure plate
[Music]

916
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,200
[Music]
 

917
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,190
[Music]
and then we want a piston up over

918
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
and then we want a piston up over
 

919
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,110
and then we want a piston up over
here to push him back into the water

920
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
here to push him back into the water
 

921
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,870
here to push him back into the water
stream

922
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
stream
 

923
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,549
stream
like that so we need this pressure plate

924
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
like that so we need this pressure plate
 

925
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,430
like that so we need this pressure plate
to power that piston

926
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
to power that piston
 

927
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,350
to power that piston
let's maybe do it like this whoops

928
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,360
let's maybe do it like this whoops
 

929
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,549
let's maybe do it like this whoops
no that's another advantage if we were

930
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:52,559
no that's another advantage if we were
 

931
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,270
no that's another advantage if we were
to go build this

932
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
to go build this
 

933
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,070
to go build this
in creative i could fly that would be a

934
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,080
in creative i could fly that would be a
 

935
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,630
in creative i could fly that would be a
lot easier

936
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640

 

937
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,470

nope let's do it up here

938
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:04,480

 

939
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,270

and i got redstone good so connect that

940
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,280
and i got redstone good so connect that
 

941
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,310
and i got redstone good so connect that
to the pressure plate up to the piston

942
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,320

 

943
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,830

and the pressure plate holds the water

944
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
and the pressure plate holds the water
 

945
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,149
and the pressure plate holds the water
in place so yeah

946
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
in place so yeah
 

947
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,470
in place so yeah
if this if this skeleton gets hit by a

948
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
if this if this skeleton gets hit by a
 

949
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,909
if this if this skeleton gets hit by a
snowball he's gonna get pushed into this

950
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
snowball he's gonna get pushed into this
 

951
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:20,710
snowball he's gonna get pushed into this
pressure plate

952
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:20,720
pressure plate
 

953
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,470
pressure plate
and then that's gonna activate this

954
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
and then that's gonna activate this
 

955
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,390
and then that's gonna activate this
redstone and push him back

956
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
redstone and push him back
 

957
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,470
redstone and push him back
this is also going to then go and

958
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
this is also going to then go and
 

959
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,669
this is also going to then go and
release the creeper up there

960
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:29,679
release the creeper up there
 

961
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,830
release the creeper up there
so creeper will fall down here get put

962
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:31,840
so creeper will fall down here get put
 

963
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,430
so creeper will fall down here get put
between the skeleton and this

964
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:33,440
between the skeleton and this
 

965
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,029
between the skeleton and this
and the snow golem these pistons lift up

966
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,039
and the snow golem these pistons lift up
 

967
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,310
and the snow golem these pistons lift up
again once more

968
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
again once more
 

969
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,270
again once more
and that will make the snow golem and

970
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,280
and that will make the snow golem and
 

971
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,909
and that will make the snow golem and
the skeleton take a shot at the creeper

972
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
the skeleton take a shot at the creeper
 

973
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,270
the skeleton take a shot at the creeper
creeper's going to get angry at the

974
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
creeper's going to get angry at the
 

975
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,310
creeper's going to get angry at the
skeleton

976
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,320
skeleton
 

977
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,630
skeleton
and then we want these pistons to go

978
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
and then we want these pistons to go
 

979
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,270
and then we want these pistons to go
down

980
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280

 

981
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,310

and the angry creeper and skeleton will

982
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
and the angry creeper and skeleton will
 

983
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:54,710
and the angry creeper and skeleton will
get

984
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
get
 

985
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,230
get
sent down the tubes and then when we

986
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
sent down the tubes and then when we
 

987
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,990
sent down the tubes and then when we
want them to blow up we

988
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
want them to blow up we
 

989
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,789
want them to blow up we
combine them somewhere down the line so

990
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
combine them somewhere down the line so
 

991
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,669
combine them somewhere down the line so
that's the

992
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:01,679
that's the
 

993
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,710
that's the
overall overall plan behind this

994
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720

 

995
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,149

now how to do it all um

996
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
now how to do it all um
 

997
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,510
now how to do it all um
yeah i'm going to hop into a creative

998
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,520
yeah i'm going to hop into a creative
 

999
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,350
yeah i'm going to hop into a creative
world just to simplify this and i'll

1000
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
world just to simplify this and i'll
 

1001
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,310
world just to simplify this and i'll
show you

1002
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,320
show you
 

1003
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,789
show you
what i figure out there i guess

1004
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799

 

1005
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,669

i got it guys check it out this is what

1006
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
i got it guys check it out this is what
 

1007
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,230
i got it guys check it out this is what
we need to build it is so cool

1008
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,240
we need to build it is so cool
 

1009
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,830
we need to build it is so cool
um so what it is or what i did

1010
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
um so what it is or what i did
 

1011
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,630
um so what it is or what i did
i ended up putting some trip wires

1012
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
i ended up putting some trip wires
 

1013
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,789
i ended up putting some trip wires
inside these water stream things so

1014
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
inside these water stream things so
 

1015
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,789
inside these water stream things so
i can detect when the skeleton enters

1016
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
i can detect when the skeleton enters
 

1017
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,190
i can detect when the skeleton enters
here and when the creeper enters his

1018
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
here and when the creeper enters his
 

1019
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,029
here and when the creeper enters his
and if they're in there still because

1020
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
and if they're in there still because
 

1021
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,390
and if they're in there still because
another thing we got to worry about is

1022
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,400
another thing we got to worry about is
 

1023
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,789
another thing we got to worry about is
when

1024
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
when
 

1025
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,549
when
if they were to despawn if it's going to

1026
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
if they were to despawn if it's going to
 

1027
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,310
if they were to despawn if it's going to
wreck the system we got to be able to

1028
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,320
wreck the system we got to be able to
 

1029
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,430
wreck the system we got to be able to
handle that too

1030
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440

 

1031
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,510

but yeah this is this is what it does

1032
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,520
but yeah this is this is what it does
 

1033
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,549
but yeah this is this is what it does
get ready for this

1034
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559
get ready for this
 

1035
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,510
get ready for this
so we got skeletons in this dispenser

1036
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,520
so we got skeletons in this dispenser
 

1037
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,270
so we got skeletons in this dispenser
and creepers in this one

1038
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,280
and creepers in this one
 

1039
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:07,669
and creepers in this one
when we release a skeleton

1040
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679

 

1041
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,590

that's so cool it's like a million

1042
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:09,600
that's so cool it's like a million
 

1043
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,110
that's so cool it's like a million
things happen in this little area

1044
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,120
things happen in this little area
 

1045
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,909
things happen in this little area

it doesn't work 100 though i have to
still

1048
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
still
 

1049
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:23,110
still
fix a few things

1050
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
fix a few things
 

1051
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,390
fix a few things
oh so much stuff happens there okay so

1052
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
oh so much stuff happens there okay so
 

1053
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,310
oh so much stuff happens there okay so
after the skeleton gets released he

1054
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
after the skeleton gets released he
 

1055
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,830
after the skeleton gets released he
activates the trip wire

1056
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:29,840
activates the trip wire
 

1057
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,950
activates the trip wire
that tripwire then tells these

1058
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:32,960
that tripwire then tells these
 

1059
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,270
that tripwire then tells these
uh pistons to pull up like we like we

1060
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,280
uh pistons to pull up like we like we
 

1061
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,990
uh pistons to pull up like we like we
said before

1062
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
said before
 

1063
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,830
said before
they get pulled up for just over a

1064
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:37,840
they get pulled up for just over a
 

1065
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,270
they get pulled up for just over a
second

1066
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,280
second
 

1067
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,990
second
um that's controlled by this here this

1068
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,000
um that's controlled by this here this
 

1069
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,710
um that's controlled by this here this
is uh

1070
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
is uh
 

1071
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,269
is uh
connected to the tripwire this redstone

1072
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:45,279
connected to the tripwire this redstone
 

1073
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:45,990
connected to the tripwire this redstone
here

1074
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
here
 

1075
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,269
here
that goes to a monostable

1076
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:49,279
that goes to a monostable
 

1077
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,990
that goes to a monostable
thing and we have one for the creeper as

1078
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,000
thing and we have one for the creeper as
 

1079
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,029
thing and we have one for the creeper as
well

1080
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
well
 

1081
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,789
well
that goes to this this is a pulse

1082
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:54,799
that goes to this this is a pulse
 

1083
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,630
that goes to this this is a pulse
extender which makes it go

1084
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
extender which makes it go
 

1085
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,830
extender which makes it go
the signal lasts over a second and then

1086
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
the signal lasts over a second and then
 

1087
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,110
the signal lasts over a second and then
that goes up to

1088
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,120
that goes up to
 

1089
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,190
that goes up to
an inverter and to the pistons

1090
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,200
an inverter and to the pistons
 

1091
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,510
an inverter and to the pistons
so

1092
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520

 

1093
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,549

see that stays on for just over a second

1094
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
see that stays on for just over a second
 

1095
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,230
see that stays on for just over a second
that time it glitched out it looks like

1096
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
that time it glitched out it looks like
 

1097
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,310
that time it glitched out it looks like
this the golem missed

1098
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
this the golem missed
 

1099
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,070
this the golem missed
hitting the skeleton so he didn't get

1100
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,080
hitting the skeleton so he didn't get
 

1101
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,310
hitting the skeleton so he didn't get
knocked onto that pressure plate

1102
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320
knocked onto that pressure plate
 

1103
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,269
knocked onto that pressure plate
uh so i'll probably have to add a clock

1104
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:23,279
uh so i'll probably have to add a clock
 

1105
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,149
uh so i'll probably have to add a clock
on here

1106
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159
on here
 

1107
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,830
on here
if that happens to try again um

1108
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
if that happens to try again um
 

1109
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,350
if that happens to try again um
they never miss the creeper though when

1110
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
they never miss the creeper though when
 

1111
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,590
they never miss the creeper though when
he's in there but since the skeleton's a

1112
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:31,600
he's in there but since the skeleton's a
 

1113
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,950
he's in there but since the skeleton's a
little bit further away

1114
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
little bit further away
 

1115
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,110
little bit further away
it's a farther target and he sometimes

1116
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,120
it's a farther target and he sometimes
 

1117
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,110
it's a farther target and he sometimes
misses

1118
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,120
misses
 

1119
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,710
misses
time set zero but yeah that

1120
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
time set zero but yeah that
 

1121
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:49,510
time set zero but yeah that
is pretty cool

1122
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520

 

1123
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,909

all right and then the idea is we move

1126
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000
all right and then the idea is we move
 

1127
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,149
all right and then the idea is we move
the explosion to whatever we want to

1128
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:58,159
the explosion to whatever we want to
 

1129
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:58,789
the explosion to whatever we want to
blow up

1130
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
blow up
 

1131
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,430
blow up

so much lately is because we're

1180
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,120
so much lately is because we're
 

1181
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,710
so much lately is because we're
resetting the map

1182
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:58,720
resetting the map
 

1183
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,390
resetting the map
and we've had that plan for a couple

1184
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,400
and we've had that plan for a couple
 

1185
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,549
and we've had that plan for a couple
months now and it's just sort of

1186
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
months now and it's just sort of
 

1187
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,149
months now and it's just sort of
discouraged me from building anything

1188
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:04,159
discouraged me from building anything
 

1189
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,750
discouraged me from building anything
because it's going to get

1190
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:05,760
because it's going to get
 

1191
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,230
because it's going to get
