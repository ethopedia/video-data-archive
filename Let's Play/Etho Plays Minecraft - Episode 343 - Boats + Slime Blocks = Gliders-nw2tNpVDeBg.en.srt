and I thought it would be a good idea

16
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:33,330
and I thought it would be a good idea

just wanted to show you two really

simple and fun command blocks you can

26
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,180
simple and fun command blocks you can
 

27
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,110
simple and fun command blocks you can
use if you want to blow something up the

28
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,120
use if you want to blow something up the
 

29
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,420
use if you want to blow something up the
first one here is a redstone clock that

30
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:50,430
first one here is a redstone clock that
 

31
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,150
first one here is a redstone clock that
activates 20 times per second it's

32
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,160
activates 20 times per second it's
 

33
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,430
activates 20 times per second it's
really simple and then this one here is

34
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
really simple and then this one here is
 

35
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,210
really simple and then this one here is
the thing that places TNT below my feet

36
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:58,220
the thing that places TNT below my feet
 

37
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,040
the thing that places TNT below my feet
so if I activate it with that redstone

38
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,050
so if I activate it with that redstone
 

39
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,660
so if I activate it with that redstone
block anywhere I walk we summon some TNT

40
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:05,670
block anywhere I walk we summon some TNT
 

41
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,999
block anywhere I walk we summon some TNT
below us and if we ever want to disable

42
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:08,009
below us and if we ever want to disable
 

43
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:09,980
below us and if we ever want to disable
this we can put another block by it and

44
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:09,990
this we can put another block by it and
 

45
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,469
this we can put another block by it and
then break this one otherwise if you

46
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
then break this one otherwise if you
 

47
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,820
then break this one otherwise if you
want if you try to break it it won't let

48
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:13,830
want if you try to break it it won't let
 

49
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,270
want if you try to break it it won't let
you but anyway so this place is TNT

50
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
you but anyway so this place is TNT
 

51
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,160
you but anyway so this place is TNT
below your feet and it lets you do these

52
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,170
below your feet and it lets you do these
 

53
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,580
below your feet and it lets you do these
trails in the sky which are pretty cool

54
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:21,590
trails in the sky which are pretty cool
 

55
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,560
trails in the sky which are pretty cool
because when you activate this it

56
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:24,570
because when you activate this it
 

57
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,560
because when you activate this it
follows a chain for forever pretty much

58
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:27,570
follows a chain for forever pretty much
 

59
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,520
follows a chain for forever pretty much
as long as you make it go and it's just

60
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:31,530
as long as you make it go and it's just
 

61
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,410
as long as you make it go and it's just
like an ongoing chain of explosions

62
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:33,420
like an ongoing chain of explosions
 

63
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,990
like an ongoing chain of explosions
which is pretty cool you make them for

64
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
which is pretty cool you make them for
 

65
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,450
which is pretty cool you make them for
shapes in the sky and fly around if you

66
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:38,460
shapes in the sky and fly around if you
 

67
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,530
shapes in the sky and fly around if you
want you can see some sometimes it

68
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:42,540
want you can see some sometimes it
 

69
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,730
want you can see some sometimes it

and you make it chase you

80
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:00,470

 

81
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,160

oh man oh it blew up the commandblocks

84
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:12,819
oh man oh it blew up the commandblocks
 

85
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,000
oh man oh it blew up the commandblocks
good well not the command box the

86
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,010
good well not the command box the
 

87
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,460
good well not the command box the

I've been looking forward to this for a
while and I think I think today's a day

108
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
while and I think I think today's a day
 

109
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,440

we are going to be starting our new base

110
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:00,450
we are going to be starting our new base
 

111
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,759
we are going to be starting our new base
we've been at the man cave here for a

112
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:02,769
we've been at the man cave here for a
 

113
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:04,650
we've been at the man cave here for a
long time and we've been finishing

114
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:04,660
long time and we've been finishing
 

115
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,630
long time and we've been finishing
things and making things look nice and

116
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
things and making things look nice and
 

117
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,820
things and making things look nice and
that's been great and all that but I

118
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:08,830
that's been great and all that but I
 

119
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,259
that's been great and all that but I
think it's time we venture out and and

120
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:12,269
think it's time we venture out and and
 

121
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:16,610
think it's time we venture out and and
made me start building somewhere else I

122
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:16,620
made me start building somewhere else I
 

123
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,390
made me start building somewhere else I
love that we're not by any means leaving

124
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:21,400
love that we're not by any means leaving
 

125
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,979
love that we're not by any means leaving
the man cave behind here or anything

126
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:22,989
the man cave behind here or anything
 

127
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,449
the man cave behind here or anything
we're gonna be going back and forth and

128
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:24,459
we're gonna be going back and forth and
 

129
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:25,979
we're gonna be going back and forth and
we'll probably work on things at the new

130
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:25,989
we'll probably work on things at the new
 

131
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,229
we'll probably work on things at the new
base and things over here and just break

132
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
base and things over here and just break
 

133
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,880
base and things over here and just break
it up a little bit have a little more

134
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:29,890
it up a little bit have a little more
 

135
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,580
it up a little bit have a little more
variety so I think maybe the best way of

136
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:32,590
variety so I think maybe the best way of
 

137
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,530
variety so I think maybe the best way of
doing this let's head out to where we're

138
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:34,540
doing this let's head out to where we're
 

139
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,110
doing this let's head out to where we're
gonna put our new base which is at that

140
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
gonna put our new base which is at that
 

141
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,940
gonna put our new base which is at that

episodes ago now I checked the video

146
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,049
episodes ago now I checked the video
 

147
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:46,319
episodes ago now I checked the video
today thankfully I saved the coordinates

148
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:46,329
today thankfully I saved the coordinates
 

149
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:49,199
today thankfully I saved the coordinates
there it's at like zero X and negative

150
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:49,209
there it's at like zero X and negative
 

151
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,150
there it's at like zero X and negative
five thousand Zed so it's a little ways

152
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,160
five thousand Zed so it's a little ways
 

153
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,880
five thousand Zed so it's a little ways
out I think our nether track will take

154
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:53,890
out I think our nether track will take
 

155
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,910
out I think our nether track will take
us partway there as Oh we'll head out

156
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:56,920
us partway there as Oh we'll head out
 

157
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,080
us partway there as Oh we'll head out
there and then I'll go over the plans

158
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,090
there and then I'll go over the plans
 

159
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,670
there and then I'll go over the plans
for the new base because we're gonna be

160
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
for the new base because we're gonna be
 

161
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,349
for the new base because we're gonna be
doing it a little different than like

162
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:01,359
doing it a little different than like
 

163
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:10,229
doing it a little different than like
what we're doing here all right so this

164
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
what we're doing here all right so this
 

165
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,640
what we're doing here all right so this
is actually pretty good we have a rail

166
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:11,650
is actually pretty good we have a rail
 

167
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,200
is actually pretty good we have a rail
line that goes about halfway here

168
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,210
line that goes about halfway here
 

169
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,290
line that goes about halfway here
and then we had like this path that we

170
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:17,300
and then we had like this path that we
 

171
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,320
and then we had like this path that we
can walk the rest of the way except for

172
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,330
can walk the rest of the way except for
 

173
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,890
can walk the rest of the way except for
about a hundred blocks I had to dig more

174
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:22,900
about a hundred blocks I had to dig more
 

175
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,180
about a hundred blocks I had to dig more
my shovel has silk touch by the way

176
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,190
my shovel has silk touch by the way
 

177
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,260
my shovel has silk touch by the way
that's why I'm not using it I need a

178
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,270
that's why I'm not using it I need a
 

179
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,200
that's why I'm not using it I need a
piece of Flint which we just got all

180
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,210
piece of Flint which we just got all
 

181
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,600
piece of Flint which we just got all
right so this portal this is from before

182
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:31,610
right so this portal this is from before
 

183
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,160
right so this portal this is from before
I think we've got some horses out of

184
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,170
I think we've got some horses out of
 

185
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,590
I think we've got some horses out of
here before that's why I had that block

186
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
here before that's why I had that block
 

187
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,300
here before that's why I had that block
there so I dug all this just now

188
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,310
there so I dug all this just now
 

189
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,180
there so I dug all this just now
unfortunately I did not bring torches

190
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,190
unfortunately I did not bring torches
 

191
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,270
unfortunately I did not bring torches
always planning ahead this goes about a

192
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:46,280
always planning ahead this goes about a
 

193
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,960
always planning ahead this goes about a
hundred blocks give or take and I think

194
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:49,970
hundred blocks give or take and I think
 

195
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,460
hundred blocks give or take and I think
this is where we need to be so hungry so

196
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,470
this is where we need to be so hungry so
 

197
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,320
this is where we need to be so hungry so
hungry

198
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,330
hungry
 

199
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,070
hungry
this was like negative 625 629 whatever

200
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
this was like negative 625 629 whatever
 

201
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,870
this was like negative 625 629 whatever
then it goes down to about zero and I

202
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
then it goes down to about zero and I
 

203
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,220
then it goes down to about zero and I
believe this is where we need our new

204
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,230
believe this is where we need our new
 

205
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,080
believe this is where we need our new
portal so let's go ahead and set that up

206
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,090
portal so let's go ahead and set that up
 

207
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,640
portal so let's go ahead and set that up
I brought an enderchest with us I'll

208
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:12,650
I brought an enderchest with us I'll
 

209
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,390
I brought an enderchest with us I'll
need a piece of iron did not think of

210
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
need a piece of iron did not think of
 

211
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,450
need a piece of iron did not think of
bringing a flint and steel though woops

212
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:18,460
bringing a flint and steel though woops
 

213
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,270
bringing a flint and steel though woops
that's fine we'll just put it over here

214
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
that's fine we'll just put it over here
 

215
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,380
that's fine we'll just put it over here
so yeah

216
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:23,390
so yeah
 

217
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,670
so yeah
I had to improvise there cool so I

218
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
I had to improvise there cool so I
 

219
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,030
I had to improvise there cool so I
pretty sure this is going to be the

220
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,040
pretty sure this is going to be the
 

221
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,580
pretty sure this is going to be the
flower forest we'll check it out go

222
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:36,590
flower forest we'll check it out go
 

223
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,690
flower forest we'll check it out go
ahead and break that and we got to find

224
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:37,700
ahead and break that and we got to find
 

225
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,850
ahead and break that and we got to find
a specific spot where we're gonna start

226
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:39,860
a specific spot where we're gonna start
 

227
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,970
a specific spot where we're gonna start
out - there was a lot of good looking

228
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:42,980
out - there was a lot of good looking
 

229
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:48,210
out - there was a lot of good looking
places here so it might be tough man oh

230
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:48,220
places here so it might be tough man oh
 

231
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,360
places here so it might be tough man oh
I'm gonna be sad if this is all snow now

232
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,370
I'm gonna be sad if this is all snow now
 

233
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,540
I'm gonna be sad if this is all snow now
please tell me this is not snow this is

234
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:55,550
please tell me this is not snow this is
 

235
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:02,650
please tell me this is not snow this is
the area this is extreme hills okay so

236
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:02,660
the area this is extreme hills okay so
 

237
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,740
the area this is extreme hills okay so
we're just right by the biome apparently

238
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:07,750

 

239
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,760

mmm guessing we gotta go this way

240
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:11,770
mmm guessing we gotta go this way
 

241
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,130
mmm guessing we gotta go this way
wait maybe it was like negative 50 100

242
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:15,140
wait maybe it was like negative 50 100
 

243
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,850
wait maybe it was like negative 50 100
it might be this way actually we're off

244
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:18,860
it might be this way actually we're off
 

245
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,100
it might be this way actually we're off
just a little bit

246
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,110

 

247
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,969

yes so the reason why I've decided to

248
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:26,979
yes so the reason why I've decided to
 

249
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:28,890
yes so the reason why I've decided to
start a new new base I want to dedicate

250
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:28,900
start a new new base I want to dedicate
 

251
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,450
start a new new base I want to dedicate
this new base to the slime blocks I want

252
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:33,460
this new base to the slime blocks I want
 

253
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,830
this new base to the slime blocks I want
to start having some fun with those I

254
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:34,840
to start having some fun with those I
 

255
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,209
to start having some fun with those I
haven't really done anything with them

256
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:36,219
haven't really done anything with them
 

257
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:38,459
haven't really done anything with them
yet usually when something like that

258
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:38,469
yet usually when something like that
 

259
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:40,950
yet usually when something like that
comes out I try to incorporate it into

260
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
comes out I try to incorporate it into
 

261
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,869
comes out I try to incorporate it into
what I've built already had a few ideas

262
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:45,879
what I've built already had a few ideas
 

263
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:48,300
what I've built already had a few ideas
but overall I think the mancave might

264
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,310
but overall I think the mancave might
 

265
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,570
but overall I think the mancave might
just be a little bit too too finished if

266
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:51,580
just be a little bit too too finished if
 

267
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,990
just be a little bit too too finished if
I'm to say that there's not really a lot

268
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm to say that there's not really a lot
 

269
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,709
I'm to say that there's not really a lot
of space to squeeze any extra like slime

270
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:58,719
of space to squeeze any extra like slime
 

271
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,779
of space to squeeze any extra like slime
block devices in with what we got built

272
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:00,789
block devices in with what we got built
 

273
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:03,659
block devices in with what we got built
already and also since we're underground

274
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:03,669
already and also since we're underground
 

275
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:05,850
already and also since we're underground
in the cave it does not work too well

276
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:05,860
in the cave it does not work too well
 

277
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,490
in the cave it does not work too well
for the slime blocks because they're all

278
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:08,500
for the slime blocks because they're all
 

279
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,129
for the slime blocks because they're all
about like launching you around and

280
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:11,139
about like launching you around and
 

281
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,350
about like launching you around and
launching things and there's not enough

282
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
launching things and there's not enough
 

283
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,529
launching things and there's not enough
space in a cave but this biome here this

284
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:16,539
space in a cave but this biome here this
 

285
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:18,659
space in a cave but this biome here this
is perfect because we got all this

286
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:18,669
is perfect because we got all this
 

287
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:21,809
is perfect because we got all this
vertical Heights there's layers it looks

288
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:21,819
vertical Heights there's layers it looks
 

289
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:26,129
vertical Heights there's layers it looks
amazing and one of the reasons people

290
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:26,139
amazing and one of the reasons people
 

291
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:28,589
amazing and one of the reasons people
have told me they don't like amplify

292
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:28,599
have told me they don't like amplify
 

293
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:30,180
have told me they don't like amplify
terrain is because it's hard to get

294
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,190
terrain is because it's hard to get
 

295
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,869
terrain is because it's hard to get
around in it which is perfect absolutely

296
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:33,879
around in it which is perfect absolutely
 

297
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,730
around in it which is perfect absolutely
perfect that's exactly what I want I

298
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:35,740
perfect that's exactly what I want I
 

299
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,589
perfect that's exactly what I want I
want it tough to get around so that you

300
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
want it tough to get around so that you
 

301
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,779
want it tough to get around so that you
have to use the slime blocks to get

302
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:39,789
have to use the slime blocks to get
 

303
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:43,159
have to use the slime blocks to get
around so that's the plan we're gonna be

304
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,169
around so that's the plan we're gonna be
 

305
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:45,629
around so that's the plan we're gonna be
we're gonna be dedicating the area to

306
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:45,639
we're gonna be dedicating the area to
 

307
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,909
we're gonna be dedicating the area to
slime blocks and and having fun with

308
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919
slime blocks and and having fun with
 

309
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,939
slime blocks and and having fun with
them basically so let me look around a

310
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:50,949
them basically so let me look around a
 

311
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:52,589
them basically so let me look around a
little bit this area looks pretty nice

312
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:52,599
little bit this area looks pretty nice
 

313
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,010
little bit this area looks pretty nice
but I want to specifically find a spot

314
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,020
but I want to specifically find a spot
 

315
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,129
but I want to specifically find a spot
oh why am i I'm lagging uh this is the

316
00:07:59,129 --> 00:07:59,139
oh why am i I'm lagging uh this is the
 

317
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:05,600
oh why am i I'm lagging uh this is the
end no we're fine but I'll do it back

318
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:05,610
end no we're fine but I'll do it back
 

319
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,249

355
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,840
area we saw at first I think that is
actually where we're gonna settle down

371
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,970

yeah this spot right here doesn't this

look amazing especially I think this is
 

375
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,060
look amazing especially I think this is
the place right there this cliff in

376
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,070
the place right there this cliff in
 

377
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,680
the place right there this cliff in
particular is pretty incredible there's

378
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:45,690
particular is pretty incredible there's
 

379
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,750
particular is pretty incredible there's
so many different layers to it we've got

380
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
so many different layers to it we've got
 

381
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,060
so many different layers to it we've got
all these little overhanging areas

382
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,070
all these little overhanging areas
 

383
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,250
all these little overhanging areas
there's some floating islands we got

384
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:52,260
there's some floating islands we got
 

385
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,440
there's some floating islands we got
waterfalls nice trees down below there's

386
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,450
waterfalls nice trees down below there's
 

387
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,840
waterfalls nice trees down below there's
even more of those overhang areas nice

388
00:09:59,840 --> 00:09:59,850
even more of those overhang areas nice
 

389
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,440
even more of those overhang areas nice
dark spots and there's another big one

390
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,450
dark spots and there's another big one
 

391
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,600
dark spots and there's another big one
right there

392
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:04,610
right there
 

393
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,210
right there
we got this really cool formation here

394
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:08,220
we got this really cool formation here
 

395
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,590
we got this really cool formation here
it's like a tall narrow cliff with a

396
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:12,600
it's like a tall narrow cliff with a
 

397
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,200
it's like a tall narrow cliff with a
flat spot on top which is pretty cool

398
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,210

 

399
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,460

let's see what else do we got there's

400
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:19,470
let's see what else do we got there's
 

401
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,430
let's see what else do we got there's
another overhang down there clouds are

402
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:22,440
another overhang down there clouds are
 

403
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,690
another overhang down there clouds are
in the way though can't really see it

404
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:23,700
in the way though can't really see it
 

405
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,450
in the way though can't really see it
got the flowers everywhere lots of water

406
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:26,460
got the flowers everywhere lots of water
 

407
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,259
got the flowers everywhere lots of water
everywhere it's pretty nice

408
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:30,269
everywhere it's pretty nice
 

409
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:32,689
everywhere it's pretty nice
the question is though if we go over

410
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:32,699
the question is though if we go over
 

411
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,030
the question is though if we go over
here is it not gonna look good because

412
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
here is it not gonna look good because
 

413
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,449
here is it not gonna look good because
this is the spot that looks good yeah I

414
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:41,459
this is the spot that looks good yeah I
 

415
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,090
this is the spot that looks good yeah I
think this would be okay

416
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:43,100
think this would be okay
 

417
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,819
think this would be okay
like I think we should build on the

418
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:46,829
like I think we should build on the
 

419
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,530
like I think we should build on the
nicer-looking area because then when we

420
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:48,540
nicer-looking area because then when we
 

421
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,269
nicer-looking area because then when we
go back and take a look at our base it's

422
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:50,279
go back and take a look at our base it's
 

423
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,879
go back and take a look at our base it's
gonna look really cool it won't look as

424
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:52,889
gonna look really cool it won't look as
 

425
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,829
gonna look really cool it won't look as
nice when we're at our base though

426
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:54,839
nice when we're at our base though
 

427
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,530
nice when we're at our base though
because like this cliff is not quite as

428
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:57,540
because like this cliff is not quite as
 

429
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,660
because like this cliff is not quite as
cool as the one we're on right now but I

430
00:10:59,660 --> 00:10:59,670
cool as the one we're on right now but I
 

431
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,919
cool as the one we're on right now but I
think that's the way we should do it

432
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:00,929
think that's the way we should do it
 

433
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:04,480
think that's the way we should do it
anyway

434
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:04,490

 

435
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,540

man all right I'm excited we need to

436
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:08,550
man all right I'm excited we need to
 

437
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,790
man all right I'm excited we need to
figure out a spot to put our chests

438
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
figure out a spot to put our chests
 

439
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,689
figure out a spot to put our chests
maybe maybe let's venture over here like

440
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:14,699
maybe maybe let's venture over here like
 

441
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:16,910
maybe maybe let's venture over here like
a little works spot with a bed in that

442
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:16,920
a little works spot with a bed in that
 

443
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,400
a little works spot with a bed in that
just to get started and then we'll try

444
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:19,410
just to get started and then we'll try
 

445
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,199
just to get started and then we'll try
to settle in a little bit better as we

446
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:21,209
to settle in a little bit better as we
 

447
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:24,049
to settle in a little bit better as we
as we're here for a while oh we can see

448
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:24,059
as we're here for a while oh we can see
 

449
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,910
as we're here for a while oh we can see
snow over there and we got to be careful

450
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
snow over there and we got to be careful
 

451
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,139
snow over there and we got to be careful
with that maybe let's check out over

452
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:30,149
with that maybe let's check out over
 

453
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:34,910
with that maybe let's check out over
here there was kind of a flat flat area

454
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:34,920
here there was kind of a flat flat area
 

455
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,989
here there was kind of a flat flat area
here by a waterfall I think maybe not

456
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:40,999
here by a waterfall I think maybe not
 

457
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:46,429
here by a waterfall I think maybe not
it's pretty hilly around here I want up

458
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:46,439
it's pretty hilly around here I want up
 

459
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,829
it's pretty hilly around here I want up
high is as my starting base just because

460
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:48,839
high is as my starting base just because
 

461
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,900
high is as my starting base just because
it'll be easier to find until I get used

462
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:50,910
it'll be easier to find until I get used
 

463
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,090
it'll be easier to find until I get used
to the area yeah this is pretty good

464
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:56,100
to the area yeah this is pretty good
 

465
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,660
to the area yeah this is pretty good
look at this

466
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:56,670
look at this
 

467
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,730
look at this
yeah nice flat spot snow over there we

468
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:01,740
yeah nice flat spot snow over there we
 

469
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,319
yeah nice flat spot snow over there we
won't really build anything here I just

470
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:03,329
won't really build anything here I just
 

471
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:07,369
won't really build anything here I just
want to put my chests here okay everyone

00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:07,379
want to put my chests here okay everyone
 

473
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,889
want to put my chests here okay everyone
so I am starting to get pretty settled

474
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:09,899
so I am starting to get pretty settled
 

475
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,679
so I am starting to get pretty settled
here I brought over a few things I set

476
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:12,689
here I brought over a few things I set
 

477
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:14,660
here I brought over a few things I set
up a little base camp we got a portal to

478
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:14,670
up a little base camp we got a portal to
 

479
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,519
up a little base camp we got a portal to
go back and forth a little easier and

480
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:16,529
go back and forth a little easier and
 

481
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,179
go back and forth a little easier and
now we have to start building or

482
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:20,189
now we have to start building or
 

483
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:22,850
now we have to start building or
planning and it's it's it's making me

484
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:22,860
planning and it's it's it's making me
 

485
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,400
planning and it's it's it's making me
wonder where we should begin it's tough

486
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,410
wonder where we should begin it's tough
 

487
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,809

quickly so we should focus on ways of

496
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:37,860
quickly so we should focus on ways of
 

497
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,499
quickly so we should focus on ways of
getting around that's sort of the focus

do we need obsidian just take a little

524
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:19,980
do we need obsidian just take a little
 

525
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,200

right so I am wondering if we can

528
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,190
right so I am wondering if we can
 

529
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,410
right so I am wondering if we can
possibly make a way of getting from this

530
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:30,420
possibly make a way of getting from this

Hill to down over there you see where

532
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,290
Hill to down over there you see where
 

533
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,490
Hill to down over there you see where
the the trees are there those two trees

534

the the trees are there those two trees
 

535
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,910
the the trees are there those two trees
it might be too far we got to get used

536
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:40,920
it might be too far we got to get used
 

537
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,380
it might be too far we got to get used
to like what's possible and not possible

538
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:45,390
to like what's possible and not possible
 

539
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,000

with these slime blocks I kind of wish

540
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,010
with these slime blocks I kind of wish
 

541
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,620
with these slime blocks I kind of wish
they would launch you like twice as far

542
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:48,630
they would launch you like twice as far
 

543
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,040
they would launch you like twice as far
as they currently do there they're cool

544
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,050
as they currently do there they're cool
 

545
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,420
as they currently do there they're cool
and they're awesome and everything but

546
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:53,430
and they're awesome and everything but
 

547
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,560
and they're awesome and everything but
they are somewhat limited I feel with

548
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:57,570
they are somewhat limited I feel with
 

549
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,480
they are somewhat limited I feel with
the way that they're implemented

550
00:13:59,480 --> 00:13:59,490
the way that they're implemented
 

551
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,170
the way that they're implemented
currently I doubt they'll change that

552
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:03,180
currently I doubt they'll change that
 

553
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,200
currently I doubt they'll change that
though so we'll have to just get used to

554
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,210
though so we'll have to just get used to
 

555
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,190
though so we'll have to just get used to
it

556
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:09,200

 

557
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,680

all right so to make a boat launcher one

558
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:12,690
all right so to make a boat launcher one
 

559
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,280
all right so to make a boat launcher one
a dispenser here to supply the boat you

560
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,290
a dispenser here to supply the boat you
 

561
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,640
a dispenser here to supply the boat you
need water above that which will wait on

562
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:19,650
need water above that which will wait on
 

563
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,260
need water above that which will wait on
doing I suppose and let's put glass

564
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,270
doing I suppose and let's put glass
 

565
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,410
doing I suppose and let's put glass
around here no we don't have glass how

566
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:27,420
around here no we don't have glass how
 

567
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,730
around here no we don't have glass how
about what should we build this out

568
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:31,740
about what should we build this out
 

569
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,170
about what should we build this out
let's see you stone for now because we

570
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:33,180
let's see you stone for now because we
 

571
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,210
let's see you stone for now because we
might be moving this and basically water

572
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:38,220
might be moving this and basically water
 

573
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,150
might be moving this and basically water
will be here we want this this one

574
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,160
will be here we want this this one
 

575
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,520
will be here we want this this one
launcher here will we'll shoot the boat

576
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:43,530
launcher here will we'll shoot the boat
 

577
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,860
launcher here will we'll shoot the boat
upwards then we want one that shoots it

578
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:45,870
upwards then we want one that shoots it
 

579
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,380
upwards then we want one that shoots it
sideways out this direction so we can

580
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:48,390
sideways out this direction so we can
 

581
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:53,090
sideways out this direction so we can
hopefully make it to the hill the reason

582
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:53,100
hopefully make it to the hill the reason
 

583
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,590
hopefully make it to the hill the reason
we're doing a boat launcher by the way

584
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:54,600
we're doing a boat launcher by the way
 

585
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,900
we're doing a boat launcher by the way
is because I think we'll get a little

586
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:56,910
is because I think we'll get a little
 

587
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,740
is because I think we'll get a little
bit more air

588
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:57,750
bit more air
 

589
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:05,390
bit more air
time that way to actually launch a boat

590
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:05,400
time that way to actually launch a boat
 

591
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,590
time that way to actually launch a boat
maybe we will put a button over here

592
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:08,600
maybe we will put a button over here
 

593
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,450
maybe we will put a button over here
like this so you'll be in the boat

594
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:11,460
like this so you'll be in the boat
 

595
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,640
like this so you'll be in the boat
sitting over here and when it when

596
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:13,650
sitting over here and when it when
 

597
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,350
sitting over here and when it when
you're ready to go hit the button and

598
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
you're ready to go hit the button and
 

599
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,620
you're ready to go hit the button and
you'll get launched off right and I've

600
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:21,630
you'll get launched off right and I've
 

601
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,020
you'll get launched off right and I've
done this before you have to go I think

602
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,030
done this before you have to go I think
 

603
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,910
done this before you have to go I think
two blocks up I have trouble making it

604
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:25,920
two blocks up I have trouble making it
 

605
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,280
two blocks up I have trouble making it
work just one block up sometimes it

606
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,290
work just one block up sometimes it
 

607
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,920
work just one block up sometimes it
would and sometimes it wouldn't so

608
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:30,930
would and sometimes it wouldn't so
 

609
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,510
would and sometimes it wouldn't so
there's a two block space between the

610
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:32,520
there's a two block space between the
 

611
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:39,320
there's a two block space between the
two alright and how do we do this I

612
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,330
two alright and how do we do this I
 

613
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:44,780
two alright and how do we do this I
think we can go here let's put a

614
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:44,790
think we can go here let's put a
 

615
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:50,240
think we can go here let's put a
repeater down oops oh I'm doing redstone

616
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,250
repeater down oops oh I'm doing redstone
 

617
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,610
repeater down oops oh I'm doing redstone
on camera what am i doing I'll skip this

618
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:52,620
on camera what am i doing I'll skip this
 

619
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,900
on camera what am i doing I'll skip this
in to show it to you because it'll be

620
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:53,910
in to show it to you because it'll be
 

621
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,860
in to show it to you because it'll be
quicker that way okay so I think we are

622
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:57,870
quicker that way okay so I think we are
 

623
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,930
quicker that way okay so I think we are
ready to try this thing out and see what

624
00:15:59,930 --> 00:15:59,940
ready to try this thing out and see what
 

625
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,210
ready to try this thing out and see what
it does it's just a very crude setup

626
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:02,220
it does it's just a very crude setup
 

627
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,800
it does it's just a very crude setup
right now I'm not gonna polish it up

628
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:03,810
right now I'm not gonna polish it up
 

629
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,770
right now I'm not gonna polish it up
unless it works which I kind of doubt it

630
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:06,780
unless it works which I kind of doubt it
 

631
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,880
unless it works which I kind of doubt it
will because that's a far far distance

632
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:10,890
will because that's a far far distance
 

633
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,320
will because that's a far far distance
isn't it that's not like ten blocks

634
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,330
isn't it that's not like ten blocks
 

635
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,100
isn't it that's not like ten blocks
that's like 40 how far do you think that

636
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,110
that's like 40 how far do you think that
 

637
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:21,829
that's like 40 how far do you think that
is from here to there that's that's

638
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:21,839
is from here to there that's that's
 

639
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,630
is from here to there that's that's
pretty far we might need to set up a

640
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:23,640
pretty far we might need to set up a
 

641
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,130
pretty far we might need to set up a
second launcher in between or some other

642
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:27,140
second launcher in between or some other
 

643
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,230
second launcher in between or some other
trickery I don't know so the launcher

644
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
trickery I don't know so the launcher
 

645
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,270
trickery I don't know so the launcher
thing is here that goes to this block

646
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,280
thing is here that goes to this block
 

647
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,390
thing is here that goes to this block
there's a repeater down here at one tick

648
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:37,400
there's a repeater down here at one tick
 

649
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,490
there's a repeater down here at one tick
that has a there's a redstone there

650
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:40,500
that has a there's a redstone there
 

651
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,790
that has a there's a redstone there
comes up the staircase to this piston so

652
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:43,800
comes up the staircase to this piston so
 

653
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,530
comes up the staircase to this piston so
these fire or one tick apart to this

654
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:45,540
these fire or one tick apart to this
 

655
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,200
these fire or one tick apart to this
bottom one and this one here so we're

656
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,210
bottom one and this one here so we're
 

657
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,150
bottom one and this one here so we're
gonna do a dry run first

658
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
gonna do a dry run first
 

659
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,460
gonna do a dry run first
I had a dropper here too you guys may

660
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,470
I had a dropper here too you guys may
 

661
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,980
I had a dropper here too you guys may
have noticed which I replaced with the

662
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:54,990
have noticed which I replaced with the
 

663
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,940
have noticed which I replaced with the
dispenser I always mix those two up okay

664
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:58,950
dispenser I always mix those two up okay
 

665
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:05,590
dispenser I always mix those two up okay
so it's the boat going

666
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600

 

667
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,639

yeah yeah made it no doesn't go too far

668
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:09,649
yeah yeah made it no doesn't go too far
 

669
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,469
yeah yeah made it no doesn't go too far
so I didn't hold up as I'm in the boat

670
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:11,479
so I didn't hold up as I'm in the boat
 

671
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:13,239
so I didn't hold up as I'm in the boat
though another give us a little extra

672
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:13,249
though another give us a little extra
 

673
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:16,479
though another give us a little extra
distance I'm fully expecting to die here

674
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:16,489
distance I'm fully expecting to die here
 

675
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:20,129
distance I'm fully expecting to die here
that's why I put all my stuff in a chest

676
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:20,139
that's why I put all my stuff in a chest
 

677
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,479
that's why I put all my stuff in a chest
but let's just see how far we can get

678
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:22,489
but let's just see how far we can get
 

679
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:27,309
but let's just see how far we can get
with it we go this mode I'm not sure

680
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:27,319
with it we go this mode I'm not sure
 

681
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,109
with it we go this mode I'm not sure
what the best mode is might be easier to

682
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:29,119
what the best mode is might be easier to
 

683
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:38,080
what the best mode is might be easier to
gauge Oh No we are short maybe 10 blocks

684
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,090
gauge Oh No we are short maybe 10 blocks
 

685
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,629
gauge Oh No we are short maybe 10 blocks
oh we actually hit the water that's

686
00:17:40,629 --> 00:17:40,639
oh we actually hit the water that's
 

687
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:42,960
oh we actually hit the water that's
actually kind of bad I wanted to die

688
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:42,970
actually kind of bad I wanted to die
 

689
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,669
actually kind of bad I wanted to die
oops

690
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:44,679
oops
 

691
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,570
oops
that wasn't too bad I regret taking my

692
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:49,580
that wasn't too bad I regret taking my
 

693
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,330
that wasn't too bad I regret taking my
enderpearls that was a waste maybe let's

694
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:52,340
enderpearls that was a waste maybe let's
 

695
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,799
enderpearls that was a waste maybe let's
go one more time yeah that wasn't too

696
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:56,809
go one more time yeah that wasn't too
 

697
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,070
go one more time yeah that wasn't too
bad so we could do things like have

698
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
bad so we could do things like have
 

699
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,810
bad so we could do things like have
floating water in there too

700
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:01,820
floating water in there too
 

701
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:07,560
floating water in there too
like if we need a bit of an extra runway

702
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:07,570

 

703
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,119

alright just hop in we'll go this

704
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:10,129
alright just hop in we'll go this
 

705
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:17,049
alright just hop in we'll go this
perspective this time woo oh it's it's

706
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:17,059
perspective this time woo oh it's it's
 

707
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:22,570
perspective this time woo oh it's it's
pretty close awesome I like it that's

708
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:22,580
pretty close awesome I like it that's
 

709
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:28,359
pretty close awesome I like it that's
pretty cool I wonder hmm you know if we

710
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:28,369
pretty cool I wonder hmm you know if we
 

711
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:30,609
pretty cool I wonder hmm you know if we
built like something here that that

712
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:30,619
built like something here that that
 

713
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:33,909
built like something here that that
brought it forward like 10 blocks or so

714
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
brought it forward like 10 blocks or so
 

715
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,609
brought it forward like 10 blocks or so
like so that it was at the same height

716
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:36,619
like so that it was at the same height
 

717
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:39,729
like so that it was at the same height
but like above us here then we could

718
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:39,739
but like above us here then we could
 

719
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:44,979
but like above us here then we could
almost certainly make it wonder if we

720
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:44,989
almost certainly make it wonder if we
 

721
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:49,080
almost certainly make it wonder if we
should do that

722
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,090

 

723
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,550

okay so I think I want to try this in

724
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:51,560
okay so I think I want to try this in
 

725
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,750
okay so I think I want to try this in
here I don't know if we'll actually keep

726
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:52,760
here I don't know if we'll actually keep
 

727
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,270
here I don't know if we'll actually keep
it but it's it's an idea we should play

728
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
it but it's it's an idea we should play
 

729
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,630
it but it's it's an idea we should play
around with it this is a midair launcher

730
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:57,640
around with it this is a midair launcher
 

731
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,130
around with it this is a midair launcher
at the bare bones of what you need

732
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:00,140
at the bare bones of what you need
 

733
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,190
at the bare bones of what you need
basically this would allow us to bridge

734
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,200
basically this would allow us to bridge
 

735
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,680
basically this would allow us to bridge
the extra gap but if we liked this idea

736
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:05,690
the extra gap but if we liked this idea
 

737
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,220
the extra gap but if we liked this idea
we could potentially have them all over

738
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,230
we could potentially have them all over
 

739
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,930
we could potentially have them all over
the place and we can we didn't bounce

740
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:10,940
the place and we can we didn't bounce
 

741
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,940
the place and we can we didn't bounce
around in midair

742
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:12,950
around in midair
 

743
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,280
around in midair
and and chain them together and do do

744
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,290
and and chain them together and do do
 

745
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,890
and and chain them together and do do
all kinds of things but they might look

746
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:17,900
all kinds of things but they might look
 

747
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,480
all kinds of things but they might look
a bit out of place

748
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:19,490
a bit out of place
 

749
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,030
a bit out of place
we have water there to break the fall of

750
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,040
we have water there to break the fall of
 

751
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,740
we have water there to break the fall of
the boat so it doesn't break when it

752
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:23,750
the boat so it doesn't break when it
 

753
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,470
the boat so it doesn't break when it
hits something the pressure plate on

754
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
hits something the pressure plate on
 

755
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,400
hits something the pressure plate on
obsidian there

756
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,410
obsidian there
 

757
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,640
obsidian there
you need the obsidian so let the slime

758
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:30,650
you need the obsidian so let the slime
 

759
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,230
you need the obsidian so let the slime
block doesn't move it we could also

760
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240
block doesn't move it we could also
 

761
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
block doesn't move it we could also
change this to a watermelon or something

762
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,250
change this to a watermelon or something
 

763
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,960
change this to a watermelon or something
I think sticky piston and redstone wire

764
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:37,970
I think sticky piston and redstone wire
 

765
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:44,040
I think sticky piston and redstone wire
down there so let's go and try it out

766
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,050

 

767
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,630

I'm wondering out if it's gonna beat it

768
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:46,640
I'm wondering out if it's gonna beat it
 

769
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,400
I'm wondering out if it's gonna beat it
to hit that target or if it's even in

770
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:48,410
to hit that target or if it's even in
 

771
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,520
to hit that target or if it's even in
the right place but try it out here see

772
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:51,530
the right place but try it out here see
 

773
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,490
the right place but try it out here see
how this goes we can move it if it's not

774
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:54,500
how this goes we can move it if it's not
 

775
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:01,750
how this goes we can move it if it's not
right woohoo oh we can't see oh is it

776
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
right woohoo oh we can't see oh is it
 

777
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,140
right woohoo oh we can't see oh is it
too far it is too far by like four or

778
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,150
too far it is too far by like four or
 

779
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:10,840
too far it is too far by like four or
five blocks whoa that was interesting

780
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:10,850
five blocks whoa that was interesting
 

781
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,710
five blocks whoa that was interesting
I bet the boat broke before we hit the

782
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
I bet the boat broke before we hit the
 

783
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,850
I bet the boat broke before we hit the
ground like just before so we didn't die

784
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:18,860
ground like just before so we didn't die
 

785
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:27,690
ground like just before so we didn't die
from it lavas gonna get me not you I

786
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:27,700
from it lavas gonna get me not you I
 

787
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,930
from it lavas gonna get me not you I
moved it let's see if we can do it now

788
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:33,940

 

789
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,010

again it's probably gonna be pretty

790
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,020
again it's probably gonna be pretty
 

791
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:44,980
again it's probably gonna be pretty
tough oh it's still darn it okay so I

792
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:44,990
tough oh it's still darn it okay so I
 

793
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,930
tough oh it's still darn it okay so I
moved this one forward two blocks

794
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:46,940
moved this one forward two blocks
 

795
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,150
moved this one forward two blocks
instead of that one I figured it'd be a

796
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:49,160
instead of that one I figured it'd be a
 

797
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,000
instead of that one I figured it'd be a
little easier and since we're just doing

798
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,010
little easier and since we're just doing
 

799
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,320
little easier and since we're just doing
this for testing it doesn't really

800
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,330
this for testing it doesn't really
 

801
00:20:53,330 --> 00:21:01,980
this for testing it doesn't really
matter okay let's try it out

802
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:01,990

 

803
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,190

it's close oh we did it

804
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,200
it's close oh we did it
 

805
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:12,640
it's close oh we did it
no that looked really cool though I

806
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:12,650
no that looked really cool though I
 

807
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,420
no that looked really cool though I
gotta say even though it was a fail I'm

808
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:16,430
gotta say even though it was a fail I'm
 

809
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,980
gotta say even though it was a fail I'm
pretty happy with that I can't believe

810
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:20,990
pretty happy with that I can't believe
 

811
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,230
pretty happy with that I can't believe
that actually worked first try

812
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:23,240
that actually worked first try
 

813
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,270
that actually worked first try
well not first try but first try with it

814
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,280
well not first try but first try with it
 

815
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:33,880
well not first try but first try with it
actually setup right oh man so close all

816
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:33,890
actually setup right oh man so close all
 

817
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,130
actually setup right oh man so close all
right so yeah what we're kind of doing

818
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:36,140
right so yeah what we're kind of doing
 

819
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,140
right so yeah what we're kind of doing
just to start off here is the an idea of

820
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,150
just to start off here is the an idea of
 

821
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,419
just to start off here is the an idea of
some of the devices we could build to

822
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:40,429
some of the devices we could build to
 

823
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:43,870
some of the devices we could build to
get around and get used to like the

824
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:43,880
get around and get used to like the
 

825
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,260
get around and get used to like the
trajectory and how far they go I am very

826
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,270
trajectory and how far they go I am very
 

827
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,900
trajectory and how far they go I am very
curious actually how far that is this is

828
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:51,910

 

829
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,280

maybe will try to check it one more time

830
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:54,290
maybe will try to check it one more time
 

831
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:54,700
maybe will try to check it one more time
here

832
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:54,710
here
 

833
00:21:54,710 --> 00:22:00,340
here
this is 590 okay I think we got one boat

834
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:00,350
this is 590 okay I think we got one boat
 

835
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:04,980
this is 590 okay I think we got one boat
left how far does it actually take us oh

836
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:04,990
left how far does it actually take us oh
 

837
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:10,900
left how far does it actually take us oh
I wasn't even aiming whoops 51 27 so

838
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:10,910
I wasn't even aiming whoops 51 27 so
 

839
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:19,090
I wasn't even aiming whoops 51 27 so
that's 37 blocks yeah okay oh I didn't

840
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:19,100
that's 37 blocks yeah okay oh I didn't
 

841
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,850
that's 37 blocks yeah okay oh I didn't
see the why we should keep that in mind

842
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:21,860
see the why we should keep that in mind
 

843
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:27,130
see the why we should keep that in mind
too but I'm sure the why is it least 40

844
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:27,140
too but I'm sure the why is it least 40
 

845
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,780
too but I'm sure the why is it least 40
50 bucks down I'm not sure I'll have to

846
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:28,790
50 bucks down I'm not sure I'll have to
 

847
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:33,490
50 bucks down I'm not sure I'll have to
check that well that's gonna do it for

848
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:33,500
check that well that's gonna do it for
 

849
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,470
check that well that's gonna do it for

do read the comments and hopefully I'll
see it and yeah we're gonna be building

860
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:50,179
see it and yeah we're gonna be building
 

861
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:51,760
see it and yeah we're gonna be building
firms and that kind of stuff at the new

862
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:51,770
firms and that kind of stuff at the new
 

863
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,760
firms and that kind of stuff at the new
base too so there's gonna be a bit too

864
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:54,770
base too so there's gonna be a bit too
 

865
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,460
base too so there's gonna be a bit too
it's not just transportation only

866
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:57,470
it's not just transportation only

there's gonna be a lot to it and the
 

869
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,350
there's gonna be a lot to it and the
firms are all gonna involve slime blocks

870
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:02,360
firms are all gonna involve slime blocks
 

871
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,490
firms are all gonna involve slime blocks
it's it's gonna be kind of like you know

872

874
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:07,940
that feed the beast season where I had
 

875
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,280
that feed the beast season where I had
the minecarts jump in between the

876
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,290
the minecarts jump in between the
 

877
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,840
the minecarts jump in between the
islands we're gonna be doing a lot of

878
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:10,850
islands we're gonna be doing a lot of
 

879
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:11,650
islands we're gonna be doing a lot of
that kind of thing

880
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:11,660
that kind of thing
 

881
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,380
that kind of thing
- silly not really efficient ways of

882
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:14,390
- silly not really efficient ways of
 

883
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,540
- silly not really efficient ways of
doing things but just fun fun ways of

884
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:16,550
doing things but just fun fun ways of
 

885
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,730
doing things but just fun fun ways of
doing things is what we're focusing on

886
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:18,740
doing things is what we're focusing on
 

887
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,690
doing things is what we're focusing on
and as we get more situated there I'll

888
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:22,700
and as we get more situated there I'll
 

889
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,690
and as we get more situated there I'll
be able to build things quicker and yeah

890
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:25,700
be able to build things quicker and yeah
 

891
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,300
be able to build things quicker and yeah
anyway here is a comment for today it

I have mixed feelings about them that
 

925
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,960
I have mixed feelings about them that
some of them are really good some of

really good at it too like I would like
 

937
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,560
really good at it too like I would like
to claim I was the best at it but I'm

938
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:32,570
to claim I was the best at it but I'm
 

939
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,900
to claim I was the best at it but I'm
not gonna do that I was close so I was I

940
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:34,910
not gonna do that I was close so I was I
 

941
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,990
not gonna do that I was close so I was I
would say I was top 50 at least I played

942
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,000
would say I was top 50 at least I played
 

943
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,480
would say I was top 50 at least I played
it so much eventually though the

944
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:40,490
it so much eventually though the
 

945
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,010
it so much eventually though the
community kind of died out with it and

946
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:44,020
community kind of died out with it and
 

947
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,960
community kind of died out with it and
somehow people figured out some hacks to

948
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:46,970
somehow people figured out some hacks to
 

949
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,090
somehow people figured out some hacks to
it like some some exploits in the game -

950
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:51,100
it like some some exploits in the game -
 

951
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,040
it like some some exploits in the game -
