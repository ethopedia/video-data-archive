00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,090
is it worth fixing I think I will it's
 

323
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,020
is it worth fixing I think I will it's
it's a simple thing to change oh I know

324
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,030
it's a simple thing to change oh I know
 

325
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,290
it's a simple thing to change oh I know
what's wrong oh this is interesting so

look at the items here they're like

328
00:07:59,640 --> 00:07:59,650
look at the items here they're like
 

329
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,189
look at the items here they're like
bouncing back and forth now they're on

330
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:02,199
bouncing back and forth now they're on
 

331
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,300

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,310
this side kind of weird it looked like a
 

333
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,399
this side kind of weird it looked like a
block was missing here is like why is a

334
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:08,409
block was missing here is like why is a
 

335
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:10,620
block was missing here is like why is a
block missing wait a second and then I

336
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:10,630
block missing wait a second and then I
 

337
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,439
block missing wait a second and then I
realized the glow stones over here they

338
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:13,449
realized the glow stones over here they
 

339
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:16,110
realized the glow stones over here they
changed it so water is more transparent

340
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,120
changed it so water is more transparent
 

341
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,839
changed it so water is more transparent
now so before it would like knock out

342
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:18,849
now so before it would like knock out
 

343
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:21,120
now so before it would like knock out
three levels of lights but the problem

344
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,130
three levels of lights but the problem
 

345
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,980
three levels of lights but the problem
is with underwater bases they looked

346
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:22,990
is with underwater bases they looked
 

347
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,700
is with underwater bases they looked
really dark so they made water basically

348
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:26,710
really dark so they made water basically
 

349
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,430
really dark so they made water basically
like any other block and as a result I

350
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
like any other block and as a result I
 

351
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,320
like any other block and as a result I
think this glow stone from here melted

352
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,330
think this glow stone from here melted
 

353
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,529
think this glow stone from here melted
the ice that was here which didn't do

354
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:34,539
the ice that was here which didn't do
 

355
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,709
the ice that was here which didn't do
that before it cuz is underwater let's

356
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:37,719
that before it cuz is underwater let's
 

357
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,389
that before it cuz is underwater let's
check out the cow farm here this uses

358
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:39,399
check out the cow farm here this uses
 

359
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,750
check out the cow farm here this uses
water so it has a chance of being broken

360
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
water so it has a chance of being broken
 

361
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,680
water so it has a chance of being broken
where's the switch over here Oh looking

362
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:46,690
where's the switch over here Oh looking
 

363
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,400
where's the switch over here Oh looking
good I mean this didn't work before but

364
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,410
good I mean this didn't work before but
 

365
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,910
good I mean this didn't work before but
I'm still gonna try it could you imagine

366
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:53,920
I'm still gonna try it could you imagine
 

367
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,590
I'm still gonna try it could you imagine
if like everything breaks but the each

368
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
if like everything breaks but the each
 

369
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,030
if like everything breaks but the each
road starts working again for some

370
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
road starts working again for some
 

371
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,329
road starts working again for some
reason now it's it's a sunken boat you

372
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:00,339
reason now it's it's a sunken boat you
 

373
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:11,200
reason now it's it's a sunken boat you
can't hop in it still good

374
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,210

 

375
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:17,500

oh maybe it's just some if it's on a

376
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:17,510
oh maybe it's just some if it's on a
 

377
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,920
oh maybe it's just some if it's on a
certain tick then they all pop off

378
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:22,930

 

379
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:30,269

hop on again that time it popped

380
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:30,279

 

381
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,820

okay interesting I'm sure there's a way

382
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:33,830
okay interesting I'm sure there's a way
 

383
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,840
okay interesting I'm sure there's a way
to still get this to work I wonder that

384
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:37,850
to still get this to work I wonder that
 

385
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,910
to still get this to work I wonder that
might mean that the rails are finally

386
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
might mean that the rails are finally
 

387
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,100
might mean that the rails are finally
fixed because this has bothered me for a

388
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,110
fixed because this has bothered me for a
 

389
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,880
fixed because this has bothered me for a
long time so before if you try to to

390
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:45,890
long time so before if you try to to
 

391
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,740
long time so before if you try to to
move this rail and the block at the same

392
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:47,750
move this rail and the block at the same
 

393
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,420
move this rail and the block at the same
time it would always pop off but as we

394
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:52,430
time it would always pop off but as we
 

395
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,980
time it would always pop off but as we
saw with the grass there the blocks are

396
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:53,990
saw with the grass there the blocks are
 

397
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,079
saw with the grass there the blocks are
moving but the grass wasn't popping off

398
00:09:58,079 --> 00:09:58,089

 

399
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:00,519

okay I thought they they fixed the

400
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:00,529
okay I thought they they fixed the
 

401
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:03,150
okay I thought they they fixed the
glitch er there made something nicer

402
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,160
glitch er there made something nicer
 

403
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,430
glitch er there made something nicer
yeah even on the retraction what if we

404
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:06,440
yeah even on the retraction what if we
 

405
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,250
yeah even on the retraction what if we
do it like this

406
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:08,260
do it like this
 

407
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,210
do it like this
nope I am so happy guys one of my big

408
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:13,220
nope I am so happy guys one of my big
 

409
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,040
nope I am so happy guys one of my big
concerns with the update was they were

410
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,050
concerns with the update was they were
 

411
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,620
concerns with the update was they were
not gonna change the water and it didn't

412
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:17,630
not gonna change the water and it didn't
 

413
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,410
not gonna change the water and it didn't
matter like all the new features they

414
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:20,420
matter like all the new features they
 

415
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,900
matter like all the new features they
add to the underwater it would still

416
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:22,910
add to the underwater it would still
 

417
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,790
add to the underwater it would still
look terrible but they actually changed

418
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
look terrible but they actually changed
 

419
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,680
look terrible but they actually changed
the water so we don't have the ugly deep

420
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:26,690
the water so we don't have the ugly deep
 

421
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,019
the water so we don't have the ugly deep
blue stuff anymore it's still pretty

422
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:29,029
blue stuff anymore it's still pretty
 

423
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,730
blue stuff anymore it's still pretty
blue but it's it's definitely more

424
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:30,740
blue but it's it's definitely more
 

425
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,319
blue but it's it's definitely more
transparent and I think it looks a lot

426
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,329
transparent and I think it looks a lot
 

427
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,600
transparent and I think it looks a lot
better and it depends on what biome

428
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:34,610
better and it depends on what biome
 

429
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,660
better and it depends on what biome
you're into so this is forest but I

430
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:37,670
you're into so this is forest but I
 

431
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,280
you're into so this is forest but I
noticed like even looking through the

432
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,290
noticed like even looking through the
 

433
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,840
noticed like even looking through the
waterfall here you can see the torches

434
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:40,850
waterfall here you can see the torches
 

435
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,630
waterfall here you can see the torches
on the other side so but it's not like

436
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:43,640
on the other side so but it's not like
 

437
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,870
on the other side so but it's not like
super bright or anything either so I

438
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
super bright or anything either so I
 

439
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
super bright or anything either so I
think that's cool I think it has a nice

440
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:48,890
think that's cool I think it has a nice
 

441
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,530
think that's cool I think it has a nice
effect like even over here I think this

442
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:50,540
effect like even over here I think this
 

443
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,060
effect like even over here I think this
looks better over here now with the new

444
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,070
looks better over here now with the new
 

445
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,650
looks better over here now with the new
water color I did like light this for

446
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:55,660
water color I did like light this for
 

447
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,449
water color I did like light this for
the darker water with it not being able

448
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:58,459
the darker water with it not being able
 

449
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,280
the darker water with it not being able
to pass light through as well before so

450
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,290
to pass light through as well before so
 

451
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,319
to pass light through as well before so
you really notice like glowstone

452
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:02,329
you really notice like glowstone
 

453
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,810
you really notice like glowstone
underneath it so that should probably be

454
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:04,820
underneath it so that should probably be
 

455
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:10,389
underneath it so that should probably be
changed under water you got the cool

456
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
changed under water you got the cool
 

457
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,240
changed under water you got the cool
sounds right it's crystal clear alright

458
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,250
sounds right it's crystal clear alright
 

459
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,519
sounds right it's crystal clear alright
it still can look dark though like the

460
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:15,529
it still can look dark though like the
 

461
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:18,400
it still can look dark though like the
ground looks start here but our visions

462
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:18,410
ground looks start here but our visions
 

463
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,550
ground looks start here but our visions
not really blocked by the darkness of

464
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:21,560
not really blocked by the darkness of
 

465
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
not really blocked by the darkness of
the water or anything so I like that I

466
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:23,570
the water or anything so I like that I
 

467
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,069
the water or anything so I like that I
think it's a good a good trade-off the

468
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:27,079
think it's a good a good trade-off the
 

469
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:30,370
think it's a good a good trade-off the
river here it did update by the way so

470
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:30,380
river here it did update by the way so
 

471
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,260
river here it did update by the way so
any water blocks that you made with ice

472
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,270
any water blocks that you made with ice
 

473
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,750
any water blocks that you made with ice
and thawed and then we're like floating

474
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:34,760
and thawed and then we're like floating
 

475
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,380
and thawed and then we're like floating
those all have

476
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:36,390
those all have
 

477
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,100
those all have
updated there's no way around it so the

478
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,110
updated there's no way around it so the
 

479
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,530
updated there's no way around it so the
river we've we went a long time without

480
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:42,540

water the water system I'm not really
 

517
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,410
water the water system I'm not really
sure why so I guess let's just do a

sure why so I guess let's just do a
 

519
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,510
sure why so I guess let's just do a
harvest and see what happens oh that

texture a lot I'm gonna be using that a
 

595
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,490
texture a lot I'm gonna be using that a
lot I'm sure I just testing out the

596
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:47,500
lot I'm sure I just testing out the
 

597
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:53,850
lot I'm sure I just testing out the
mushroom firm it's still good

oh and it gets better guys we have the
 

601
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,400
oh and it gets better guys we have the
interior texture again too so if you put

602
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:01,410
interior texture again too so if you put
 

603
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,990
interior texture again too so if you put
two of these side-by-side and then break

604
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,000
two of these side-by-side and then break
 

605
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,090
two of these side-by-side and then break
one of them it keeps the texture now

606
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,100
one of them it keeps the texture now
 

607
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,120
one of them it keeps the texture now
that's that's a great way of doing it

608

still works the same but the the effect
 

637
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,319
still works the same but the the effect
when they get harvested is different

638
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,329
when they get harvested is different
 

639
00:15:52,329 --> 00:16:06,610

looking good so far that's what they're
 

803
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,970
looking good so far that's what they're
supposed to do I think the next

804
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:06,980
supposed to do I think the next
 

805
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,530
supposed to do I think the next
potential area where it could break is

806
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:08,540
potential area where it could break is
 

807
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:15,580
potential area where it could break is
over here where they fall down I think

808
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:15,590
over here where they fall down I think
 

809
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,850
over here where they fall down I think
it's fine guys whoo yeah look at the

810
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:18,860
it's fine guys whoo yeah look at the
 

811
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,340
it's fine guys whoo yeah look at the
swamp water it's so much more clear you

812
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:21,350
swamp water it's so much more clear you
 

813
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,440
swamp water it's so much more clear you
can see the sand and dirt so easily

814
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,450
can see the sand and dirt so easily
 

815
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,160
can see the sand and dirt so easily
through it now it does look good though

816
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,170
through it now it does look good though
 

817
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,900
through it now it does look good though
I think I like it all right you still

818
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:28,910
I think I like it all right you still
 

819
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,280
I think I like it all right you still
got the blue patches where it's a little

820
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,290
got the blue patches where it's a little
 

821
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:34,660
got the blue patches where it's a little
bit deeper so it's pretty cool so the

822
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:34,670
bit deeper so it's pretty cool so the
 

823
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,370
bit deeper so it's pretty cool so the
super smelter I don't think it's broken

824
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:36,380
super smelter I don't think it's broken
 

825
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,010
super smelter I don't think it's broken
but of course as we saw we can't use

826
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,020
but of course as we saw we can't use
 

827
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,450
but of course as we saw we can't use
mushroom blocks as the

828
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:40,460
mushroom blocks as the
 

829
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,240
mushroom blocks as the
you all anymore so we'll have to switch

830
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,250
you all anymore so we'll have to switch
 

831
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,140
you all anymore so we'll have to switch
over to planks or something instead

832
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,150
over to planks or something instead
 

833
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,580
over to planks or something instead
which means I gotta empty all the fuel

834
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:48,590
which means I gotta empty all the fuel
 

835
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,740
which means I gotta empty all the fuel
out of the furnaces which will probably

836
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:50,750
out of the furnaces which will probably
 

837
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,220
out of the furnaces which will probably
take me 5-10 minutes to do another kind

838
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,230
take me 5-10 minutes to do another kind
 

839
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,570
take me 5-10 minutes to do another kind
of annoying thing but it's not a big

840
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:55,580
of annoying thing but it's not a big
 

841
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,930
of annoying thing but it's not a big
deal looks like we still got pumpkins

842
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:58,940
deal looks like we still got pumpkins
 

843
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,020
deal looks like we still got pumpkins
flowing down there that's a good sign

844
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,030
flowing down there that's a good sign
 

845
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,120
flowing down there that's a good sign
now we just finished this farm I didn't

846
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,130
now we just finished this farm I didn't
 

847
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,300
now we just finished this farm I didn't
know that the mushroom boxing was gonna

848
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,310
know that the mushroom boxing was gonna
 

849
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,250
know that the mushroom boxing was gonna
be changed right

850
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:09,260
be changed right
 

851
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,100
be changed right
I think this farm will still work its

852
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,110
I think this farm will still work its
 

853
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,530
I think this farm will still work its
usefulness though is another question

854
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:14,540
usefulness though is another question
 

855
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,810
usefulness though is another question
it's not nearly as useful if we can't

856
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:16,820
it's not nearly as useful if we can't
 

857
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,170
it's not nearly as useful if we can't
use it for fuel but we can still

858
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:19,180
use it for fuel but we can still
 

859
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,630
use it for fuel but we can still
manufacture brown mushroom blocks and I

860
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:22,640
manufacture brown mushroom blocks and I
 

861
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,980
manufacture brown mushroom blocks and I
guess this texture - and the stems and

862
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:28,990

 

863
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,300

yeah the brown mushrooms like it for

864
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:31,310
yeah the brown mushrooms like it for
 

865
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,310
yeah the brown mushrooms like it for
fermented spider eyes and stuff so it's

866
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:33,320
fermented spider eyes and stuff so it's
 

867
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,160
fermented spider eyes and stuff so it's
got some value still but I won't need to

868
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,170
got some value still but I won't need to
 

869
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,430
got some value still but I won't need to
use it as much as before probably first

870
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
use it as much as before probably first
 

871
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,160
use it as much as before probably first
to grow the one thing that could be

872
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,170
to grow the one thing that could be
 

873
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,390
to grow the one thing that could be
broken here is the collection system

874
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:45,400
broken here is the collection system
 

875
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,370

let's give that a shot so they all flow

876
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:51,380
let's give that a shot so they all flow
 

877
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,360
let's give that a shot so they all flow
to the middle and they do go down that's

878
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:55,370
to the middle and they do go down that's
 

879
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,960
to the middle and they do go down that's
good still fine then oh here comes the

880
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:58,970
good still fine then oh here comes the
 

881
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,080
good still fine then oh here comes the
clay does it get picked up I think it

882
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,090
clay does it get picked up I think it
 

883
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,220
clay does it get picked up I think it
got picked up

884
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,230

 

885
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,780

yeah it's getting picked up just making

886
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:07,790
yeah it's getting picked up just making
 

887
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,640
yeah it's getting picked up just making
sure with the Nexus that the hoppers are

888
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:09,650
sure with the Nexus that the hoppers are
 

889
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,770
sure with the Nexus that the hoppers are
actually grabbing the items - and it

890
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:11,780
actually grabbing the items - and it
 

891
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,720
actually grabbing the items - and it
looks like they're clays going into here

892
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:13,730
looks like they're clays going into here
 

893
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:22,110
looks like they're clays going into here
like it's supposed to

894
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,120

 

895
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,380

[Applause]
 

897
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,090
[Applause]
okay so the firework system still works

898
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,100
okay so the firework system still works
 

899
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,730
okay so the firework system still works
the same but it is a lot more laggy that

900
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:28,740
the same but it is a lot more laggy that
 

901
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,130
the same but it is a lot more laggy that
used to be I'm getting like really low

902
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,140
used to be I'm getting like really low
 

903
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,560
used to be I'm getting like really low
framerate right now from the redstone

904
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:33,570
framerate right now from the redstone
 

905
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:38,480
framerate right now from the redstone
running below yeah so maybe I'll mention

906
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:38,490
running below yeah so maybe I'll mention
 

907
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,760
running below yeah so maybe I'll mention
that as well as far as like optimization

908
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:40,770
that as well as far as like optimization
 

909
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,880
that as well as far as like optimization
goes I think I'm getting a slightly

910
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:43,890
goes I think I'm getting a slightly
 

911
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,910
goes I think I'm getting a slightly
lower frame rate than 1.12 but there's

912
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:46,920
lower frame rate than 1.12 but there's
 

913
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,070
lower frame rate than 1.12 but there's
no jitters or anything which is which is

914
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,080
no jitters or anything which is which is
 

915
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,210
no jitters or anything which is which is
good

916
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:50,220
good
 

917
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,590
good
no like choppy frame rates and I think

918
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:54,600
no like choppy frame rates and I think
 

919
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,750
no like choppy frame rates and I think
at night time I've noticed the tick rate

920
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:56,760
at night time I've noticed the tick rate
 

921
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,320
at night time I've noticed the tick rate
might be a bit low maybe from some issue

922
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:00,330
might be a bit low maybe from some issue
 

923
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,780
might be a bit low maybe from some issue
with the pet the mob pathfinding but I'm

924
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:02,790
with the pet the mob pathfinding but I'm
 

925
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,299
with the pet the mob pathfinding but I'm
not sure but overall it's not too bad

926
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:05,309
not sure but overall it's not too bad
 

927
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:07,700
not sure but overall it's not too bad
not too bad and is this is just the

928
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:07,710
not too bad and is this is just the
 

929
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,790
not too bad and is this is just the
release after the game release usually

930
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:10,800
release after the game release usually
 

931
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,620
release after the game release usually
they have a couple more batches and they

932
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:12,630
they have a couple more batches and they
 

933
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,870
they have a couple more batches and they
optimize things further so I'm not too

934
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
optimize things further so I'm not too
 

935
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,090
optimize things further so I'm not too
worried about that

936
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,100
worried about that
 

937
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,100
worried about that
last farm for us to try out here I think

938
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,110
last farm for us to try out here I think
 

939
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:23,900
last farm for us to try out here I think
is the core Street farm ooh big leg

940
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:23,910
is the core Street farm ooh big leg
 

941
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,390
is the core Street farm ooh big leg
that's normal it's normal are the items

942
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,400
that's normal it's normal are the items
 

943
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,100
that's normal it's normal are the items
gonna overshoot the water they're gonna

944
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,110
gonna overshoot the water they're gonna
 

945
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:33,530
gonna overshoot the water they're gonna
get stuck I'm not sure they do move like

946
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:33,540
get stuck I'm not sure they do move like
 

947
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,640
get stuck I'm not sure they do move like
so much faster

948
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:34,650
so much faster
 

949
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,470
so much faster
I like that like when you're harvesting

950
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:36,480
I like that like when you're harvesting
 

951
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,590
I like that like when you're harvesting
things now normally it has to drag your

952
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:39,600
things now normally it has to drag your
 

953
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,450
things now normally it has to drag your
grip across the ground but now it's just

954
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:41,460
grip across the ground but now it's just
 

955
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,740
grip across the ground but now it's just
like super fast on all the firms yeah

956
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:45,750
like super fast on all the firms yeah
 

957
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,620
like super fast on all the firms yeah
it's fine it's all good

958
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:47,630
it's fine it's all good
 

959
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,150
it's fine it's all good
all right everybody so that's probably

960
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:50,160
all right everybody so that's probably
 

961
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,070
all right everybody so that's probably

all the troubleshooting we need to do
 

963
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,230
