00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:05,930
hello everyone this is etho and I have
another excellent episode for you today

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:05,940
another excellent episode for you today
 

5
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,589
another excellent episode for you today
playing Minecraft something that

6
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599
playing Minecraft something that
 

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,299
playing Minecraft something that
everybody seems to be doing now is

8
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:11,309
everybody seems to be doing now is
 

9
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,390
everybody seems to be doing now is
building slime farms people have been

10
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
building slime farms people have been
 

11
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,340
building slime farms people have been
suggesting to me to do this for a long

12
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:16,350
suggesting to me to do this for a long
 

13
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,550
suggesting to me to do this for a long
time but it's never really interested me

14
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:19,560
time but it's never really interested me
 

15
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,310
time but it's never really interested me
because really what's the point but now

16
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
because really what's the point but now
 

17
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,099
because really what's the point but now
we need slimes to make sticky pistons

18
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:25,109
we need slimes to make sticky pistons
 

19
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,800
we need slimes to make sticky pistons
so there's actually a point to making a

20
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:27,810
so there's actually a point to making a
 

21
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,849
so there's actually a point to making a
slime farm so that's what I'm going to

22
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:31,859
slime farm so that's what I'm going to
 

23
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:32,990
slime farm so that's what I'm going to
be doing today

24
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,000
be doing today
 

25
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,090
be doing today
I've already started kind of I found the

26
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,100
I've already started kind of I found the
 

27
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,410
I've already started kind of I found the
location where I'm going to be building

28
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:39,420
location where I'm going to be building
 

29
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,270
location where I'm going to be building
it I did this it's a little bit

30
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:44,280
it I did this it's a little bit
 

31
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,160
it I did this it's a little bit
complicated

32
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,170
complicated
 

33
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,490
complicated
basically slimes have a very low chance

34
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:49,500
basically slimes have a very low chance
 

35
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,459
basically slimes have a very low chance
of spawning they can only spawn in

36
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:52,469
of spawning they can only spawn in
 

37
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,319
of spawning they can only spawn in
certain chunks as well and these are

38
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:54,329
certain chunks as well and these are
 

39
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,689
certain chunks as well and these are
decided randomly by your world seed so

40
00:00:58,689 --> 00:00:58,699
decided randomly by your world seed so
 

41
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:01,430
decided randomly by your world seed so
they're kind of randomly placed all over

42
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
they're kind of randomly placed all over
 

43
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,469
they're kind of randomly placed all over
the place about every 10th chunk there

44
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
the place about every 10th chunk there
 

45
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,270
the place about every 10th chunk there
will be one chunk order slimes and spawn

46
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:08,280
will be one chunk order slimes and spawn
 

47
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,190
will be one chunk order slimes and spawn
and using simple online

48
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
and using simple online
 

49
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,350
and using simple online
I don't you call it online application

50
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:18,360
I don't you call it online application
 

51
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,410
I don't you call it online application
or whatever made by a guy named trunks I

52
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:21,420
or whatever made by a guy named trunks I
 

53
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,120
or whatever made by a guy named trunks I
have determined this is the best spot to

54
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,130
have determined this is the best spot to
 

55
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,190
have determined this is the best spot to
build my slime farm because there's

56
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:28,200
build my slime farm because there's
 

57
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,359
build my slime farm because there's
three chunks next to each other one here

58
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:32,369
three chunks next to each other one here
 

59
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,200
three chunks next to each other one here
here and one here

60
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,210
here and one here
 

61
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:41,030
here and one here
and my ex position is minus and 96 and

62
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
and my ex position is minus and 96 and
 

63
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,420
and my ex position is minus and 96 and
that is at 48 this point right here is

64
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:44,430
that is at 48 this point right here is
 

65
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,490
that is at 48 this point right here is
where the three chunks meet so that's

66
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:49,500
where the three chunks meet so that's
 

67
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,319
where the three chunks meet so that's
pretty good normally slime chunks or

68
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:51,329
pretty good normally slime chunks or
 

69
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,620
pretty good normally slime chunks or
just all on their own

70
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:53,630
just all on their own
 

71
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,179
just all on their own
occasionally they'll be two together but

72
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:56,189
occasionally they'll be two together but
 

73
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,709
occasionally they'll be two together but
if you can find three together that's

74
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:57,719
if you can find three together that's
 

75
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,530
if you can find three together that's
really good if you find forty other

76
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:00,540
really good if you find forty other
 

77
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,969
really good if you find forty other
that's very rare so I found three

78
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:04,979
that's very rare so I found three
 

79
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,440
that's very rare so I found three
together yeah so I'm just going to build

80
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,450
together yeah so I'm just going to build
 

81
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,910
together yeah so I'm just going to build
here I'm going to do a hole straight

82
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:10,920
here I'm going to do a hole straight
 

83
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,080
here I'm going to do a hole straight
down

84
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,090
down
 

85
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:18,880
down
pretty much yeah and dig straight down I

86
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:18,890
pretty much yeah and dig straight down I
 

87
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:24,380
pretty much yeah and dig straight down I
don't care what I know this is a bad

88
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,390
don't care what I know this is a bad
 

89
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,350
don't care what I know this is a bad
idea but that's just the way I do it and

90
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360

 

91
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,380

I will see you in just a little bit if

92
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:33,390
I will see you in just a little bit if
 

93
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,180
I will see you in just a little bit if
I'm still alive and a lot of you are

94
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,190
I'm still alive and a lot of you are
 

95
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,160
I'm still alive and a lot of you are
going to say don't dig straight down but

96
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,170
going to say don't dig straight down but
 

97
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,080
going to say don't dig straight down but
not a complete idiot when I do it I can

98
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,090
not a complete idiot when I do it I can
 

99
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,610
not a complete idiot when I do it I can
see slightly where these two blocks meet

100
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:49,620
see slightly where these two blocks meet
 

101
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,190
see slightly where these two blocks meet
I can see a little bit of blue through a

102
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,200
I can see a little bit of blue through a
 

103
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,039
I can see a little bit of blue through a
crack which tells me there's no lava

104
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,049
crack which tells me there's no lava
 

105
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,479
crack which tells me there's no lava
below me but just to be safe since I'm

106
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:58,489
below me but just to be safe since I'm
 

107
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,589
below me but just to be safe since I'm
close to the lava level

108
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:00,599
close to the lava level
 

109
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,240
close to the lava level
I will alternate blocks towards the

110
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,250
I will alternate blocks towards the
 

111
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:14,900
I will alternate blocks towards the
bottom as well so slimes they only spawn

112
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:14,910
bottom as well so slimes they only spawn
 

113
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,640
bottom as well so slimes they only spawn
below level 16 which is where we're

114
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:19,650
below level 16 which is where we're
 

115
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,819
below level 16 which is where we're
we've passed now so this area here you

116
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:22,829
we've passed now so this area here you
 

117
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:28,460
we've passed now so this area here you
can actually spawn in I'm just going to

118
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:28,470
can actually spawn in I'm just going to
 

119
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,210
can actually spawn in I'm just going to
go all the way to bedrock nice cool

120
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:32,220
go all the way to bedrock nice cool
 

121
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,710
go all the way to bedrock nice cool
thing about building a slime farm is

122
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:33,720
thing about building a slime farm is
 

123
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,589
thing about building a slime farm is
you'll probably get redstone diamonds

124
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:36,599
you'll probably get redstone diamonds
 

125
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,559
you'll probably get redstone diamonds
gold all that good stuff and we hit

126
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:42,569
gold all that good stuff and we hit
 

127
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:48,920
gold all that good stuff and we hit
bedrock no lava that's good um yeah so

128
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:48,930
bedrock no lava that's good um yeah so
 

129
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,640
bedrock no lava that's good um yeah so
I'm gonna widen this out in the shape I

130
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:52,650
I'm gonna widen this out in the shape I
 

131
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,400
I'm gonna widen this out in the shape I
want it I brought my good friend with me

132
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,410
want it I brought my good friend with me
 

133
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:01,430
want it I brought my good friend with me
and it will be back oh yeah if you guys

134
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:01,440
and it will be back oh yeah if you guys
 

135
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,110
and it will be back oh yeah if you guys
are wondering what the f coordinate is

136
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
are wondering what the f coordinate is
 

137
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,690
are wondering what the f coordinate is
it's pretty obvious it's what direction

138
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:05,700
it's pretty obvious it's what direction
 

139
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,159
it's pretty obvious it's what direction
you're facing so I think zero is West

140
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:09,169
you're facing so I think zero is West
 

141
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:14,449
you're facing so I think zero is West
two is east and don't ask me what one in

142
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:14,459
two is east and don't ask me what one in
 

143
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,920
two is east and don't ask me what one in
three is because I always mix it up

144
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:16,930
three is because I always mix it up
 

145
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,240
three is because I always mix it up
okay I'll see you in a bit and we're

146
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,250
okay I'll see you in a bit and we're
 

147
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,220
okay I'll see you in a bit and we're
back so I just put ladders all the way

148
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,230
back so I just put ladders all the way
 

149
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,150
back so I just put ladders all the way
to the surface

150
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,160
to the surface
 

151
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,780
to the surface
okay so I need to get out of here again

152
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:28,790
okay so I need to get out of here again
 

153
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,850
okay so I need to get out of here again
the three chunks not the slimes then

154
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:30,860
the three chunks not the slimes then
 

155
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,920
the three chunks not the slimes then
spawn in meets there's one here there's

156
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:34,930
spawn in meets there's one here there's
 

157
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,030
spawn in meets there's one here there's
one here and there's one here so this is

158
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,040
one here and there's one here so this is
 

159
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,010
one here and there's one here so this is
the point where all three of them meet

160
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,020
the point where all three of them meet
 

161
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,180
the point where all three of them meet

yet they'll probably copy a few things

00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
yet they'll probably copy a few things
 

199
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,000
yet they'll probably copy a few things
from people and I might make up a few

from people and I might make up a few
 

201
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,580

so before I do too

206
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:15,350
so before I do too
 

207
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,070

before I do too much with this so I'm

before I do too much with this so I'm
just going to haul out these three

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:19,850
just going to haul out these three
 

211
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,540
just going to haul out these three
chunks and see if I can get slime

212
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:22,550
chunks and see if I can get slime

215
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,239

and what's the deal with these tunnels

216
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:29,249
and what's the deal with these tunnels
 

217
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:31,429
and what's the deal with these tunnels
well what I did is I just went all

218
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:31,439
well what I did is I just went all
 

219
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,589
well what I did is I just went all
around the perimeter of the three chunks

220
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:33,599
around the perimeter of the three chunks
 

221
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:37,849
around the perimeter of the three chunks
and I'm going to rig these with TNT all

222
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:37,859
and I'm going to rig these with TNT all
 

223
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:40,959
and I'm going to rig these with TNT all
around here and I will blow it all up

224
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:40,969
around here and I will blow it all up
 

225
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:53,299
around here and I will blow it all up
with the simple pull of a lever and only

226
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:53,309
with the simple pull of a lever and only
 

227
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:58,879
with the simple pull of a lever and only
one some more gold some of the resources

228
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:58,889
one some more gold some of the resources
 

229
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:01,189
one some more gold some of the resources
will get blown up by the TNT but I don't

230
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
will get blown up by the TNT but I don't
 

231
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,459
will get blown up by the TNT but I don't
really care more iron gas elope that's

00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:09,979
the perimeter of the three chunks we
went in

236
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:09,989
went in
 

237
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:15,499
went in
oops like we went in here goes in all

238
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:15,509
oops like we went in here goes in all
 

239
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:22,609
oops like we went in here goes in all
around and then comes back out here so

00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:22,619
around and then comes back out here so
 

241
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,039
around and then comes back out here so
I'll rig it with TNT and then I will be

242
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:25,049
I'll rig it with TNT and then I will be
 

243
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:31,219
I'll rig it with TNT and then I will be
back all right here we go so one my

244
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:31,229
back all right here we go so one my

stuff up so it goes all the way around

248
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:36,749
stuff up so it goes all the way around
 

249
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:40,809
stuff up so it goes all the way around
that perimeter I dug which is uh

250
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:40,819
that perimeter I dug which is uh
 

251
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:49,510
that perimeter I dug which is uh
actually one block shy of the edge so

252
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520

 

253
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,420

so like the chunk boundary is over here

254
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:52,430
so like the chunk boundary is over here
 

255
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,770
so like the chunk boundary is over here
but the perimeter is one block from that

256
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:56,780
but the perimeter is one block from that
 

257
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,420
but the perimeter is one block from that
edge if that makes sense

258
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:00,430

all the way around without me having to
 

263
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:33,430
all the way around without me having to
hit it a few times here real more

264
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
hit it a few times here real more
 

265
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:42,329

267
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:49,079

that's annoying okay one two three four

00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:49,089
that's annoying okay one two three four

I'll probably just mine out the rest of

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:09,770
I'll probably just mine out the rest of
 

275

I'll probably just mine out the rest of

this like what doesn't get blown up by

I get more done alright so there's lots

290
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:00,590
I get more done alright so there's lots
 

291
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,800
I get more done alright so there's lots
of blocks of mine out yet so I decided

292
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:02,810
of blocks of mine out yet so I decided
 

293
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,920
of blocks of mine out yet so I decided
to use TNT after all and I just cut out

294
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:05,930
to use TNT after all and I just cut out
 

295
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,790
to use TNT after all and I just cut out
these little slats here or these little

296
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:09,800
these little slats here or these little
 

297
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,360

tunnels by doing this I was able to get

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,370
tunnels by doing this I was able to get
 

299
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,980
tunnels by doing this I was able to get
all the diamonds and stuff out of them

300
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:14,990
all the diamonds and stuff out of them
 

301
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,900
all the diamonds and stuff out of them
and gold or at least I think I did at 21

302
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:19,910
and gold or at least I think I did at 21
 

303

let's set this off yeah I don't like the

312
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:42,140
let's set this off yeah I don't like the
 

313
00:10:42,140 --> 00:11:02,740
let's set this off yeah I don't like the
new TNT very much

314
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:02,750

 

315
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,810

all right cool

316
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:07,820

 

317
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,069

I'll just my not the rest of this stuff

318
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
I'll just my not the rest of this stuff
 

319
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:19,329
I'll just my not the rest of this stuff
now there's not much left and then

320
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:19,339
now there's not much left and then
 

321
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:21,050
now there's not much left and then
should be pretty good

322
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:21,060
should be pretty good
 

323
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:41,470
should be pretty good
I should really light this place up -

324
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:41,480

 

325
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,910

yeah I'm actually amazed just how well

326
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
yeah I'm actually amazed just how well
 

327
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,840
yeah I'm actually amazed just how well
this works already it's not even done

328
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:46,850
this works already it's not even done
 

329
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,439
this works already it's not even done
not even close to done and I just went

330
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:51,449
not even close to done and I just went
 

331
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:53,000
not even close to done and I just went
up to the surface for a little bit and I

332
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,010
up to the surface for a little bit and I
 

333
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:59,600
up to the surface for a little bit and I
got tons of slimes here so it has a lot

334
00:11:59,600 --> 00:11:59,610
got tons of slimes here so it has a lot
 

335
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:11,180
got tons of slimes here so it has a lot
of potential I think I'll kill them down

336
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,190
of potential I think I'll kill them down
 

337
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,220
of potential I think I'll kill them down
here although I kind of would like one

338
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,230
here although I kind of would like one
 

339
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,360
here although I kind of would like one
and would like a slime farm that

340
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,370
and would like a slime farm that
 

341
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:39,079
and would like a slime farm that
transports some of you anyway now one

342
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:39,089
transports some of you anyway now one
 

343
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:41,300
transports some of you anyway now one
thing I've noticed is that they don't

344
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:41,310
thing I've noticed is that they don't
 

345
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,309
thing I've noticed is that they don't
split if you kill them like with your

346
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:43,319
split if you kill them like with your
 

347
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:46,250
split if you kill them like with your
axe like if you kill a large one with in

348
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:46,260
axe like if you kill a large one with in
 

349
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,769
axe like if you kill a large one with in
your axe they won't split they'll just

350
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:48,779
your axe they won't split they'll just
 

351
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:49,309
your axe they won't split they'll just
die

352
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:49,319
die
 

353
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,750
die
and you won't get any slime balls from

354
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:50,760
and you won't get any slime balls from
 

355
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,379
and you won't get any slime balls from
them so I killed that big slime with my

356
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:54,389
them so I killed that big slime with my
 

357
00:12:54,389 --> 00:13:00,230
them so I killed that big slime with my
arrows and it killed them and it killed

358
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
arrows and it killed them and it killed
 

359
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,059
arrows and it killed them and it killed
them ends he split into all these little

360
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:02,069
them ends he split into all these little
 

361
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:03,980
them ends he split into all these little
slimes so I'm guessing you need to you

362
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:03,990
slimes so I'm guessing you need to you
 

363
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,590
slimes so I'm guessing you need to you
either use arrows or a sword if you kill

364
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:06,600
either use arrows or a sword if you kill
 

365
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,960
either use arrows or a sword if you kill
them manually but I'm pretty sure they

366
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:08,970
them manually but I'm pretty sure they
 

367
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,720
them manually but I'm pretty sure they
split if they suffocate or stuff like

368
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:13,730
split if they suffocate or stuff like
 

369
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:20,289
split if they suffocate or stuff like
- so now it should be really easy for

370
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:20,299
- so now it should be really easy for
 

371
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,299
- so now it should be really easy for
you to visualize where the three chunks

372
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:22,309
you to visualize where the three chunks
 

373
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:27,879
you to visualize where the three chunks
are that spawn slimes clearly see this

374
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:27,889
are that spawn slimes clearly see this
 

375
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:40,840
are that spawn slimes clearly see this
three sixteen by sixteen squares and you

376
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:40,850
three sixteen by sixteen squares and you
 

377
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,409
three sixteen by sixteen squares and you
get to get to between zero and two slime

378
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:44,419
get to get to between zero and two slime
 

379
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:49,079
get to get to between zero and two slime
balls each slimy into small slimy guilt

380
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:49,089
balls each slimy into small slimy guilt
 

381
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:58,599
balls each slimy into small slimy guilt
the bigger ones don't drop any really

382
00:13:58,599 --> 00:13:58,609
the bigger ones don't drop any really
 

383
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:07,840
the bigger ones don't drop any really
sure broadsword Jay so this isn't really

384
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:07,850
sure broadsword Jay so this isn't really
 

385
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,629

is it tilt excuse me this isn't really a

tutorial on how to make a slime farm

388
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:12,799
tutorial on how to make a slime farm
 

389
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,289
tutorial on how to make a slime farm
this is just to show you how I made mine

390
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:16,299
this is just to show you how I made mine
 

391
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:19,179
this is just to show you how I made mine
I can't really make it a tutorial on it

392
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:19,189
I can't really make it a tutorial on it
 

393
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:22,720
I can't really make it a tutorial on it
until I've at least made one otherwise I

394
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:22,730
until I've at least made one otherwise I
 

395
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,889
until I've at least made one otherwise I
would kind of be leading you blindly but

396
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:26,899
would kind of be leading you blindly but
 

397
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,599
would kind of be leading you blindly but
you should be able to pick up a few

398
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:28,609
you should be able to pick up a few
 

399
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:31,449
you should be able to pick up a few
things from this one thing that kind of

400
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:31,459
things from this one thing that kind of
 

401
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:33,369
things from this one thing that kind of
realized just now is that your slime

402
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:33,379
realized just now is that your slime
 

403
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:37,269
realized just now is that your slime
farm and your hostile mark your hostile

404
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
farm and your hostile mark your hostile
 

405
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,939
farm and your hostile mark your hostile
mob farm like with the creepers skeleton

406
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:39,949
mob farm like with the creepers skeleton
 

407
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:42,460
mob farm like with the creepers skeleton
zombies spiders the two are going to

408
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:42,470
zombies spiders the two are going to
 

409
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,189
zombies spiders the two are going to
interfere with each other

410
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:44,199
interfere with each other
 

411
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:47,529
interfere with each other
so if a slime spawns down here for

412
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:47,539
so if a slime spawns down here for
 

413
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:51,009
so if a slime spawns down here for
example that means that that's one less

414
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:51,019
example that means that that's one less
 

415
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:54,639
example that means that that's one less
mob spot for say a creeper to spawn in

416
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:54,649
mob spot for say a creeper to spawn in
 

417
00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:04,029
mob spot for say a creeper to spawn in
your other hostile mob trap so ideally I

418
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:04,039
your other hostile mob trap so ideally I
 

419
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,489
your other hostile mob trap so ideally I
would like to be able to shut the slime

420
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:06,499
would like to be able to shut the slime
 

421
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:09,609
would like to be able to shut the slime
farm off and also the hostile mob farm

422
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:09,619
farm off and also the hostile mob farm
 

423
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:11,849
farm off and also the hostile mob farm
off so that I could choose between

424
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:11,859
off so that I could choose between
 

425
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:15,729
off so that I could choose between
spawning slimes or spawning the other

426
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:15,739
spawning slimes or spawning the other
 

427
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:18,599
spawning slimes or spawning the other
hostile mobs like spiders creepers

428
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:18,609
hostile mobs like spiders creepers
 

429
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:22,359
hostile mobs like spiders creepers
skeleton zombies is you know or to have

430
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:22,369
skeleton zombies is you know or to have
 

431
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:26,460
skeleton zombies is you know or to have
them both going at the same time

432
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:26,470

 

433
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,810

if you do stop the hostile other hostile

434
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:31,820
if you do stop the hostile other hostile
 

435
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,500
if you do stop the hostile other hostile
mobs from spawning then you will get

436
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:35,510
mobs from spawning then you will get
 

437
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,620
mobs from spawning then you will get
tons of slimes I'm pretty sure because

438
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:37,630
tons of slimes I'm pretty sure because
 

439
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,230
tons of slimes I'm pretty sure because
the only mob that can spawn then is

440
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:41,240
the only mob that can spawn then is
 

441
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,040
the only mob that can spawn then is
slimes even though it's very rare for

442
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,050
slimes even though it's very rare for
 

443
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,280
slimes even though it's very rare for
them to spawn if nothing else can spawn

444
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,290
them to spawn if nothing else can spawn
 

445
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:56,590
them to spawn if nothing else can spawn
you'll get lots of slimes so actually

446
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:56,600
you'll get lots of slimes so actually
 

447
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,880
you'll get lots of slimes so actually
I'm going to test I'm gonna go shut off

448
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:57,890
I'm going to test I'm gonna go shut off
 

449
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,760
I'm going to test I'm gonna go shut off
my hostile mob system which

450
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:00,770
my hostile mob system which
 

451
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,590
my hostile mob system which
unfortunately I can only do right now by

452
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:02,600
unfortunately I can only do right now by
 

453
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,160
unfortunately I can only do right now by
placing torches with pistons though you

454
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,170
placing torches with pistons though you
 

455
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,530
placing torches with pistons though you
could set up floodgates to spawn to

456
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:08,540
could set up floodgates to spawn to
 

457
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,070
could set up floodgates to spawn to
flood the spawning pads and then no mobs

458
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,080
flood the spawning pads and then no mobs
 

459
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,900
flood the spawning pads and then no mobs
would be able to spawn on the spawning

460
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:13,910
would be able to spawn on the spawning
 

461
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:19,330
would be able to spawn on the spawning
pads but just first test I want to I'll

462
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:19,340
pads but just first test I want to I'll
 

463
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:25,030
pads but just first test I want to I'll
just shut off with torches all right

464
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
just shut off with torches all right
 

465
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,250
just shut off with torches all right
here we are my normal hostile mob

466
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:27,260
here we are my normal hostile mob
 

467
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,750
here we are my normal hostile mob
spawning system and it's all lit up now

468
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:30,760
spawning system and it's all lit up now
 

469
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,690
spawning system and it's all lit up now
so this is where most of the hostile

470
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:34,700
so this is where most of the hostile
 

471
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,410
so this is where most of the hostile
mobs were spawning let's head over the

472
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:38,420
mobs were spawning let's head over the
 

473
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:44,800
mobs were spawning let's head over the
slime farm now and see what happens okay

474
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:44,810
slime farm now and see what happens okay
 

475
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,720
slime farm now and see what happens okay
so I'm definitely noticing a major

476
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:48,730
so I'm definitely noticing a major
 

477
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,040
so I'm definitely noticing a major
increase in the spawning rates of the

478
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,050
increase in the spawning rates of the
 

479
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,770
increase in the spawning rates of the
slime since I've lit up my hostile mob

480
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:53,780
slime since I've lit up my hostile mob
 

481
00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:01,930
slime since I've lit up my hostile mob
system so that tells me one way to

482

system so that tells me one way to
 

483
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,360
system so that tells me one way to
increase spawns liming rates is to

484
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:04,370
increase spawns liming rates is to
 

485
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:09,790
increase spawns liming rates is to
decrease areas where creepers skeleton

486
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:09,800
decrease areas where creepers skeleton
 

487
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:16,270
decrease areas where creepers skeleton
spiders and zombies can spawn the other

488
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:16,280
spiders and zombies can spawn the other
 

489
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,939
spiders and zombies can spawn the other
way to increase slime spawning rates is

490
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:18,949
way to increase slime spawning rates is
 

491
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:20,980
way to increase slime spawning rates is
to increase the amount of area that

492
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:20,990
to increase the amount of area that
 

493
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:27,429
to increase the amount of area that
slimes can spawn inside your trap why is

494
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
slimes can spawn inside your trap why is
 

495
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:35,870
slimes can spawn inside your trap why is
this filled in here

496
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:35,880

 

497
00:17:35,880 --> 00:18:01,500

where is the skillet so you might think

498
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:01,510
where is the skillet so you might think
 

499
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,600
where is the skillet so you might think
you have all the caves lit up around

500
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:03,610
you have all the caves lit up around
 

501
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,930
you have all the caves lit up around
your world but there's always always

502
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:06,940
your world but there's always always
 

503
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:16,170
your world but there's always always
more places you least expect and so

504
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:16,180
more places you least expect and so
 

505
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,150
more places you least expect and so
since this galton spawn there that's one

506
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
since this galton spawn there that's one
 

507
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
since this galton spawn there that's one
slime that can't spawn because that's

508
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,170
slime that can't spawn because that's
 

509
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,830
slime that can't spawn because that's
skeleton is using up that mob spot

510
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:24,840

 

511
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,090

anyway let's check out the slime farm so

512
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:27,100
anyway let's check out the slime farm so
 

513
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,340

a few places probably where hostile mobs
 

521
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:47,190
a few places probably where hostile mobs
and spawn still so pretty much only mobs

522
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,200
and spawn still so pretty much only mobs
 

523

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:49,480
that will spawn though our slimes down
 

525
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,920

have three stacks just from testing so

556
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,020
have three stacks just from testing so
 

557
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,790
have three stacks just from testing so
which is probably more than I need even

558
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:14,800
which is probably more than I need even
 

559
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,750
which is probably more than I need even
because I don't go through that many

really to more despond yeah so I'll be

572
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,200
really to more despond yeah so I'll be
 

573
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,870
really to more despond yeah so I'll be
setting up like water canals and stuff

574
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:43,880
setting up like water canals and stuff
 

575
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,920
setting up like water canals and stuff
and spawning pads and I will probably be

576
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:47,930
and spawning pads and I will probably be
 

577
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,830
and spawning pads and I will probably be
making its multiple layers just to

578
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:50,840
making its multiple layers just to
 

579
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,990
making its multiple layers just to
increase the surface area for them to

580
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,000
increase the surface area for them to
 

581
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,360
increase the surface area for them to
spawn on I can go up to I think level 15

582
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:58,370
spawn on I can go up to I think level 15
 

583
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:06,360
spawn on I can go up to I think level 15
for the y coordinate or level 16 yeah

584
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:06,370
for the y coordinate or level 16 yeah
 

585
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,360
for the y coordinate or level 16 yeah
still not entirely sure how I'll do it

586
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:09,370
still not entirely sure how I'll do it

00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,030
still not entirely sure how I'll do it
but I'll think about it

588
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,040
but I'll think about it
 

589
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,380
but I'll think about it
and I might do some of it off-camera but

590
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:16,390
and I might do some of it off-camera but
 

591
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,810
and I might do some of it off-camera but
anyway thank you for watching and I will
