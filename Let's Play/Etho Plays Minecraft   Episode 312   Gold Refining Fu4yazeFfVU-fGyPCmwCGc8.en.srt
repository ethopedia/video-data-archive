the portal
 

61
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,350

what are we at here we're at entities
 

69
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,030
what are we at here we're at entities
687 so there's probably

70
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
687 so there's probably
 

71
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,310
687 so there's probably
maybe five 600 in there

72
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
maybe five 600 in there
 

73

the way i have it right now when i come
out of the portal up there

108
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
out of the portal up there
 

109
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,030
out of the portal up there
i have to drop down i'll probably set up

110
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
i have to drop down i'll probably set up
 

111
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,710
i have to drop down i'll probably set up
a platform over here

112
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
a platform over here
 

113
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,710
a platform over here
but for right now i just have a bunch of

but for right now i just have a bunch of
 

115
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,550
but for right now i just have a bunch of

so i equip that when i throw
 

121
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,910
so i equip that when i throw
the potion at them let's try this out

122
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920

 

123
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,229

okay so i throw it and then i switch

124
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
okay so i throw it and then i switch
 

125
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,350
okay so i throw it and then i switch
real quick

126
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
real quick
 

127
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,390
real quick
and they are mad now unfortunately it

128
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
and they are mad now unfortunately it
 

129
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,390
and they are mad now unfortunately it
does not just take one to kill him

130
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
does not just take one to kill him
 

131
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,509
does not just take one to kill him
right now it takes like five or more to

132
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
right now it takes like five or more to
 

133
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,350
right now it takes like five or more to
kill them

134
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360

 

135
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,869

oh i all forgot to switch here so

136
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
oh i all forgot to switch here so
 

137
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,229
oh i all forgot to switch here so
could be better you saw we killed a

138
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
could be better you saw we killed a
 

139
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,790
could be better you saw we killed a
bunch there

140
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
bunch there
 

141
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,869
bunch there
um but some of these guys are actually

142
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
um but some of these guys are actually
 

143
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,910
um but some of these guys are actually
at full health

144
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
at full health
 

145
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,309
at full health
so it takes a lot of hits to kill them

146
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319

 

147
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,910

what was that that was number f

148
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
what was that that was number f
 

149
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,830
what was that that was number f
four maybe five

150
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840

 

151
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,229

six it takes a lot right now so we

152
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
six it takes a lot right now so we
 

153
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,229
six it takes a lot right now so we
should do something about that

154
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239

 

155
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,830

go again seven

156
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840

 

157
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,550

eight

158
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560

automatic brewing station so it's not
 

163
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,430
automatic brewing station so it's not
tough to get these

164
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
tough to get these
 

165
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,270
tough to get these
and we get gold from them which is what

166
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
and we get gold from them which is what
 

167
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,710
and we get gold from them which is what
we need to make these 10

168

break very quick though it's a problem
 

345
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,029
break very quick though it's a problem
there's also a sharpness two one um

346
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
there's also a sharpness two one um
 

347
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,830
there's also a sharpness two one um
so that's cool these guys they drop 13

348
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
so that's cool these guys they drop 13
 

349
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,189
so that's cool these guys they drop 13
gold ingots like

350
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
gold ingots like
 

351
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,589
gold ingots like
the indian itself that it's a rare drop

352
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
the indian itself that it's a rare drop
 

353
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,110
the indian itself that it's a rare drop
you can get from zombie pigmen kind of

354
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
you can get from zombie pigmen kind of
 

355
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,029
you can get from zombie pigmen kind of
like you can get uh

356
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
like you can get uh
 

357
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,029
like you can get uh
iron ingots from zombies sometimes these

358
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
iron ingots from zombies sometimes these
 

359
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,390
iron ingots from zombies sometimes these
guys will give you

360
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
guys will give you
 

361
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,189
guys will give you
uh gold and gets every so often uh if

362
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
uh gold and gets every so often uh if
 

363
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,950
uh gold and gets every so often uh if
you kill them with player damage

364
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
you kill them with player damage
 

365
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,830
you kill them with player damage
so that's where some of those came from

366
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
so that's where some of those came from
 

367
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,629
so that's where some of those came from
um

368
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
um
 

369
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,869
um
we were able to enchant just about four

370
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
we were able to enchant just about four
 

371
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,909
we were able to enchant just about four
books so that's cool too

372
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
books so that's cool too
 

373
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,390
books so that's cool too
now to improve this thing we do need to

374
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
now to improve this thing we do need to
 

375
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,950
now to improve this thing we do need to
use

376
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
use
 

377
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,830
use
or we do need to make some changes we

378
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840
or we do need to make some changes we
 

379
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,270
or we do need to make some changes we
gotta make the hoppers pick up stuff

380
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
gotta make the hoppers pick up stuff
 

381
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,110
gotta make the hoppers pick up stuff
faster if we can

382
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
faster if we can
 

383
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,869
faster if we can
we should set up a sorting system so the

384
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
we should set up a sorting system so the
 

385
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,029
we should set up a sorting system so the
zombie flash and the ingots and

386
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
zombie flash and the ingots and
 

387
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,230
zombie flash and the ingots and
all this chicken junk gets separated

388
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
all this chicken junk gets separated
 

389
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,070
all this chicken junk gets separated
maybe find a way to filter through these

390
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
maybe find a way to filter through these
 

391
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,950
maybe find a way to filter through these
gold swords quicker too

392
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
gold swords quicker too
 

393
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,469
gold swords quicker too
um and then we probably should get a

394
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
um and then we probably should get a
 

395
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,070
um and then we probably should get a
crusher in here the way i'm doing this

396
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
crusher in here the way i'm doing this
 

397
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,750
crusher in here the way i'm doing this
right now

398
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
right now
 

399
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,990
right now
the zombie pigmen fall from the portal

400
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
the zombie pigmen fall from the portal
 

401
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,149
the zombie pigmen fall from the portal
they'll get like pushed off usually

402
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
they'll get like pushed off usually
 

403
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,389
they'll get like pushed off usually
there's one guy that stays up there but

404
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
there's one guy that stays up there but
 

405
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,030
there's one guy that stays up there but
all the others they they fall down some

406
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
all the others they they fall down some
 

407
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,389
all the others they they fall down some
of them will fall to the right and then

408
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:46,399
of them will fall to the right and then
 

409
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:46,710
of them will fall to the right and then
it's

410
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
it's
 

411
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,030
it's
just a straight drop down into that that

412
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
just a straight drop down into that that
 

413
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,990
just a straight drop down into that that
area there

414
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
area there
 

415
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,389
area there
but some of them get pushed to the left

416
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
but some of them get pushed to the left
 

417
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,269
but some of them get pushed to the left
and then they walk down these like steps

418
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:55,279
and then they walk down these like steps
 

419
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,509
and then they walk down these like steps
another layer there and then down um

420
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
another layer there and then down um
 

421
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,150
another layer there and then down um
so that works okay but the thing about

422
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
so that works okay but the thing about
 

423
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,430
so that works okay but the thing about
doing it this way

424
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
doing it this way
 

425
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,509
doing it this way
the ones that fall to the right they

426
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
the ones that fall to the right they
 

427
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,949
the ones that fall to the right they
take more damage than the ones that go

428
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
take more damage than the ones that go
 

429
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,470
take more damage than the ones that go
to the left

430
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
to the left
 

431
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,829
to the left
and same with our spawning floor some of

432
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
and same with our spawning floor some of
 

433
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,990
and same with our spawning floor some of
them take more damage

434
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
them take more damage
 

435
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,509
them take more damage
than other ones so might

436
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
than other ones so might
 

437
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,110
than other ones so might
need to make a few adjustments i think

438
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
need to make a few adjustments i think
 

439
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,430
need to make a few adjustments i think
what we should do also though is punch a

440
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
what we should do also though is punch a
 

441
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,550
what we should do also though is punch a
hole through

442
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
hole through
 

443
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,310
hole through
the nether ceiling so let's go do that

444
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320

 

445
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,389

i fell in this thing and i forgot this

446
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
i fell in this thing and i forgot this
 

447
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,630
i fell in this thing and i forgot this
guy is still mad at me

448
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
guy is still mad at me
 

449
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,389
guy is still mad at me
and yeah he he like one shot me stole my

450
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
and yeah he he like one shot me stole my
 

451
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,870
and yeah he he like one shot me stole my
boots and my sword

452
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
boots and my sword
 

453
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,269
boots and my sword
i got him back though all right let's

454
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
i got him back though all right let's
 

455
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,230
i got him back though all right let's
head on up to the nether roof

456
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240

 

457
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,389

actually just set here as looking at

458
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
actually just set here as looking at
 

459
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,430
actually just set here as looking at
this

460
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
this
 

461
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,949
this
some of the zombie pigmen like they

462
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
some of the zombie pigmen like they
 

463
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,710
some of the zombie pigmen like they
spawn up there and they fall down

464
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
spawn up there and they fall down
 

465
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,790
spawn up there and they fall down
all the way down to here and they take

466
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
all the way down to here and they take
 

467
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,750
all the way down to here and they take
like 10

468
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
like 10
 

469
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,910
like 10
blocks of fall damage while others they

470
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
blocks of fall damage while others they
 

471
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,509
blocks of fall damage while others they
might spawn

472
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
might spawn
 

473
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,990
might spawn
up here and they'll just gently be

474
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
up here and they'll just gently be
 

475
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,590
up here and they'll just gently be
pushed off down to here and then down

476
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
pushed off down to here and then down
 

477
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,310
pushed off down to here and then down
again

478
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
again
 

479
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,829
again
and take no fall damage when they go

480
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
and take no fall damage when they go
 

481
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,829
and take no fall damage when they go
through the portal so

482
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
through the portal so
 

483
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,430
through the portal so
for the crusher to work the best we want

484
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
for the crusher to work the best we want
 

485
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,949
for the crusher to work the best we want
to try to keep them all the same

486
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
to try to keep them all the same
 

487
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,110
to try to keep them all the same
health levels or as close to as possible

488
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
health levels or as close to as possible
 

489
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,949
health levels or as close to as possible
and can't really use lava i don't think

490
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
and can't really use lava i don't think
 

491
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:19,990
and can't really use lava i don't think
because i don't think they're falling

492
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
because i don't think they're falling
 

493
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,509
because i don't think they're falling
far enough where they'll all fall

494
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
far enough where they'll all fall
 

495
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,269
far enough where they'll all fall
through the lava some of them will get

496
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
through the lava some of them will get
 

497
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,069
through the lava some of them will get
stuck in it and stay swimming in it

498
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
stuck in it and stay swimming in it
 

499
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,030
stuck in it and stay swimming in it
uh cobwebs would be a little slow so i'm

500
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
uh cobwebs would be a little slow so i'm
 

501
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,509
uh cobwebs would be a little slow so i'm
thinking

502
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
thinking
 

503
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,150
thinking
maybe we can try vines and see how that

504
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
maybe we can try vines and see how that
 

505
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,310
maybe we can try vines and see how that
goes

506
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
goes
 

507
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,550
goes
let's see this is the first layer here

508
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560

 

509
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,829

so we would put i brought some vines

510
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
so we would put i brought some vines
 

511
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,030
so we would put i brought some vines
here we could put vines

512
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
here we could put vines
 

513
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,470
here we could put vines
here

514
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480

 

515
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,230

and then we got to prevent them from

516
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
and then we got to prevent them from
 

517
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,069
and then we got to prevent them from
growing too as other things so maybe

518
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
growing too as other things so maybe
 

519
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,990
growing too as other things so maybe
we could either use stringer buttons or

520
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
we could either use stringer buttons or
 

521
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,269
we could either use stringer buttons or
something

522
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
something
 

523
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,150
something
put them over here should be fine and

524
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
put them over here should be fine and
 

525
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,990
put them over here should be fine and
can we do that on the other side

526
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
can we do that on the other side
 

527
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,110
can we do that on the other side
yes we can okay good so i might try that

528
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
yes we can okay good so i might try that
 

529
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,670
yes we can okay good so i might try that
out it'll be really hard to monitor if

530
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
out it'll be really hard to monitor if
 

531
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,310
out it'll be really hard to monitor if
they get stuck in that though

532
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320

 

533
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,310

so we've jumped into a creative world

534
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
so we've jumped into a creative world
 

535
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,910
so we've jumped into a creative world
real quick here just to check

536
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
real quick here just to check
 

537
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,350
real quick here just to check
because i won't be able to see this when

538
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
because i won't be able to see this when
 

539
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,350
because i won't be able to see this when
i'm on top of the nether anyway

540
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
i'm on top of the nether anyway
 

541
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,310
i'm on top of the nether anyway
it'd be really hard to figure out okay

542
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
it'd be really hard to figure out okay
 

543
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,550
it'd be really hard to figure out okay
it looks like you fell down no problem

544
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
it looks like you fell down no problem
 

545
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,990
it looks like you fell down no problem
let's try different a few different

546
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
let's try different a few different
 

547
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,269
let's try different a few different
heights to see if they get stuck in the

548
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
heights to see if they get stuck in the
 

549
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,350
heights to see if they get stuck in the
vines

550
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
vines
 

551
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,030
vines
seem okay

552
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040

 

553
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,150

yeah vines seem to be working when it's

554
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
yeah vines seem to be working when it's
 

555
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,069
yeah vines seem to be working when it's
a single vine there comes a point where

556
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
a single vine there comes a point where
 

557
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,269
a single vine there comes a point where
they fall far enough

558
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
they fall far enough
 

559
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,870
they fall far enough
they just kind of fall through the vine

560
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
they just kind of fall through the vine
 

561
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,030
they just kind of fall through the vine
i think

562
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
i think
 

563
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,460
i think
oh yeah there we go

564
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:47,470

 

565
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,870

[Music]

566
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880

 

567
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,870

okay so that's at this height we're okay

568
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
okay so that's at this height we're okay
 

569
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,310
okay so that's at this height we're okay
here yeah we're okay there

570
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320

 

571
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,910

so i'll have to check the heights and

572
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
so i'll have to check the heights and
 

573
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,069
so i'll have to check the heights and
make sure none of them coincide with the

574
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
make sure none of them coincide with the
 

575
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,310
make sure none of them coincide with the
spawning pad heights

576
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
spawning pad heights
 

577
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,629
spawning pad heights
but otherwise it seems to work okay

578
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639

 

579
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,230

so i just double checked the heights

580
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
so i just double checked the heights
 

581
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,150
so i just double checked the heights
here of the spawning pads i don't think

582
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
here of the spawning pads i don't think
 

583
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,870
here of the spawning pads i don't think
any of the

584
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
any of the
 

585
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,389
any of the
the pigment will fall through the vines

586
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
the pigment will fall through the vines
 

587
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,870
the pigment will fall through the vines
like we saw at that one height

588
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
like we saw at that one height
 

589
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,069
like we saw at that one height
so that's good um the ones that spawn on

590
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
so that's good um the ones that spawn on
 

591
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,990
so that's good um the ones that spawn on
the rights they will fall

592
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
the rights they will fall
 

593
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,750
the rights they will fall
far enough to take a little bit of

594
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
far enough to take a little bit of
 

595
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,750
far enough to take a little bit of
damage here the ones on the left

596
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
damage here the ones on the left
 

597
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,030
damage here the ones on the left
won't uh but it's not a significant

598
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
won't uh but it's not a significant
 

599
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,389
won't uh but it's not a significant
amount so i think it's fine still

600
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
amount so i think it's fine still
 

601
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,470
amount so i think it's fine still
um we're not we're not aiming for

602
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
um we're not we're not aiming for
 

603
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,990
um we're not we're not aiming for
perfection here it's too late for that

604
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
perfection here it's too late for that
 

605
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,110
perfection here it's too late for that
i'd have to redesign

606
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
i'd have to redesign
 

607
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,990
i'd have to redesign
everything to get perfection so

608
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
everything to get perfection so
 

609
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,590
everything to get perfection so
got the vines in place got the buttons

610
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
got the vines in place got the buttons
 

611
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,910
got the vines in place got the buttons
in place oh man

612
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
in place oh man
 

613
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,790
in place oh man
add vine farm to my to-do list because

614
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
add vine farm to my to-do list because
 

615
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,829
add vine farm to my to-do list because
getting four stacks of vines is a little

616
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
getting four stacks of vines is a little
 

617
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,870
getting four stacks of vines is a little
annoying uh

618
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
annoying uh
 

619
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,590
annoying uh
i just grew a bunch of big jungle trees

620
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
i just grew a bunch of big jungle trees
 

621
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,269
i just grew a bunch of big jungle trees
and took them off of there but still

622
00:12:59,269 --> 00:12:59,279

 

623
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,190

now i made a mistake i can't actually

624
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
now i made a mistake i can't actually
 

625
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,350
now i made a mistake i can't actually
put buttons here because the pistons are

626
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
put buttons here because the pistons are
 

627
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,790
put buttons here because the pistons are
there so they're just going to push them

628
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
there so they're just going to push them
 

629
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,509
there so they're just going to push them
off

630
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
off
 

631
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,509
off
as soon as these pressure plates get

632
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
as soon as these pressure plates get
 

633
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,150
as soon as these pressure plates get
triggered also

634
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
triggered also
 

635
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,110
triggered also
but that's fine even if the vines grow

636
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
but that's fine even if the vines grow
 

637
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,310
but that's fine even if the vines grow
like this

638
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
like this
 

639
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,310
like this
when they get pushed they'll they'll

640
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
when they get pushed they'll they'll
 

641
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,670
when they get pushed they'll they'll
break every time

642
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
break every time
 

643
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,069
break every time
so i think it's gonna work out okay like

644
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
so i think it's gonna work out okay like
 

645
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,430
so i think it's gonna work out okay like
we have it here

646
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
we have it here
 

647
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,509
we have it here
but let's punch a hole into the ceiling

648
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
but let's punch a hole into the ceiling
 

649
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,470
but let's punch a hole into the ceiling
we are at

650
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
we are at
 

651
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,069
we are at
negative 43 z11

652
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:30,079
negative 43 z11
 

653
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,870
negative 43 z11
and up to this point i've been ender

654
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
and up to this point i've been ender
 

655
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,069
and up to this point i've been ender
pearling through every time

656
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:34,079
pearling through every time
 

657
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,910
pearling through every time
and that's getting a little annoying to

658
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
and that's getting a little annoying to
 

659
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,389
and that's getting a little annoying to
be honest

660
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
be honest
 

661
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,110
be honest
um i would like to be able to go down up

662
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
um i would like to be able to go down up
 

663
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,269
um i would like to be able to go down up
and down as i please here

664
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:43,279
and down as i please here
 

665
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,230
and down as i please here
and also i want to someday set up some

666
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
and also i want to someday set up some
 

667
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,750
and also i want to someday set up some
beacons here too

668
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
beacons here too
 

669
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,389
beacons here too
what'd i say it's 13 knows that 11.

670
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:52,399
what'd i say it's 13 knows that 11.
 

671
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,310
what'd i say it's 13 knows that 11.
i think why 43. i think i have the

672
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
i think why 43. i think i have the
 

673
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,710
i think why 43. i think i have the
portal centered

674
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
portal centered
 

675
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:04,150
portal centered
um should i take it out i

676
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680
all right then we replace pretty sure it
 

793
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,629
all right then we replace pretty sure it
would have worked

794
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
would have worked
 

795
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,670
would have worked
with just blocks

796
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
with just blocks
 

797
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,470
with just blocks
but now i'll never know alright do that

798
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
but now i'll never know alright do that
 

799
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,710
but now i'll never know alright do that

806
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
i didn't punch a hole maybe it doesn't
 

807
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,470
i didn't punch a hole maybe it doesn't
happen every time

808
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
happen every time
 

809
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,150
happen every time
oh no

810
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160

 

811
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,829

814
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199

 

815
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,350

well i ended up starting a tree farm for

816
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,360
well i ended up starting a tree farm for
 

817
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,870
well i ended up starting a tree farm for
saplings up here

818
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
saplings up here
 

819
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,669
saplings up here
i think we're doing pretty good now so

820
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:15,679
i think we're doing pretty good now so
 

821
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,949
i think we're doing pretty good now so
let's try this again i think that's a

822
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
let's try this again i think that's a
 

823
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,270
let's try this again i think that's a
random element to it

824
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
random element to it
 

825
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,309
random element to it
i'm gonna try

826
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319

 

827
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,630

restrict it a little more this time and

828
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
restrict it a little more this time and
 

829
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,549
restrict it a little more this time and
hopefully

830
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:26,559
hopefully
 

831
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,830
hopefully
that will force it to grow down let's do

832
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:30,840
that will force it to grow down let's do
 

833
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,789
that will force it to grow down let's do
this

834
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
this
 

835
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,909
this
um should we put it

836
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
um should we put it
 

837
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,710
um should we put it
here to really force it

838
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:40,720

 

839
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,789

this might be a mistake we'll see

840
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
this might be a mistake we'll see
 

841
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,029
this might be a mistake we'll see
all right let's leave a little opening

842
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039

 

843
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,750

um that's not what i was hoping for

844
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760

 

845
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,549

let's try it again

846

they'll land on these hoppers is the
 

1179
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,669
they'll land on these hoppers is the
plan

1180
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
plan
 

1181
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,870
plan
actually wait a minute right so

1182
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:50,880
actually wait a minute right so
 

1183
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,789
actually wait a minute right so
if they land on these hoppers down here

1184
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:52,799
if they land on these hoppers down here
 

1185
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,909
if they land on these hoppers down here
that means their head's going to be at

1186
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:53,919
that means their head's going to be at
 

1187
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,230
that means their head's going to be at
this level so we are going to put

1188
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
this level so we are going to put
 

1189
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,510
this level so we are going to put
the crusher the pistons back here can we

1190
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
the crusher the pistons back here can we
 

1191
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,630
the crusher the pistons back here can we
reach us

1192
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,640
reach us
 

1193
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,909
reach us
oh we can nice like this

1194
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:03,919
oh we can nice like this
 

1195
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,950
oh we can nice like this
those will come forward

1196
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
those will come forward
 

1197
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,029
those will come forward
push the clay into the zombie pigmen's

1198
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,039
push the clay into the zombie pigmen's
 

1199
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:09,990
push the clay into the zombie pigmen's
head

1200
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
head
 

1201
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,470
head
and suffocate them like they deserve

1202
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:14,480
and suffocate them like they deserve
 

1203
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,310
and suffocate them like they deserve
vile creatures um

1204
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
vile creatures um
 

1205
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,990
vile creatures um
okay so let's go over

1206
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,000
okay so let's go over
 

1207
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,830
okay so let's go over
all you really need is a hopper timer

1208
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,840
all you really need is a hopper timer
 

1209
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,149
all you really need is a hopper timer
it's so simple um

1210
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:28,159
it's so simple um
 

1211
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,149
it's so simple um
yeah let's do it like this we'll put

1212
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159

 

1213
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,630

the redstone wire here and i think um

1214
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:36,640
the redstone wire here and i think um
 

1215
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,630
the redstone wire here and i think um
let's do it like this so this one piece

1216
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
let's do it like this so this one piece
 

1217
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,470
let's do it like this so this one piece
of redstone dust will power both

1218
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,480
of redstone dust will power both
 

1219
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,549
of redstone dust will power both
power both pistons like it'll go into

1220
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:42,559
power both pistons like it'll go into
 

1221
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,470
power both pistons like it'll go into
this block

1222
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:44,480
this block
 

1223
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,230
this block
or wait will it

1224
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,240
or wait will it
 

1225
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,149
or wait will it
i think it will i think this will update

1226
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
i think it will i think this will update
 

1227
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,830
i think it will i think this will update
this piston will ex

1228
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
this piston will ex
 

1229
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,430
this piston will ex
extend and update this one and then

1230
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,440
extend and update this one and then
 

1231
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,029
extend and update this one and then
it'll go because this block is powering

1232
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:55,039
it'll go because this block is powering
 

1233
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,909
it'll go because this block is powering
it diagonally as a bud switch

1234
00:25:57,909 --> 00:25:57,919
it diagonally as a bud switch
 

1235
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,750
it diagonally as a bud switch
yeah i think that'll work it's a little

1236
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
yeah i think that'll work it's a little
 

1237
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,830
yeah i think that'll work it's a little
weird but it should work

1238
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:01,840
weird but it should work
 

1239
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,070
weird but it should work
um then we're going to set up a hopper

1240
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,080
um then we're going to set up a hopper
 

1241
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,110
um then we're going to set up a hopper
timer right above here

1242
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,120
timer right above here
 

1243
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,830
timer right above here
let me lay down a base so it's a little

1244
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:08,840
let me lay down a base so it's a little
 

1245
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,510
let me lay down a base so it's a little
easier

1246
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,520
easier
 

1247
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,350
easier
too high let's go a little lower

1248
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,360

 

1249
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,590

yeah this is the right height i think

1250
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
yeah this is the right height i think
 

1251
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,470
yeah this is the right height i think
yeah

1252
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:18,480
yeah
 

1253
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,470
yeah
okay so hopper timer the one i like to

1254
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:22,480
okay so hopper timer the one i like to
 

1255
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:22,870
okay so hopper timer the one i like to
use

1256
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
use
 

1257
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,870
use
is that one i showed in a tutorial a

1258
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:24,880
is that one i showed in a tutorial a
 

1259
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,390
is that one i showed in a tutorial a
long time ago it's just a six

1260
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:26,400
long time ago it's just a six
 

1261
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,789
long time ago it's just a six
by by two piston based one

1262
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:30,799
by by two piston based one
 

1263
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:37,190
by by two piston based one
um the way we're gonna do it

1264
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200

 

1265
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,029

yeah this is this isn't one that runs

1266
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
yeah this is this isn't one that runs
 

1267
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,390
yeah this is this isn't one that runs
all the time it's only when you click a

1268
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,400
all the time it's only when you click a
 

1269
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,950
all the time it's only when you click a
button

1270
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:40,960
button
 

1271
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,350
button
and so the redstone block sticks to the

1272
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,360
and so the redstone block sticks to the
 

1273
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,029
and so the redstone block sticks to the
one

1274
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:45,039
one
 

1275
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,549
one
it sticks to the piston that is the

1276
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:46,559
it sticks to the piston that is the
 

1277
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,470
it sticks to the piston that is the
sticky piston so this is the sticky

1278
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,480
sticky piston so this is the sticky
 

1279
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,350
sticky piston so this is the sticky
piston

1280
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,360
piston
 

1281
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,269
piston
and i'm going to put a regular piston on

1282
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:51,279
and i'm going to put a regular piston on
 

1283
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,870
and i'm going to put a regular piston on
this side

1284
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
this side
 

1285
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,390
this side
so the default position of the redstone

1286
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
so the default position of the redstone
 

1287
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,909
so the default position of the redstone
block here is going to be

1288
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
block here is going to be
 

1289
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,190
block here is going to be
by the sticky piston over here um

1290
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,200
by the sticky piston over here um
 

1291
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,830
by the sticky piston over here um
so these pistons won't be extended but

1292
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840
so these pistons won't be extended but
 

1293
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,029
so these pistons won't be extended but
if the block is over here

1294
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:07,039

 

1295
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,630

wait a second

1296
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:10,640

 

1297
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,269

let's get rid of this there we go you

1298
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:13,279
let's get rid of this there we go you
 

1299
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,669
let's get rid of this there we go you
see that updates both of them

1300
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:15,679
see that updates both of them
 

1301
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,149
see that updates both of them
yeah i guess i can't have a block there

1302
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:18,159
yeah i guess i can't have a block there
 

1303
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,549
yeah i guess i can't have a block there
otherwise it powers that piston

1304
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:20,559
otherwise it powers that piston
 

1305
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,669
otherwise it powers that piston
um okay

1306
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:23,679
um okay
 

1307
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,029
um okay
let's put this back oh

1308
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
let's put this back oh
 

1309
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,350
let's put this back oh
i said quickly right why am i fumbling

1310
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:29,360
i said quickly right why am i fumbling
 

1311
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,310
i said quickly right why am i fumbling
around so much

1312
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,320
around so much
 

1313
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,269
around so much
let's get to it here uh then

1314
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:35,279
let's get to it here uh then
 

1315
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,350
let's get to it here uh then
block here block here

1316
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360

 

1317
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,470

redstone dust oops

1318
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:42,480
redstone dust oops
 

1319
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,630
redstone dust oops
redstone dust and the hoppers

1320
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
redstone dust and the hoppers
 

1321
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,230
redstone dust and the hoppers
you know what i could have made it go

1322
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:48,240
you know what i could have made it go
 

1323
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,029
you know what i could have made it go
let's make it go this way instead

1324
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:51,039
let's make it go this way instead
 

1325
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,710
let's make it go this way instead
be even more compact

1326
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:56,720

 

1327
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,750

what am i doing uh yeah

1328
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
what am i doing uh yeah
 

1329
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,510
what am i doing uh yeah
ignore this this line here that we just

1330
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:01,520
ignore this this line here that we just
 

1331
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,950
ignore this this line here that we just
set up

1332
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
set up
 

1333
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,070
set up
okay comparators

1334
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,080
okay comparators
 

1335
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,549
okay comparators
there we go comparators hoppers

1336
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,559

 

1337
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,269

facing into each other like so

1338
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:17,279
facing into each other like so
 

1339
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,470
facing into each other like so
and that's about it and i believe to

1340
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:20,480
and that's about it and i believe to
 

1341
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,029
and that's about it and i believe to
kill

1342
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:21,039
kill
 

1343
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,750
kill
or to soften up a mob like a regular 10

1344
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:23,760
or to soften up a mob like a regular 10
 

1345
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,110
or to soften up a mob like a regular 10
heart mob

1346
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,120
heart mob
 

1347
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,590
heart mob
you want about i think it's 25 blocks in

1348
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:27,600
you want about i think it's 25 blocks in
 

1349
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,750
you want about i think it's 25 blocks in
it

1350
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:29,760
it
 

1351
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,789
it
that'll run

1352
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:32,799

 

1353
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,870

um let's see they're going towards the

1354
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:34,880
um let's see they're going towards the
 

1355
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,710
um let's see they're going towards the
sticky piston that's the defaults

1356
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:36,720
sticky piston that's the defaults
 

1357
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,710
sticky piston that's the defaults
they'll end up there

1358
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:40,720

 

1359
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,269

yeah okay so when we update this

1360
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:45,279
yeah okay so when we update this
 

1361
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,470
yeah okay so when we update this
this sticky piston will push it so

1362
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:48,480
this sticky piston will push it so
 

1363
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,950
this sticky piston will push it so
uh we can actually set up a button down

1364
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:50,960
uh we can actually set up a button down
 

1365
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,389
uh we can actually set up a button down
here

1366
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:52,399
here
 

1367
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,630
here
very nicely on the right probably

1368
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,640

 

1369
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,870

which will activate the crusher

1370
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:00,880

 

1371
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,190

um just give me a second

1372
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,200
um just give me a second
 

1373
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,669
um just give me a second
see we got to send power to here i think

1374
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:09,679
see we got to send power to here i think
 

1375
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,870
see we got to send power to here i think
just to show you let's go back up

1376
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:14,880

 

1377
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,470

yeah so this is this is where the

1378
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,480
yeah so this is this is where the
 

1379
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,470
yeah so this is this is where the
redstone dust is if we

1380
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
redstone dust is if we
 

1381
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,470
redstone dust is if we
if we update it's not that we actually

1382
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,480
if we update it's not that we actually
 

1383
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,310
if we update it's not that we actually
power

1384
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:22,320
power
 

1385
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,350
power
um this piston we just update it by

1386
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,360
um this piston we just update it by
 

1387
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,830
um this piston we just update it by
sending a redstone signal near it

1388
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:27,840
sending a redstone signal near it
 

1389
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,110
sending a redstone signal near it
um so

1390
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,120
um so
 

1391
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,830
um so
tell you what let's do it like this get

1392
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:33,840
tell you what let's do it like this get
 

1393
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,389
tell you what let's do it like this get
the block

1394
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:34,399
the block
 

1395
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,190
the block
like here put a repeater

1396
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,200

 

1397
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,789

so otherwise the comparator above there

1398
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:40,799
so otherwise the comparator above there
 

1399
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,669
so otherwise the comparator above there
will send power down

1400
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:43,679
will send power down
 

1401
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,590
will send power down
and

1402
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:47,600

 

1403
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,190

yeah like this wait let's do it so we

1404
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:51,200
yeah like this wait let's do it so we
 

1405
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,830
yeah like this wait let's do it so we
can place it

1406
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:52,840
can place it
 

1407
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,350
can place it
redstone that goes through that goes to

1408
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,360
redstone that goes through that goes to
 

1409
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,310
redstone that goes through that goes to
there

1410
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
there
 

1411
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,070
there
get rid of that block we don't want the

1412
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
get rid of that block we don't want the
 

1413
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,990
get rid of that block we don't want the
pistons moving like that

1414
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,000
pistons moving like that
 

1415
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,110
pistons moving like that
and then that goes up to there and that

1416
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
and then that goes up to there and that
 

1417
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,590
and then that goes up to there and that
should

1418
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:03,600
should
 

1419
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,630
should
do it i think

1420
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:08,640

 

1421
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,909

let's hope it's working

1422
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:11,919

 

1423
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,430

so then the next thing is just fiddle

1424
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,440
so then the next thing is just fiddle
 

1425
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,269
so then the next thing is just fiddle
around with how many items you put in

1426
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:15,279
around with how many items you put in
 

1427
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:15,750
around with how many items you put in
the

1428
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
the
 

1429
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,029
the
hopper timer to get it suffocating them

1430
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:19,039
hopper timer to get it suffocating them
 

1431
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,710
hopper timer to get it suffocating them
as much as you want

1432
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:22,720
as much as you want
 

1433
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,510
as much as you want
everything's going back cool cool let's

1434
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:25,520
everything's going back cool cool let's
 

1435
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,750
everything's going back cool cool let's
get some more glowstone back here

1436
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:29,760

 

1437
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,750

oh you know i wanted to demonstrate this

1438
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:31,760
oh you know i wanted to demonstrate this
 

1439
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,830
oh you know i wanted to demonstrate this
too

1440
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:33,840
too
 

1441
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,470
too
um oh and i gotta light this with the

1442
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
um oh and i gotta light this with the
 

1443
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,909
um oh and i gotta light this with the
glass in front

1444
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:39,919

 

1445
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,230

yeah so it's pretty simple it's

1446
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
yeah so it's pretty simple it's
 

1447
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,149
yeah so it's pretty simple it's
basically just a hopper timer

1448
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:46,159

 

1449
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,470

cool all right i'm gonna get

1450
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,480
cool all right i'm gonna get
 

1451
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,630
cool all right i'm gonna get
a bunch of pigments spawning again and

1452
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:52,640
a bunch of pigments spawning again and
 

1453
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,149
a bunch of pigments spawning again and
then we will see if we can kill them

1454
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:54,159
then we will see if we can kill them
 

1455
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,950
then we will see if we can kill them
with one health potion

1456
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:56,960
with one health potion
 

1457
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,870
with one health potion
hopefully hopefully only one that would

1458
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:58,880
hopefully hopefully only one that would
 

1459
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,269
hopefully hopefully only one that would
be ideal

1460
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:03,279

 

1461
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,950

still forgot to put the half slabs on

1462
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:04,960
still forgot to put the half slabs on
 

1463
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,110
still forgot to put the half slabs on
there uh i just went

1464
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
there uh i just went
 

1465
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,909
there uh i just went
wait a minute am i gonna die if i go

1466
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:09,919
wait a minute am i gonna die if i go
 

1467
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,830
wait a minute am i gonna die if i go
through here no i should be fine

1468
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
through here no i should be fine
 

1469
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,509
through here no i should be fine
just went for five minutes this time we

1470
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:13,519
just went for five minutes this time we
 

1471
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,830
just went for five minutes this time we
want to see how things

1472
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:15,840
want to see how things
 

1473
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,870
want to see how things
work i'm okay please tell me i'm okay

1474
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:20,880
work i'm okay please tell me i'm okay
 

1475
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,870
work i'm okay please tell me i'm okay
i'm doing great oh yeah

1476
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:24,880
i'm doing great oh yeah
 

1477
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,070
i'm doing great oh yeah
look at this much better

1478
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,080

 

1479
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,070

okay where did i leave those instant

1480
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
okay where did i leave those instant
 

1481
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,110
okay where did i leave those instant
healths

1482
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,120
healths
 

1483
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,710
healths
i might have to adjust the timing on

1484
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
i might have to adjust the timing on
 

1485
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,870
i might have to adjust the timing on
here i might want 24 items in the

1486
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:36,880
here i might want 24 items in the
 

1487
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,149
here i might want 24 items in the
hoppers not 25

1488
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:38,159
hoppers not 25
 

1489
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,669
hoppers not 25
because they do take a little damage

1490
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:39,679
because they do take a little damage
 

1491
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:40,310
because they do take a little damage

i'm gonna
 

1499
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,029
i'm gonna
grab the looting sword uh put some jump

1500
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:49,039
grab the looting sword uh put some jump
 

1501
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,789
grab the looting sword uh put some jump
in here

in case they get me
yeah i'm gonna take all these just in

1506
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,200
yeah i'm gonna take all these just in
 

1507
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,830
yeah i'm gonna take all these just in
case we figured something out wrong and

1508
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840
case we figured something out wrong and
 

1509
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,950
case we figured something out wrong and
we need to kill or use a lot more than i

1510
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:00,960
we need to kill or use a lot more than i
 

1511
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,450
we need to kill or use a lot more than i
expected

1512
