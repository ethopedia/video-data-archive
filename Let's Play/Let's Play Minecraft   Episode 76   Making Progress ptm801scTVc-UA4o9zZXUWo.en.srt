5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,950

and i don't mind they're just having a

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
and i don't mind they're just having a
 

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,870
and i don't mind they're just having a
party on my roof

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
party on my roof
 

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,390
party on my roof
how's it going everybody uh

10
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
how's it going everybody uh
 

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,390
how's it going everybody uh
i've been working on the treat on the

12
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:22,400
i've been working on the treat on the
 

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,630
i've been working on the treat on the
slime farm a little bit

14
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640

 

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,550

i wasn't really sure how i was doing it

16
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
i wasn't really sure how i was doing it
 

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,070
i wasn't really sure how i was doing it
last episode

18
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
last episode
 

19
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,990
last episode
i got a little bit of a better idea now

20
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
i got a little bit of a better idea now
 

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,350
i got a little bit of a better idea now
but one thing i did decide is that i

22
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
but one thing i did decide is that i
 

23
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:37,990
but one thing i did decide is that i
wanted to

24
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000
wanted to
 

25
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,069
wanted to
make a switch so that i could turn the

26
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
make a switch so that i could turn the
 

27
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,630
make a switch so that i could turn the
slime farm on or off

28
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
slime farm on or off
 

29
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,709
slime farm on or off
and i came up with a pretty easy way of

30
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
and i came up with a pretty easy way of
 

31
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,229
and i came up with a pretty easy way of
doing that

32
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
doing that
 

33
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,869
doing that
which most of you suggested to me too

34
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
which most of you suggested to me too
 

35
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,950
which most of you suggested to me too
just using water

36
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960

 

37
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,150

here we are at the slime farm

38
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160

 

39
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,150

sometimes i find the slime balls just

40
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
sometimes i find the slime balls just
 

41
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,400
sometimes i find the slime balls just
randomly

42
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:03,410
randomly
 

43
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,230
randomly
[Applause]

44
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
[Applause]
 

45
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,830
[Applause]
on the ground like these suffocates

46
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,840

 

47
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,350

somehow

48
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
somehow
 

49
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,429
somehow
but yeah this is uh this is what i got

50
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
but yeah this is uh this is what i got
 

51
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,429
but yeah this is uh this is what i got
so far it's not done yet

52
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439

 

53
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,510

as you can see these are pistons all

54
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
as you can see these are pistons all
 

55
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,390
as you can see these are pistons all
along here

56
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400

 

57
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,550

they're sticky pistons

58
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560

 

59
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,670

all along this side all along the side

60
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
all along this side all along the side
 

61
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,670
all along this side all along the side
i had plenty of slime balls to make them

62
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
i had plenty of slime balls to make them
 

63
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,310
i had plenty of slime balls to make them
thankfully

64
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320

 

65
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,990

and i just have it lit up in here right

66
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
and i just have it lit up in here right
 

67
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,350
and i just have it lit up in here right
now

68
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
now
 

69
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,389
now
so that you guys can see

70
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
so that you guys can see
 

71
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,389
so that you guys can see
i need to put lights in the ceiling

72
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
i need to put lights in the ceiling
 

73
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,149
i need to put lights in the ceiling
though

74
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
though
 

75
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,429
though
because these torches are going to get

76
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
because these torches are going to get
 

77
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,469
because these torches are going to get
washed away

78
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479

 

79
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,630

but maybe i'll show you the wiring here

80
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640

 

81
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,109

just just stay put guys stay put i'll be

82
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
just just stay put guys stay put i'll be
 

83
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,389
just just stay put guys stay put i'll be
back

84
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
back
 

85
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,910
back
so i'll have a lever

86
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920

 

87
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,990

and this wire here activates all the

88
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
and this wire here activates all the
 

89
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,590
and this wire here activates all the
pistons

90
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
pistons
 

91
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,510
pistons
and every so often there's a repeater

92
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520

 

93
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,229

uh piston over here still gets activated

94
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
uh piston over here still gets activated
 

95
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,510
uh piston over here still gets activated
by this wire

96
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
by this wire
 

97
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,190
by this wire
one over here gets activated by the

98
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
one over here gets activated by the
 

99
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,869
one over here gets activated by the
repeater

100
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
repeater
 

101
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,630
repeater
one over here gets activated by the wire

102
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
one over here gets activated by the wire
 

103
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,630
one over here gets activated by the wire
again this kind of goes around

104
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
again this kind of goes around
 

105
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,200
again this kind of goes around
like that

106
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,210
like that
 

107
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,670
like that
[Applause]

108
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
[Applause]
 

109
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,589
[Applause]
and it goes all the way around

110
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599

 

111
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,589

doing the same thing

112
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599

 

113
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,750

just like that

114
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760

 

115
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,670

one thing i kind of decided is i don't

116
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
one thing i kind of decided is i don't
 

117
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,070
one thing i kind of decided is i don't
want to have any pistons running on a

118
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
want to have any pistons running on a
 

119
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,470
want to have any pistons running on a
loop in my world because

120
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480

 

121
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,430

because i find they uh like the game a

122
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
because i find they uh like the game a
 

123
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,390
because i find they uh like the game a
lot

124
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
lot
 

125
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,830
lot
so i don't really want any continuously

126
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
so i don't really want any continuously
 

127
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,309
so i don't really want any continuously
running

128
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
running
 

129
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,869
running
elevators or anything like that

130
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879

 

131
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,430

so if i'm gonna make anything with

132
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
so if i'm gonna make anything with
 

133
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,550
so if i'm gonna make anything with
pistons

134
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
pistons
 

135
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,110
pistons
they need to be manually activated

136
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120
they need to be manually activated
 

137
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,630
they need to be manually activated
that's kind of what i want

138
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
that's kind of what i want
 

139
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,710
that's kind of what i want
so like this even though this causes a

140
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
so like this even though this causes a
 

141
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,229
so like this even though this causes a
lot of lag

142
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
lot of lag
 

143
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,990
lot of lag
to switch this on and off it's manually

144
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
to switch this on and off it's manually
 

145
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,990
to switch this on and off it's manually
activated oh

146
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
activated oh
 

147
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,869
activated oh
ah

148
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879

 

149
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,149

there's actually a lot of slimes down

150
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
there's actually a lot of slimes down
 

151
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,550
there's actually a lot of slimes down
here

152
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560

 

153
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,630

yeah i'll show you how this works

154
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
yeah i'll show you how this works
 

155
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,869
yeah i'll show you how this works
nice got a lever over here flick it

156
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
nice got a lever over here flick it
 

157
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,869
nice got a lever over here flick it
water gates come all the slimes get

158
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
water gates come all the slimes get
 

159
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,670
water gates come all the slimes get
pushed

160
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
pushed
 

161
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,470
pushed
to that corner there

162
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
to that corner there
 

163
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,149
to that corner there
that one's stuck on the chest it's not

164
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
that one's stuck on the chest it's not
 

165
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,950
that one's stuck on the chest it's not
supposed to be there

166
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:49,960
supposed to be there
 

167
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,789
supposed to be there
[Applause]

168
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
[Applause]
 

169
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,070
[Applause]
they can't fight the currents

170
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
they can't fight the currents
 

171
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,910
they can't fight the currents
uh one thing i did find out though is i

172
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
uh one thing i did find out though is i
 

173
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,550
uh one thing i did find out though is i
need to change this water here because

174
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
need to change this water here because
 

175
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,120
need to change this water here because
it's pushing me back

176
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,130
it's pushing me back
 

177
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,910
it's pushing me back
[Applause]

178
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
[Applause]
 

179
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,410
[Applause]
but yeah that's all i got so far

180
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:15,420
but yeah that's all i got so far
 

181
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,150
but yeah that's all i got so far
[Applause]

182
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
[Applause]
 

183
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,310
[Applause]
and they'll all kind of go towards a

184
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
and they'll all kind of go towards a
 

185
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:30,040
and they'll all kind of go towards a
corner like that

186
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,050

 

187
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,430

[Applause]

188
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
[Applause]
 

189
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,270
[Applause]
yeah it's kind of challenging to make a

190
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
yeah it's kind of challenging to make a
 

191
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,629
yeah it's kind of challenging to make a
slime farm

192
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
slime farm
 

193
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,950
slime farm
that's a weird shape like this because

194
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
that's a weird shape like this because
 

195
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,550
that's a weird shape like this because
there's only three chunks where they

196
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
there's only three chunks where they
 

197
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,990
there's only three chunks where they
could spawn

198
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000

 

199
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,110

there we go

200
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120

 

201
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,670

but this seems to work okay this is

202
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
but this seems to work okay this is
 

203
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,430
but this seems to work okay this is
actually very simple

204
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
actually very simple
 

205
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,270
actually very simple
i was going to do like spawning pads and

206
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
i was going to do like spawning pads and
 

207
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,110
i was going to do like spawning pads and
stuff but it just

208
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120

 

209
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,469

didn't seem like it was going to make

210
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
didn't seem like it was going to make
 

211
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,990
didn't seem like it was going to make
sense because if i was to have water

212
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
sense because if i was to have water
 

213
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,270
sense because if i was to have water
come out of the

214
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
come out of the
 

215
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,510
come out of the
out of the ceiling onto the spawning

216
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
out of the ceiling onto the spawning
 

217
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,189
out of the ceiling onto the spawning
pads i would need to make the spawning

218
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
pads i would need to make the spawning
 

219
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,070
pads i would need to make the spawning
pads a diamond

220
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
pads a diamond
 

221
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,510
pads a diamond
shape for the water to go all over the

222
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
shape for the water to go all over the
 

223
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,029
shape for the water to go all over the
spawning pads

224
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
spawning pads
 

225
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:24,390
spawning pads
which would be fine but okay seriously

226
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
which would be fine but okay seriously
 

227
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,950
which would be fine but okay seriously
it would be fine but you can't have

228
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
it would be fine but you can't have
 

229
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,150
it would be fine but you can't have
water canals

230
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
water canals
 

231
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,950
water canals
on diamond shaped spawning pads so

232
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960

 

233
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,310

didn't really uh make much sense so i

234
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
didn't really uh make much sense so i
 

235
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,350
didn't really uh make much sense so i
just did a

236
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
just did a
 

237
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,790
just did a
totally flat land like this i might make

238
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
totally flat land like this i might make
 

239
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,990
totally flat land like this i might make
it two levels still i'm not sure

240
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000

 

241
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:56,070

and i gotta change all this

242
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080

 

243
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:03,350

[Applause]

244
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360

 

245
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,150

my armor is almost all done

246
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160

 

247
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,029

okay but anyway my plan is i kind of

248
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
okay but anyway my plan is i kind of
 

249
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:11,909
okay but anyway my plan is i kind of
want

250
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
want
 

251
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,029
want
a few options here

252
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
a few options here
 

253
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,230
a few options here
one thing i'll probably do is i'll make

254
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
one thing i'll probably do is i'll make
 

255
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,710
one thing i'll probably do is i'll make
a little ladder elevator to bring the

256
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
a little ladder elevator to bring the
 

257
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,350
a little ladder elevator to bring the
slimes to the surface

258
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
slimes to the surface
 

259
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,550
slimes to the surface
much like uh roboticos uses

260
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
much like uh roboticos uses
 

261
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,150
much like uh roboticos uses
i'll probably copy his slime

262
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
i'll probably copy his slime
 

263
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,670
i'll probably copy his slime
slime evader thing but i also want to be

264
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
slime evader thing but i also want to be
 

265
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,710
slime evader thing but i also want to be
able to transport

266
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
able to transport
 

267
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,790
able to transport
the big slimes to the surface just

268
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
the big slimes to the surface just
 

269
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,510
the big slimes to the surface just
because i think that would be cool

270
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
because i think that would be cool
 

271
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,909
because i think that would be cool
so i'll probably make another

272
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
so i'll probably make another
 

273
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,790
so i'll probably make another
elevator thing for them it'll probably

274
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
elevator thing for them it'll probably
 

275
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,670
elevator thing for them it'll probably
be slower

276
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
be slower
 

277
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,430
be slower
but i'll have a way of getting the big

278
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
but i'll have a way of getting the big
 

279
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,469
but i'll have a way of getting the big
ones to the surface too

280
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
ones to the surface too
 

281
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,510
ones to the surface too
hopefully anyway

282
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
hopefully anyway
 

283
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,790
hopefully anyway
this isn't what i'm going to be working

284
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
this isn't what i'm going to be working
 

285
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,150
this isn't what i'm going to be working
on this episode we're going to do

286
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
on this episode we're going to do
 

287
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,790
on this episode we're going to do
something else

288
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
something else
 

289
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,550
something else
okay there's a few other things i should

290
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
okay there's a few other things i should
 

291
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,070
okay there's a few other things i should
probably mention about my

292
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
probably mention about my
 

293
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,230
probably mention about my
slime farm plan here um

294
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
slime farm plan here um
 

295
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,990
slime farm plan here um
obviously when the water is all over the

296
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
obviously when the water is all over the
 

297
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,830
obviously when the water is all over the
ground like that no slimes will be able

298
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
ground like that no slimes will be able
 

299
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,390
ground like that no slimes will be able
to spawn down here so that's how you can

300
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
to spawn down here so that's how you can
 

301
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,749
to spawn down here so that's how you can
shut slime spawning off

302
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
shut slime spawning off
 

303
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,870
shut slime spawning off
the water will also push them to

304
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
the water will also push them to
 

305
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,309
the water will also push them to
the slime evaders i'll probably have two

306
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
the slime evaders i'll probably have two
 

307
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,430
the slime evaders i'll probably have two
in this corner somewhere not entirely

308
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
in this corner somewhere not entirely
 

309
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,230
in this corner somewhere not entirely
sure how i'm

310
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
sure how i'm
 

311
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,070
sure how i'm
reading that up yet uh

312
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080

 

313
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,110

so the water does two things shut slime

314
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
so the water does two things shut slime
 

315
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,390
so the water does two things shut slime
spawning off and it also pushes them

316
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
spawning off and it also pushes them
 

317
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,670
spawning off and it also pushes them
unlike my hostile mob system with that

318
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
unlike my hostile mob system with that
 

319
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,950
unlike my hostile mob system with that
the mobs are automatically killed and

320
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
the mobs are automatically killed and
 

321
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,029
the mobs are automatically killed and
their items are automatically delivered

322
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
their items are automatically delivered
 

323
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,629
their items are automatically delivered
constantly and you can either pick them

324
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
constantly and you can either pick them
 

325
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:52,950
constantly and you can either pick them
up

326
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
up
 

327
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,430
up
or if you don't you'll miss them and

328
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
or if you don't you'll miss them and
 

329
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,830
or if you don't you'll miss them and
items will despawn

330
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
items will despawn
 

331
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,629
items will despawn
with slimes though they don't spawn

332
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
with slimes though they don't spawn
 

333
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,950
with slimes though they don't spawn
nearly as often as hostile mobs so i

334
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
nearly as often as hostile mobs so i
 

335
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,670
nearly as often as hostile mobs so i
don't want their items just

336
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
don't want their items just
 

337
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,469
don't want their items just
being automatically delivered because i

338
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
being automatically delivered because i
 

339
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,950
being automatically delivered because i
might miss them if i do that

340
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
might miss them if i do that
 

341
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,710
might miss them if i do that
so uh

342
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
so uh
 

343
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,309
so uh
slime ball collection will be done

344
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
slime ball collection will be done
 

345
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,629
slime ball collection will be done
manually by flicking a lever

346
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
manually by flicking a lever
 

347
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,029
manually by flicking a lever
cause the water to flow to bring the

348
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
cause the water to flow to bring the
 

349
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,110
cause the water to flow to bring the
slimes up a slime elevator

350
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
slimes up a slime elevator
 

351
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,629
slimes up a slime elevator
and possibly to a killing chamber above

352
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
and possibly to a killing chamber above
 

353
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,550
and possibly to a killing chamber above
is the plan

354
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560

 

355
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,949

the way slime spawning works is a little

356
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
the way slime spawning works is a little
 

357
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,310
the way slime spawning works is a little
bit

358
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
bit
 

359
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,070
bit
weird the

360
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
weird the
 

361
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,630
weird the
spawn on hard if you switch at the

362
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
spawn on hard if you switch at the
 

363
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,790
spawn on hard if you switch at the
peaceful though

364
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
peaceful though
 

365
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,150
peaceful though
they don't disappear well they spawn on

366
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
they don't disappear well they spawn on
 

367
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,710
they don't disappear well they spawn on
easy

368
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
easy
 

369
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,509
easy
normal or hard the little ones will

370
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
normal or hard the little ones will
 

371
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,870
normal or hard the little ones will
spawn on peaceful

372
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
spawn on peaceful
 

373
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,829
spawn on peaceful
the tiniest ones but if you switch it to

374
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
the tiniest ones but if you switch it to
 

375
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,470
the tiniest ones but if you switch it to
peaceful the big ones don't disappear

376
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
peaceful the big ones don't disappear
 

377
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,910
peaceful the big ones don't disappear
which is nice for my what i've heard

378
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
which is nice for my what i've heard
 

379
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,949
which is nice for my what i've heard
also they don't

380
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
also they don't
 

381
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,190
also they don't
despawn if you're within 128

382
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
despawn if you're within 128
 

383
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,230
despawn if you're within 128
blocks from them and that's in a

384
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
blocks from them and that's in a
 

385
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,509
blocks from them and that's in a
spherical

386
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
spherical
 

387
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,949
spherical
three-dimensional distance

388
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959

 

389
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,670

so if i'm in my base these guys that

390
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
so if i'm in my base these guys that
 

391
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,949
so if i'm in my base these guys that
spawn down here shouldn't disappear

392
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
spawn down here shouldn't disappear
 

393
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,310
spawn down here shouldn't disappear
until until i kill them which is good

394
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320

 

395
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,630

because we're only we're only about

396
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
because we're only we're only about
 

397
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,389
because we're only we're only about
60 blocks below the surface

398
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
60 blocks below the surface
 

399
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,990
60 blocks below the surface
and my base is definitely not 60 blocks

400
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
and my base is definitely not 60 blocks
 

401
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,350
and my base is definitely not 60 blocks
away from here so it's definitely within

402
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
away from here so it's definitely within
 

403
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,670
away from here so it's definitely within
range

404
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
range
 

405
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,389
range
uh for for this here i need to make this

406
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
uh for for this here i need to make this
 

407
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,230
uh for for this here i need to make this
three high so that the big guys

408
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
three high so that the big guys
 

409
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,870
three high so that the big guys
can spawn on here and not not split

410
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
can spawn on here and not not split
 

411
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,389
can spawn on here and not not split
i also need to light it up so that the

412
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
i also need to light it up so that the
 

413
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,590
i also need to light it up so that the
other hostile mobs don't spawn i'll

414
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
other hostile mobs don't spawn i'll
 

415
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,750
other hostile mobs don't spawn i'll
probably just put torches

416
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
probably just put torches
 

417
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,110
probably just put torches
in the ceiling because

418
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
in the ceiling because
 

419
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,990
in the ceiling because
they should light up the ground decently

420
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
they should light up the ground decently
 

421
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,470
they should light up the ground decently
enough

422
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
enough
 

423
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,710
enough
i may also just use glowstone on the

424
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
i may also just use glowstone on the
 

425
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,910
i may also just use glowstone on the
ground

426
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
ground
 

427
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,829
ground
although i'm not sure if uh

428
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
although i'm not sure if uh
 

429
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,710
although i'm not sure if uh
if slimes can spawn on top of glowstone

430
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
if slimes can spawn on top of glowstone
 

431
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,470
if slimes can spawn on top of glowstone
it's kind of kind of an unknown thing i

432
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
it's kind of kind of an unknown thing i
 

433
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,790
it's kind of kind of an unknown thing i
think

434
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
think
 

435
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,150
think
because obviously hostile mobs can't

436
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
because obviously hostile mobs can't
 

437
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,630
because obviously hostile mobs can't
because

438
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
because
 

439
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,310
because
light stone emits light so

440
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
light stone emits light so
 

441
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,389
light stone emits light so
hostile mobs can't spawn on it so i

442
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
hostile mobs can't spawn on it so i
 

443
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,069
hostile mobs can't spawn on it so i
don't know if anyone knows if science

444
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
don't know if anyone knows if science
 

445
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,389
don't know if anyone knows if science
can

446
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
can
 

447
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,949
can
or not but i'm kind of guessing they can

448
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959

 

449
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,230

but i don't want to take the risk

450
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
but i don't want to take the risk
 

451
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,150
but i don't want to take the risk
without knowing

452
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
without knowing
 

453
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,590
without knowing
yeah so i'm going to work on this some

454
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
yeah so i'm going to work on this some
 

455
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,630
yeah so i'm going to work on this some
more later let's go do something else so

456
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640

 

457
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,590

00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
some of my longtime subscribers might
 

459
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,470
some of my longtime subscribers might
remember this

460
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
remember this
 

461
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,949
remember this
this is my ultra simple mob trap

462
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
this is my ultra simple mob trap
 

463
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,069

469
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,389

it was a neat little thing problem was

470
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
it was a neat little thing problem was
 

471
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,590
it was a neat little thing problem was
often

472
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
often
 

473
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,430
often
the tall mobs would get stuck on the

and i kind of
 

481
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,430
and i kind of
came up with a new way

482
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
came up with a new way
 

483
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,870
came up with a new way
using pistons again

484
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
using pistons again
 

485
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,270

491
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,389

just use sticky pistons oh no what you

just use sticky pistons oh no what you
 

493
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,550
just use sticky pistons oh no what you
do is you put uh

do is you put uh
 

495
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,269
do is you put uh
you put a redstone wire underneath here

like that and then
 

503
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,030
like that and then
put your spikes in

504
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040

 

505
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,710

you can also chain many of them together

i believe
 

521
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,110
i believe
just like that and you can make a giant

522
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
just like that and you can make a giant
 

523
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:07,509
just like that and you can make a giant
grid of them

525
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,990
grid of them
fun stuff

526
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000

 

527
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,550

they'll also uh kill like small mobs

528
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:14,560
they'll also uh kill like small mobs
 

529
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,389
they'll also uh kill like small mobs
like chickens

530
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
like chickens
 

531
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,269
like chickens
and i found they killed little slimes

532
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
and i found they killed little slimes
 

533
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:19,970
and i found they killed little slimes
when the

534
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:19,980
when the
 

535
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,350
when the
[Applause]

536

[Applause]
 

537
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,550
[Applause]

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560

 

539
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,069

so yeah that's the new super simple

540
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:30,079
so yeah that's the new super simple
 

541
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,990
so yeah that's the new super simple
mob trap

542
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
mob trap
 

543
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,670
mob trap
right i guess we should test this out to

544
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,680
right i guess we should test this out to
 

545
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,350
right i guess we should test this out to
make sure it works

546
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
make sure it works
 

547
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:48,230
make sure it works
as well because i haven't tried it yet

548
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
as well because i haven't tried it yet
 

549
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,840
as well because i haven't tried it yet
oh we don't want spiders

550
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:55,850

 

551
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,750

oops

556
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639

 

557
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:19,509

creeper and a spider

558
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519

 

559
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,550

561
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:31,430

how's he going in there

562
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
how's he going in there
 

563
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,110
how's he going in there
oh this is scary

564
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120

 

565
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,230

cool let's try skeletons i don't think

566
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
cool let's try skeletons i don't think
 

567
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,269
cool let's try skeletons i don't think
they'll be able to hit you

568
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
they'll be able to hit you
 

569
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,590
they'll be able to hit you
when they're in there because they got

570
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
when they're in there because they got
 

571
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,710
when they're in there because they got
the

572
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
the
 

573
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:57,269
the
ceiling over top

574
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279

 

575
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,629

cool

576
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639

 

577
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,430

yeah that's the simple mob trap revised

578
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440

 

579
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,030

so one other thing i wanted to work on

580
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,040
so one other thing i wanted to work on
 

581
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,870
so one other thing i wanted to work on
this episode just a little bit

582
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
this episode just a little bit
 

583
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,230
this episode just a little bit
is the uh hostile mob system

584
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
is the uh hostile mob system
 

585
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,269
is the uh hostile mob system
this spider setup things still working

586
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
this spider setup things still working
 

587
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,030
this spider setup things still working
great

588
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
great
 

589
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,750
great
i tried adding like piston crushers at

590
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
i tried adding like piston crushers at
 

591
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,710
i tried adding like piston crushers at
the top of it

592
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720
the top of it
 

593
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,310
the top of it
to crush the spiders that were

594
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
to crush the spiders that were
 

595
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,310
to crush the spiders that were
activated when the spider touched the

596
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
activated when the spider touched the
 

597
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,430
activated when the spider touched the
pressure plate

598
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
pressure plate
 

599
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,949
pressure plate
i should have got it on camera but i

600
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
i should have got it on camera but i
 

601
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,350
i should have got it on camera but i
didn't it worked

602
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
didn't it worked
 

603
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,269
didn't it worked
pretty good but i found it was lagging

604
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
pretty good but i found it was lagging
 

605
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,870
pretty good but i found it was lagging
my game a lot

606
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
my game a lot
 

607
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,710
my game a lot
like every time it activated i did a

608
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:38,720
like every time it activated i did a
 

609
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,389
like every time it activated i did a
huge like spike

610
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
huge like spike
 

611
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,069
huge like spike
so i got rid of it

612
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
so i got rid of it
 

613
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,550
so i got rid of it
like i said i don't want to have pistons

614
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
like i said i don't want to have pistons
 

615
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,910
like i said i don't want to have pistons
constantly

616
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
constantly
 

617
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,670
constantly
being used in my world

618
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680

 

619
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,870

like automatically like that so

620
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
like automatically like that so
 

621
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,310
like automatically like that so
i got rid of it because it was causing

622
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
i got rid of it because it was causing
 

623
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,150
i got rid of it because it was causing
lag

624
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
lag
 

625
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,829
lag
so at the moment the tall mobs are just

626
00:15:59,829 --> 00:15:59,839
so at the moment the tall mobs are just
 

627
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,949
so at the moment the tall mobs are just
falling down here on top of my roof

628
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
falling down here on top of my roof
 

629
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,150
falling down here on top of my roof
which is a big issue i've actually had

630
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
which is a big issue i've actually had
 

631
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,790
which is a big issue i've actually had
my house

632
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
my house
 

633
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,590
my house
blow up and not my house my storage room

634
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
blow up and not my house my storage room
 

635
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,910
blow up and not my house my storage room
blew up

636
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
blew up
 

637
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,790
blew up
in a few places already so i should get

638
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
in a few places already so i should get
 

639
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,509
in a few places already so i should get
this

640
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
this
 

641
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,189
this
taken care of

642
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:21,199

 

643
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,230

so i'll have the tall mobs

644
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
so i'll have the tall mobs
 

645
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,430
so i'll have the tall mobs
come out here

646
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440

 

647
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,550

and i'm gonna add a

648
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
and i'm gonna add a
 

649
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,470
and i'm gonna add a
junction here

650
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:36,480
junction here
 

651
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,470
junction here
right right above it's probably really

652
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
right right above it's probably really
 

653
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,790
right right above it's probably really
hard to see

654
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800

 

655
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,629

yeah i want a junction right here i'm

656
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
yeah i want a junction right here i'm
 

657
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,030
yeah i want a junction right here i'm
going to use pistons

658
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
going to use pistons
 

659
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,629
going to use pistons
to do my mob junctions now i think

660
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
to do my mob junctions now i think
 

661
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,790
to do my mob junctions now i think
really i don't see much use in using

662
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
really i don't see much use in using
 

663
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,470
really i don't see much use in using
trapdoors anymore

664
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
trapdoors anymore
 

665
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,430
trapdoors anymore
just kind of kind of

666
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440

 

667
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,150

kind of disappointing i guess

668
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
kind of disappointing i guess
 

669
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,230
kind of disappointing i guess
what's the best way of doing this

670
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240

 

671
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,390

the sticky piston here maybe

672
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400

 

673
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,309

still have trouble placing them

674
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319

 

675
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,789

there we go

676
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799

 

677
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,350

okay maybe i'll just have a lever here

678
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
okay maybe i'll just have a lever here
 

679
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:33,590
okay maybe i'll just have a lever here
to test it for now

680
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
to test it for now
 

681
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,950
to test it for now
oh you know what i built in the wrong

682
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
oh you know what i built in the wrong
 

683
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,510
oh you know what i built in the wrong
place

684
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520

 

685
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:47,750

try again let's go over one

686
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
try again let's go over one
 

687
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,789
try again let's go over one
okay sandstone was there

688
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:52,799

 

689
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:59,990

and the sticky piston goes there

690
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
and the sticky piston goes there
 

691
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,310
and the sticky piston goes there
the library bows here

692
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320

 

693
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,390

good

694
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400

 

695
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:16,870

okay that should work fine and dandy

696
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:16,880

 

697
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,070

so if the sandstone is there there's a

698
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080
so if the sandstone is there there's a
 

699
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,669
so if the sandstone is there there's a
the roof is solid otherwise there's a

700
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:23,679
the roof is solid otherwise there's a
 

701
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,870
the roof is solid otherwise there's a
hole here

702
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
hole here
 

703
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,390
hole here
now i'm going to make them swim up this

704
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,400
now i'm going to make them swim up this
 

705
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,110
now i'm going to make them swim up this
hole if it's open

706
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,120
hole if it's open
 

707
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,029
hole if it's open
i'm just going to put a pressure plate

708
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
i'm just going to put a pressure plate
 

709
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,990
i'm just going to put a pressure plate
down here to hold some water back

710

711
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,150

and see
 

715
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,150
and see
signs and stuff

721
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,950

i think one right there

723
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,070

and a sign here

724
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
and a sign here
 

725
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,430
and a sign here
one here oh no

726
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440
one here oh no
 

727
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,669
one here oh no
actually i don't want to do that

728
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:17,679

 

729
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:25,190

i'm gonna move this over one

i'm gonna move this over one
 

731
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,789
i'm gonna move this over one
extend this again and we'll put another

00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:28,799
extend this again and we'll put another

water like that

739
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,029

no dead zones it's good so the mobs will

no dead zones it's good so the mobs will

i can't put a sign here to hold water
 

753
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,470
i can't put a sign here to hold water
back

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
back
 

755
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:21,830

could be a serious flaw

756
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:21,840
could be a serious flaw
 

757
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,669
could be a serious flaw
let's see

00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679

 

759
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,270

and sorry about the lighting i know it's

00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,280
and sorry about the lighting i know it's
 

761
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:35,669
and sorry about the lighting i know it's
really dark

really dark
 

763
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,350
really dark
okay i'll try it like this and see what

764
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
okay i'll try it like this and see what
 

765
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,560
okay i'll try it like this and see what
happens

766
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:38,570
happens
 

767
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:44,470

769
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,470

and build it up and i'll just

770
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
and build it up and i'll just
 

771
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,940
and build it up and i'll just
put the cap on top

772
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:49,950
put the cap on top
 

773
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,730

okay and maybe just dig a hole in the

00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
okay and maybe just dig a hole in the
 

779
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,880

ground here

780
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:01,890

and lock this off

784
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480

 

785
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,710

and hopefully this works i'm going to

786
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
and hopefully this works i'm going to
 

787
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,149
and hopefully this works i'm going to
get some mops up here and see

788
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
get some mops up here and see
 

789
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,070
get some mops up here and see
if the junction works

790
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080

 

791
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,789

yeah so it's definitely not working uh

792
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:22,799
yeah so it's definitely not working uh
 

793
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,789
yeah so it's definitely not working uh
the downward water flow is preventing

794
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:24,799
the downward water flow is preventing
 

795
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,190
the downward water flow is preventing
them from swimming up

796
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
them from swimming up
 

797
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,750
them from swimming up
so i'll have to do something else

798
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760

 

799
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,950

so i got a working method now guys this

800
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
so i got a working method now guys this
 

801
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,070
so i got a working method now guys this
uh use pistons again except we have a

802
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
uh use pistons again except we have a
 

803
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,750
uh use pistons again except we have a
horizontal junction here this works much

804
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:43,760
horizontal junction here this works much
 

805
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,950
horizontal junction here this works much
like the door junctions work that i used

806
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:46,960
like the door junctions work that i used
 

807
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,310
like the door junctions work that i used
to use

808
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
to use
 

809
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,750
to use
just have a diagonal stream

810
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
just have a diagonal stream
 

811
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,149
just have a diagonal stream
right now this path here is closed

812
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:54,159
right now this path here is closed
 

813
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,830
right now this path here is closed
because this block is in the way

814
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:55,840
because this block is in the way
 

815
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,590
because this block is in the way
but this one's open if you flip the

816
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
but this one's open if you flip the
 

817
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,110
but this one's open if you flip the
lever

818
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120

 

819
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,630

this path is closed

820
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640

 

821
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,789

but this one is open so

822
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799
but this one is open so
 

823
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,390
but this one is open so
it's pretty simple uh

824
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,400

 

825
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,350

this torch here i believe inverts one of

826
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
this torch here i believe inverts one of
 

827
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,430
this torch here i believe inverts one of
the pistons so

828
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
the pistons so
 

829
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,430
the pistons so
uh if one of them's out the other one's

830
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,440
uh if one of them's out the other one's
 

831
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,669
uh if one of them's out the other one's
in

832
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679
in
 

833
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,070
in
and pretty pretty basic

834
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
and pretty pretty basic
 

835
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,070
and pretty pretty basic
uh now that i think about the one other

836
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,080
uh now that i think about the one other
 

837
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,350
uh now that i think about the one other
thing i could did is i

838
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
thing i could did is i
 

839
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,390
thing i could did is i
could have just had a trapdoor with

840
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:36,400
could have just had a trapdoor with
 

841
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,350
could have just had a trapdoor with
where the prison

842
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:37,360
where the prison
 

843
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,710
where the prison
where the piston was before

844
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
where the piston was before
 

845
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,190
where the piston was before
and i think that would have solved my

846
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
and i think that would have solved my
 

847
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,750
and i think that would have solved my
problem

848
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
problem
 

849
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,110
problem
with them not being able to swim up

850
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,120

 

851
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,470

because i could have had like a water

852
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,480
because i could have had like a water
 

853
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,390
because i could have had like a water
block trap door

854
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
block trap door
 

855
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,270
block trap door
and a water block above and they would

856
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,280
and a water block above and they would
 

857
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,390
and a water block above and they would
be able to swim through

858
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
be able to swim through
 

859
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,830
be able to swim through
the trap door

860
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840

 

861
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,830

but it doesn't matter this way works

862
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:01,840
but it doesn't matter this way works
 

863
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,950
but it doesn't matter this way works
fine for me

864
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,960
fine for me
 

865
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,549
fine for me
it's nice that it splits some left and

866
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
it's nice that it splits some left and
 

867
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,149
it's nice that it splits some left and
right over here so they're far apart

868
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:10,159
right over here so they're far apart
 

869
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,990
right over here so they're far apart
uh i believe this path here will lead to

870
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,000
uh i believe this path here will lead to
 

871
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,470
uh i believe this path here will lead to
the cook house i'll probably just make

872
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
the cook house i'll probably just make
 

873
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,549
the cook house i'll probably just make
uh

874
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:18,559
uh
 

875
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,590
uh
actually i think what i'm going to do is

876
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:19,600
actually i think what i'm going to do is
 

877
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,710
actually i think what i'm going to do is
i'm going to make a tower that goes up

878
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:22,720
i'm going to make a tower that goes up

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,830
i'm going to make a tower that goes up
they'll swim up they'll fall down and

880
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:25,840
they'll swim up they'll fall down and
 

881
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,350
they'll swim up they'll fall down and
take

882
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
take
 

883
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,710
take
as much fall damage as they can without

884
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:30,720
as much fall damage as they can without
 

885
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,430
as much fall damage as they can without
killing them

886
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,440

 

887
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,830

and they'll be a light source above so

888
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:35,840
and they'll be a light source above so
 

889
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,909
and they'll be a light source above so
if they are

890
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:37,919
if they are
 

891
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,350
if they are
skeletons or zombies they will burn in

892
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,360
skeletons or zombies they will burn in
 

893
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,950
skeletons or zombies they will burn in
the light if it's daytime

894
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
the light if it's daytime
 

895
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,070
the light if it's daytime
and creepers

896
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
and creepers
 

897
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,590
and creepers
can then be taken out they'll only be

898
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
can then be taken out they'll only be
 

899
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:49,990
can then be taken out they'll only be
creepers

900
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,000
creepers
 

901
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,990
creepers
left uh this other path

902
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
left uh this other path
 

903
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,549
left uh this other path
is going to lead directly to a chilling

904
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:56,559
is going to lead directly to a chilling
 

905
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,870
is going to lead directly to a chilling
chamber to kill all three of them

906
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:58,880
chamber to kill all three of them
 

907
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,350
chamber to kill all three of them
and the loot will run

908
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360

 

909
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,510

into here and hopefully i'll be able to

910
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,520
into here and hopefully i'll be able to
 

911
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,710
into here and hopefully i'll be able to
turn it on and off

912
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:06,720
turn it on and off
 

913
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,750
turn it on and off
like i did with the spider one

914
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
like i did with the spider one
 

915
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,029
like i did with the spider one
like this

916
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039

 

917
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,830

that's the plan so i might do that off

918
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:16,840
that's the plan so i might do that off
 

919
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,830
that's the plan so i might do that off
camera

920
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:19,840
camera
 

921
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,029
camera
well that's where i'm gonna end the

922
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039
well that's where i'm gonna end the
 

923
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,430
well that's where i'm gonna end the
episode today guys uh

924
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:23,440
episode today guys uh
 

925
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,190
episode today guys uh
i'm gonna keep working on that slime

926
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,200
i'm gonna keep working on that slime
 

927
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,630
i'm gonna keep working on that slime
farm

928
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
farm
 

929
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,950
farm
and i will keep working on the hostile

930
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:28,960
and i will keep working on the hostile
 

931
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,630
and i will keep working on the hostile
mob system i'll probably do those things

932
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:30,640
mob system i'll probably do those things
 

933
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,950
mob system i'll probably do those things
i said

934
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
i said
 

935
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,149
i said
and i may also add like a lighting

936
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
and i may also add like a lighting
 

937
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,430
and i may also add like a lighting
switch to the hostile spawning

938
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
switch to the hostile spawning
 

939
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,549
switch to the hostile spawning
pads below so that i can turn

940
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:42,559
pads below so that i can turn
 

941
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,230
pads below so that i can turn
that on and off like i can with the

942
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,240
that on and off like i can with the
 

943
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,029
that on and off like i can with the
slime farm and i think that would be a

944
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
slime farm and i think that would be a
 

945
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,870
slime farm and i think that would be a
good idea

946
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:48,880
good idea
 

947
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,870
good idea
i still haven't come up with any great

948
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:50,880
i still haven't come up with any great
 

949
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,710
i still haven't come up with any great
ideas for my new base but i'll be

950
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,720
ideas for my new base but i'll be
 

951
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,310
ideas for my new base but i'll be
thinking about it

952
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,320
thinking about it
 

953
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,830
thinking about it
and then we may start a new base

954
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:58,840
and then we may start a new base
 

955
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,590
and then we may start a new base
highly efficient and thought out

956
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
