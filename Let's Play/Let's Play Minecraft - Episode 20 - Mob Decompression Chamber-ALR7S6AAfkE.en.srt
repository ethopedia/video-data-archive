mob system all rebuilt now so let's go

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:13,810
mob system all rebuilt now so let's go
 

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:24,120
mob system all rebuilt now so let's go
check it out

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,130

 

19
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,039

there's a bunch of guys in there I'll

20
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,049
there's a bunch of guys in there I'll
 

21
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:31,770
there's a bunch of guys in there I'll
stuff the other

22
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:31,780

 

23
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:46,630

shailen try some

24
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640

 

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,660

and so what happens when you touch them

26
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:49,670
and so what happens when you touch them
 

27
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,679
and so what happens when you touch them
it's like getting pumped by 50 or 100

28
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:54,689
it's like getting pumped by 50 or 100
 

29
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,630
it's like getting pumped by 50 or 100
guys all at once

30
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:57,640

 

31
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:15,620

which makes you fly very far

32
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:15,630

 

33
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:25,600

it's crap honey listen

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:25,610

 

35
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:34,850

okay so

36
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:34,860

 

37
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,080

let's get started here so what happens

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,090
let's get started here so what happens
 

39
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,520
let's get started here so what happens
is they all get compressed the other in

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:41,530
is they all get compressed the other in
 

41
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,980
is they all get compressed the other in
this one you walk area and even if you

42
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:46,990
this one you walk area and even if you
 

43
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,300
this one you walk area and even if you
open the door they're not all going to

44
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,310
open the door they're not all going to
 

45
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,990
open the door they're not all going to
get out

46
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000

 

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,089

whoa so a bunch of guys made it through

48
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:00,099
whoa so a bunch of guys made it through
 

49
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,370
whoa so a bunch of guys made it through
but the rest of these guys they're stuck

50
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:02,380
but the rest of these guys they're stuck
 

51
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:17,390
but the rest of these guys they're stuck
in there for good

52
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,400

 

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,920

pretty crazy

54
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:21,930

 

55
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,200

now even with both doors open not able

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,210
now even with both doors open not able
 

57
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,750
now even with both doors open not able
to get through the door hinges because

58
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
to get through the door hinges because
 

59
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,440
to get through the door hinges because
they're basically one big entity now

60
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,450

 

61
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,550

we're just going to switch to peaceful

62
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
we're just going to switch to peaceful
 

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:55,199
we're just going to switch to peaceful
for now so let's see so what we're going

64
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,209
for now so let's see so what we're going
 

65
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,880
for now so let's see so what we're going
to need to do is build like a

66
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:56,890
to need to do is build like a
 

67
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,830
to need to do is build like a
decompression chamber for these guys

68
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840
decompression chamber for these guys
 

69
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,479
decompression chamber for these guys
because we're not able to sort them if

70
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:03,489
because we're not able to sort them if
 

71
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:05,070
because we're not able to sort them if
they're all stuck together like that so

72
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,080
they're all stuck together like that so
 

73
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,190
they're all stuck together like that so
we need to be able to sort them one by

74
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,200
we need to be able to sort them one by
 

75
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,060
we need to be able to sort them one by
one

76
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,070

 

77
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:15,720

so that's what we're going to do off the

78
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:15,730
so that's what we're going to do off the
 

79
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,099
so that's what we're going to do off the
start here I'm going to keep it on

80
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:20,109
start here I'm going to keep it on
 

81
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:21,300
start here I'm going to keep it on
peaceful just so we don't have them

82
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:21,310
peaceful just so we don't have them
 

83
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:31,290
peaceful just so we don't have them
annoying us up here going to block this

84
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:31,300
annoying us up here going to block this
 

85
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:42,740
annoying us up here going to block this
off for now and oh yeah I added a sign

86
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:42,750
off for now and oh yeah I added a sign
 

87
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,860
off for now and oh yeah I added a sign
over there I don't think I had that

88
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:45,870
over there I don't think I had that
 

89
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:52,730
over there I don't think I had that
before it blew up

90
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:52,740

 

91
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,610

and since our elevator thing is over

92
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:56,620
and since our elevator thing is over
 

93
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,440
and since our elevator thing is over
here we're going to have to do it make

94
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,450
here we're going to have to do it make
 

95
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:04,409
here we're going to have to do it make
it go around a bend I think like that

96
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:04,419
it go around a bend I think like that
 

97
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:22,190
it go around a bend I think like that
I guess this thing's on the way too and

98
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,200
I guess this thing's on the way too and
 

99
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,140
I guess this thing's on the way too and

this is what your problem was - untry

102
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
this is what your problem was - untry
 

103
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,620
this is what your problem was - untry
figured this out already

104
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:29,630
figured this out already
 

105
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,070
figured this out already
but all the guys are getting stuck

106
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,080
but all the guys are getting stuck
 

107
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,350
but all the guys are getting stuck
together and your spartacus machine

108
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360

 

109
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,460

which is why you can get only one out so

110
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:42,470
which is why you can get only one out so
 

111
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,230
which is why you can get only one out so
you need some kind of decompression

112
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
you need some kind of decompression
 

113
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:52,629
you need some kind of decompression
chamber and I think I'm going to try

114
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
chamber and I think I'm going to try
 

115
00:05:52,639 --> 00:06:00,370
chamber and I think I'm going to try
make one that is a 5x5 area I might have

116
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:00,380
make one that is a 5x5 area I might have
 

117
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,939
make one that is a 5x5 area I might have
to play around with it and adjust it a

118
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:03,949
to play around with it and adjust it a
 

119
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:09,879
to play around with it and adjust it a
bit and I just help build it right here

120
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:09,889
bit and I just help build it right here
 

121
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:22,960
bit and I just help build it right here
I probably have to tear this down and

122
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:22,970
I probably have to tear this down and
 

123
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:52,029
I probably have to tear this down and
redo it but okay and then that's not all

124
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:52,039
redo it but okay and then that's not all
 

125
00:06:52,039 --> 00:07:08,560
redo it but okay and then that's not all
mentally for long

126
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:08,570

 

127
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,450

and so this is going to have space for

128
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:13,460
and so this is going to have space for
 

129
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,730
and so this is going to have space for
five times five is 25 so at least plus

130
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:19,740
five times five is 25 so at least plus
 

131
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,070
five times five is 25 so at least plus
all this tunneling and stuff it should

132
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
all this tunneling and stuff it should
 

133
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,180
all this tunneling and stuff it should
handle around 50 guys no problem

134
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,190
handle around 50 guys no problem
 

135
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,800
handle around 50 guys no problem
and hopefully it'll handle more but I'm

136
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:30,810
and hopefully it'll handle more but I'm
 

137
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:41,390
and hopefully it'll handle more but I'm
not sure okay and I'm just going to put

138
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,400
not sure okay and I'm just going to put
 

139
00:07:41,400 --> 00:08:09,899
not sure okay and I'm just going to put
a block roof over top this

140
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:09,909

 

141
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:14,769

okay so that's our mob decompression

142
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:14,779
okay so that's our mob decompression
 

143
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:18,009
okay so that's our mob decompression
chamber we're going to have an opening

144
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:18,019
chamber we're going to have an opening
 

145
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:26,259
chamber we're going to have an opening
over here yes and it's going to put a

146
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:26,269
over here yes and it's going to put a
 

147
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:32,819
over here yes and it's going to put a
pressure plate down here and one over

148
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:32,829
pressure plate down here and one over
 

149
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:38,800
pressure plate down here and one over
here then we're going to have a water

150
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:38,810
here then we're going to have a water
 

151
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,449
here then we're going to have a water
stream over there and there and it's

152
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:43,459
stream over there and there and it's
 

153
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:48,069
stream over there and there and it's
going to push them into this tunnel here

154
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:48,079
going to push them into this tunnel here
 

155
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:53,530
going to push them into this tunnel here
kind of like that zombie trap thing we

156
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:53,540
kind of like that zombie trap thing we
 

157
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:01,150
kind of like that zombie trap thing we
made and then over here we're going to

158
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,160
made and then over here we're going to
 

159
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:20,610
made and then over here we're going to
have a door actually

160
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:20,620

 

161
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,850

let's get this water going here I'm just

162
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:23,860
let's get this water going here I'm just
 

163
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,810
let's get this water going here I'm just
going to fill this up with pressure

164
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:24,820
going to fill this up with pressure
 

165
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,180
going to fill this up with pressure
plates for now I might change that one

166
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,190
plates for now I might change that one
 

167
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,710
plates for now I might change that one
down there so the water stream should

168
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
down there so the water stream should
 

169
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,740
down there so the water stream should
force them around the corner and then

170
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:39,750
force them around the corner and then
 

171
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,210
force them around the corner and then
we're going to need some signs here I

172
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,220
we're going to need some signs here I
 

173
00:09:42,220 --> 00:10:02,360
we're going to need some signs here I
guess

174
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,370

 

175
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,949

and with the signs I'm just going to

176
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
and with the signs I'm just going to
 

177
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:12,090
and with the signs I'm just going to
block that other stream merging place it

178
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,100
block that other stream merging place it
 

179
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,519
block that other stream merging place it
sign there and then assign on another

180
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:14,529
sign there and then assign on another
 

181
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:29,190
sign there and then assign on another
side OOP I missed

182
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200

 

183
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,460

there

184
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:35,470

 

185
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,810

so yeah they'll get forced through into

186
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:39,820
so yeah they'll get forced through into
 

187
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:47,130
so yeah they'll get forced through into
this room and the water will push them

188
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:47,140
this room and the water will push them
 

189
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,010
this room and the water will push them
into this area here hopefully one by one

190
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,020
into this area here hopefully one by one
 

191
00:10:52,020 --> 00:11:10,950
into this area here hopefully one by one
and then we need a door there one sec

192
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:10,960
and then we need a door there one sec
 

193
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,050
and then we need a door there one sec
I'm going to think about this all right

194
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,060
I'm going to think about this all right
 

195
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,690
I'm going to think about this all right
I think I figured it out now so with

196
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:21,700
I think I figured it out now so with
 

197
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,440
I think I figured it out now so with
this full of water water only goes up to

198
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:25,450
this full of water water only goes up to
 

199
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,290
this full of water water only goes up to
here so I'm going to place door right

200
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:28,300
here so I'm going to place door right
 

201
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,689
here so I'm going to place door right
here

202
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:32,699

 

203
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:35,639

but the door needs to be dropped down

204
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:35,649
but the door needs to be dropped down
 

205
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:48,439
but the door needs to be dropped down
one block and I'll explain why in a sec

206
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:48,449

 

207
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:59,189

replace a block underneath and we're

208
00:11:59,189 --> 00:11:59,199
replace a block underneath and we're
 

209
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:15,539
replace a block underneath and we're
going to need to place a stair here door

210
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:15,549
going to need to place a stair here door
 

211
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:25,589
going to need to place a stair here door
will be facing this way and need another

212
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:25,599
will be facing this way and need another
 

213
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:38,420
will be facing this way and need another
sign

214
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:38,430

 

215
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,400

that sign is going cool on this block

216
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,410
that sign is going cool on this block
 

217
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,600
that sign is going cool on this block
here because there's going to be a water

218
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:45,610
here because there's going to be a water
 

219
00:12:45,610 --> 00:13:11,670
here because there's going to be a water
source above this door and mm-hmm maybe

220
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
source above this door and mm-hmm maybe
 

221
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:21,120
source above this door and mm-hmm maybe
I'm doing this wrong okay I've been

222
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,130
I'm doing this wrong okay I've been
 

223
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,220
I'm doing this wrong okay I've been
poking and prodding at this thing for a

224
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,230
poking and prodding at this thing for a
 

225
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,250
poking and prodding at this thing for a
while now very slowly making changes to

226
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:29,260
while now very slowly making changes to
 

227
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,400
while now very slowly making changes to
it and I haven't had a whole lot of I

228
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,410
it and I haven't had a whole lot of I
 

229
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:38,270
it and I haven't had a whole lot of I
haven't had a whole lot of success I on

230
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:38,280
haven't had a whole lot of success I on
 

231
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,210
haven't had a whole lot of success I on
the verge of giving up on it actually

232
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:41,220
the verge of giving up on it actually
 

233
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,130
the verge of giving up on it actually
and resorting to another method that I

234
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:47,140
and resorting to another method that I
 

235
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:54,180
and resorting to another method that I
know will work um so I built a little

236
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,190
know will work um so I built a little
 

237
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,680
know will work um so I built a little
testing attachment here and this ladder

238
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:58,690
testing attachment here and this ladder
 

239
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,550
testing attachment here and this ladder
is pretty much my last hope I don't know

240
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
is pretty much my last hope I don't know
 

241
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,450
is pretty much my last hope I don't know
if this is going to work because the

242
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:09,460
if this is going to work because the
 

243
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,110
if this is going to work because the
mobs are getting recompressed at this

244
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,120
mobs are getting recompressed at this
 

245
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:24,690
mobs are getting recompressed at this
point so will this wait till if you

246
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:24,700
point so will this wait till if you
 

247
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,610
point so will this wait till if you
build up I put slow sand above because I

248
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:29,620
build up I put slow sand above because I
 

249
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,710
build up I put slow sand above because I
thought it might help I don't I don't

250
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:31,720
thought it might help I don't I don't
 

251
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,220
thought it might help I don't I don't
know if it really does and this door

252
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:35,230
know if it really does and this door
 

253
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:46,130
know if it really does and this door
opens the other way now and so I think

254
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:46,140

 

255
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,100

so if a mob goes in here the goal is to

256
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,110
so if a mob goes in here the goal is to
 

257
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:56,190
so if a mob goes in here the goal is to
make its only one will go through and I

258
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:56,200
make its only one will go through and I
 

259
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,660
make its only one will go through and I
think only one can go up if there's a

260
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:00,670
think only one can go up if there's a
 

261
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:16,480
think only one can go up if there's a
ladder here

262
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,490

 

263
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,769

yeah this is a little harder than I was

264
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:18,779
yeah this is a little harder than I was
 

265
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:33,590
yeah this is a little harder than I was
expecting it to be all right I'm going

266
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
expecting it to be all right I'm going
 

267
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,360
expecting it to be all right I'm going
to let them build up for a few seconds

268
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,370
to let them build up for a few seconds
 

269
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,430
to let them build up for a few seconds
and then we'll start it again all right

270
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:40,440
and then we'll start it again all right
 

271
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,199
and then we'll start it again all right
things are getting more compressed in

272
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:42,209
things are getting more compressed in
 

273
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:46,690
things are getting more compressed in
there now so we're going to try and see

274
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:46,700
there now so we're going to try and see
 

275
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,810
there now so we're going to try and see
how this works basically one mobs going

276
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:50,820
how this works basically one mobs going
 

277
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,500
how this works basically one mobs going
to push them in and the door hinge might

278
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:54,510
to push them in and the door hinge might
 

279
00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:26,660
to push them in and the door hinge might
be an issue I'm not sure yeah not

280
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:26,670
be an issue I'm not sure yeah not
 

281
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:42,840
be an issue I'm not sure yeah not
looking too hopeful right now

282
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:42,850

 

283
00:16:42,850 --> 00:17:39,100

be very careful guys stuck Oh

284
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,110

 

285
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,510

soé creepers will blow up if you're

286
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
soé creepers will blow up if you're
 

287
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,370
soé creepers will blow up if you're
within two blocks of them if they can

288
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:46,380
within two blocks of them if they can
 

289
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,970
within two blocks of them if they can
see you I walk a little closer as before

290
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:49,980
see you I walk a little closer as before
 

291
00:17:49,980 --> 00:18:04,460
see you I walk a little closer as before
oh yeah so it's not working more than

292
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:04,470
oh yeah so it's not working more than
 

293
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,810
oh yeah so it's not working more than
one is going up with the ladder at a

294
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:05,820
one is going up with the ladder at a
 

295
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,560
one is going up with the ladder at a
time so going to resort to another plan

296
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:11,570
time so going to resort to another plan
 

297
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:18,050
time so going to resort to another plan
and I'm going to assume that this method

298
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,060
and I'm going to assume that this method
 

299
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,410
and I'm going to assume that this method
is actually impossible until someone

300
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:21,420
is actually impossible until someone
 

301
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:29,750
is actually impossible until someone
proves me wrong alright so we've taken a

302
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
proves me wrong alright so we've taken a
 

303
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,870
proves me wrong alright so we've taken a
few steps back quite a few steps back

304
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:32,880
few steps back quite a few steps back
 

305
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,320
few steps back quite a few steps back
actually um I don't like that other

306
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,330
actually um I don't like that other
 

307
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:46,340
actually um I don't like that other
method is going to work so this is the

308
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:46,350
method is going to work so this is the
 

309
00:18:46,350 --> 00:19:01,659
method is going to work so this is the
new plan oops

310
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:01,669

 

311
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:04,250

if any of you can get that other method

312
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,260
if any of you can get that other method
 

313
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,799
if any of you can get that other method
working please let me know because I

314
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:06,809
working please let me know because I
 

315
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:08,330
working please let me know because I
would like to see your solution to the

316
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:08,340
would like to see your solution to the
 

317
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:15,919
would like to see your solution to the
problem but the goal was to get only one

318
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:15,929
problem but the goal was to get only one
 

319
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:19,340
problem but the goal was to get only one
mob through the door by pressing a

320
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:19,350
mob through the door by pressing a
 

321
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:25,430
mob through the door by pressing a
button 100% of the time without any gaps

322
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
button 100% of the time without any gaps
 

323
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,010
button 100% of the time without any gaps
in the water stream either which was

324
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,020
in the water stream either which was
 

325
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:37,399
in the water stream either which was
pretty challenging the new plan this was

326
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:37,409
pretty challenging the new plan this was
 

327
00:19:37,409 --> 00:20:07,790
pretty challenging the new plan this was
my original plan much simpler

328
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:07,800

 

329
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:34,440

new plan is to use minecarts something

330
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,450
new plan is to use minecarts something
 

331
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,640
new plan is to use minecarts something
kind of like this we're just testing

332
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:38,650
kind of like this we're just testing
 

333
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:43,980
kind of like this we're just testing
this here and so this is a special

334
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:43,990
this here and so this is a special
 

335
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:59,910
this here and so this is a special
corner I think hopefully we don't get a

336
00:20:59,910 --> 00:20:59,920
corner I think hopefully we don't get a
 

337
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:15,930
corner I think hopefully we don't get a
skeleton here oh that's not good pretty

338
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:15,940
skeleton here oh that's not good pretty
 

339
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:24,990
skeleton here oh that's not good pretty
sure I tested this before maybe that's

340
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,000
sure I tested this before maybe that's
 

341
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:47,820
sure I tested this before maybe that's
the wrong corner oh boy this better not

342
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:47,830
the wrong corner oh boy this better not
 

343
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,620
the wrong corner oh boy this better not
be like last time oh okay so I guess

344
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:52,630
be like last time oh okay so I guess
 

345
00:21:52,630 --> 00:22:03,230
be like last time oh okay so I guess
it's that corner actually

346
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:03,240

 

347
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,280

it's probably any corner but I think

348
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,290
it's probably any corner but I think
 

349
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,500
it's probably any corner but I think
down below I have the water moving

350
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:10,510
down below I have the water moving
 

351
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,150
down below I have the water moving
toward this corner and that's why

352
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:14,160
toward this corner and that's why
 

353
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:23,460
toward this corner and that's why
they're against this corner so I should

354
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:23,470
they're against this corner so I should
 

355
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,590
they're against this corner so I should
be able to choose whatever corner I want

356
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:25,600
be able to choose whatever corner I want
 

357
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,240
be able to choose whatever corner I want
the met by changing the water flow

358
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,250
the met by changing the water flow
 

359
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:50,040
the met by changing the water flow
diagonally actually let's try so I kind

360
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,050
diagonally actually let's try so I kind
 

361
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:58,080
diagonally actually let's try so I kind
of want them over on the side I think so

362
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,090
of want them over on the side I think so
 

363
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:12,370
of want them over on the side I think so
we'll put it like we had it before

364
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:12,380

 

365
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:20,340

water there and water here seal it up

366
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:20,350
water there and water here seal it up
 

367
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,480
water there and water here seal it up
and now I think they'll get into this

368
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:22,490
and now I think they'll get into this
 

369
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:53,620
and now I think they'll get into this
minecart I hope and yeah so the plan is

370
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:53,630
minecart I hope and yeah so the plan is
 

371
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,560
minecart I hope and yeah so the plan is
to make this semi-automatic I don't

372
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:56,570
to make this semi-automatic I don't
 

373
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,820
to make this semi-automatic I don't
think it's possible to make an automatic

374
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:57,830
think it's possible to make an automatic
 

375
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:07,840
think it's possible to make an automatic
sorting system because all the tall mobs

376
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:07,850
sorting system because all the tall mobs
 

377
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,940
sorting system because all the tall mobs
have the same physical characteristics

378
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:09,950
have the same physical characteristics
 

379
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:15,909
have the same physical characteristics
as far as I know so the only other

380
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:15,919
as far as I know so the only other
 

381
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,649
as far as I know so the only other
option would be to do something with the

382
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:17,659
option would be to do something with the
 

383
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:21,310
option would be to do something with the
pathfinding but I have no idea how you

384
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:21,320
pathfinding but I have no idea how you
 

385
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:31,659
pathfinding but I have no idea how you
would do it so basically we're going to

386
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:31,669
would do it so basically we're going to
 

387
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:34,299
would do it so basically we're going to
set up some kind of minecart system here

388
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:34,309
set up some kind of minecart system here
 

389
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:38,289
set up some kind of minecart system here
to pick them up and then put them into a

390
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:38,299
to pick them up and then put them into a
 

391
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:42,909
to pick them up and then put them into a
buffer and then I'll have a control

392
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:42,919
buffer and then I'll have a control
 

393
00:24:42,919 --> 00:25:06,159
buffer and then I'll have a control
panel with three buttons on as a little

394
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:06,169
panel with three buttons on as a little
 

395
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:08,320
panel with three buttons on as a little
be like three buttons and I'll click one

396
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,330
be like three buttons and I'll click one
 

397
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,720
be like three buttons and I'll click one
if it's a creeper another one of its

398
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:10,730
if it's a creeper another one of its
 

399
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,370
if it's a creeper another one of its
skeleton one if it's a zombie and then

400
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:15,380
skeleton one if it's a zombie and then
 

401
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,850
skeleton one if it's a zombie and then
I'll put them into another buffer for

402
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:18,860
I'll put them into another buffer for
 

403
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,980
I'll put them into another buffer for
their type

404
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:20,990
their type
 

405
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,720
their type
so they'll be four buffers at the end

406
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:23,730
so they'll be four buffers at the end
 

407
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,900
so they'll be four buffers at the end
one for spiders one for zombies

408
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:25,910
one for spiders one for zombies
 

409
00:25:25,910 --> 00:26:22,430
one for spiders one for zombies
skeletons and creepers probably actually

410
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:22,440
skeletons and creepers probably actually
 

411
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,630
skeletons and creepers probably actually
changes and have a pressure plate

412
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:25,640
changes and have a pressure plate
 

413
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,200
changes and have a pressure plate
underneath them like and detectives are

414
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,210
underneath them like and detectives are
 

415
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:36,260
underneath them like and detectives are
there too and I'll send the card to pick

416
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:36,270
there too and I'll send the card to pick
 

417
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:49,400
there too and I'll send the card to pick
them up no enter the buffers that works

418
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:49,410
them up no enter the buffers that works
 

419
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:56,150
them up no enter the buffers that works
pretty good that's stuck on that feather

420
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:56,160
pretty good that's stuck on that feather
 

421
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:14,799
pretty good that's stuck on that feather
I think that's not me now

422
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:14,809

 

423
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:17,389

and it's safe I can bump into this it

424
00:27:17,389 --> 00:27:17,399
and it's safe I can bump into this it
 

425
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:30,620
and it's safe I can bump into this it
won't hurt me yes that's what we're

426
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:30,630
won't hurt me yes that's what we're
 

427
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,039
won't hurt me yes that's what we're
going to do something like that I'll

428
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:34,049
going to do something like that I'll
 

429
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:44,060
going to do something like that I'll
think about it and that's a much easier

430
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,070
think about it and that's a much easier
 

431
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,610
think about it and that's a much easier
way to separate them one by one it'll

432
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:46,620
way to separate them one by one it'll
 

433
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,240
way to separate them one by one it'll
need a lot of minecarts but not a big

434
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,250
need a lot of minecarts but not a big
 

435
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:55,249
need a lot of minecarts but not a big
deal I have lots of iron and I'm

436
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:55,259
deal I have lots of iron and I'm
 

437
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:57,529
deal I have lots of iron and I'm
probably going to rip out this elevator

438
00:27:57,529 --> 00:27:57,539
probably going to rip out this elevator
 

439
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:58,879
probably going to rip out this elevator
because I'm not liking it because the

440
00:27:58,879 --> 00:27:58,889
because I'm not liking it because the
 

441
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:10,210
because I'm not liking it because the
boats are moving around for some reason

442
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:10,220

 

443
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:16,580

anyway what else should we do probably

444
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:16,590
anyway what else should we do probably
 

445
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:21,499
anyway what else should we do probably
wrap up this episode pretty quick I'm

446
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:21,509
wrap up this episode pretty quick I'm
 

447
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:26,860
wrap up this episode pretty quick I'm
going to show you guys how I kind of

448
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:26,870
going to show you guys how I kind of
 

449
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:37,779
going to show you guys how I kind of
plan on having part of the storage room

450
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:37,789

 

451
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:42,169

so for items you need sort of often I

452
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:42,179
so for items you need sort of often I
 

453
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,299
so for items you need sort of often I
think I'm going to have something like

454
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:44,309
think I'm going to have something like
 

455
00:28:44,309 --> 00:29:00,200
think I'm going to have something like
this walls of dispensers and I think

456
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,210
this walls of dispensers and I think
 

457
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:10,100
this walls of dispensers and I think
buttons underneath each one something

458
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,110
buttons underneath each one something
 

459
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:33,220
buttons underneath each one something
like that and then

460
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,230

 

461
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,940

and then the type of material it is

462
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:36,950
and then the type of material it is
 

463
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:43,760
and then the type of material it is
above so if there is soil in this one

464
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:43,770
above so if there is soil in this one
 

465
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,830
above so if there is soil in this one
for example there would be a soil block

466
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:45,840
for example there would be a soil block
 

467
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,750
for example there would be a soil block
above if there's cobble in this will be

468
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:47,760
above if there's cobble in this will be
 

469
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,120
above if there's cobble in this will be
cobble above that way from a long

470
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,130
cobble above that way from a long
 

471
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,850
cobble above that way from a long
distance I can tell what's in the

472
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:52,860
distance I can tell what's in the
 

473
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,050
distance I can tell what's in the
dispenser without having to read a sign

474
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:56,060
dispenser without having to read a sign
 

475
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:00,740
dispenser without having to read a sign
which is kind of handy and we're just

476
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:00,750
which is kind of handy and we're just
 

477
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,560
which is kind of handy and we're just
going to test this to make sure it works

478
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:05,570

 

479
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,560

yeah so they don't need to interfere

480
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:09,570
yeah so they don't need to interfere
 

481
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,160
yeah so they don't need to interfere
with each other

482
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,170
with each other
 

483
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,050
with each other
pressing this button doesn't make one

484
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:12,060
pressing this button doesn't make one
 

485
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:18,230
pressing this button doesn't make one
shoot out of here so that'll work and

486
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,240
shoot out of here so that'll work and
 

487
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,220
shoot out of here so that'll work and
I'll probably like to have a storage

488
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,230
I'll probably like to have a storage
 

489
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:38,720
I'll probably like to have a storage
chests over here maybe we'll make some

490
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:38,730

 

491
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:45,779
