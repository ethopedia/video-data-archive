it to make blue fire apparently so I'm

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,090
it to make blue fire apparently so I'm
 

19
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,330
it to make blue fire apparently so I'm
guessing it must be copper chloride or

20
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:50,340
guessing it must be copper chloride or
 

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,880
guessing it must be copper chloride or
something then I thought it was emeralds

22
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:52,890
something then I thought it was emeralds
 

23
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,610
something then I thought it was emeralds
but I guess it looks like copper

24
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:55,620
but I guess it looks like copper
 

25
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,049
but I guess it looks like copper
chloride I don't know what else it could

26
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:00,059
chloride I don't know what else it could
 

27
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:00,700
chloride I don't know what else it could
be

28
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:00,710
be
 

29
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,080
be
so we're going to try make some blue

30
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,090
so we're going to try make some blue
 

31
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,789
so we're going to try make some blue
fire with this stuff and I'm guessing

32
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:07,799
fire with this stuff and I'm guessing
 

33
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:19,500
fire with this stuff and I'm guessing
you can make blue torches no huh

of course I just tattoo cactus farm
 

175
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:53,930
of course I just tattoo cactus farm
which is pretty much a copy yep pretty

176
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:53,940
which is pretty much a copy yep pretty
 

177

just going up through the through the
 

183
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,950
just going up through the through the
Takas farm for now but yeah this is a

184
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:05,960
Takas farm for now but yeah this is a
 

185
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,610
Takas farm for now but yeah this is a
this is above the farms spent a little

186
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:10,620
this is above the farms spent a little
 

187
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,110
this is above the farms spent a little
time trying to make it look a little

188
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,120
time trying to make it look a little
 

189
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:20,020
time trying to make it look a little
better got a cool little bridge here I

190
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,030
better got a cool little bridge here I
 

191
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,190
better got a cool little bridge here I
don't know what you call this a pond

192
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,200
don't know what you call this a pond
 

193
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,430
don't know what you call this a pond
with a cover over top and benches to

194
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,440
with a cover over top and benches to
 

195
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:36,080
with a cover over top and benches to
pretend to sit down at yeah oh that's

196
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,090
pretend to sit down at yeah oh that's
 

197
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:41,719
pretend to sit down at yeah oh that's
nice too bad I'm all alone here but the

198
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:41,729
nice too bad I'm all alone here but the
 

199
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,190
nice too bad I'm all alone here but the
thing I really like about this is the

200
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:43,200
thing I really like about this is the
 

201
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,440
thing I really like about this is the
tree canopy which is a pretty cool we

202
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:48,450
tree canopy which is a pretty cool we
 

203
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,230
tree canopy which is a pretty cool we
got the astroturf which actually looks

204
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,240
got the astroturf which actually looks
 

205
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,100
got the astroturf which actually looks
good in my opinion and in between the

206
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,110
good in my opinion and in between the
 

207
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,600
good in my opinion and in between the
two the bridge we have water

208
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:00,610

 

209
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,200

and which is above class and since this

210
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,210
and which is above class and since this
 

211
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,179
and which is above class and since this
is above class I had to place every

212
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:06,189
is above class I had to place every
 

213
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:10,260
is above class I had to place every
single one of these water box took

214
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,270
single one of these water box took
 

215
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:16,529
single one of these water box took
a long time and yeah this looks pretty

216
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:16,539
a long time and yeah this looks pretty
 

217
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,990
a long time and yeah this looks pretty
cool though I think it's not done of

218
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,000
cool though I think it's not done of
 

219
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,300
cool though I think it's not done of
course I'll probably make a tree canopy

220
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,310
course I'll probably make a tree canopy
 

221
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,839
course I'll probably make a tree canopy
above here yet and do something similar

222
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:27,849
above here yet and do something similar
 

223
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:30,330
above here yet and do something similar
that I have over there and my frame rate

224
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:30,340
that I have over there and my frame rate
 

225
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,000
that I have over there and my frame rate
just drops I'm going to stop for a sec

226
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,010

 

227
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,790

all right sorry about that

228
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:37,800
all right sorry about that
 

229
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:46,470
all right sorry about that
it gets better now okay so the way this

230
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
it gets better now okay so the way this
 

231
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:56,040
it gets better now okay so the way this
canopy works is ah yeah my team's really

232
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,050
canopy works is ah yeah my team's really
 

233
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,009
canopy works is ah yeah my team's really
lighting right now I basically I just

234
00:08:59,009 --> 00:08:59,019
lighting right now I basically I just
 

235
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:01,079
lighting right now I basically I just
kept growing these trees over and over

236
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:01,089
kept growing these trees over and over
 

237
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,509
kept growing these trees over and over
until I got ones I liked you you'll

238
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
until I got ones I liked you you'll
 

239
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,340
until I got ones I liked you you'll
notice most of them are the great trees

240
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:05,350
notice most of them are the great trees
 

241
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,340
notice most of them are the great trees
and then in the center I have these

242
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,350
and then in the center I have these
 

243
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:17,689
and then in the center I have these
hovering logs and all I've been doing is

244
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:17,699
hovering logs and all I've been doing is
 

245
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:22,980
hovering logs and all I've been doing is
like placing dirt too high and placing a

246
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:22,990
like placing dirt too high and placing a
 

247
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,960
like placing dirt too high and placing a
sapling on top growing it with bone meal

248
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:24,970
sapling on top growing it with bone meal
 

249
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,680
sapling on top growing it with bone meal
and then cutting off the logs beneath

250
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:28,690
and then cutting off the logs beneath
 

251
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,630
and then cutting off the logs beneath
and the leaves stay up in the middle is

252
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:33,640
and the leaves stay up in the middle is
 

253
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,360
and the leaves stay up in the middle is
how I've been how I built that canopy

254
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,370
how I've been how I built that canopy
 

255
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,880
how I've been how I built that canopy
over there a word of caution now if you

256
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:38,890
over there a word of caution now if you
 

257
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,470
over there a word of caution now if you
do that it's going to like your game

258
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
do that it's going to like your game
 

259
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,710
do that it's going to like your game
like crazy because the code is very

260
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:43,720
like crazy because the code is very
 

261
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:51,269
like crazy because the code is very
unoptimized for a leaf decay and yeah

262
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
unoptimized for a leaf decay and yeah
 

263
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,800
unoptimized for a leaf decay and yeah
this is partially done only um when I

264
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:55,810
this is partially done only um when I
 

265
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,720
this is partially done only um when I
figure out what I'm going to do with all

266
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:57,730
figure out what I'm going to do with all
 

267
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,420
figure out what I'm going to do with all
this stuff this part here will probably

268
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:00,430
this stuff this part here will probably
 

269
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,530
this stuff this part here will probably
join with that part over there somehow

270
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:04,540
join with that part over there somehow
 

271
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,040
join with that part over there somehow
and it'll be all green and trees and

272
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,050
and it'll be all green and trees and
 

273
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,530
and it'll be all green and trees and
nice because

274
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:10,540
nice because
 

275
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,950
nice because
that's the way I like it somehow they'll

276
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:14,960
that's the way I like it somehow they'll
 

277
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,390
that's the way I like it somehow they'll
join together and all work and let's go

278
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:19,400
join together and all work and let's go
 

279
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,430
join together and all work and let's go
down below and it right now these water

280
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:24,440
down below and it right now these water
 

281
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,680
down below and it right now these water
screen or like this River in the middle

282
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:26,690
screen or like this River in the middle
 

283
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,620
screen or like this River in the middle
just cuts off real sloppy here I'll make

284
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:32,630
just cuts off real sloppy here I'll make
 

285
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,370
just cuts off real sloppy here I'll make
something nice or later and on this end

286
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:36,380
something nice or later and on this end
 

287
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,960
something nice or later and on this end
I plan on building some type of

288
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:37,970
I plan on building some type of
 

289
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,450
I plan on building some type of
waterfall maybe I have one here already

290
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:43,460
waterfall maybe I have one here already
 

291
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,980
waterfall maybe I have one here already
but I don't like quite how this looks so

292
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:46,990
but I don't like quite how this looks so
 

293
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,910
but I don't like quite how this looks so
probably build something slightly

294
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:48,920
probably build something slightly
 

295
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:57,010
probably build something slightly
different and yeah I'm happy with how it

296
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:57,020
different and yeah I'm happy with how it
 

297
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,310
different and yeah I'm happy with how it
looks uh something you guys might might

298
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
looks uh something you guys might might
 

299
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,740
looks uh something you guys might might
not like it tore many of you guys it's

300
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:02,750
not like it tore many of you guys it's
 

301
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,820
not like it tore many of you guys it's
kind of a weird style but I don't

302
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:06,830
kind of a weird style but I don't
 

303
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,960
kind of a weird style but I don't
usually build things normally and

304
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:10,970
usually build things normally and
 

305
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,140
usually build things normally and
underneath the farms I have these wooden

306
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,150
underneath the farms I have these wooden
 

307
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,850
underneath the farms I have these wooden
supports pillars which aren't really

308
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:17,860
supports pillars which aren't really
 

309
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,980
supports pillars which aren't really
necessary for anything except looks and

310
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:22,990
necessary for anything except looks and
 

311
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,170
necessary for anything except looks and
that timers in my way now so I really

312
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:26,180
that timers in my way now so I really
 

313
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,360
that timers in my way now so I really
need to make the tutorial to the cannon

314
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,370
need to make the tutorial to the cannon
 

315
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,990
need to make the tutorial to the cannon
to get it out of here and the house is

316
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
to get it out of here and the house is
 

317
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,660
to get it out of here and the house is
kind of in my way so yeah but they'll

318
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:37,670
kind of in my way so yeah but they'll
 

319
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,640
kind of in my way so yeah but they'll
probably be a waterfall down here you

320
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:39,650
probably be a waterfall down here you
 

321
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,990
probably be a waterfall down here you
might be able to ride a boat down

322
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,000
might be able to ride a boat down
 

323
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,260
might be able to ride a boat down

324
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,270
somehow eventually and will probably be
 

325
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,090
somehow eventually and will probably be
a big pool of water underneath the

326
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:46,100
a big pool of water underneath the
 

327
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,940
a big pool of water underneath the
waterfall and maybe I don't don't know

328
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:51,950
waterfall and maybe I don't don't know
 

329
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,120
waterfall and maybe I don't don't know
exactly how it's been work but hopefully

330
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,130
exactly how it's been work but hopefully
 

331
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,940
exactly how it's been work but hopefully
it will be cool looks pretty neat

00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:58,570

 

485
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:03,520

yeah so these cannons are triggered by

486
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:03,530
yeah so these cannons are triggered by
 

487
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:10,090
yeah so these cannons are triggered by
fire and they have water timers so the

488
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,100
fire and they have water timers so the
 

489
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,330
fire and they have water timers so the
fire burns this block here which

490
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:13,340
fire burns this block here which
 

491
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,120
fire burns this block here which
destroys a sleeve er which activates the

492
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,130
destroys a sleeve er which activates the
 

493
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,310
destroys a sleeve er which activates the
boosters when the lever gets destroyed

494
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,320
boosters when the lever gets destroyed
 

495
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,180
boosters when the lever gets destroyed
and also it releases this water which

496
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,190
and also it releases this water which
 

497
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,780
and also it releases this water which
pours down flows destroys another lever

498
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:25,790
pours down flows destroys another lever
 

499
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,510
pours down flows destroys another lever
and it activates the missile

500
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:28,520
and it activates the missile
 

501
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,660
and it activates the missile
so that just for something different

502
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:33,670
so that just for something different
 

503
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,330
so that just for something different
something different ten interesting

504
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:36,340
something different ten interesting
 

505
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,860
something different ten interesting
they're easy to reset I just need to

506
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:38,870
they're easy to reset I just need to
 

507
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:45,310
they're easy to reset I just need to
replace two levers and the block that

508
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:45,320
replace two levers and the block that
 

509
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:55,530
replace two levers and the block that
burns of course so yeah that's about it

510
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:55,540
burns of course so yeah that's about it
 

511
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,150
burns of course so yeah that's about it
so I'm going to set up the wicks here

512
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
so I'm going to set up the wicks here
 

513
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,860
so I'm going to set up the wicks here
I'm going to connect these all together

514
00:18:59,860 --> 00:18:59,870
I'm going to connect these all together
 

515
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,200
I'm going to connect these all together
then we're going to do our launch

516
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,210
then we're going to do our launch
 

517
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:11,500
then we're going to do our launch
hopefully before day I just made a bunch

518
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:11,510
hopefully before day I just made a bunch
 

519
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,830
hopefully before day I just made a bunch
of wicks here and I'm connecting them

520
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:14,840
of wicks here and I'm connecting them
 

521
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:23,110
of wicks here and I'm connecting them
all together with wood that's pretty

522
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
all together with wood that's pretty
 

523
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,760
all together with wood that's pretty
simple I'm doing a bat-like I'm going to

524
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:27,770
simple I'm doing a bat-like I'm going to
 

525
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,850
simple I'm doing a bat-like I'm going to
make a backup here before I did all this

526
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:30,860
make a backup here before I did all this
 

527
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:37,600
make a backup here before I did all this
so it'll be easy to return back to

528
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:37,610
so it'll be easy to return back to
 

529
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:42,039
so it'll be easy to return back to
normal without using all this TNT

530
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:42,049
normal without using all this TNT
 

531
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:45,019
normal without using all this TNT
so just the reignite this block

532
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:45,029
so just the reignite this block
 

533
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:47,960
so just the reignite this block
underneath the glass here all right not

534
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:47,970
underneath the glass here all right not
 

535
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,340
underneath the glass here all right not
that one the one with the lever on okay

536
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,350
that one the one with the lever on okay
 

537
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,779
that one the one with the lever on okay
so we're all set up here

538
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:55,789
so we're all set up here
 

539
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:59,360
so we're all set up here
and I'm going to make a quick backup

540
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,370
and I'm going to make a quick backup
 

541
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,889
and I'm going to make a quick backup
first all right I have a backup before I

542
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:03,899
first all right I have a backup before I
 

543
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:05,539
first all right I have a backup before I
start loading the cannons and now I have

544
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:05,549
start loading the cannons and now I have
 

545
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:08,659
start loading the cannons and now I have
one with them all loaded so I should be

546
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:08,669
one with them all loaded so I should be
 

547
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:12,700
one with them all loaded so I should be
set for any problem and I'm going to

548
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:12,710
set for any problem and I'm going to
 

549
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,289
set for any problem and I'm going to
start the launch so I'm going to light

550
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:15,299
start the launch so I'm going to light
 

551
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,789

this and then run over to our other

552
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
this and then run over to our other
 

553
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:24,860
this and then run over to our other
button hopefully fast enough and in the

554
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:24,870
button hopefully fast enough and in the
 

555
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,299
button hopefully fast enough and in the
future I'll probably set this up a

556
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:26,309
future I'll probably set this up a
 

557
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:33,680
future I'll probably set this up a
