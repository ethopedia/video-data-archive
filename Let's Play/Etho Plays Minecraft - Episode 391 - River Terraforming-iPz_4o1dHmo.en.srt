00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,010
was like what is that that's the Nexus
 

161
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,540
was like what is that that's the Nexus
over there looked like a spaceship

162
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:35,550
over there looked like a spaceship
 

163
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,980
over there looked like a spaceship
what's going on if we go further then

164
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:39,990
what's going on if we go further then
 

165
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,260
what's going on if we go further then
this is sort of the end now I think if

166
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,270
this is sort of the end now I think if
 

167
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,050
this is sort of the end now I think if
we connect straight through here we have

168
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,060
we connect straight through here we have
 

169
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,700
we connect straight through here we have
another lake and then oh we don't stop

170
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:50,710
another lake and then oh we don't stop
 

171
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,860
another lake and then oh we don't stop
there no we kind of got this cool arch

172
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:52,870
there no we kind of got this cool arch
 

173
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,390
there no we kind of got this cool arch
thing if we go further

174
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
thing if we go further
 

175
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,580
thing if we go further
dead-end but let's see if we can get up

176
00:04:59,580 --> 00:04:59,590
dead-end but let's see if we can get up
 

177
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,379
dead-end but let's see if we can get up
on top the mountain it's kind of a

178
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:01,389
on top the mountain it's kind of a
 

179
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,540
on top the mountain it's kind of a
mountain in our way here we can blow a

180
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:03,550
mountain in our way here we can blow a
 

181
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,600
mountain in our way here we can blow a
hole right through it and then it

182
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:06,610
hole right through it and then it
 

183
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,730
hole right through it and then it
connects oh wait is this ice here no

184
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:08,740
connects oh wait is this ice here no
 

185
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,089
connects oh wait is this ice here no
it's not connects to this lake and this

186
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:12,099
it's not connects to this lake and this
 

187
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,600
it's not connects to this lake and this
lake is sort of big like it goes on

188
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:15,610
lake is sort of big like it goes on
 

189
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,150
lake is sort of big like it goes on
quite a ways sort of all over so that

190
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
quite a ways sort of all over so that
 

191
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,310
quite a ways sort of all over so that
would be cool because I do actually go

192
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
would be cool because I do actually go
 

193
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,439
would be cool because I do actually go
out this direction sometimes and it's

194
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:22,449
out this direction sometimes and it's
 

195
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,260
out this direction sometimes and it's
really hard to get back with these

196
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,270
really hard to get back with these
 

197
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,870
really hard to get back with these
mountains here because I got to go over

198
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:27,880
mountains here because I got to go over
 

199
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,140
mountains here because I got to go over
top them there's no shortcut um so that

200
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,150
top them there's no shortcut um so that
 

201
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,800
top them there's no shortcut um so that
would be cool record record yeah I got a

202
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:34,810
would be cool record record yeah I got a
 

203
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,149
would be cool record record yeah I got a
record oh no oh I didn't get record oh

Minecraft here oh hey oh I'm right in
the line of fire we're good

226
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:21,500
the line of fire we're good
 

227
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,560
the line of fire we're good
I may have spaced these too far we'll

228
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:23,570
I may have spaced these too far we'll
 

229
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,370
I may have spaced these too far we'll
see ouch

230
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:27,380
see ouch
 

231
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,340
see ouch
yeah they're not even detonating that's

232
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:30,350
yeah they're not even detonating that's
 

233
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,300

fine it's fine
 

235
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,270
fine it's fine
so this one goes all the way up over

236
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:34,280
so this one goes all the way up over
 

237
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,110
so this one goes all the way up over
here I'm gonna be careful actually

238
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,120
here I'm gonna be careful actually
 

239
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,960
here I'm gonna be careful actually
because if I lose my tools again I'm

240
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:40,970
because if I lose my tools again I'm
 

241
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,279
because if I lose my tools again I'm
gonna feel really dumb I blow myself up

242
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:44,289
gonna feel really dumb I blow myself up
 

243
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:47,680
gonna feel really dumb I blow myself up
all right and then decide to go through

244
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:47,690
all right and then decide to go through
 

245
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,050
all right and then decide to go through
the terrain here these ones I put pretty

246
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,060
the terrain here these ones I put pretty
 

247
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,970
the terrain here these ones I put pretty
close together should make a big boom

248
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:54,980

 

249
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,000

all right Oh is there a team underneath

250
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,010
all right Oh is there a team underneath
 

251
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:08,220
all right Oh is there a team underneath
a little bit okay and you better run

252
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:08,230

 

253
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:12,910

helping it listen last but not least we

254
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:12,920
helping it listen last but not least we
 

255
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,930
helping it listen last but not least we
have the tunnel through the mountain

256
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:13,940
have the tunnel through the mountain
 

257
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,960
have the tunnel through the mountain
here again I put these ones pretty close

258
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:16,970
here again I put these ones pretty close
 

259
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:27,670
here again I put these ones pretty close
together yeah good oh that's actually

260
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
together yeah good oh that's actually
 

261
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,260
together yeah good oh that's actually
pretty far okay so I'm trying a

262
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:32,270
pretty far okay so I'm trying a
 

263
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,390
pretty far okay so I'm trying a
different method for flooding here

264
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
different method for flooding here
 

265
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,640
different method for flooding here
usually what I do I'll put a layer of

266
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:36,650
usually what I do I'll put a layer of
 

267
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,170
usually what I do I'll put a layer of
dirt and then I put the water overtop

268
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:38,180
dirt and then I put the water overtop
 

269
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,880
dirt and then I put the water overtop
and flood flood the dirt and then I

270
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:39,890
and flood flood the dirt and then I
 

271
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,370
and flood flood the dirt and then I
remove it this time I'm just putting ice

272
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:42,380
remove it this time I'm just putting ice
 

273
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,170
remove it this time I'm just putting ice
all the way through and leaving it

274
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:44,180
all the way through and leaving it
 

275
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,960
all the way through and leaving it
hollow underneath I'm not trying to fill

276
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:46,970
hollow underneath I'm not trying to fill
 

277
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,880
hollow underneath I'm not trying to fill
it solid that will just take longer and

278
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:48,890
it solid that will just take longer and
 

279
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,490
it solid that will just take longer and
it's not necessary the nice thing about

280
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:51,500
it's not necessary the nice thing about
 

281
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
it's not necessary the nice thing about
doing it this way is I can stand on the

282
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:53,510
doing it this way is I can stand on the
 

283
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,760
doing it this way is I can stand on the
ice and like shape it if this is all

284
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:57,770
ice and like shape it if this is all
 

285
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,760
ice and like shape it if this is all
water you know it's kind of tricky to do

286
00:07:59,760 --> 00:07:59,770
water you know it's kind of tricky to do
 

287
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,630
water you know it's kind of tricky to do
so yeah so now what I'll do is I'll go

288
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:04,640
so yeah so now what I'll do is I'll go
 

289
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,280
so yeah so now what I'll do is I'll go
by and I'd have a row of of stone or

290
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,290
by and I'd have a row of of stone or
 

291
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,020
by and I'd have a row of of stone or
something probably dirts and put torches

292
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,030
something probably dirts and put torches
 

293
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,940
something probably dirts and put torches
on both sides and try to melt the ice

294
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:12,950
on both sides and try to melt the ice
 

295
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:24,760
on both sides and try to melt the ice
and see if that turns out okay

296
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:24,770

 

297
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:30,050

that's a lot of Mom's alright guys I got

298
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,060
that's a lot of Mom's alright guys I got
 

299
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,730
that's a lot of Mom's alright guys I got
the river done here we're gonna go for a

300
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:31,740
the river done here we're gonna go for a
 

301
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,880
the river done here we're gonna go for a
ride and try it out got to make sure I

302
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:34,890
ride and try it out got to make sure I
 

303
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,030
ride and try it out got to make sure I
can take those bends at full speed

304
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,040
can take those bends at full speed
 

305
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,020
can take those bends at full speed
actually it's pretty much a straight

306
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,030
actually it's pretty much a straight
 

307
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:44,630
actually it's pretty much a straight
away I think um melting the ice didn't

308
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
away I think um melting the ice didn't
 

309
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,040
away I think um melting the ice didn't
work out as well as I hoped I had a

310
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,050
work out as well as I hoped I had a
 

311
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,380
work out as well as I hoped I had a
weird side effect where it created all

312
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:48,390
weird side effect where it created all
 

313
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,500
weird side effect where it created all
these air pockets in the water which I

314
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:51,510
these air pockets in the water which I
 

315
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:56,480
these air pockets in the water which I
had to then go fill but it wasn't too

316
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:56,490
had to then go fill but it wasn't too
 

317
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:56,990
had to then go fill but it wasn't too
bad either

318
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,000
bad either
 

319

we'll try to get up to full speed again

342
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,450
we'll try to get up to full speed again
 

343
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,310
we'll try to get up to full speed again
and see if I can do that man I really

something non terraforming okay where

366
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:16,740
something non terraforming okay where
 

367
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,250
something non terraforming okay where
does this one go I think I have to dig

368

out more spots to connect it to other

370
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:20,790
out more spots to connect it to other
 

371
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,330
out more spots to connect it to other
water places but I'm just kind of want

372
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:23,340
water places but I'm just kind of want
 

373
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,100
water places but I'm just kind of want
to check it out as well I think this is

374
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,110
to check it out as well I think this is
 

375
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,900

formed here so we'd have to cut out

382
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:42,529
formed here so we'd have to cut out
 

383
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:47,250
formed here so we'd have to cut out
there and maybe then cut across here

384
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:47,260
there and maybe then cut across here
 

385
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:58,480
there and maybe then cut across here

it's quite the eyesore we also have a
 

431
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:14,620
it's quite the eyesore we also have a
problem with this is the gold farm by

432
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:14,630
problem with this is the gold farm by
 

433
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,350
problem with this is the gold farm by
the way this elevator stopped working in

434
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
the way this elevator stopped working in
 

435
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,040
the way this elevator stopped working in
one of the patches kind of it does this

436
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,050
one of the patches kind of it does this
 

437
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,250
one of the patches kind of it does this
all the time and for some reason I get

438
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:24,260
all the time and for some reason I get
 

439
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,519
all the time and for some reason I get
stuck in it and it like stops weird

440
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:27,529
stuck in it and it like stops weird
 

441
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:32,139
stuck in it and it like stops weird
I should almost investigate this this is

442
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:32,149
I should almost investigate this this is
 

443
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:34,750
I should almost investigate this this is
a very strange thing it's like sometimes

444
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:34,760
a very strange thing it's like sometimes
 

445
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,139
a very strange thing it's like sometimes
it goes and then retracts other times I

446
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:38,149
it goes and then retracts other times I
 

447
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:41,180
it goes and then retracts other times I
get stuck in it

448
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,190

 

449
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,870

it's very odd not exactly sure what's

450
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:45,880
it's very odd not exactly sure what's
 

451
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,050
it's very odd not exactly sure what's
going on with the redstone

452
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,060

 

453
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,790

is it every second time it doesn't like

454
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
is it every second time it doesn't like
 

455
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,040
is it every second time it doesn't like
I should get stuck this time right yeah

456
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,050
I should get stuck this time right yeah
 

457
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,350
I should get stuck this time right yeah
I got stuck this time okay maybe it's

458
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:00,360
I got stuck this time okay maybe it's
 

459
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:08,449
I got stuck this time okay maybe it's
making uh oh oh man so strange anyway

460
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:08,459
making uh oh oh man so strange anyway
 

461
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,519
making uh oh oh man so strange anyway
it's not working quite right anymore so

462
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:10,529
it's not working quite right anymore so
 

463
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:14,150
it's not working quite right anymore so
I need a new elevator design I think but

464
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
I need a new elevator design I think but
 

465
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,680
I need a new elevator design I think but
also this building doesn't look the

466
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:18,690
also this building doesn't look the
 

467
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,030
also this building doesn't look the
greatest of course it's not finished but

468
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
greatest of course it's not finished but
 

469
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,290
greatest of course it's not finished but
maybe we need to do something about it

470
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:26,300
maybe we need to do something about it
 

471
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,730
maybe we need to do something about it
so yeah do you have ideas let me know

475
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,970
there's a specific theme or or idea we
could go with it sort of has to sit stay

476
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:34,980
could go with it sort of has to sit stay
 

477
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,160
could go with it sort of has to sit stay
in that spot is the problem and there's

478
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,170
in that spot is the problem and there's
 

479
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,780
in that spot is the problem and there's
a portal up there that we also need to

480
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:38,790
a portal up there that we also need to
 

481
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,040
a portal up there that we also need to
access to so yeah we're going to head

482
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,050
access to so yeah we're going to head
 

483
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,360
access to so yeah we're going to head
over to the library though I just want

484
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,370
over to the library though I just want
 

485
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,440
over to the library though I just want
to try check out something as well all

486
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,450
to try check out something as well all
 

487
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,449
to try check out something as well all
right so some of you are probably like

488
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:50,459
right so some of you are probably like
 

489
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,210
right so some of you are probably like
etho why you know work on library what's

490
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:53,220
etho why you know work on library what's
 

491
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,910
etho why you know work on library what's
going on well it's because we've hit

492
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
going on well it's because we've hit
 

493
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,460
going on well it's because we've hit
sort of a tough spot - right - now if

494
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:58,470
sort of a tough spot - right - now if
 

495
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,910
sort of a tough spot - right - now if
you remember I wanted to wire up these

496
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:01,920
you remember I wanted to wire up these
 

497
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,130
you remember I wanted to wire up these
buttons you see how close together there

498
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,140
buttons you see how close together there
 

499
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,630
buttons you see how close together there
and on both rows here these are supposed

500
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:08,640
and on both rows here these are supposed
 

501
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,030
and on both rows here these are supposed
to go to some droppers that have the

502
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
to go to some droppers that have the
 

503
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,610
to go to some droppers that have the
enchanted books in which we'll probably

504
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:13,620
enchanted books in which we'll probably
 

505
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,340
enchanted books in which we'll probably
want to put in the middle here somewhere

506
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:16,350
want to put in the middle here somewhere
 

507
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,949
want to put in the middle here somewhere
and I gotta connect each of those

508
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
and I gotta connect each of those
 

509
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,740
and I gotta connect each of those
buttons to the dropper and nuts have the

510
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:21,750
buttons to the dropper and nuts have the
 

511
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,500
buttons to the dropper and nuts have the
wires connect with each other and we

512
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:24,510
wires connect with each other and we
 

513
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,540
wires connect with each other and we
don't have bundled cables or anything so

514
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:26,550
don't have bundled cables or anything so
 

515
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,990
don't have bundled cables or anything so
that is not an easy task but I think

516
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
that is not an easy task but I think
 

517
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,030
that is not an easy task but I think
we'll probably do it like like we did at

518
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,040
we'll probably do it like like we did at
 

519
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,850
we'll probably do it like like we did at
the Nexus where we have droppers then

520
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:34,860
the Nexus where we have droppers then
 

521
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,670
the Nexus where we have droppers then
hoppers and a chest going into the

522
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
hoppers and a chest going into the
 

523
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,560
hoppers and a chest going into the
droppers these will shoot the the books

524
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:39,570
droppers these will shoot the the books
 

525
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,610
droppers these will shoot the the books
into like a nice ice water stream thing

526
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:43,620
into like a nice ice water stream thing
 

527
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,509
into like a nice ice water stream thing
and then those will get launched to us

528
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
and then those will get launched to us
 

529
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,210
and then those will get launched to us
when we're over here with some slime

530
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:50,220
when we're over here with some slime
 

531
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,300
when we're over here with some slime
block launchers I think is my plan now

532
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:52,310
block launchers I think is my plan now
 

533
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,579
block launchers I think is my plan now
but to actually connect these is going

534
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:55,589
but to actually connect these is going
 

535
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:57,710
but to actually connect these is going
to be very tricky I want to see how I

536
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:57,720
to be very tricky I want to see how I
 

537
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,850
to be very tricky I want to see how I
does this I think we need 23 droppers or

538
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:01,860
does this I think we need 23 droppers or
 

539
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,810
does this I think we need 23 droppers or
something 23 different types of

540
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:03,820
something 23 different types of
 

541
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,650
something 23 different types of
chanted books I believe maybe I got that

542
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:07,660
chanted books I believe maybe I got that
 

543
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,410
chanted books I believe maybe I got that
wrong wait we should check that just to

544
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:10,420
wrong wait we should check that just to
 

545
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,400
wrong wait we should check that just to
be sure one two three four five six

546
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,410
be sure one two three four five six
 

547
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,590
be sure one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

548
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:16,600
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
 

549
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,260
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
thirteen oh now it's twenty five

550
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,270
thirteen oh now it's twenty five
 

551
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,640
thirteen oh now it's twenty five
thirteen plus thirteen twenty six and I

552
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:23,650
thirteen plus thirteen twenty six and I
 

553
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:30,810
thirteen plus thirteen twenty six and I
think I had one extra 25 that's nine ten

554
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:30,820
think I had one extra 25 that's nine ten
 

555
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,600
think I had one extra 25 that's nine ten
eleven twelve thirteen oh man

556
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:33,610
eleven twelve thirteen oh man
 

557
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,690
eleven twelve thirteen oh man
so if we go that way it doesn't leave us

558
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:36,700
so if we go that way it doesn't leave us
 

559
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,220
so if we go that way it doesn't leave us
any space to walk by all right so that's

560
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,230
any space to walk by all right so that's
 

561
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,810
any space to walk by all right so that's
not going to work we might need to do

562
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:42,820
not going to work we might need to do
 

563
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,200
not going to work we might need to do
like like we'll probably have some going

564
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,210
like like we'll probably have some going
 

565
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,050
like like we'll probably have some going
this way then some going this way and I

566
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:49,060
this way then some going this way and I
 

567
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,380
this way then some going this way and I
guess we'll need a couple on the sides

568
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,390
guess we'll need a couple on the sides
 

569
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,180
guess we'll need a couple on the sides
because otherwise it's it's too fat and

570
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,190
because otherwise it's it's too fat and
 

571
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,990
because otherwise it's it's too fat and
we can't walk by it so I might go with

572
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
we can't walk by it so I might go with
 

573
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,780
we can't walk by it so I might go with
this arrangement here we have seven by

574
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:00,790
this arrangement here we have seven by
 

575
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,610
this arrangement here we have seven by
six so 14 plus twelve that's 26 that's

576
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:05,620
six so 14 plus twelve that's 26 that's
 

577
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,080
six so 14 plus twelve that's 26 that's
good that's what we need

578
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,090
good that's what we need
 

579
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,780
good that's what we need
well we only need 25 but I'm I'll keep

580
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:09,790
well we only need 25 but I'm I'll keep
 

581
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,730
well we only need 25 but I'm I'll keep
the extra you never know they might add

582
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:11,740
the extra you never know they might add
 

583
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,500
the extra you never know they might add
a new enchantment to the game or

584
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:13,510
a new enchantment to the game or
 

585
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,320
a new enchantment to the game or
something dumb and that would be pretty

586
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,330
something dumb and that would be pretty
 

587
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,480
something dumb and that would be pretty
sad if I built all this and they added a

588
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:18,490
sad if I built all this and they added a
 

589
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,030
sad if I built all this and they added a
new one

590
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,040
new one
 

591
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,350
new one
so I got I'm trying to set this up so

592
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:22,360
so I got I'm trying to set this up so
 

593
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,870
so I got I'm trying to set this up so
that we can manually access these if we

594
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
that we can manually access these if we
 

595
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,550
that we can manually access these if we
want and like check how many books we

596
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
want and like check how many books we
 

597
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,100
want and like check how many books we
have but I also wanted to work

598
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,110
have but I also wanted to work
 

599
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,780
have but I also wanted to work
automatically with these buttons down

600
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:30,790
automatically with these buttons down
 

601
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,980
automatically with these buttons down
here which is going to be tricky let's

602
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:34,990
here which is going to be tricky let's
 

603
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,110
here which is going to be tricky let's
see probably the best way of doing it is

604
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,120
see probably the best way of doing it is
 

605
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,940
see probably the best way of doing it is
to connect these top ones in the middle

606
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:41,950
to connect these top ones in the middle
 

607
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:48,330
to connect these top ones in the middle
here with these first droppers here all

608
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:48,340
here with these first droppers here all
 

609
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,100
here with these first droppers here all
right so I'm gonna I'm gonna remove this

610
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,110
right so I'm gonna I'm gonna remove this
 

611
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,280
right so I'm gonna I'm gonna remove this
stuff and start trying to lay this out

612
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,290
stuff and start trying to lay this out
 

613
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,250
stuff and start trying to lay this out
um a little secret you know I love doing

614
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:56,260
um a little secret you know I love doing
 

615
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,280
um a little secret you know I love doing
redstone it's a lot of fun I like trying

616
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,290
redstone it's a lot of fun I like trying
 

617
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,590
redstone it's a lot of fun I like trying
to work out the problem and and build

618
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
to work out the problem and and build
 

619
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,150
to work out the problem and and build
the components and all that stuff I

620
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,160
the components and all that stuff I
 

621
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,829
the components and all that stuff I
really don't like this part of redstone

622
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:04,839
really don't like this part of redstone
 

623
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,530
really don't like this part of redstone
though trying to find how to link

624
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:07,540
though trying to find how to link
 

625

everything together with the wire isn't

626
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:09,550
everything together with the wire isn't
 

627
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,380

one of the buttons Darrin I was hoping I

630
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:16,390
one of the buttons Darrin I was hoping I
 

631
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,280
one of the buttons Darrin I was hoping I
could just

632
