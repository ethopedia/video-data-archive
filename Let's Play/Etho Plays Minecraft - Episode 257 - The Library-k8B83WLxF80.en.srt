yeah I had this idea the other day I was

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:47,430
yeah I had this idea the other day I was
 

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,069
yeah I had this idea the other day I was
wondering if I could represent all the

16
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:49,079
wondering if I could represent all the
 

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,100
wondering if I could represent all the
letters in the English alphabet within a

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,110
letters in the English alphabet within a
 

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,240
letters in the English alphabet within a
3x3 block space in Minecraft and this is

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,250
3x3 block space in Minecraft and this is
 

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,410
3x3 block space in Minecraft and this is
what I came up with and they're actually

22
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:57,420
what I came up with and they're actually
 

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,340
what I came up with and they're actually
pretty clear you know or I think they're

24
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:01,350
pretty clear you know or I think they're
 

25
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,820
pretty clear you know or I think they're
pretty readable I especially like the R

26
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:03,830
pretty readable I especially like the R
 

27
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,800
pretty readable I especially like the R
R is very cool

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:06,810
R is very cool
 

29
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,070
R is very cool
so yeah if you guys need tiny fonts for

30
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
so yeah if you guys need tiny fonts for
 

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,520
so yeah if you guys need tiny fonts for
anything in Minecraft this is probably

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:13,530
anything in Minecraft this is probably
 

33
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,990
anything in Minecraft this is probably
one of the smallest ways you can do it

34
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,000
one of the smallest ways you can do it
 

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,370
one of the smallest ways you can do it
and actually like place blocks to do it

36
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:18,380
and actually like place blocks to do it
 

37
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,410
and actually like place blocks to do it
that I would share it hope you find this

38
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:21,420
that I would share it hope you find this
 

39
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,109
that I would share it hope you find this
useful for whatever on earth too you

40
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:24,119
useful for whatever on earth too you
 

41
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,330
useful for whatever on earth too you
have to spell out and

42
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:28,340

 

43
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,510

yeah well that brings us to our world

44
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:32,520
yeah well that brings us to our world
 

45
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,840
yeah well that brings us to our world
here today and you know I'm in a

46
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:35,850
here today and you know I'm in a
 

47
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,810
here today and you know I'm in a
building and terraforming mood today I

48
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:38,820
building and terraforming mood today I
 

49
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,830
building and terraforming mood today I
think we're gonna take a break from

50
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
think we're gonna take a break from
 

51
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,010
think we're gonna take a break from
redstone or at least I think we're going

52
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,020
redstone or at least I think we're going
 

53
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,460
redstone or at least I think we're going
to so this has been a scar in my world

54
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:49,470
to so this has been a scar in my world
 

55
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,410
to so this has been a scar in my world
for a long time this big hole here that

56
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:53,420
for a long time this big hole here that
 

57
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,610
for a long time this big hole here that
keeps getting bigger and this is where I

58
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:58,620
keeps getting bigger and this is where I
 

59
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,469
keeps getting bigger and this is where I
got a bunch of sand when I first started

60
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
got a bunch of sand when I first started
 

61
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,730
got a bunch of sand when I first started
in this world and then I moved on to

62
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:01,740
in this world and then I moved on to
 

63
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,590
in this world and then I moved on to
another place that I don't mind wrecking

64
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
another place that I don't mind wrecking
 

65
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,090
another place that I don't mind wrecking
but this is really close to the man cave

66
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,100
but this is really close to the man cave
 

67
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,219
but this is really close to the man cave
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna

68
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:10,229
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
 

69
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,170
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
try fill us in as much as we can today

70
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,180
try fill us in as much as we can today
 

71
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,210
try fill us in as much as we can today
if not all of its and I'm just gonna do

72
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:17,220
if not all of its and I'm just gonna do
 

73
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,910
if not all of its and I'm just gonna do
one pick of dirt like so all the way

74
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:22,920
one pick of dirt like so all the way
 

75
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,010
one pick of dirt like so all the way
through and then we might have a room

76
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,020
through and then we might have a room
 

77
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,520
through and then we might have a room
underneath or at least light it up or

78
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,530
underneath or at least light it up or
 

79
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,009
underneath or at least light it up or
something I don't know it I kind of like

80
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:31,019
something I don't know it I kind of like
 

81
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,840
something I don't know it I kind of like
this area for testing because it's a big

82
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:32,850
this area for testing because it's a big
 

83
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:40,340
this area for testing because it's a big
flat area but we would like to be able

84
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:40,350
flat area but we would like to be able
 

85
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,610
flat area but we would like to be able
to walk over it so I'm gonna try to

86
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:43,620
to walk over it so I'm gonna try to
 

87
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,310
to walk over it so I'm gonna try to
collect all the soil I have together and

88
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:46,320
collect all the soil I have together and
 

89
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,479
collect all the soil I have together and
fill this baby in and actually the best

90
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:50,489
fill this baby in and actually the best
 

91
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:52,820
fill this baby in and actually the best
way of probably doing this is to go out

92
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:52,830
way of probably doing this is to go out
 

93
00:02:52,830 --> 00:03:00,500
way of probably doing this is to go out
in rows like this then every 3 or 4

94
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:00,510
in rows like this then every 3 or 4
 

95
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,870
in rows like this then every 3 or 4
blocks do that so that we have something

96
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:02,880
blocks do that so that we have something
 

97
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,330
blocks do that so that we have something
to actually place blocks against when

98
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:05,340
to actually place blocks against when
 

99
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,449
to actually place blocks against when
filling it in makes it much easier all

100
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:11,459
filling it in makes it much easier all
 

101
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,250
filling it in makes it much easier all
right well it's going very well here

102
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:13,260
right well it's going very well here
 

103
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,050
right well it's going very well here
we're just about got it all done I have

104
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,060
we're just about got it all done I have
 

105
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,810
we're just about got it all done I have
to go for one more load of soil and it

106
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:17,820
to go for one more load of soil and it
 

107
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,880
to go for one more load of soil and it
will be enough to finish it there's just

108
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:19,890
will be enough to finish it there's just
 

109
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,550
will be enough to finish it there's just
this one area left but it's gonna look a

110
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:25,560
this one area left but it's gonna look a
 

111
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,289
this one area left but it's gonna look a
lot better I think in this area this is

112
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:27,299
lot better I think in this area this is
 

113
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:30,289
lot better I think in this area this is
however deserts so this grass is going

114
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:30,299
however deserts so this grass is going
 

115
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,600
however deserts so this grass is going
to be like that color not not that color

116
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:34,610
to be like that color not not that color
 

117
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,440
to be like that color not not that color
so

118
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,450
so
 

119
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,180
so
what do you do we'll get used to it I

120
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,190
what do you do we'll get used to it I
 

121
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,759
what do you do we'll get used to it I
prefer like desert grass over sand to be

122
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:43,769
prefer like desert grass over sand to be
 

123
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:52,970
prefer like desert grass over sand to be
honest all right these sheep I've dyed

124
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:52,980
honest all right these sheep I've dyed
 

125
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,229
honest all right these sheep I've dyed
them this color for the build project I

126
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:57,239
them this color for the build project I
 

127
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,490
them this color for the build project I
have planned for today we're gonna work

128
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:58,500
have planned for today we're gonna work
 

129
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,440
have planned for today we're gonna work
on that library I think and I'm gonna be

130
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,450
on that library I think and I'm gonna be
 

131
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,440
on that library I think and I'm gonna be
I'm gonna try and mix up some weird

132
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,450
I'm gonna try and mix up some weird
 

133
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,360
I'm gonna try and mix up some weird
colors together and see how it goes it's

134
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,370
colors together and see how it goes it's
 

135
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,170
colors together and see how it goes it's
a style I've never tried before you need

136
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:12,180
a style I've never tried before you need
 

137
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,080
a style I've never tried before you need
cyan wool didn'ti clay possibly quartz

138
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,090
cyan wool didn'ti clay possibly quartz
 

139
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,659
cyan wool didn'ti clay possibly quartz
blocks and a lot of stone bricks and

140
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:20,669
blocks and a lot of stone bricks and
 

141
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:24,379
blocks and a lot of stone bricks and
stuff and we will see how that goes but

142
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:24,389
stuff and we will see how that goes but
 

143
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,450
stuff and we will see how that goes but
we'll get to that pretty soon I'm just

144
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:26,460
we'll get to that pretty soon I'm just
 

145
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,719
we'll get to that pretty soon I'm just
gonna finish up here and then I got a

146
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:29,729
gonna finish up here and then I got a
 

147
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:37,610
gonna finish up here and then I got a
transition this - I've been aft here for

148
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:37,620
transition this - I've been aft here for
 

149
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,890
transition this - I've been aft here for
good 30 minutes or so let's check out

150
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:39,900
good 30 minutes or so let's check out
 

151
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:47,900
good 30 minutes or so let's check out
how the grass is doing it's almost all

152
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:47,910
how the grass is doing it's almost all
 

153
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,060
how the grass is doing it's almost all
spread that's good oh man look at the

154
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,070
spread that's good oh man look at the
 

155
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,830
spread that's good oh man look at the
grass so that's a big difference isn't

156
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
grass so that's a big difference isn't
 

157
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:00,500
grass so that's a big difference isn't
it it's not bad once we grow like Paul

158

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,190
a little bit one thing I noticed though
 

163
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,830
a little bit one thing I noticed though
when I was working on this there's a lot

164
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:06,840
when I was working on this there's a lot
 

165
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,779
when I was working on this there's a lot
of mobs spawning down below and let's

166
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:10,789
of mobs spawning down below and let's
 

167
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:16,980
of mobs spawning down below and let's
let's just go check that out real quick

168
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:16,990

 

169
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,920

173
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,420
I've had brighter ideas in my day and
I'm tempted to make a mob system like in

174
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:33,430
I'm tempted to make a mob system like in
 

175
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,290
I'm tempted to make a mob system like in
this area to like not a drop one maybe

176
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:37,300
this area to like not a drop one maybe
 

177
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,600
this area to like not a drop one maybe
like one of the old mob evader styles

178
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:39,610
like one of the old mob evader styles
 

179
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,249
like one of the old mob evader styles
cuz I really like those and the spawn

180
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:44,259
cuz I really like those and the spawn
 

181
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:46,020
cuz I really like those and the spawn
rates are good most cities must be lit

182
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,030
rates are good most cities must be lit
 

183
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,050
rates are good most cities must be lit
up I haven't even tried to light them up

184
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,060
up I haven't even tried to light them up
 

185
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,960
up I haven't even tried to light them up
and it looks like make sure I was aft

186
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:51,970
and it looks like make sure I was aft
 

187
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,150
and it looks like make sure I was aft
for a long time here but it was like

188
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
for a long time here but it was like
 

189
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:03,960
for a long time here but it was like
this even before then oh oh that's not

190
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:03,970
this even before then oh oh that's not

207
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:46,219
up later we're gonna get out of here
we're gonna go over to our library area

208
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:46,229

 

209

235
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,730
we're gonna go which way is it up over
to the library area over this way I

236
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:40,740
to the library area over this way I
 

237
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,930
to the library area over this way I
believe my bearings are rights we're

238
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:44,940
believe my bearings are rights we're
 

239
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,720
believe my bearings are rights we're
looking for that floating island again I

240
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:49,730

 

241
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,980

don't have feather falling boots I got
 

243
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,230
don't have feather falling boots I got
to do some big enchanting again because

244
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
to do some big enchanting again because
 

245
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,690
to do some big enchanting again because
I do I don't have any work pics I'm

246

I do I don't have any work pics I'm
 

247
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,780
I do I don't have any work pics I'm
using that fortune 3-1 which is a bit

248
00:07:59,780 --> 00:07:59,790
using that fortune 3-1 which is a bit
 

249
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:06,920
using that fortune 3-1 which is a bit
wasteful up there we are going to build

250
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:06,930
wasteful up there we are going to build
 

251
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,690
wasteful up there we are going to build
the library not on the floating island

252
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:11,700
the library not on the floating island
 

253
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,070
the library not on the floating island
we're gonna build it on the mountain so

254
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,080
we're gonna build it on the mountain so
 

255
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,280
we're gonna build it on the mountain so
we'll have more space to work I think it

256
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,290
we'll have more space to work I think it
 

257
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:24,470
we'll have more space to work I think it
was up there I had my eye on let's see

258
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:24,480
was up there I had my eye on let's see
 

259
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,550
was up there I had my eye on let's see
let's just check this out real quick

260
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560

 

261
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,900

yeah right here this is it I marked it

262
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:32,910
yeah right here this is it I marked it
 

263
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:39,339
yeah right here this is it I marked it
with a torch so what we're gonna do

264
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:39,349

 

265
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:43,339

let's I think we're gonna level this out

266
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:43,349
let's I think we're gonna level this out
 

267
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,540
let's I think we're gonna level this out
a fair bit

268
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:45,550
a fair bit
 

269
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,870
a fair bit
it'd make a nice big open flat area to

270
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
it'd make a nice big open flat area to
 

271
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,360
it'd make a nice big open flat area to
work and we'll we'll build it with the

272
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,370
work and we'll we'll build it with the
 

273
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,650
work and we'll we'll build it with the
front facing this light towards us and

274
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:54,660
front facing this light towards us and
 

275
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,180
front facing this light towards us and
if we need more space we can clear out

276
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,190
if we need more space we can clear out
 

277
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,760
if we need more space we can clear out
more of the mountain as we need to

278
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:01,770
more of the mountain as we need to
 

279
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,230
more of the mountain as we need to
because otherwise like I would like to

280
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
because otherwise like I would like to
 

281
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,730
because otherwise like I would like to
build on the floating island there but

282
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:05,740
build on the floating island there but
 

283
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,800
build on the floating island there but
it's just not big enough let's go check

284
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:07,810
it's just not big enough let's go check
 

285
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:14,480
it's just not big enough let's go check
that out one more time it's over here

286
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:14,490

 

287
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,820

wait I thought it was over here this is

288
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:17,830
wait I thought it was over here this is
 

289
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,500
wait I thought it was over here this is
it yeah and it's not really flat this

290
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:22,510
it yeah and it's not really flat this
 

291
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:36,240
it yeah and it's not really flat this
thing either be a bit hard to shape well

292
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,250
thing either be a bit hard to shape well
 

293
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,070
thing either be a bit hard to shape well
I think I got a nice little area

294
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
I think I got a nice little area
 

295
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,639
I think I got a nice little area
prepared here to begin with we'll need

296
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:41,649
prepared here to begin with we'll need
 

297
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,040
prepared here to begin with we'll need
to clear more line for sure

298
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,050
to clear more line for sure
 

299
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,350
to clear more line for sure
and flatten the area a bit I've been

300
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:46,360
and flatten the area a bit I've been
 

301
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,210
and flatten the area a bit I've been
placed in Kabul as filler and just

302
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:48,220
placed in Kabul as filler and just
 

303
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,560
placed in Kabul as filler and just
covering over but this this will get us

304
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:52,570
covering over but this this will get us
 

305
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,210
covering over but this this will get us
started we can work on the front at

306
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:54,220
started we can work on the front at
 

307
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,600
started we can work on the front at
least and I marked this as our center

308
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:57,610
least and I marked this as our center
 

309
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,250
least and I marked this as our center
and I believe I got all the blocks

310
00:09:59,250 --> 00:09:59,260
and I believe I got all the blocks
 

311
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,430
and I believe I got all the blocks
transported over here that we'll need

312
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
transported over here that we'll need
 

313
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,810
transported over here that we'll need
there was a zombie villager by the way

314
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:03,820
there was a zombie villager by the way
 

315
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,720
there was a zombie villager by the way
that spawned up here and he had

316
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:05,730
that spawned up here and he had
 

317
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,100
that spawned up here and he had
protection two thorns one I was like

318
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,110
protection two thorns one I was like
 

319
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,930
protection two thorns one I was like
fighting him and I started taking damage

320
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:09,940
fighting him and I started taking damage
 

321
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,269
fighting him and I started taking damage
done that kinda surprised me because

322
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:12,279
done that kinda surprised me because
 

323
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,210
done that kinda surprised me because
I've never seen that before they can get

324
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:15,220
I've never seen that before they can get
 

325
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,610
I've never seen that before they can get
thorns on their on their gear and yeah

326
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:20,620
thorns on their on their gear and yeah
 

327
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,050
thorns on their on their gear and yeah
yeah one of the materials were gonna

328
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,060
yeah one of the materials were gonna
 

329
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,329
yeah one of the materials were gonna
build with is quartz I just want to show

330
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:24,339
build with is quartz I just want to show
 

331
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:26,670
build with is quartz I just want to show
you something I kind of clued in to a

332
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:26,680
you something I kind of clued in to a
 

333
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,829
you something I kind of clued in to a
little while ago which I'm sure other

334
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:28,839
little while ago which I'm sure other
 

335
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,090
little while ago which I'm sure other
people have too but this is really neat

336
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,100
people have too but this is really neat
 

337
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,639
people have too but this is really neat
quartz blocks on their own they're so

338
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:35,649
quartz blocks on their own they're so
 

339
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:36,180
quartz blocks on their own they're so
pretty

340
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,190
pretty
 

341
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,600
pretty
they're awesome I love them it's a great

342
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:39,610
they're awesome I love them it's a great
 

343
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:46,110
they're awesome I love them it's a great
addition great block but with with the

344
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,120
addition great block but with with the
 

345
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,060
addition great block but with with the
pillar quartz block and the chiseled

346
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,070
pillar quartz block and the chiseled
 

347
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:48,990
pillar quartz block and the chiseled
quartz block

348
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,000
quartz block
 

349
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,900
quartz block
especially the pillar one though you can

350
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:51,910
especially the pillar one though you can
 

351
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,449
especially the pillar one though you can
do some pretty neat subtle patterns with

352
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:54,459
do some pretty neat subtle patterns with
 

353
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:58,960
do some pretty neat subtle patterns with
it like for example

354
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:58,970

 

355
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,970

one side like this is what the pillar of

356
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:01,980
one side like this is what the pillar of
 

357
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,629
one side like this is what the pillar of
block looks like so you got the stripes

358
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:05,639
block looks like so you got the stripes
 

359
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,970
block looks like so you got the stripes
on the side but this is really neat like

360
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:07,980
on the side but this is really neat like
 

361
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,329
on the side but this is really neat like
it has almost like a woodgrain like like

362
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:11,339
it has almost like a woodgrain like like
 

363
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,759
it has almost like a woodgrain like like
the logs have this this square look on

364
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:13,769
the logs have this this square look on
 

365
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:17,749
the logs have this this square look on
the top so hopefully it's not too bright

366
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:17,759
the top so hopefully it's not too bright
 

367
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,850
the top so hopefully it's not too bright
on YouTube we can actually see what I'm

368
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:19,860
on YouTube we can actually see what I'm
 

369
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,910
on YouTube we can actually see what I'm
talking about here but you can make some

370
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:22,920
talking about here but you can make some
 

371
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,100
talking about here but you can make some
pretty cool patterns with that better

372
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,110
pretty cool patterns with that better
 

373
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,729
pretty cool patterns with that better
you know they're nice and subtle or you

374
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:31,739
you know they're nice and subtle or you
 

375
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:34,759
you know they're nice and subtle or you
can for example late them sideways and

376
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:34,769
can for example late them sideways and
 

377
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,650
can for example late them sideways and
come up with a ton of other patterns as

378
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:36,660
come up with a ton of other patterns as
 

379
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,819
come up with a ton of other patterns as
well let's just check that out real

380
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:40,829
well let's just check that out real
 

381
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:46,389
well let's just check that out real
quick they're a bit of a pain to place

382
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
quick they're a bit of a pain to place
 

383
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,979
quick they're a bit of a pain to place
but you can do something like this for

384
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:48,989
but you can do something like this for
 

385
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:55,809
but you can do something like this for
example

386
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:55,819

 

387
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:58,309

and you know on a large scale that would

388
00:11:58,309 --> 00:11:58,319
and you know on a large scale that would
 

389
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:03,559
and you know on a large scale that would
look pretty neat but anyway library

390
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:03,569
look pretty neat but anyway library
 

391
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:05,869
look pretty neat but anyway library
library I don't know how to build the

392
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:05,879
library I don't know how to build the
 

393
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,129
library I don't know how to build the
library really I looked I did a Google

394
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:10,139
library really I looked I did a Google
 

395
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,379
library really I looked I did a Google
image search for libraries and nothing

396
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:12,389
image search for libraries and nothing
 

397
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,660
image search for libraries and nothing
really stood out to me like I gotta

398
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:14,670
really stood out to me like I gotta
 

399
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,449
really stood out to me like I gotta
build this so we're probably gonna make

400
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:17,459
build this so we're probably gonna make
 

401
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,030
build this so we're probably gonna make
something a little weird here and that's

402
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,040
something a little weird here and that's
 

403
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,489
something a little weird here and that's
just oh you know what I never grabbed as

404
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:22,499
just oh you know what I never grabbed as
 

405
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:28,280
just oh you know what I never grabbed as
my wool I'll be right back so what I'm

406
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,290
my wool I'll be right back so what I'm
 

407
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,429
my wool I'll be right back so what I'm
kind of planning with this is like

408
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:30,439
kind of planning with this is like
 

409
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:33,769
kind of planning with this is like
staircase entrance with an archway over

410
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:33,779
staircase entrance with an archway over
 

411
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,549
staircase entrance with an archway over
top you know I love my arches and like

412
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:37,559
top you know I love my arches and like
 

413
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,259
top you know I love my arches and like
two big windows one on the left one on

414
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:39,269
two big windows one on the left one on
 

415
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:42,319
two big windows one on the left one on
the right with like support columns and

416
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:42,329
the right with like support columns and
 

417
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,509
the right with like support columns and
that sort of thing I want to try to use

418
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:44,519
that sort of thing I want to try to use
 

419
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,269
that sort of thing I want to try to use
a clay for around the windows I've done

420
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
a clay for around the windows I've done
 

421
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,840
a clay for around the windows I've done
that before and it looks really good and

422
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:49,850
that before and it looks really good and
 

423
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:56,659
that before and it looks really good and
maybe maybe a path yeah let's do the

424
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:56,669
maybe maybe a path yeah let's do the
 

425
00:12:56,669 --> 00:13:00,590
maybe maybe a path yeah let's do the
stairs out of quartz so we will have a

426
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:00,600
stairs out of quartz so we will have a
 

427
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,679
stairs out of quartz so we will have a
path that goes up to the library and we

428
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:03,689
path that goes up to the library and we
 

429
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:08,679
path that goes up to the library and we
will start that I guess just over here

430
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:08,689
will start that I guess just over here
 

431
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:13,119
will start that I guess just over here
I don't know exactly where's the best

432
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:13,129
I don't know exactly where's the best
 

433
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:17,559
I don't know exactly where's the best
place for it but this will do yeah this

434
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:17,569
place for it but this will do yeah this
 

435
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:19,629
place for it but this will do yeah this
was courts actually wait let's do that

436
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:19,639
was courts actually wait let's do that
 

437
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:27,369
was courts actually wait let's do that
pattern get a pattern going um we'll

438
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:27,379
pattern get a pattern going um we'll
 

439
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,779
pattern get a pattern going um we'll
just do the checkered one I like that

440
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:28,789
just do the checkered one I like that
 

441
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:38,109
just do the checkered one I like that
one whoa oh I don't know what happen

442
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:38,119
one whoa oh I don't know what happen
 

443
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,299
one whoa oh I don't know what happen
there is just I like clicked once and my

444
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:40,309
there is just I like clicked once and my
 

445
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:45,129
there is just I like clicked once and my
game froze and placed a bunch all right

446
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:45,139
game froze and placed a bunch all right
 

447
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,729
game froze and placed a bunch all right
so I am I don't usually use wool in my

448
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:48,739
so I am I don't usually use wool in my
 

449
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:51,819
so I am I don't usually use wool in my
builds but you know if you have just one

450
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:51,829
builds but you know if you have just one
 

451
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:54,879
builds but you know if you have just one
color it can do a whole lot especially

452
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:54,889
color it can do a whole lot especially
 

453
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:56,979
color it can do a whole lot especially
like I like building with stone bricks a

454
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:56,989
like I like building with stone bricks a
 

455
00:13:56,989 --> 00:14:00,279
like I like building with stone bricks a
lot and like gray color stuff and if you

456
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:00,289
lot and like gray color stuff and if you
 

457
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:02,349
lot and like gray color stuff and if you
don't have one thing with color and it

458
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:02,359
don't have one thing with color and it
 

459
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:04,779
don't have one thing with color and it
doesn't really work so that's what I'm

460
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:04,789
doesn't really work so that's what I'm
 

461
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:07,449
doesn't really work so that's what I'm
hoping the rule is gonna do and we're

462
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:07,459
hoping the rule is gonna do and we're
 

463
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:10,899
hoping the rule is gonna do and we're
gonna try carry the blue or the cyan

464
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:10,909
gonna try carry the blue or the cyan
 

465
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:13,499
gonna try carry the blue or the cyan
we'll look throughout the build so let's

466
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:13,509
we'll look throughout the build so let's
 

467
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:16,629
we'll look throughout the build so let's
let's try put it around the outside here

468
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
let's try put it around the outside here
 

469
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,369
let's try put it around the outside here
which actually works good because if you

470
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:18,379
which actually works good because if you
 

471
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,739
which actually works good because if you
think about the mountain grass is sort

472
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:20,749
think about the mountain grass is sort
 

473
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:24,009
think about the mountain grass is sort
of bluish tinged so maybe that maybe

474
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:24,019
of bluish tinged so maybe that maybe
 

475
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:29,339
of bluish tinged so maybe that maybe
this isn't a terrible idea

476
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:29,349

 

477
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:33,059

it's it's gonna be a weird library

478
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:33,069
it's it's gonna be a weird library
 

479
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:39,969
it's it's gonna be a weird library
alright arch let's do the arch going it

480
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:39,979
alright arch let's do the arch going it
 

481
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:43,210
alright arch let's do the arch going it
will make it go over top here or right

482
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:43,220
will make it go over top here or right
 

483
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,369
will make it go over top here or right
mmm

484
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:44,379
mmm
 

485
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:49,829
mmm
foundation how about a foundation let's

486
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839

 

487
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:57,569

how does it look if we do this get this

488
00:14:57,569 --> 00:14:57,579
how does it look if we do this get this
 

489
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:02,319
how does it look if we do this get this
top and I feel like we can't have the

490
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:02,329
top and I feel like we can't have the
 

491
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:04,239
top and I feel like we can't have the
wool on the ground though so if we do

492
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:04,249
wool on the ground though so if we do
 

493
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:10,090
wool on the ground though so if we do
that

494
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,100

 

495
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:18,829

hmm maybe maybe maybe let's maybe move

496
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:18,839
hmm maybe maybe maybe let's maybe move
 

497
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:28,430
hmm maybe maybe maybe let's maybe move
this arch back then okay uh see I'm

498
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:28,440
this arch back then okay uh see I'm
 

499
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
this arch back then okay uh see I'm
tempted sometimes to plant stuff more so

500
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,450
tempted sometimes to plant stuff more so
 

501
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,930
tempted sometimes to plant stuff more so
in creative and just copy it but I'd

502
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:32,940
in creative and just copy it but I'd
 

503
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,420
in creative and just copy it but I'd
love it on the other hand then there's

504
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,430
love it on the other hand then there's
 

505
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:40,160
love it on the other hand then there's
no spot Nate spot I'm not gonna be able

506
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,170
no spot Nate spot I'm not gonna be able
 

507
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,500
no spot Nate spot I'm not gonna be able
to say the word spontaneity no that's

508
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:42,510
to say the word spontaneity no that's
 

509
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,670
to say the word spontaneity no that's
not the right way of saying it

510
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
not the right way of saying it
 

511
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,560
not the right way of saying it
oh why can't I say that word I know what

512
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:51,570
oh why can't I say that word I know what
 

513
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,100
oh why can't I say that word I know what
the word is I just can't see it now

514
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,110
the word is I just can't see it now
 

515
00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:01,100
the word is I just can't see it now
how's that look let's get a stair here

516
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,110
how's that look let's get a stair here
 

517
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:07,730
how's that look let's get a stair here
one there and then yeah we'll make a

518
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:07,740
one there and then yeah we'll make a
 

519
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,650
one there and then yeah we'll make a
quartz staircase that starts going up

520
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:09,660
quartz staircase that starts going up
 

521
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,940
quartz staircase that starts going up
here where should we start the actual

522
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:13,950
here where should we start the actual
 

523
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,769
here where should we start the actual
walls to this thing it's the next

524
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:15,779
walls to this thing it's the next
 

525
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:24,860
walls to this thing it's the next
question hmm maybe this type of arch a

526
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:24,870
question hmm maybe this type of arch a
 

527
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:30,980
question hmm maybe this type of arch a
little smoother

528
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:30,990

 

529
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,630

yeah that's better okay the windows and

530
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:35,640
yeah that's better okay the windows and
 

531
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:44,960
yeah that's better okay the windows and
the walls let's let's start those ah you

532
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:44,970
the walls let's let's start those ah you
 

533
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,040
the walls let's let's start those ah you
know what I kind of think we should move

534
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,050
know what I kind of think we should move
 

535
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:51,910
know what I kind of think we should move
that arch back one more like over here

536
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:51,920

 

537
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,900

one second all right we can always

538
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:56,910
one second all right we can always
 

539
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,240
one second all right we can always
adjust it again later if we need to but

540
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,250
adjust it again later if we need to but
 

541
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,540
adjust it again later if we need to but
what I've tried before and creative is I

542
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:02,550
what I've tried before and creative is I
 

543
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,600
what I've tried before and creative is I
had like a stone brick slab in front of

544
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:05,610
had like a stone brick slab in front of
 

545
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,560
had like a stone brick slab in front of
a clay block window and it looked really

546
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:09,570
a clay block window and it looked really
 

547
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:18,650
a clay block window and it looked really
cool like let's just do this let's maybe

548
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:18,660
cool like let's just do this let's maybe
 

549
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,270
cool like let's just do this let's maybe
one more we'll try that so you have like

550
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
one more we'll try that so you have like
 

551
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,890
one more we'll try that so you have like
clay blocks running down but you can

552
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:27,900
clay blocks running down but you can
 

553
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,730
clay blocks running down but you can
only see the top half like that and

554
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:33,740
only see the top half like that and
 

555
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,030
only see the top half like that and
we'll have maybe let's the strike courts

556
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,040
we'll have maybe let's the strike courts
 

557
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,390
we'll have maybe let's the strike courts
for this as a border we'll probably have

558
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:41,400
for this as a border we'll probably have
 

559
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,740
for this as a border we'll probably have
to change that though or like a

560
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:45,750
to change that though or like a
 

561
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,890
to change that though or like a
transition to the clay block one two

562
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:48,900
transition to the clay block one two
 

563
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:56,210
transition to the clay block one two
three four run along the top as well and

564
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:56,220
three four run along the top as well and
 

565
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,620
three four run along the top as well and
then we'll put these slabs at the top as

566
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:00,630
then we'll put these slabs at the top as
 

567
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,240
then we'll put these slabs at the top as
well then what I would like to do is

568
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,250
well then what I would like to do is
 

569
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,480
well then what I would like to do is
kind of have overhang balcony type thing

570
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:08,490
kind of have overhang balcony type thing
 

571
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,570
kind of have overhang balcony type thing
above like what I'm placing right now if

572
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:11,580
above like what I'm placing right now if
 

573
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,940
above like what I'm placing right now if
that works out kind of like that and I

574
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:16,950
that works out kind of like that and I
 

575
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:22,910
that works out kind of like that and I
also used this stuff to hide the clay on

576
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:22,920
also used this stuff to hide the clay on
 

577
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,150
also used this stuff to hide the clay on
like the vertical clay blocks a little

578
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
like the vertical clay blocks a little
 

579
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:33,650
like the vertical clay blocks a little
bit like like that okay and window

580
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:33,660
bit like like that okay and window
 

581
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:41,630
bit like like that okay and window
windowpane we will put over here getting

582
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:41,640
windowpane we will put over here getting
 

583
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,280
windowpane we will put over here getting
close to the edge of the world here

584
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,290
close to the edge of the world here
 

585
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,370
close to the edge of the world here
I might not have enough space for this

586
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:47,380
I might not have enough space for this
 

587
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:59,850
I might not have enough space for this
build will see and yet let's just go

588
00:18:59,850 --> 00:18:59,860
build will see and yet let's just go
 

589
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:07,160
build will see and yet let's just go
take a nap here quick nap power nap and

590
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,170

 

591
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,110

yeah I guess I'll just build this

592
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
yeah I guess I'll just build this
 

593
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,750
yeah I guess I'll just build this
building one side and then at the time

594
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:12,760
building one side and then at the time
 

595
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,750
building one side and then at the time
and then do the other side off-camera

596
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760
and then do the other side off-camera
 

597
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,890
and then do the other side off-camera
cuz it'll just be a copy okay we'll move

598
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:21,900
cuz it'll just be a copy okay we'll move
 

599
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:29,880
cuz it'll just be a copy okay we'll move
or we'll put this here how far do we

600
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:29,890
or we'll put this here how far do we
 

601
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,460
or we'll put this here how far do we
want it to extend like I wanted one it

602
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:32,470
want it to extend like I wanted one it
 

603
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,490
want it to extend like I wanted one it
calms as well actually if we brought

604
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:35,500
calms as well actually if we brought
 

605
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,410
calms as well actually if we brought
this out one more block that might be

606
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:37,420
this out one more block that might be
 

607
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:43,080
this out one more block that might be
better and have like that there make

608
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,090
better and have like that there make
 

609
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,430
better and have like that there make
this come up and then the block there

610
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
this come up and then the block there
 

611
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,190
this come up and then the block there
and we'll do that every fourth block to

612
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
and we'll do that every fourth block to
 

613
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,890
and we'll do that every fourth block to
break it in two three wide sections I

614
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:57,900
break it in two three wide sections I
 

615
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:05,580
break it in two three wide sections I
felt down where's that over here we'll

616
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:05,590
felt down where's that over here we'll
 

617
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,200
felt down where's that over here we'll
try this out a little take a step back

618
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,210
try this out a little take a step back
 

619
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:12,690
try this out a little take a step back
and to see what it looks like and if I'm

620
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:12,700
and to see what it looks like and if I'm
 

621
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,460
and to see what it looks like and if I'm
getting too carried away with one type

622
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:14,470
getting too carried away with one type
 

623
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,050
getting too carried away with one type
of lock let me know like I might did a

624
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,060
of lock let me know like I might did a
 

625
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,450
of lock let me know like I might did a
little overboard with the wall or

626
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:18,460
little overboard with the wall or
 

627
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,000
little overboard with the wall or
something as I'm building this I'm nuts

628
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,010
something as I'm building this I'm nuts
 

629
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,540
something as I'm building this I'm nuts
I'm not really good at judging looks of

630
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:24,550
I'm not really good at judging looks of
 

631
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:29,580
I'm not really good at judging looks of
stuff okay that's cool and we'll bring

632
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:29,590
stuff okay that's cool and we'll bring
 

633
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:38,000
stuff okay that's cool and we'll bring
these slabs out a bit more like so and

634
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,010
these slabs out a bit more like so and
 

635
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:45,840
these slabs out a bit more like so and
we should go maybe one more column I'm

636
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:45,850
we should go maybe one more column I'm
 

637
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,340
we should go maybe one more column I'm
going to extend this a little bit more

638
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:47,350
going to extend this a little bit more
 

639
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,900
going to extend this a little bit more
off camera one second again alright well

640
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:51,910
off camera one second again alright well
 

641
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,630
off camera one second again alright well
I tried putting these stairs in front of

642
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:54,640
I tried putting these stairs in front of
 

643
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,120
I tried putting these stairs in front of
the wall for the foundation and that I

644
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,130
the wall for the foundation and that I
 

645
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,060
the wall for the foundation and that I
actually really liked

646
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,070
actually really liked
 

647
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,470
actually really liked
the look of that so we're gonna keep

648
00:20:59,470 --> 00:20:59,480
the look of that so we're gonna keep
 

649
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,790
the look of that so we're gonna keep
that this Court's it's definitely not

650
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:03,800
that this Court's it's definitely not
 

651
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,260
that this Court's it's definitely not
working so we're getting rid of that I

652
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:05,270
working so we're getting rid of that I
 

653
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:09,790
working so we're getting rid of that I
tried stone brick it's it's kind of okay

654
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:09,800
tried stone brick it's it's kind of okay
 

655
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,180
tried stone brick it's it's kind of okay
I also wanted to try these stone slabs

656
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,190
I also wanted to try these stone slabs
 

657
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,950
I also wanted to try these stone slabs
although I'm kind of scared to introduce

658
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
although I'm kind of scared to introduce
 

659
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,830
although I'm kind of scared to introduce
a new type block but when you got so

660
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
a new type block but when you got so
 

661
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,180
a new type block but when you got so
many different ones maybe it doesn't

662
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,190
many different ones maybe it doesn't
 

663
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,350
many different ones maybe it doesn't
matter anyway let's just see what this

664
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
matter anyway let's just see what this
 

665
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:35,950
matter anyway let's just see what this
looks like maybe maybe maybe the other

666
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:35,960
looks like maybe maybe maybe the other
 

667
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,950
looks like maybe maybe maybe the other
idea I had is bear with me this might be

668
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
idea I had is bear with me this might be
 

669
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,260
idea I had is bear with me this might be
a bit crazy

670
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:40,270
a bit crazy
 

671
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,670
a bit crazy
instead of having stone brick there we

672
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:42,680
instead of having stone brick there we
 

673
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:50,230
instead of having stone brick there we
put wool there give it more color make

674
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
put wool there give it more color make
 

675
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,160
put wool there give it more color make
it stand out quite a bit more although I

676
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,170
it stand out quite a bit more although I
 

677
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,170
it stand out quite a bit more although I
think then we have to put some more

678
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:56,180
think then we have to put some more
 

679
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:06,400
think then we have to put some more
slabs in front of the wool to hide that

680
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,410

 

681
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,890

yeah that could be cool let's let's try

682
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:09,900
yeah that could be cool let's let's try
 

683
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,230
yeah that could be cool let's let's try
this out let's put some more slabs or we

684
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240
this out let's put some more slabs or we
 

685
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,850
this out let's put some more slabs or we
could move the columns back as another

686
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:13,860
could move the columns back as another
 

687
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:20,150
could move the columns back as another
option that way you only see half of the

688
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,160
option that way you only see half of the
 

689
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,560
option that way you only see half of the
wool block if you see the full wool

690
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:21,570
wool block if you see the full wool
 

691
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:32,320
wool block if you see the full wool
block on the top it doesn't look right

692
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,330

 

693
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:38,960

hmm maybe maybe okay staircase let's

694
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:38,970
hmm maybe maybe okay staircase let's
 

695
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,790
hmm maybe maybe okay staircase let's
work on the staircase some we will I

696
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:42,800
work on the staircase some we will I
 

697
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,050
work on the staircase some we will I
made the court stairs already I think

698
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:45,060
made the court stairs already I think
 

699
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,350
made the court stairs already I think
what we should do is have a mix of the

700
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:48,360
what we should do is have a mix of the
 

701
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,230
what we should do is have a mix of the
stone stone brick stairs and court

702
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:51,240
stone stone brick stairs and court
 

703
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:59,470
stone stone brick stairs and court
stairs and we'll start it maybe here

704
00:22:59,470 --> 00:22:59,480

 

705
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,510

yeah we'll try there first no let's

706
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:02,520
yeah we'll try there first no let's
 

707
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,780
yeah we'll try there first no let's
let's move it back one more we'll start

708
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:05,790
let's move it back one more we'll start
 

709
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,410
let's move it back one more we'll start
it here and it will go up kind of like

710
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:09,420
it here and it will go up kind of like
 

711
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:18,770
it here and it will go up kind of like
this let's get some ease this is all

712
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:18,780
this let's get some ease this is all
 

713
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,330
this let's get some ease this is all
experimental if we don't like something

714
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:20,340
experimental if we don't like something
 

715
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,570
experimental if we don't like something
we can change it I know that's that's

716
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:23,580
we can change it I know that's that's
 

717
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,920
we can change it I know that's that's
way too close we got to move that back

718
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:26,930
way too close we got to move that back
 

719
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,090
way too close we got to move that back
okay and then we're gonna put the quartz

720
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:29,100
okay and then we're gonna put the quartz
 

721
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,750
okay and then we're gonna put the quartz
stairs in between one stair back sort of

722
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:32,760
stairs in between one stair back sort of
 

723
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:43,310
stairs in between one stair back sort of
thing like that so pretty cool okay

724
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,320
thing like that so pretty cool okay
 

725
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,560
thing like that so pretty cool okay
let's just take a step back and see what

726
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:45,570
let's just take a step back and see what
 

727
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:53,050
let's just take a step back and see what
that looks like yeah I like that

728
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:53,060
that looks like yeah I like that
 

729
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,700
that looks like yeah I like that
maybe I'll miss a little bit more off

730
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:55,710
maybe I'll miss a little bit more off
 

731
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,840
maybe I'll miss a little bit more off
camera here

732
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:56,850
camera here
 

733
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:02,450
camera here
see where that gets us okay well I did a

734
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:02,460
see where that gets us okay well I did a
 

735
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,280
see where that gets us okay well I did a
little bit more here and I duplicated it

736
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,290
little bit more here and I duplicated it
 

737
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,370
little bit more here and I duplicated it
on the other side we'll probably have to

738
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:07,380
on the other side we'll probably have to
 

739
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,740
on the other side we'll probably have to
leave it at this for today we got a bit

740
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:09,750
leave it at this for today we got a bit
 

741
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,890
leave it at this for today we got a bit
done anyway now I tried I tried

742
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:12,900
done anyway now I tried I tried
 

743
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,290
done anyway now I tried I tried
mirroring this at the top and I think

744
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:15,300
mirroring this at the top and I think
 

745
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,380
mirroring this at the top and I think
that's too much wool now

746
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:18,390
that's too much wool now
 

747
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:24,170
that's too much wool now
possibly one thing we could do is use

748
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:24,180
possibly one thing we could do is use
 

749
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,800
possibly one thing we could do is use
quartz blocks at the top there see we

750
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:27,810
quartz blocks at the top there see we
 

751
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,150
quartz blocks at the top there see we
got to get lighting in here somehow

752
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:29,160
got to get lighting in here somehow
 

753
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,270
got to get lighting in here somehow
other things so I thought about putting

754
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:31,280
other things so I thought about putting
 

755
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,390
other things so I thought about putting
glowstone there but then we need block

756
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:35,400
glowstone there but then we need block
 

757
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,830
glowstone there but then we need block
thickness at least up there cuz I wanted

758
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
thickness at least up there cuz I wanted
 

759
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,540
thickness at least up there cuz I wanted
that to be like the balcony or the the

760
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:41,550
that to be like the balcony or the the
 

761
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,240
that to be like the balcony or the the
an area you could go to look down you

762
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,250
an area you could go to look down you
 

763
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,350
an area you could go to look down you
know and this works if we have like a

764
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:48,360
know and this works if we have like a
 

765
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,240
know and this works if we have like a
half slab here it can cover up

766
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,250
half slab here it can cover up
 

767
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:55,040
half slab here it can cover up
everything we have here and if we walk

768
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,050
everything we have here and if we walk
 

769
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,990
everything we have here and if we walk
forward we don't fall off we even have a

770
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,000
forward we don't fall off we even have a
 

771
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,400
forward we don't fall off we even have a
better view actually so could be a good

772
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,410
better view actually so could be a good
 

773
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,340
better view actually so could be a good
idea anyway if you guys have ideas let

774
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:04,350
idea anyway if you guys have ideas let
 

775
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,550
idea anyway if you guys have ideas let
me know hopefully you don't think it's

776
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:07,560
me know hopefully you don't think it's
 

777
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,520
me know hopefully you don't think it's
too hideous I have weird tastes I

778
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:10,530
too hideous I have weird tastes I
 

779
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:15,230
too hideous I have weird tastes I
actually like this build but that's just

780
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:15,240
actually like this build but that's just
 

781
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,090
actually like this build but that's just
me so far anyway okay let's go read some

me so far anyway okay let's go read some
 

783
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,410
me so far anyway okay let's go read some

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,000
nine books each perhaps
 

793
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,880
nine books each perhaps
so there is a trick you can do you can

794
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:37,890
so there is a trick you can do you can
 

795
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,430
so there is a trick you can do you can
push a storage minecart into a bookshelf

796
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:40,440
push a storage minecart into a bookshelf
 

797
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,930
push a storage minecart into a bookshelf
and then when you right-click the

798
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:41,940
and then when you right-click the
 

799
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,110
and then when you right-click the
bookshelf block it accesses a minecart

800
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120
bookshelf block it accesses a minecart
 

801
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,660
bookshelf block it accesses a minecart
and you don't actually see the minecart

802
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:47,670
and you don't actually see the minecart
 

803
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,660
and you don't actually see the minecart
you just use Pistons push it into place

804
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:50,670
you just use Pistons push it into place
 

805
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:55,160
you just use Pistons push it into place
that's one way you can do it the reason

806
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,170
that's one way you can do it the reason
 

807
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,650
that's one way you can do it the reason
why they wouldn't do that normally in

808
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:57,660
why they wouldn't do that normally in
 

809
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,430
why they wouldn't do that normally in
Minecraft like the downside of of them

810
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,440
Minecraft like the downside of of them
 

811
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,460
Minecraft like the downside of of them
doing that is then they gotta save it as

812
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:04,470
doing that is then they gotta save it as
 

813
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,280
doing that is then they gotta save it as
a tile entity in the world file which

814
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,290
a tile entity in the world file which
 

815
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:11,810
a tile entity in the world file which
you know increases data and all that and

816
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:11,820
you know increases data and all that and
 

817
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,000
you know increases data and all that and
most people use it for decoration so if

818
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,010
most people use it for decoration so if
 

819
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,920
most people use it for decoration so if
you have hundreds or thousands of them

820
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:15,930
you have hundreds or thousands of them
 

821
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,450
you have hundreds or thousands of them
in your world that's that's a big

822
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:19,460
in your world that's that's a big
 

823
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,800
in your world that's that's a big
overhang you know for something you're

824
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:21,810
overhang you know for something you're
 

825
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,299
overhang you know for something you're
not actually

826
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:23,309
not actually
 

827
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:25,890
not actually
so that's that's kind of the reasoning

828
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:25,900
so that's that's kind of the reasoning
 

829
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,150
so that's that's kind of the reasoning
behind it I believe but anyway that is

830
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,160
behind it I believe but anyway that is
 

831
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,010
behind it I believe but anyway that is
