excited about it as well like with the
new bubble streams you can float

24
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,140
new bubble streams you can float
 

25
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,160
new bubble streams you can float
minecarts in them you can floats anvils

26
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,170

really hurt the projectiles the hope was

32
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,030
really hurt the projectiles the hope was

that we could throw an ender pearl and

34
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:46,739
that we could throw an ender pearl and
 

35
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,619
that we could throw an ender pearl and
have it just float float in the bubble

36
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:48,629
have it just float float in the bubble
 

37
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,959
have it just float float in the bubble
stream but it behaves just like it's

38
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:53,969
stream but it behaves just like it's
 

39
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,260
stream but it behaves just like it's
slowed down still but it it goes up and

40
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:57,270
slowed down still but it it goes up and
 

41
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,720
slowed down still but it it goes up and
it just comes straight down so maybe

42
00:00:59,720 --> 00:00:59,730
it just comes straight down so maybe
 

43
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,250
it just comes straight down so maybe
I'll show you guys the old design here

44
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,260
I'll show you guys the old design here
 

45
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,569
I'll show you guys the old design here
too I played around with this a little

46

too I played around with this a little
 

47
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,830
too I played around with this a little
bit to see if I could get it working

48
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
bit to see if I could get it working
 

49
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,160
bit to see if I could get it working
today again but doesn't seem like it's

50
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,170
today again but doesn't seem like it's
 

51

00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840
the sound turned down a little bit it
 

57
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,539
the sound turned down a little bit it
causes an incredible amount of leg

58

we got the slime block going up and down

64
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,110
we got the slime block going up and down
 

65
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,100
we got the slime block going up and down
repeatedly and you would throw an ender

66
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,110
repeatedly and you would throw an ender

the water slows it down so that it'll

the water slows it down so that it'll

the water slows it down so that it'll
hopefully bounce off the slime

72
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:34,430
hopefully bounce off the slime
 

73
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,130

looking for I was supposed to do this

78
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,210
looking for I was supposed to do this
 

79
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,539
looking for I was supposed to do this
off camera I forgot okay got a make a

80
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:44,549
off camera I forgot okay got a make a
 

81
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,179
off camera I forgot okay got a make a
sign but I did figure out how to get it

82
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:47,189
sign but I did figure out how to get it
 

83
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,510
sign but I did figure out how to get it
working again today I'm just gonna make

84
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:50,520
working again today I'm just gonna make
 

85
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,590
working again today I'm just gonna make
a slight adjustment to its basically we

86
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:54,600
a slight adjustment to its basically we
 

87
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,389
a slight adjustment to its basically we
need likes something to hold the water

88
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
need likes something to hold the water
 

89
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,530
need likes something to hold the water
in here

90
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:58,540
in here
 

91
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,590
in here
and then a sign here so that the water

92
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
and then a sign here so that the water
 

93
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,350
and then a sign here so that the water
doesn't try to flow down ever and if we

94
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:04,360
doesn't try to flow down ever and if we
 

95
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,750
doesn't try to flow down ever and if we
do that then I was able to get to and

96
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:06,760
do that then I was able to get to and
 

97
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,040
do that then I was able to get to and
repel suspended still enough that

98
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,050
repel suspended still enough that
 

99
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,350
repel suspended still enough that
happens every time that time it failed

100
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360

 

101
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:24,060

let's try again oh oh look at that so we

102
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,070
let's try again oh oh look at that so we
 

103
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,370
let's try again oh oh look at that so we
got a bouncing enderpearl there and the

104
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:26,380
got a bouncing enderpearl there and the
 

105
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,070
got a bouncing enderpearl there and the
idea is like you can activate this

106
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:29,080
idea is like you can activate this
 

107
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,900
idea is like you can activate this
piston here and it'll shoot the

108
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:30,910
piston here and it'll shoot the
 

109
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,030
piston here and it'll shoot the
enderpearl sideways the slime will

110
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
enderpearl sideways the slime will
 

111
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
enderpearl sideways the slime will
bounce it this way and then it'll it'll

112
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:34,810
bounce it this way and then it'll it'll
 

113
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,060
bounce it this way and then it'll it'll
hit something right and then you

114
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,070
hit something right and then you
 

115
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,850
hit something right and then you
teleport there so we have these a couple

116
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:38,860
teleport there so we have these a couple
 

117
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,260
teleport there so we have these a couple
of these built in the world I think we

118
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:40,270
of these built in the world I think we
 

119
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,100
of these built in the world I think we
made three of them and you hit the

120
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,110
made three of them and you hit the
 

121
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,240
made three of them and you hit the
button here and it takes you to the

122
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,250
button here and it takes you to the
 

123
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,280
button here and it takes you to the
Nexus like it activates the one at the

124
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,290
Nexus like it activates the one at the
 

125
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,870
Nexus like it activates the one at the
Nexus and then we get teleported there

126
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:48,880
Nexus and then we get teleported there
 

127
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,030
Nexus and then we get teleported there
or we hit this one and it teleports us

128
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
or we hit this one and it teleports us
 

129
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,340
or we hit this one and it teleports us
to the man cave a couple hundred blocks

130
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,350
to the man cave a couple hundred blocks
 

131
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,290
to the man cave a couple hundred blocks
that way all right

132
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:55,300
that way all right
 

133
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,210
that way all right
the issue is just to clarify cuz you

134
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:00,220
the issue is just to clarify cuz you
 

135
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,710
the issue is just to clarify cuz you
know I had this built I thought it was

136
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:01,720
know I had this built I thought it was
 

137
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,229
know I had this built I thought it was
really good and stuff and then I had

138
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
really good and stuff and then I had
 

139
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,729
really good and stuff and then I had
issues when I would go through the

140
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:05,739
issues when I would go through the
 

141
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,170
issues when I would go through the
nether through the nether portal and

142
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:07,180
nether through the nether portal and
 

143
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,660
nether through the nether portal and
come back or if I sometimes when the

144
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:09,670
come back or if I sometimes when the
 

145
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,920
come back or if I sometimes when the
chunks with unload and reload just by

146
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:12,930
chunks with unload and reload just by
 

147
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,979
chunks with unload and reload just by
going away from it then coming back then

148
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:16,989
going away from it then coming back then
 

149
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,900
going away from it then coming back then
sometimes the ender pearl will just

150
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:18,910
sometimes the ender pearl will just
 

151
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,570
sometimes the ender pearl will just
randomly land even though it's not

152
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:21,580
randomly land even though it's not
 

153
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,410
randomly land even though it's not
supposed to might happen here it's

154
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:25,420
supposed to might happen here it's
 

155
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,210
supposed to might happen here it's
loading in no no it's fine

156
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:27,220
loading in no no it's fine
 

157
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,039
loading in no no it's fine
doesn't happen every time just if it's

158
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,049
doesn't happen every time just if it's
 

159
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:33,660
doesn't happen every time just if it's
in the right position I guess but yeah

160
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:33,670
in the right position I guess but yeah
 

161
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,610
in the right position I guess but yeah
if the chunks unload and then reload

162
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:35,620
if the chunks unload and then reload
 

163
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,710
if the chunks unload and then reload
that's that's the issue I was hoping the

164
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:37,720

to be honest I didn't care about the

564
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:52,660
to be honest I didn't care about the
 

565
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,440
to be honest I didn't care about the
fishing rod I just wanted this so I need

fishing rod I just wanted this so I need
 

567
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,360
fishing rod I just wanted this so I need
eight of those and then one part of the

568
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,370
eight of those and then one part of the
 

569
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:04,910
eight of those and then one part of the
scene aha

570
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:04,920
scene aha
 

571
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,670
scene aha
so I think I found it here guys I looked

572
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:08,680
so I think I found it here guys I looked
 

573
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,610
so I think I found it here guys I looked
in like 5,000 by 5,000 area and I think

574
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:11,620
in like 5,000 by 5,000 area and I think
 

575
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,940
in like 5,000 by 5,000 area and I think
this is the best spot I found to set up

576
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:14,950
this is the best spot I found to set up
 

577
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,540
this is the best spot I found to set up
a base it's it's pretty good what I want

578
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:18,550
a base it's it's pretty good what I want
 

579
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,640
a base it's it's pretty good what I want
doesn't really exist I don't think but

580
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:20,650
doesn't really exist I don't think but
 

581
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,440
doesn't really exist I don't think but
this is as close as I'm gonna get to it

582
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,450
this is as close as I'm gonna get to it
 

583
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,950
this is as close as I'm gonna get to it
probably I have certain criteria I'm

584
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:25,960
probably I have certain criteria I'm
 

585
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
probably I have certain criteria I'm
looking for like I would really like to

586
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:27,970
looking for like I would really like to
 

587
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,850
looking for like I would really like to
set up in a coral reef here we got a

588
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:29,860
set up in a coral reef here we got a
 

589
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,640
set up in a coral reef here we got a
pretty decent sized one you got the nice

590
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:32,650
pretty decent sized one you got the nice
 

591
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,580
pretty decent sized one you got the nice
blue water here all the plant life and

592
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:35,590
blue water here all the plant life and
 

593
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,180
blue water here all the plant life and
stuff and the only problem with this is

594
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,190
stuff and the only problem with this is
 

595
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,460
stuff and the only problem with this is
it doesn't go very deep none of these go

596
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,470
it doesn't go very deep none of these go
 

597
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,370
it doesn't go very deep none of these go
very deep ideally I would like to set up

598
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:44,380
very deep ideally I would like to set up
 

599
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,810
very deep ideally I would like to set up
a base in one of these coral reefs

600
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:45,820
a base in one of these coral reefs
 

601
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,450
a base in one of these coral reefs
that's like it.why 30 and this only goes

602
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:48,460
that's like it.why 30 and this only goes
 

603
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,050
that's like it.why 30 and this only goes
down to

604
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:49,060
down to
 

605
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,230
down to
fifty-three rights so I don't think

606
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
fifty-three rights so I don't think
 

607
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,640
fifty-three rights so I don't think
we're actually gonna live in a coral

608
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:53,650
we're actually gonna live in a coral
 

609
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,220
we're actually gonna live in a coral
reef but we're gonna want to live beside

610
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,230
reef but we're gonna want to live beside
 

611
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,240
reef but we're gonna want to live beside
one we could live here but then I'd have

612
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,250
one we could live here but then I'd have
 

613
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,120
one we could live here but then I'd have
to do a lot of terraforming which is a

614
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,130
to do a lot of terraforming which is a
 

615
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,880
to do a lot of terraforming which is a
lot of work so I think the next best

616
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:05,890
lot of work so I think the next best
 

617
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:10,080
lot of work so I think the next best
option is to set up the side one in a

618
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,090
option is to set up the side one in a
 

619
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,950
option is to set up the side one in a
lukewarm ocean I marked the spot with

620
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:13,960
lukewarm ocean I marked the spot with
 

621
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,070
lukewarm ocean I marked the spot with
some yeah down over here people live

622
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,080
some yeah down over here people live
 

623
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,640
some yeah down over here people live
somewhere around here so you'll notice

624
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:20,650
somewhere around here so you'll notice
 

625
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,770
somewhere around here so you'll notice
we go way down that was kind of at the

626
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:22,780
we go way down that was kind of at the
 

627
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,930
we go way down that was kind of at the
level of the coral reef and it goes way

628
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:24,940
level of the coral reef and it goes way
 

629
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,850
level of the coral reef and it goes way
down another like 10 to 20 blocks here

630
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:28,860
down another like 10 to 20 blocks here
 

631
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,710
down another like 10 to 20 blocks here
we're at Y 30 here which is about

632
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:31,720
we're at Y 30 here which is about
 

633
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,630
we're at Y 30 here which is about
perfect I would say you have the option

634
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:33,640
perfect I would say you have the option
 

635
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,390
perfect I would say you have the option
of going down more if you want or you

636
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:36,400
of going down more if you want or you
 

637
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,630
of going down more if you want or you
have like 30 blocks of water above you

638
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:39,640
have like 30 blocks of water above you
 

639
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,550
have like 30 blocks of water above you
so if you build tall towers or something

640
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:41,560
so if you build tall towers or something
 

641
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,270
so if you build tall towers or something
underwater it's gonna look good still

642
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:44,280
underwater it's gonna look good still
 

643
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,650
underwater it's gonna look good still
there's lots of boat wrecks I'm finding

644
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:46,660
there's lots of boat wrecks I'm finding
 

645
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,100
there's lots of boat wrecks I'm finding
tons of these things all over the place

646
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,110
tons of these things all over the place
 

647
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,020
tons of these things all over the place
we got the nice coral in the backgrounds

648
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,030
we got the nice coral in the backgrounds
 

649
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,540
we got the nice coral in the backgrounds
it's pretty flat too for building which

650
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:54,550
it's pretty flat too for building which
 

651
00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:00,360
it's pretty flat too for building which
is usually kind of nice but also another

652
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,370
is usually kind of nice but also another
 

653
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,660
is usually kind of nice but also another
important thing there is a guardian

654
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:03,670
important thing there is a guardian
 

655
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,420
important thing there is a guardian
temple right beside this too which is

656
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:06,430
temple right beside this too which is
 

657
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,160
temple right beside this too which is
pretty cool I don't want to set up base

658
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,170
pretty cool I don't want to set up base
 

659
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,840
pretty cool I don't want to set up base
at the Guardian temple I think the

660
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:09,850
at the Guardian temple I think the
 

661
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,330
at the Guardian temple I think the
guardians would get kind of annoying and

662
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:12,340
guardians would get kind of annoying and
 

663
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,460
guardians would get kind of annoying and
then if we build the farm for them you

664
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,470
then if we build the farm for them you
 

665
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,490
then if we build the farm for them you
won't get normal mobs very often I want

666
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:17,500
won't get normal mobs very often I want
 

667
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,270
won't get normal mobs very often I want
to have like a natural mob firm and then

668
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
to have like a natural mob firm and then
 

669
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,710
to have like a natural mob firm and then
if we go like a couple hundred blocks

670
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
if we go like a couple hundred blocks
 

671
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,240
if we go like a couple hundred blocks
that way then we'll get the the

672
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,250
that way then we'll get the the
 

673
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,600
that way then we'll get the the
guardians like maybe we'll build XP farm

674
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:27,610
guardians like maybe we'll build XP farm
 

675
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,360
guardians like maybe we'll build XP farm
over there in the future could be cool

676
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:30,370
over there in the future could be cool
 

677
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,490
over there in the future could be cool
but yeah I like this I like this area a

678
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:32,500
but yeah I like this I like this area a
 

679

lot one important thing why we want to

680
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,160
lot one important thing why we want to
 

681
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,970
lot one important thing why we want to
build near coral reef in the snapshot

682
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:38,980
build near coral reef in the snapshot
 

683
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,090
build near coral reef in the snapshot
that that's out right now that I'm using

684
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,100
that that's out right now that I'm using
 

685
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,750

31a you need the warm water to grow

686
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:45,760
31a you need the warm water to grow
 

687
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,660
31a you need the warm water to grow
corals you see that if you guys tried

688
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:48,670
corals you see that if you guys tried
 

689
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,970
corals you see that if you guys tried
that in the official release it's not

690
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:50,980
that in the official release it's not
 

691
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,870
that in the official release it's not
going to work not till the next update

692
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:53,880
going to work not till the next update
 

693
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,320
going to work not till the next update
but it doesn't work when you go to that

694
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,330
but it doesn't work when you go to that
 

695
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,920
but it doesn't work when you go to that
light this is deep lukewarm ocean

696
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:00,930
light this is deep lukewarm ocean
 

697
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,080
light this is deep lukewarm ocean
you get the kelp but you don't get the

698
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,090
you get the kelp but you don't get the
 

699
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,780
you get the kelp but you don't get the
coral so we're gonna need a coral biome

700
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:05,790
coral so we're gonna need a coral biome
 

701
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,200
coral so we're gonna need a coral biome
nearby possibly I think in the future

702
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,210
nearby possibly I think in the future
 

703
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,730
nearby possibly I think in the future
I'm surprised they didn't do this

704
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:10,740
I'm surprised they didn't do this
 

705
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:16,420
I'm surprised they didn't do this
actually they're gonna change it so that

706
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:16,430

 

707
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,710

this is just a hunch of mine I think

708
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:18,720
this is just a hunch of mine I think
 

709
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,110
this is just a hunch of mine I think
like even harvest these with with silt

710
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
like even harvest these with with silt
 

711
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,910
like even harvest these with with silt
that's right

712
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:21,920
that's right
 

713
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,310
that's right
so we inform them I kind of thought we

714
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:25,320
so we inform them I kind of thought we
 

715
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,140
so we inform them I kind of thought we
would use these to craft the coral

716
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,150
would use these to craft the coral
 

717
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,070
would use these to craft the coral
blocks like these actual blocks here but

718
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,080
blocks like these actual blocks here but
 

719
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,080
blocks like these actual blocks here but
I don't think you can craft these not

720
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,090
I don't think you can craft these not
 

721
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,700
I don't think you can craft these not
yet anyway but maybe in the future

722
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:34,710
yet anyway but maybe in the future
 

723
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,070
yet anyway but maybe in the future
they'll change at where use the corals

724
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,080
they'll change at where use the corals
 

725
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,720
they'll change at where use the corals
to make them like maybe nine of these

726
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:38,730
to make them like maybe nine of these
 

727
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:48,290
to make them like maybe nine of these
will make a blue one oh I get it

alright guys well one thing we should

738
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:13,320
alright guys well one thing we should
 

739
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,720
alright guys well one thing we should
probably do right away here we're gonna

740
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:14,730
probably do right away here we're gonna
 

741
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,760
probably do right away here we're gonna
be working in this area a bunch right so

742
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:16,770
be working in this area a bunch right so
 

743
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,040
be working in this area a bunch right so
I decided to put a portal in one of

744
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,050
I decided to put a portal in one of
 

745
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,530
I decided to put a portal in one of
these coral structures and I modified it

746
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:21,540
these coral structures and I modified it
 

747
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,990
these coral structures and I modified it
slightly so I think the way to do this

748
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
slightly so I think the way to do this
 

749
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,550
slightly so I think the way to do this
we've got a block up the sides right and

750
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:28,560
we've got a block up the sides right and
 

751
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,390
we've got a block up the sides right and
like sandwich ourselves in and then

752
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
like sandwich ourselves in and then
 

753
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,450
like sandwich ourselves in and then
remove maybe one side and the other side

754
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:37,460

 

755
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,900

yeah that'll work

756
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:38,910
yeah that'll work
 

757
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:43,440
yeah that'll work
alright then we light it and break the

758
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:43,450
alright then we light it and break the
 

759
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,509
alright then we light it and break the
I think that should be good that looks

760
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:48,519
I think that should be good that looks
 

761
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:51,239
I think that should be good that looks
weird alright so we probably gotta fill

762
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:51,249
weird alright so we probably gotta fill
 

763
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:56,459
weird alright so we probably gotta fill
in the water - right it's not gonna put

764
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:56,469
in the water - right it's not gonna put
 

765
00:19:56,469 --> 00:19:59,940
in the water - right it's not gonna put
it out it's weird like the top part of

766
00:19:59,940 --> 00:19:59,950
it out it's weird like the top part of
 

767
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,440
it out it's weird like the top part of
it looks fine but this part not so much

768
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:03,450
it looks fine but this part not so much
 

769
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,519
it looks fine but this part not so much
all right let's see where it takes us in

770
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:05,529
all right let's see where it takes us in
 

771
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:08,069
all right let's see where it takes us in
the nether we got to link up to our ice

772
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:08,079
the nether we got to link up to our ice
 

773
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:10,830
the nether we got to link up to our ice
road now
