00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
i have good news the storage room is
 

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,709
i have good news the storage room is
basically

8
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
basically
 

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,950
basically
complete now i can comfortably say it's

00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:16,960
complete now i can comfortably say it's
 

11
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,750
complete now i can comfortably say it's
done

12
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,760

 

13
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,750

i would decide to go with pattern number

14
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
i would decide to go with pattern number
 

15
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,029
i would decide to go with pattern number

it was i believe the most voted one and

18
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
it was i believe the most voted one and
 

19
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,029
it was i believe the most voted one and
i have

20
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
i have
 

21
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,349
i have
come to like it myself as well the

22
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:29,359
come to like it myself as well the
 

23
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,710
come to like it myself as well the
creeper face was cool

24
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
creeper face was cool
 

25
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,790
creeper face was cool
except it looked a little bit empty in

26
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:32,800
except it looked a little bit empty in
 

27
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,310
except it looked a little bit empty in
this room

28
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
this room
 

29
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,670
this room
and uh i did like pattern one but i

30
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
and uh i did like pattern one but i
 

31
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,389
and uh i did like pattern one but i
think i

32
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
think i
 

33
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,190
think i
prefer this one now

34
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200

 

35
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,670

and good news we have fixed the

36
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
and good news we have fixed the
 

37
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,990
and good news we have fixed the
stairs or the shutters not opening and

38
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000
stairs or the shutters not opening and
 

39
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,670
stairs or the shutters not opening and
closing correctly

40
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
closing correctly
 

41
00:00:51,680 --> 00:01:00,310
closing correctly
it was a block updated issue after all

42
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320

 

43
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,990

now they all open together and close

44
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
now they all open together and close
 

45
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,270
now they all open together and close
together it's great

46
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
together it's great
 

47
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,750
together it's great
i have cleaned up the wiring room here

48
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
i have cleaned up the wiring room here
 

49
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,710
i have cleaned up the wiring room here
we'll go look at it very quickly

50
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
we'll go look at it very quickly
 

51
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,710
we'll go look at it very quickly
this is something i do now with my

52
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
this is something i do now with my
 

53
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,630
this is something i do now with my
redstone projects i like to put ladders

54
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
redstone projects i like to put ladders
 

55
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:16,950
redstone projects i like to put ladders
or

56
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:16,960
or
 

57
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,070
or
signs or something at the stairs like

58
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
signs or something at the stairs like
 

59
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,469
signs or something at the stairs like
this

60
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
this
 

61
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,950
this
in case i accidentally spill water it

62
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
in case i accidentally spill water it
 

63
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,149
in case i accidentally spill water it
won't wash

64
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
won't wash
 

65
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,870
won't wash
all my wiring away you know because i

66
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
all my wiring away you know because i
 

67
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,310
all my wiring away you know because i
tend to do that quite often

68
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320

 

69
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,510

but yeah so basically pistons are

70
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
but yeah so basically pistons are
 

71
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,710
but yeah so basically pistons are
underneath

72
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
underneath
 

73
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,670
underneath
this block here and this one here uh

74
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
this block here and this one here uh
 

75
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,670
this block here and this one here uh
before i had the repeaters on top these

76
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
before i had the repeaters on top these
 

77
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,270
before i had the repeaters on top these
blocks here

78
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
blocks here
 

79
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,710
blocks here
and they were sending power above

80
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
and they were sending power above
 

81
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,630
and they were sending power above
now we have them powering the pistons

82
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
now we have them powering the pistons
 

83
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,350
now we have them powering the pistons
from the side so there's no

84
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
from the side so there's no
 

85
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,030
from the side so there's no
diagonal powering issues

86
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
diagonal powering issues
 

87
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,630
diagonal powering issues
which was causing the problem i don't

88
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
which was causing the problem i don't
 

89
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,510
which was causing the problem i don't
know exactly well

90
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
know exactly well
 

91
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,910
know exactly well
yeah we still have that bug in the game

92
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
yeah we still have that bug in the game
 

93
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,789
yeah we still have that bug in the game
don't know exactly

94
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
don't know exactly
 

95
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,830
don't know exactly
what was going on i almost think it was

96
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840

 

97
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,710

like just steal this temporarily

98
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
like just steal this temporarily
 

99
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,670
like just steal this temporarily
i almost think like if this repeater was

100
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
i almost think like if this repeater was
 

101
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,229
i almost think like if this repeater was
powered

102
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
powered
 

103
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,670
powered
it was powering this block here well

104
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
it was powering this block here well
 

105
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,070
it was powering this block here well
this one here it was powering this block

106
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
this one here it was powering this block
 

107
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,830
this one here it was powering this block
and i think that was affecting the

108
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
and i think that was affecting the
 

109
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,430
and i think that was affecting the
piston diagonally like

110
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
piston diagonally like
 

111
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,550
piston diagonally like
like this not like diagonally from the

112
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
like this not like diagonally from the
 

113
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,830
like this not like diagonally from the
repeater

114
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
repeater
 

115
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,430
repeater
like that i think it was doing that as

116
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
like that i think it was doing that as
 

117
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,270
like that i think it was doing that as
well but i think you're doing

118
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
well but i think you're doing
 

119
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,589
well but i think you're doing
like that was the problem but i could be

120
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
like that was the problem but i could be
 

121
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,470
like that was the problem but i could be
wrong it was

122
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,480
wrong it was
 

123
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,190
wrong it was
i still only exactly understand why it

124
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
i still only exactly understand why it
 

125
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,550
i still only exactly understand why it
was doing

126
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
was doing
 

127
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,750
was doing
woohoo i wanted to go down anyway

128
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
woohoo i wanted to go down anyway
 

129
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,110
woohoo i wanted to go down anyway
i don't know exactly why it was doing

130
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
i don't know exactly why it was doing
 

131
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,229
i don't know exactly why it was doing
what it was doing because

132
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239

 

133
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,790

this this stair was opening before this

134
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
this this stair was opening before this
 

135
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,309
this this stair was opening before this
one even though this one had a longer

136
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
one even though this one had a longer
 

137
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,589
one even though this one had a longer
delay

138
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
delay
 

139
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,630
delay
with all uh block update issues i've had

140
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
with all uh block update issues i've had
 

141
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,229
with all uh block update issues i've had
with pistons usually

142
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
with pistons usually
 

143
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,750
with pistons usually
if there is a problem they will open

144
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
if there is a problem they will open
 

145
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,430
if there is a problem they will open
together

146
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
together
 

147
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,270
together
so i don't know exactly what was wrong

148
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
so i don't know exactly what was wrong
 

149
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,110
so i don't know exactly what was wrong
and i have also expanded over here

150
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
and i have also expanded over here
 

151
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,270
and i have also expanded over here
a little bit we're gonna round it out a

152
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
a little bit we're gonna round it out a
 

153
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,149
a little bit we're gonna round it out a
bit more

154
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159

 

155
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,309

i might just make a big deep hole there

156
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
i might just make a big deep hole there
 

157
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,830
i might just make a big deep hole there
i'm not sure

158
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
i'm not sure
 

159
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,470
i'm not sure
and i have moved

160
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480

 

161
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,750

this rail over one block

162
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
this rail over one block
 

163
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,830
this rail over one block
before it was over here and we're just

164
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
before it was over here and we're just
 

165
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,589
before it was over here and we're just
waiting for that grass to grow

166
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
waiting for that grass to grow
 

167
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,910
waiting for that grass to grow
i decided to light this part by putting

168
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
i decided to light this part by putting
 

169
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,110
i decided to light this part by putting
a pressure plate over

170
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
a pressure plate over
 

171
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,229
a pressure plate over
a glowing pumpkin and i'll probably do

172
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
a glowing pumpkin and i'll probably do
 

173
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,589
a glowing pumpkin and i'll probably do
that more often

174
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
that more often
 

175
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,270
that more often
there's another cool trick people have

176
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
there's another cool trick people have
 

177
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,270
there's another cool trick people have
been showing me too

178
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
been showing me too
 

179
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,830
been showing me too
do i have fences i do

180
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
do i have fences i do
 

181
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,830
do i have fences i do
you can do something like this um

182
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
you can do something like this um
 

183
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,070
you can do something like this um
oh i do have pumpkins too i am so

184
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
oh i do have pumpkins too i am so
 

185
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,910
oh i do have pumpkins too i am so
prepared

186
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920

 

187
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,750

uh i think i went that one too far

188
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
uh i think i went that one too far
 

189
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,390
uh i think i went that one too far
you can do you can have like the pumpkin

190
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400

 

191
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,070

then a fence

192
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080

 

193
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,630

and then the pressure plates and like

194
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
and then the pressure plates and like
 

195
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,469
and then the pressure plates and like
how like if there's wood around wooden

196
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
how like if there's wood around wooden
 

197
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,509
how like if there's wood around wooden
planks

198
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
planks
 

199
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,870
planks
that's another way you can do it which

200
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
that's another way you can do it which
 

201
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,710
that's another way you can do it which
is pretty cool uh

202
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
is pretty cool uh
 

203
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,390
is pretty cool uh
as long as you're not walking over it

204
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
as long as you're not walking over it
 

205
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,749
as long as you're not walking over it
because then it might be a little

206
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
because then it might be a little
 

207
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,110
because then it might be a little
strange

208
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
strange
 

209
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,870
strange
but that's one another way of hiding the

210
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
but that's one another way of hiding the
 

211
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,749
but that's one another way of hiding the
lighting really really well

212
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
lighting really really well
 

213
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,150
lighting really really well
uh what we're going to do first here is

214
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
uh what we're going to do first here is
 

215
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,430
uh what we're going to do first here is
make a staircase here

216
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
make a staircase here
 

217
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,590
make a staircase here
and i'll probably just show quick clips

218
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
and i'll probably just show quick clips
 

219
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,590
and i'll probably just show quick clips
of it like i used to do i've kind of

220
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
of it like i used to do i've kind of
 

221
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,710
of it like i used to do i've kind of
fallen out of the habit

222
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
fallen out of the habit
 

223
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,070
fallen out of the habit
of my uh old editing trick i learned

224
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
of my uh old editing trick i learned
 

225
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,550
of my uh old editing trick i learned
from

226
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
from
 

227
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,230
from
zysteru zisto

228
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
zysteru zisto
 

229
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,550
zysteru zisto
zesto i have such a hard time with his

230
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
zesto i have such a hard time with his
 

231
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,909
zesto i have such a hard time with his
name

232
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
name
 

233
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,990
name
uh we'll probably do a staircase like

234
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
uh we'll probably do a staircase like
 

235
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,950
uh we'll probably do a staircase like
this where it

236
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
this where it
 

237
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,310
this where it
goes out six blocks then there's a

238
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
goes out six blocks then there's a
 

239
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,710
goes out six blocks then there's a
switch type thing and then another six

240
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
switch type thing and then another six
 

241
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,909
switch type thing and then another six
blocks

242
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
blocks
 

243
00:05:01,919 --> 00:06:02,920
blocks
so here i go

244
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:02,930

 

245
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,350

[Applause]

246
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
[Applause]
 

247
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,110
[Applause]
okay so this is attempt number one at

248
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
okay so this is attempt number one at
 

249
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,870
okay so this is attempt number one at
the stairs and it's

250
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
the stairs and it's
 

251
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,029
the stairs and it's
not going to work like this it's way too

252
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
not going to work like this it's way too
 

253
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,230
not going to work like this it's way too
gradual

254
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
gradual
 

255
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,230
gradual
we're going to use real stairs instead

256
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
we're going to use real stairs instead
 

257
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,469
we're going to use real stairs instead
of the half slabs

258
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
of the half slabs
 

259
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,270
of the half slabs
to make it steeper downside of that is i

260
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
to make it steeper downside of that is i
 

261
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,150
to make it steeper downside of that is i
won't be able to run

262
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
won't be able to run
 

263
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,029
won't be able to run
up them like that but that's that's just

264
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
up them like that but that's that's just
 

265
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,110
up them like that but that's that's just
the price said yes

266
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
the price said yes
 

267
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,710
the price said yes
um i could like start doing the half

268
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
um i could like start doing the half
 

269
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,230
um i could like start doing the half
slaps further back

270
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
slaps further back
 

271
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,270
slaps further back
like from here for example but

272
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
like from here for example but
 

273
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,270
like from here for example but
i want to keep it extended out further

274
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
i want to keep it extended out further
 

275
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,469
i want to keep it extended out further
like this

276
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
like this
 

277
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,550
like this
so that we have a nice view of this area

278
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
so that we have a nice view of this area
 

279
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,749
so that we have a nice view of this area
here

280
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
here
 

281
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,830
here
and it would look really weird if we had

282
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
and it would look really weird if we had
 

283
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,029
and it would look really weird if we had
half slabs

284
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
half slabs
 

285
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,830
half slabs
going for miles so and switches the

286
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840
going for miles so and switches the
 

287
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,390
going for miles so and switches the
stairs

288
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
stairs
 

289
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:55,110
stairs
and it should work a lot better

290
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120

 

291
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,309

okay so i spent a fair bit of time

292
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
okay so i spent a fair bit of time
 

293
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,270
okay so i spent a fair bit of time
tweaking this i had to rip out these

294
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
tweaking this i had to rip out these
 

295
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,870
tweaking this i had to rip out these
stairs and rebuild them about

296
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
stairs and rebuild them about
 

297
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,510
stairs and rebuild them about
five or six times i think i'm gonna keep

298
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
five or six times i think i'm gonna keep
 

299
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:05,990
five or six times i think i'm gonna keep
it

300
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
it
 

301
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,909
it
like this it's uh it's regular stairs

302
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
like this it's uh it's regular stairs
 

303
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,309
like this it's uh it's regular stairs
now

304
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
now
 

305
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,670
now
and there's a one two three

306
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
and there's a one two three
 

307
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,790
and there's a one two three
four five of them then the platform over

308
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
four five of them then the platform over
 

309
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,070
four five of them then the platform over
here

310
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
here
 

311
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,990
here
which is at a pretty good height before

312
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
which is at a pretty good height before
 

313
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,589
which is at a pretty good height before
i think it was two or three blocks

314
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
i think it was two or three blocks
 

315
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,510
i think it was two or three blocks
higher and the bridge was at

316
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
higher and the bridge was at
 

317
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,150
higher and the bridge was at
your eye level basically now it looks

318
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
your eye level basically now it looks
 

319
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,749
your eye level basically now it looks
like the bridge is up higher

320
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
like the bridge is up higher
 

321
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,629
like the bridge is up higher
which is good and it's not blocking this

322
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
which is good and it's not blocking this
 

323
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,390
which is good and it's not blocking this
window like i had before

324
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
window like i had before
 

325
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,070
window like i had before
as much

326
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080

 

327
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,870

and then again this is one two three

328
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
and then again this is one two three
 

329
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,350
and then again this is one two three
four

330
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
four
 

331
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:48,230
four
five so it's the same

332
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240

 

333
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,390

and i'll probably do the sides out of

334
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
and i'll probably do the sides out of
 

335
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,350
and i'll probably do the sides out of
wood like the regular wood like this

336
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360

 

337
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,909

and at the bottom here i'm thinking we

338
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
and at the bottom here i'm thinking we
 

339
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,990
and at the bottom here i'm thinking we
will do a water pool in the middle after

340
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
will do a water pool in the middle after
 

341
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,869
will do a water pool in the middle after
all

342
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
all
 

343
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,629
all
i know i tried that before and kind of

344
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
i know i tried that before and kind of
 

345
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,909
i know i tried that before and kind of
didn't like it but

346
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
didn't like it but
 

347
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,029
didn't like it but

389
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,389

see

390
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399

 

391
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,310

and this we will make go up two blocks

392
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
and this we will make go up two blocks
 

393
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,790
and this we will make go up two blocks
and i may still put something over here

394
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800
and i may still put something over here
 

395
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:20,829
and i may still put something over here
not sure yet though

396
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839

 

397
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,550

um

398
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
um
 

399
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,910
um
put that there i'll just see how this

400
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
put that there i'll just see how this
 

401
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:34,829
put that there i'll just see how this
looks

402
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:34,839

 

403
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,030

there

404
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040

 

405
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,550

feels like i've been making a lot of

406
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
feels like i've been making a lot of
 

407
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,509
feels like i've been making a lot of
stairs lately

408
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519

 

409
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,430

you'd think i'd be a master at it by now

410
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
you'd think i'd be a master at it by now
 

411
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,590
you'd think i'd be a master at it by now
but nope

412
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
but nope
 

413
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,310
but nope
yeah i don't know if i'll i'll make it

414
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
yeah i don't know if i'll i'll make it
 

415
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,190
yeah i don't know if i'll i'll make it
raised like that

416
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200

 

417
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,910

and then we'll do the fences like uh the

418
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920
and then we'll do the fences like uh the
 

419
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,430
and then we'll do the fences like uh the
other stairs by the tree farm

420
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
other stairs by the tree farm
 

421
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,269
other stairs by the tree farm
up up to the right there

422
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
up up to the right there
 

423
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,190
up up to the right there
oh yeah we won't want it to connect to

424
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
oh yeah we won't want it to connect to
 

425
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:14,069
oh yeah we won't want it to connect to
the wall like that that'll look weird

426
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079

 

427
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,550

do that

428
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560

 

429
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,630

should look pretty good i think

430
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640

 

431
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,630

yeah that's good i like it

432
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640

 

433
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:40,230

i'm not sure how to do the lighting

434
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240

 

435
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,750

will probably have a rail that connects

436
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
will probably have a rail that connects
 

437
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,230
will probably have a rail that connects
to here or something

438
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
to here or something
 

439
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,509
to here or something
okay so i'll tweak with this a little

440
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
okay so i'll tweak with this a little
 

441
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:49,829
okay so i'll tweak with this a little
bit

442
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
bit
 

443
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,790
bit
and we'll see how it looks

444
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800

 

445
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,310

yeah so it doesn't seem like there's

446
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
yeah so it doesn't seem like there's
 

447
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,310
yeah so it doesn't seem like there's
enough space for a mushroom

448
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
enough space for a mushroom
 

449
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,949
enough space for a mushroom
over here because there's really only

450
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
over here because there's really only
 

451
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,829
over here because there's really only
six blocks of working space

452
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
six blocks of working space
 

453
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,190
six blocks of working space
um got a new idea though because i want

454
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
um got a new idea though because i want
 

455
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,870
um got a new idea though because i want
to put something here otherwise it'll

456
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
to put something here otherwise it'll
 

457
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,590
to put something here otherwise it'll
look

458
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
look
 

459
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,630
look
empty going to put

460
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
empty going to put
 

461
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,829
empty going to put
a jukebox station here

462
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
a jukebox station here
 

463
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,829
a jukebox station here
so that we can listen to our records um

464
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
so that we can listen to our records um
 

465
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,550
so that we can listen to our records um
and we're gonna try do a little redstone

466
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
and we're gonna try do a little redstone
 

467
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,190
and we're gonna try do a little redstone
with it

468
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
with it
 

469
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,389
with it
so the center of this seems to be one

470
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
so the center of this seems to be one
 

471
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,069
so the center of this seems to be one
two three four five

472
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
two three four five
 

473
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,509
two three four five
six seven eight nine now we'll put the

six seven eight nine now we'll put the
 

475
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,069
six seven eight nine now we'll put the
center

476
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
center
 

477
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,829
center
two three four five right here

478
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
two three four five right here
 

479
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,110
two three four five right here
so this is where i will be putting

480
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
so this is where i will be putting
 

481
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:49,509

really making a lot of sounds this video

490
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
really making a lot of sounds this video
 

491
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,230

498
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
it's not going to be a big station just
 

499
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,069
it's not going to be a big station just
a little

500
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:18,079

 

501
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,230

00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959

 

523
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,350

something like that

524
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
something like that
 

525
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:05,990
something like that
then in the back

526
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
then in the back
 

527
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,829
then in the back
and we'll do something with the floor

528
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839
and we'll do something with the floor
 

529
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,670
and we'll do something with the floor
there too i think that's

530
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,680
there too i think that's
 

531
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,790
there too i think that's
pretty good um yeah so we're gonna rig

532
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
pretty good um yeah so we're gonna rig
 

533
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,069
pretty good um yeah so we're gonna rig
this though

534
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
this though
 

535
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,990
this though
so that we have lamps here that come on

536
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
so that we have lamps here that come on
 

537
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,389
so that we have lamps here that come on
when we put a record

538
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
when we put a record
 

539
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,910
when we put a record
in the jukebox to do that we're going to

540
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
in the jukebox to do that we're going to
 

541
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,509
in the jukebox to do that we're going to
do a bud t-flip

542
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
do a bud t-flip
 

543
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:34,389
do a bud t-flip
bud t flip flop over here so do we have

544
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
bud t flip flop over here so do we have
 

545
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,110
bud t flip flop over here so do we have
pistons

546
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
pistons
 

547
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,310
pistons
we do not have pistons let's go get some

548
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
we do not have pistons let's go get some
 

549
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,550
we do not have pistons let's go get some
pistons

550
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560

 

551
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,829

yeah i think this will be pretty good

552
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
yeah i think this will be pretty good
 

553
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,189
yeah i think this will be pretty good
uh where did we leave them

554
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:49,199
uh where did we leave them
 

555
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,750
uh where did we leave them
oh there we go

556
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760

 

557
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,829

how's it so cool i like that room that's

558
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:55,839
how's it so cool i like that room that's
 

559
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,030
how's it so cool i like that room that's
very good

560
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040

 

561
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,710

uh we will put the piston right behind

562
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
uh we will put the piston right behind
 

563
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,790
uh we will put the piston right behind
the jukebox and that's what senses the

564
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
the jukebox and that's what senses the
 

565
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,870
the jukebox and that's what senses the
update when you put the record in or

566
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
update when you put the record in or
 

567
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,069
update when you put the record in or
take the record out

568
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
take the record out
 

569
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,189
take the record out
the jukebox updates

570
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
the jukebox updates
 

571
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,310
the jukebox updates
and then that will

572
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320

 

573
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,629

let's build it out of cobble maybe now

574
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
let's build it out of cobble maybe now
 

575
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,069
let's build it out of cobble maybe now
we'll we'll use the redwood

576
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:20,079

 

577
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,389

we'll move that and then

578
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399

 

579
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,590

this is a design i saw on

580
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
this is a design i saw on
 

581
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,509
this is a design i saw on
recon jeff's uh channel

582
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
recon jeff's uh channel
 

583
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,470
recon jeff's uh channel
it's one of my favorite t-flip-flop bud

584
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
it's one of my favorite t-flip-flop bud
 

585
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,949
it's one of my favorite t-flip-flop bud
switches

586
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959

 

587
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,829

yeah that's this is in the way already

588
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839
yeah that's this is in the way already
 

589
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,230
yeah that's this is in the way already
hmm

590
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
hmm
 

591
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,710
hmm
nuts okay we'll have to

592
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720

 

593
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,310

i'm gonna see if i can move this out of

594
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
i'm gonna see if i can move this out of
 

595
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,910
i'm gonna see if i can move this out of
the way

596
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920

 

597
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,069

okay i think we can do it now i took the

598
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
okay i think we can do it now i took the
 

599
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,350
okay i think we can do it now i took the
wiring off up here and

600
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
wiring off up here and
 

601
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,470
wiring off up here and
and moved it down here i wasn't able to

602
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,480
and moved it down here i wasn't able to
 

603
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,189
and moved it down here i wasn't able to
lower it

604
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
lower it
 

605
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,750
lower it
here because i guess the elevator for

606
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
here because i guess the elevator for
 

607
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,790
here because i guess the elevator for
the cave spiders

608
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800
the cave spiders
 

609
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,189
the cave spiders
is right there so we need to keep these

610
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
is right there so we need to keep these
 

611
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,470
is right there so we need to keep these
here otherwise they'll

612
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
here otherwise they'll
 

613
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,389
here otherwise they'll
escape um

614
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
escape um
 

615
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,829
escape um
it doesn't give us a whole lot of

616
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
it doesn't give us a whole lot of
 

617
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,470
it doesn't give us a whole lot of
working room here but i think it'll be

618
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
working room here but i think it'll be
 

619
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,069
working room here but i think it'll be
okay so when the piston extends this

620
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
okay so when the piston extends this
 

621
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,470
okay so when the piston extends this
block goes out above the redstone torch

622
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
block goes out above the redstone torch
 

623
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,710
block goes out above the redstone torch
which will then allow

624
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
which will then allow
 

625
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,550
which will then allow
power to flow from this block to this

626
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
power to flow from this block to this
 

627
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,350
power to flow from this block to this
wire

628
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360
wire
 

629
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,470
wire
when it's extended that will go to

630
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
when it's extended that will go to
 

631
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,670
when it's extended that will go to
another block oh dang it

632
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:39,680
another block oh dang it
 

633
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,310
another block oh dang it
dang it dang it dang it dang it oh the

634
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
dang it dang it dang it dang it oh the
 

635
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,069
dang it dang it dang it dang it oh the
wiring

636
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
wiring
 

637
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,470
wiring
did not have ladders where i needed them

638
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480

 

639
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,350

yeah it's annoying happened so often for

640
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
yeah it's annoying happened so often for
 

641
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,870
yeah it's annoying happened so often for
me

642
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880

 

643
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,230

anything else wrecked put that back

644
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,240
anything else wrecked put that back
 

645
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,069
anything else wrecked put that back
okay wire there um redstone torch here

646
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
okay wire there um redstone torch here
 

647
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,670
okay wire there um redstone torch here
we'll power that block

648
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680

 

649
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,790

that'll come over like that

650
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800

 

651
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,470

to another wire there

652
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
to another wire there
 

653
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,069
to another wire there
and repeater set to one over here

654
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
and repeater set to one over here
 

655
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,790
and repeater set to one over here
and then i think we need two more blocks

656
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
and then i think we need two more blocks
 

657
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,150
and then i think we need two more blocks
yet

658
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
yet
 

659
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,470
yet
we'll have to go up a little higher

660
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480

 

661
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,670

take this out too

662
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680

 

663
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,910

and that should do it

664
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920

 

665
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,430

so now if there's an update

666
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440

 

667
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,910

extends retracts extends

668
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
extends retracts extends
 

669
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,550
extends retracts extends
retracts good i'm gonna make sure we

670
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
retracts good i'm gonna make sure we
 

671
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,389
retracts good i'm gonna make sure we
don't lose our record or i'll be very

672
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
don't lose our record or i'll be very
 

673
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,790
don't lose our record or i'll be very
sad

674
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
sad
 

675
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,189
sad
then we could put that there

676
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
then we could put that there
 

677
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,090
then we could put that there
that there um

678
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,100
that there um
 

679
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,590
that there um
[Music]

680
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600
[Music]
 

681
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,350
[Music]
and i want these to come on so we'll put

682
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
and i want these to come on so we'll put
 

683
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:15,669
and i want these to come on so we'll put
redstone torches there and there

684
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:15,679

 

685
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,270

okay so that'll do it it's just in

686
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
okay so that'll do it it's just in
 

687
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,630
okay so that'll do it it's just in
reverse right now

688
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640

 

689
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,870

see we'll change the floor

690
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880

 

691
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,830

get our regular planks for the for this

692
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:30,840
get our regular planks for the for this
 

693
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,990
get our regular planks for the for this
uh

694
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
uh
 

695
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,590
uh
what would you call that what i have the

696
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,600
what would you call that what i have the
 

697
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,950
what would you call that what i have the
the wood on the left and right a

698
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:36,960
the wood on the left and right a
 

699
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,630
the wood on the left and right a
highlight i don't know

700
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640

 

701
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,350

i'm sure it has a proper name um

702
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,360

 

703
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,789

so we gotta switch this over

704
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799

 

705
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,710

it's one way of doing it

706
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:54,720

 

707
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,830

usually i use repeaters if i need to

708
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
usually i use repeaters if i need to
 

709
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,630
usually i use repeaters if i need to
switch a t flip flop you just add a

710
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
switch a t flip flop you just add a
 

711
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,270
switch a t flip flop you just add a
delay

712
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
delay
 

713
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,909
delay
one delay and now that we put that there

714
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
one delay and now that we put that there
 

715
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,830
one delay and now that we put that there
it should be

716
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840

 

717
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,190

at the right state

718
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
at the right state
 

719
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,750
at the right state
yeah so it's off by default with no

720
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
yeah so it's off by default with no
 

721
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,190
yeah so it's off by default with no
record in

722
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200
record in
 

723
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,630
record in
put a record in lights come on

724
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
put a record in lights come on
 

725
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,630
put a record in lights come on
uh they'll stay on even when it finishes

726
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:22,640
uh they'll stay on even when it finishes
 

727
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,390
uh they'll stay on even when it finishes
playing

728
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,400
playing
 

729
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,070
playing
it they only shut off when we take the

730
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
it they only shut off when we take the
 

731
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,270
it they only shut off when we take the
record out which is good

732
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,280
record out which is good
 

733
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,190
record out which is good
because that'll add a little extra

734
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
because that'll add a little extra
 

735
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,750
because that'll add a little extra
lighting here too because it'll probably

736
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:33,760
lighting here too because it'll probably
 

737
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,150
lighting here too because it'll probably
most the time always be on

738
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160

 

739
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,549

and then we will try to merge this into

740
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
and then we will try to merge this into
 

741
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,470
and then we will try to merge this into
over here and over here

742
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480

 

743
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,990

[Music]

744
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000

 

745
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,710

i don't know having a really tough time

746
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
i don't know having a really tough time
 

747
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,070
i don't know having a really tough time
trying to merge

748
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
trying to merge
 

749
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,230
trying to merge
stone brick into this red wood doesn't

750
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
stone brick into this red wood doesn't
 

751
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,350
stone brick into this red wood doesn't
look very good

752
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
look very good
 

753
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,029
look very good
so

754
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039

 

755
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,950

may have to do something else here

756
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
may have to do something else here
 

757
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,830
may have to do something else here
if you got ideas let me know and

758
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
if you got ideas let me know and
 

759
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,029
if you got ideas let me know and
thinking what i

760
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
thinking what i
 

761
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,990
thinking what i
probably have to do is just use the

762
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
probably have to do is just use the
 

763
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,990
probably have to do is just use the
stone

764
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,000
stone
 

765
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,190
stone
all the way through

766
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
all the way through
 

767
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,669
all the way through
and we'll see how that looks and then

768
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679
and we'll see how that looks and then
 

769
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,510
and we'll see how that looks and then
where these pumpkins are

770
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
where these pumpkins are
 

771
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,590
where these pumpkins are
we could have lava with iron gates in

772
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
we could have lava with iron gates in
 

773
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,029
we could have lava with iron gates in
front or iron bars

774
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039

 

775
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,029

but if you can think of another way of

776
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
but if you can think of another way of
 

777
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,150
but if you can think of another way of
doing it that doesn't

778
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
doing it that doesn't
 

779
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,270
doing it that doesn't
uh get rid of the wood look let me know

780
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280

 

781
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,870

or that looks better in general

782
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880

 

783
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,070

um yeah

784
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,080
um yeah
 

785
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,070
um yeah
then i don't know maybe use the nether

786
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,080
then i don't know maybe use the nether
 

787
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,310
then i don't know maybe use the nether
the nether brick like we do with the

788
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
the nether brick like we do with the
 

789
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,110
the nether brick like we do with the
this stuff here

790
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,120
this stuff here
 

791
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,350
this stuff here
although i hate to have that in this

792
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,360
although i hate to have that in this
 

793
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,669
although i hate to have that in this
part of the cave because i was trying to

794
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
part of the cave because i was trying to
 

795
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,149
part of the cave because i was trying to
avoid using it

796
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,159
avoid using it
 

797
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,750
avoid using it
but i don't know

798
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:15,760

 

799
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,149

because i can't really change the stone

800
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:18,159
because i can't really change the stone
 

801
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:18,870
because i can't really change the stone
brick here

802
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
brick here
 

803
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,110
brick here
because we use it throughout the whole

804
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,120
because we use it throughout the whole
 

805
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,830
because we use it throughout the whole
slime elevator there

806
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:25,840

 

807
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,750

i don't know i'll try

808
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
i don't know i'll try
 

809
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,909
i don't know i'll try
i'll try switch that with nether brick

810
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
i'll try switch that with nether brick
 

811
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,590
i'll try switch that with nether brick
and put lava there and we'll see how it

812
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:33,600
and put lava there and we'll see how it
 

813
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,190
and put lava there and we'll see how it
looks

814
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200

 

815
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,029

there we go so that would be the other

816
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:39,039
there we go so that would be the other
 

817
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,510
there we go so that would be the other
option another way of doing it

818
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,520
option another way of doing it
 

819
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,510
option another way of doing it
that carries the stone look from there

820
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:43,520
that carries the stone look from there
 

821
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,789
that carries the stone look from there
and there

822
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
and there
 

823
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,310
and there
and keeps it going uh if i

824
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
and keeps it going uh if i
 

825
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,470
and keeps it going uh if i
if i do keep it like this i will

826
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
if i do keep it like this i will
 

827
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,750
if i do keep it like this i will
probably

828
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760
probably
 

829
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,669
probably
not make it completely flat on the top

830
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:53,679
not make it completely flat on the top
 

831
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,390
not make it completely flat on the top
i'll try maybe

832
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400
i'll try maybe
 

833
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,029
i'll try maybe
do a little give it a little shape

834
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
do a little give it a little shape
 

835
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,630
do a little give it a little shape
anyway

836
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
anyway
 

837
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,510
anyway
