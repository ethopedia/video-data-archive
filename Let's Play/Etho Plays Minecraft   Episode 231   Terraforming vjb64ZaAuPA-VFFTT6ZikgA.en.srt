21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,590

kind of wondering what happens

22
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
kind of wondering what happens
 

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,190
kind of wondering what happens
to the stuff that goes through this

24
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
to the stuff that goes through this
 

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,389
to the stuff that goes through this
portal

26
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399

 

27
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,630

i don't really know to be honest

28
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640

 

29
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,430

because you can throw stuff in i think

30
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
because you can throw stuff in i think
 

31
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,189
because you can throw stuff in i think
mobs can go in but where do they come

32
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
mobs can go in but where do they come
 

33
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,150
mobs can go in but where do they come
out

34
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
out
 

35
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,069
out
because you come out wherever your your

36
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
because you come out wherever your your
 

37
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,790
because you come out wherever your your
spawn is set

38
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,800
spawn is set
 

39
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,870
spawn is set
where do they come out though

40
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880

 

41
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,230

all right you throw that there

42
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
all right you throw that there
 

43
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,390
all right you throw that there
got still not picking it up

got still not picking it up
 

45
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,390
got still not picking it up
still not picking up so it actually went

46
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400
still not picking up so it actually went
 

47
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,350
still not picking up so it actually went
through the portal somewhere

48
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
through the portal somewhere
 

49
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,429
through the portal somewhere
do you think it actually came out though

50
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
do you think it actually came out though
 

51
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,350
do you think it actually came out though
i honestly don't know so if you're

52
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
i honestly don't know so if you're
 

53
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,789
i honestly don't know so if you're
waiting for an answer

54
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
waiting for an answer
 

55
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,270
waiting for an answer
uh i don't have one i mean i'm guessing

56
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
uh i don't have one i mean i'm guessing
 

57
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,789
uh i don't have one i mean i'm guessing
it either got destroyed though or

58
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
it either got destroyed though or
 

59
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:42,550
it either got destroyed though or
comes out at the main spawn of the world

60
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560

 

61
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,429

right [ __ ]

62
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439

 

63
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,270

i bet you could if they actually came

64
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
i bet you could if they actually came
 

65
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,710
i bet you could if they actually came
out somewhere i bet you could get a

66
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
out somewhere i bet you could get a
 

67
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,990
out somewhere i bet you could get a
whole ton of them through here

68
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
whole ton of them through here
 

69
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,230
whole ton of them through here
really easy

70
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240

 

71
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,510

actually i just saw did i see the dirt i

72
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
actually i just saw did i see the dirt i
 

73
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,789
actually i just saw did i see the dirt i
threw when i came through i

74
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
threw when i came through i
 

75
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,990
threw when i came through i
i don't know i'm gonna have to watch

76
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
i don't know i'm gonna have to watch
 

77
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,790
i don't know i'm gonna have to watch
that back

78
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800

 

79
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,710

yeah so this is the main spawn point of

80
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
yeah so this is the main spawn point of
 

81
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,229
yeah so this is the main spawn point of
my world

82
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
my world
 

83
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,830
my world
and i don't see the items anywhere i

84
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
and i don't see the items anywhere i
 

85
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,350
and i don't see the items anywhere i
know a chicken went through too when i

86
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
know a chicken went through too when i
 

87
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,869
know a chicken went through too when i
was goofing around

88
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
was goofing around
 

89
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,470
was goofing around
and i don't see a chicken anywhere on

90
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
and i don't see a chicken anywhere on
 

91
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,030
and i don't see a chicken anywhere on
the surface

92
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
the surface
 

93
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,430
the surface
so that just makes me think they get

94
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
so that just makes me think they get
 

95
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,949
so that just makes me think they get
destroyed whatever goes through that

96
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
destroyed whatever goes through that
 

97
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,309
destroyed whatever goes through that
portal

98
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319

 

99
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,030

that's my guess who knows i'm sure

100
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
that's my guess who knows i'm sure
 

101
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,070
that's my guess who knows i'm sure
somebody

102
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
somebody
 

103
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,430
somebody
will tell us so

104
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440

 

105
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,430

you know what uh being here has given me

106
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
you know what uh being here has given me
 

107
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,190
you know what uh being here has given me
an idea of what i want to do

108
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
an idea of what i want to do
 

109
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,270
an idea of what i want to do
for today's episode or at least part of

110
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
for today's episode or at least part of
 

111
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,390
for today's episode or at least part of
it

112
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
it
 

113
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,509
it
uh i really like this area like i think

114
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
uh i really like this area like i think
 

115
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,550
uh i really like this area like i think
it looks awesome

116
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
it looks awesome
 

117
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,710
it looks awesome
but there's a few tweaks to it we could

118
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
but there's a few tweaks to it we could
 

119
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,110
but there's a few tweaks to it we could
make to make it even better i think

120
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
make to make it even better i think
 

121
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,470
make to make it even better i think
and one of those is to fix

122
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
and one of those is to fix
 

123
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,990
and one of those is to fix
or to adjust the water a little bit like

124
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
or to adjust the water a little bit like
 

125
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,869
or to adjust the water a little bit like
for example over here definitely want to

126
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
for example over here definitely want to
 

127
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,550
for example over here definitely want to
take that out so that the water flows

128
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
take that out so that the water flows
 

129
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,070
take that out so that the water flows
all the way through

130
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
all the way through
 

131
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,910
all the way through
and we could actually take a boat around

132
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
and we could actually take a boat around
 

133
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,910
and we could actually take a boat around
here

134
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
here
 

135
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,070
here
so that's one thing i want to do i think

136
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
so that's one thing i want to do i think
 

137
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,470
so that's one thing i want to do i think
this this area here would be

138
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
this this area here would be
 

139
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,990
this this area here would be
oh hey hello

140
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000

 

141
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,589

i think this area would look really cool

142
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
i think this area would look really cool
 

143
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,910
i think this area would look really cool
if i put a cover over top too

144
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
if i put a cover over top too
 

145
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,670
if i put a cover over top too
and made it look like this mountain

146
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
and made it look like this mountain
 

147
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,110
and made it look like this mountain
joined with this one

148
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
joined with this one
 

149
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,789
joined with this one
and there was a passage through

150
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
and there was a passage through
 

151
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,190
and there was a passage through
oh we actually got a gold piece nice

152
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200

 

153
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:45,509

cool uh so let's take this out

154
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519

 

155
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,270

just a lot of minor tweaks could make

156
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
just a lot of minor tweaks could make
 

157
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,149
just a lot of minor tweaks could make
this place a whole lot better i think

158
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159

 

159
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,589

actually what i should do is get some

160
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
actually what i should do is get some
 

161
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,390
actually what i should do is get some
ice

162
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400

 

163
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,710

all right

164
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720

 

165
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,110

okay i wonder how hard it is to

166
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
okay i wonder how hard it is to
 

167
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,869
okay i wonder how hard it is to
make it look like a passage through here

168
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
make it look like a passage through here
 

169
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,310
make it look like a passage through here
you know when i started this world i

170
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
you know when i started this world i
 

171
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,590
you know when i started this world i
always thought i was going to go this

172
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
always thought i was going to go this
 

173
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,390
always thought i was going to go this
way

174
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
way
 

175
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,590
way
into the mountains because these

176
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
into the mountains because these
 

177
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,509
into the mountains because these
mountains are pretty cool

178
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
mountains are pretty cool
 

179
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,189
mountains are pretty cool
but i ended up going that way instead

180
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
but i ended up going that way instead
 

181
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,469
but i ended up going that way instead
just the way it worked out with the

182
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
just the way it worked out with the
 

183
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,670
just the way it worked out with the
stronghold being over there and

184
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
stronghold being over there and
 

185
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,189
stronghold being over there and
everything

186
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
everything
 

187
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,629
everything
but eventually we should go this way

188
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639

 

189
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,830

okay uh i guess i'll just

190
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
okay uh i guess i'll just
 

191
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,230
okay uh i guess i'll just
play around with putting some dirt here

192
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
play around with putting some dirt here
 

193
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,469
play around with putting some dirt here
and see what it looks like

194
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
and see what it looks like
 

195
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,590
and see what it looks like
oops

196
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600

 

197
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,430

yeah we'll use this as a guide i think

198
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
yeah we'll use this as a guide i think
 

199
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,909
yeah we'll use this as a guide i think
we should go make it slope like

200
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
we should go make it slope like
 

201
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,749
we should go make it slope like
this and gradually up

202
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
this and gradually up
 

203
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,590
this and gradually up
and then for the lower part we'll make

204
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
and then for the lower part we'll make
 

205
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,590
and then for the lower part we'll make
it kind of arch

206
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
it kind of arch
 

207
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,990
it kind of arch
like that

208
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000

 

209
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,230

yeah that's what we'll go for and we'll

210
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
yeah that's what we'll go for and we'll
 

211
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,029
yeah that's what we'll go for and we'll
make it go

212
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
make it go
 

213
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,950
make it go
from maybe here

214
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
from maybe here
 

215
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,070
from maybe here
see what what height are we maybe from

216
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
see what what height are we maybe from
 

217
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,469
see what what height are we maybe from
here

218
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
here
 

219
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,110
here
we don't want it to look too man-made

220
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
we don't want it to look too man-made
 

221
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,830
we don't want it to look too man-made
though

222
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
though
 

223
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,390
though
we'll have to rough it up a bit and

224
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
we'll have to rough it up a bit and
 

225
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,189
we'll have to rough it up a bit and
we'll make it come out

226
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
we'll make it come out
 

227
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,230
we'll make it come out
we'll make it go up to here

228
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
we'll make it go up to here
 

229
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,469
we'll make it go up to here
so from here

230
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479

 

231
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,790

to here

232
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800

 

233
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,710

all right well i got some shape going

234
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
all right well i got some shape going
 

235
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,070
all right well i got some shape going
here i'll tell you the strategy

236
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
here i'll tell you the strategy
 

237
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,749
here i'll tell you the strategy
i'm using to shape this i don't know how

238
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
i'm using to shape this i don't know how
 

239
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,790
i'm using to shape this i don't know how
effective it's going to actually be

240
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
effective it's going to actually be
 

241
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,189
effective it's going to actually be
but i'm just picking the lowest point of

242
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
but i'm just picking the lowest point of
 

243
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,950
but i'm just picking the lowest point of
the two sides

244
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
the two sides
 

245
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,270
the two sides
so for example the lowest point would be

246
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
so for example the lowest point would be
 

247
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,710
so for example the lowest point would be
over here

248
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
over here
 

249
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,350
over here
because the point would be way up there

250
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
because the point would be way up there
 

251
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,270
because the point would be way up there
for that side

252
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
for that side
 

253
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,830
for that side
so i just went straight across from

254
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
so i just went straight across from
 

255
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,550
so i just went straight across from
there

256
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
there
 

257
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,430
there
but if you get to like here for example

258
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
but if you get to like here for example
 

259
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,590
but if you get to like here for example
uh this side is the lowest point

260
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
uh this side is the lowest point
 

261
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,270
uh this side is the lowest point
and this one goes up to there right

262
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
and this one goes up to there right
 

263
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,510
and this one goes up to there right
so i just just did that all the way down

264
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
so i just just did that all the way down
 

265
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,070
so i just just did that all the way down
as far as i wanted it to go and then

266
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
as far as i wanted it to go and then
 

267
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,550
as far as i wanted it to go and then
i'll have to

268
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
i'll have to
 

269
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,629
i'll have to
or the the way i plan on shaping this

270
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
or the the way i plan on shaping this
 

271
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,670
or the the way i plan on shaping this
now

272
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
now
 

273
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,749
now
if it's a flat wall like this it'll be a

274
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
if it's a flat wall like this it'll be a
 

275
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,510
if it's a flat wall like this it'll be a
steeper slope

276
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
steeper slope
 

277
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,710
steeper slope
or or like over here so i'll be placing

278
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
or or like over here so i'll be placing
 

279
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,830
or or like over here so i'll be placing
more land

280
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
more land
 

281
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,270
more land
to help make up for that and i'm gonna

282
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
to help make up for that and i'm gonna
 

283
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,990
to help make up for that and i'm gonna
shape the top

284
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
shape the top
 

285
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,950
shape the top
first got to get some soil over here i

286
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
first got to get some soil over here i
 

287
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,350
first got to get some soil over here i
don't

288
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
don't
 

289
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,230
don't
have i've used it all somewhere i don't

290
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
have i've used it all somewhere i don't
 

291
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,749
have i've used it all somewhere i don't
know where

292
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
know where
 

293
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,230
know where
but at the stronghold i have a lot more

294
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
but at the stronghold i have a lot more
 

295
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,909
but at the stronghold i have a lot more
i'm gonna shape the top first so then

296
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
i'm gonna shape the top first so then
 

297
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,790
i'm gonna shape the top first so then
we'll shape

298
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
we'll shape
 

299
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,270
we'll shape
underneath and i think it'll be okay

300
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280

 

301
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,029

that feels that feels pretty cool

302
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039

 

303
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,390

yeah you know what this is actually

304
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
yeah you know what this is actually
 

305
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,110
yeah you know what this is actually
going pretty good i think

306
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
going pretty good i think
 

307
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,510
going pretty good i think
i i was a little worried starting this

308
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
i i was a little worried starting this
 

309
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,790
i i was a little worried starting this
how good i would be at it

310
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
how good i would be at it
 

311
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,510
how good i would be at it
because it's it's fairly random trying

312
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
because it's it's fairly random trying
 

313
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,350
because it's it's fairly random trying
to do this

314
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
to do this
 

315
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,390
to do this
and random isn't my specialty

316
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
and random isn't my specialty
 

317
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,909
and random isn't my specialty
usually everything has to have a purpose

318
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:15,919
usually everything has to have a purpose
 

319
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,270
usually everything has to have a purpose
but really all this is

320
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
but really all this is
 

321
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,350
but really all this is
all i'm doing with this is averaging the

322
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
all i'm doing with this is averaging the
 

323
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,110
all i'm doing with this is averaging the
landscape out which

324
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
landscape out which
 

325
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,950
landscape out which
isn't too hard even for someone like me

326
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
isn't too hard even for someone like me
 

327
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,029
isn't too hard even for someone like me
just to do with their

328
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
just to do with their
 

329
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,950
just to do with their
their eyes

330
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960

 

331
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,749

um it doesn't have to be perfect either

332
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
um it doesn't have to be perfect either
 

333
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,469
um it doesn't have to be perfect either
which is always

334
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
which is always
 

335
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,950
which is always
nice

336
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960

 

337
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,710

but yeah landscaping is one of those

338
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
but yeah landscaping is one of those
 

339
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,589
but yeah landscaping is one of those
things i tend to avoid usually

340
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
things i tend to avoid usually
 

341
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,950
things i tend to avoid usually
just because i don't know it takes a lot

342
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
just because i don't know it takes a lot
 

343
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,990
just because i don't know it takes a lot
of time

344
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
of time
 

345
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,749
of time
a lot of resources usually and

346
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759

 

347
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,189

it's not like you can move mountains

348
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
it's not like you can move mountains
 

349
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,430
it's not like you can move mountains
around in this game

350
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
around in this game
 

351
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,309
around in this game
it would be cool if you could but yeah

352
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
it would be cool if you could but yeah
 

353
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,749
it would be cool if you could but yeah
that takes a lot of tnt

354
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
that takes a lot of tnt
 

355
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,670
that takes a lot of tnt
and a lot of prep time to do something

356
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
and a lot of prep time to do something
 

357
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,950
and a lot of prep time to do something
like that

358
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
like that
 

359
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,430
like that
and you know what i always thought would

360
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
and you know what i always thought would
 

361
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:05,990
and you know what i always thought would
be cool

362
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
be cool
 

363
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,150
be cool
is if there's a quick way like we have

364
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
is if there's a quick way like we have
 

365
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,909
is if there's a quick way like we have
tnt that's a quick way of destroying

366
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
tnt that's a quick way of destroying
 

367
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,469
tnt that's a quick way of destroying
blocks

368
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
blocks
 

369
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,230
blocks
and there's creepers and and all that

370
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
and there's creepers and and all that
 

371
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,550
and there's creepers and and all that
stuff be cool if there's a quick way of

372
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
stuff be cool if there's a quick way of
 

373
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,230
stuff be cool if there's a quick way of
placing blocks in this game too

374
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
placing blocks in this game too
 

375
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,230
placing blocks in this game too
somehow but i don't know how

376
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
somehow but i don't know how
 

377
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,070
somehow but i don't know how
you could get that to work i guess

378
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
you could get that to work i guess
 

379
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,830
you could get that to work i guess
in some ways there is like if you pour

380
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
in some ways there is like if you pour
 

381
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,350
in some ways there is like if you pour
lava over water you'll get

382
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
lava over water you'll get
 

383
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,749
lava over water you'll get
you'll get a stone which is cool

384
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
you'll get a stone which is cool
 

385
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,029
you'll get a stone which is cool
but it's not like you can

386
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039

 

387
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,190

put 64 blocks of something into

388
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
put 64 blocks of something into
 

389
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,509
put 64 blocks of something into
a furnace type thing put some tnt and

390
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
a furnace type thing put some tnt and
 

391
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,469
a furnace type thing put some tnt and
have it

392
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
have it
 

393
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,070
have it
blow up and make a a 4x4

394
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
blow up and make a a 4x4
 

395
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,550
blow up and make a a 4x4
cube of the material you put in or

396
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
cube of the material you put in or
 

397
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,509
cube of the material you put in or
something like that

398
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
something like that
 

399
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,550
something like that
i don't know

400
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560

 

401
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,790

doing large scale terraforming is very

402
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
doing large scale terraforming is very
 

403
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,910
doing large scale terraforming is very
difficult in

404
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
difficult in
 

405
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,030
difficult in
survival that's for sure oops

406
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040

 

407
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,829

see how's this looking pretty good

408
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
see how's this looking pretty good
 

409
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,590
see how's this looking pretty good
uh this should probably join a bit

410
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
uh this should probably join a bit
 

411
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:15,350
uh this should probably join a bit
better

412
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360

 

413
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,110

yeah i'm happy with how that turned out

414
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
yeah i'm happy with how that turned out
 

415
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,190
yeah i'm happy with how that turned out
that's that's the top side done

416
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
that's that's the top side done
 

417
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,230
that's that's the top side done
still gotta do underneath but i think

418
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
still gotta do underneath but i think
 

419
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,670
still gotta do underneath but i think
that looks pretty

420
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
that looks pretty
 

421
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,030
that looks pretty
pretty good

422
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040

 

423
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,790

uh one thing i want to do yet though is

424
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
uh one thing i want to do yet though is
 

425
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,389
uh one thing i want to do yet though is
just

426
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
just
 

427
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,509
just
try to make it a little more natural

428
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
try to make it a little more natural
 

429
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,710
try to make it a little more natural
you know if you plant a tree or

430
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
you know if you plant a tree or
 

431
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,470
you know if you plant a tree or
something on top of it it really doesn't

432
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
something on top of it it really doesn't
 

433
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,910
something on top of it it really doesn't
look like somebody

434
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
look like somebody
 

435
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,070
look like somebody
built it and grass does the same thing

436
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
built it and grass does the same thing
 

437
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,790
built it and grass does the same thing
kinda

438
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800

 

439
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,230

uh yeah sure

440
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
uh yeah sure
 

441
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,710
uh yeah sure
okay so now we have to do the bottom

442
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
okay so now we have to do the bottom
 

443
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,750
okay so now we have to do the bottom
side

444
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
side
 

445
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,870
side
and i sort of started started with that

446
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
and i sort of started started with that
 

447
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,630
and i sort of started started with that
i made a base

448
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
i made a base
 

449
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,829
i made a base
like we did above and it's hollow inside

450
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:02,839
like we did above and it's hollow inside
 

451
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,310
like we did above and it's hollow inside
woohoo i might fill it i'm not sure

452
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
woohoo i might fill it i'm not sure
 

453
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,150
woohoo i might fill it i'm not sure
um but yeah now i just have to average

454
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
um but yeah now i just have to average
 

455
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,350
um but yeah now i just have to average
the bottom side so make it go

456
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
the bottom side so make it go
 

457
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,030
the bottom side so make it go
arch shaped

458
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040

 

459
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,310

and i think it'll be okay

460
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320

 

461
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,630

well what i'm finding is doing the

462
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
well what i'm finding is doing the
 

463
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,069
well what i'm finding is doing the
underside of this thing is

464
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
underside of this thing is
 

465
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,389
underside of this thing is
much much more difficult and i think

466
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
much much more difficult and i think
 

467
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,829
much much more difficult and i think
it's because of

468
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
it's because of
 

469
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,470
it's because of
two things really the first one is i

470
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
two things really the first one is i
 

471
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,150
two things really the first one is i
can't reach anything so i have to make

472
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
can't reach anything so i have to make
 

473
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,829
can't reach anything so i have to make
scaffolding

474
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
scaffolding
 

475
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,990
scaffolding
and the second thing is i don't have a

476
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
and the second thing is i don't have a
 

477
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,509
and the second thing is i don't have a
difference between the two walls there

478
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
difference between the two walls there
 

479
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,230
difference between the two walls there
they're the same heights because i went

480
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
they're the same heights because i went
 

481
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,190
they're the same heights because i went
straight across unlike above there was a

482
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
straight across unlike above there was a
 

483
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,990
straight across unlike above there was a
difference

484
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
difference
 

485
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,750
difference
and it made it easier to give it

486
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
and it made it easier to give it
 

487
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,110
and it made it easier to give it
character

488
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
character
 

489
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,030
character
with this i kind of have to just throw

490
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
with this i kind of have to just throw
 

491
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,150
with this i kind of have to just throw
in my own randomness

492
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
in my own randomness
 

493
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,550
in my own randomness
and like i said i'm not good at that so

494
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
and like i said i'm not good at that so
 

495
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,190
and like i said i'm not good at that so
probably won't turn out as well as the

496
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
probably won't turn out as well as the
 

497
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,509
probably won't turn out as well as the
top parts

498
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519

 

499
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,829

okay guys i got it mostly all

500
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839

 

501
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:13,990

done

502
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
done
 

503
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,910
done
slimes slimes everywhere

504
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
slimes slimes everywhere
 

505
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,150
slimes slimes everywhere
and uh let's go for a ride through it

506
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
and uh let's go for a ride through it
 

507
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,069
and uh let's go for a ride through it
it didn't turn out perfect but you know

508
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
it didn't turn out perfect but you know
 

509
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,509
it didn't turn out perfect but you know
it's it's pretty good

510
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519

 

511
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,509

the underside oh that was a nice boat

512
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
the underside oh that was a nice boat
 

513
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,430
the underside oh that was a nice boat
ride the underside was really

514
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
ride the underside was really
 

515
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,790
ride the underside was really
tough to do

516
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800

 

517
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,710

here we go so just a little something to

518
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
here we go so just a little something to
 

519
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,069
here we go so just a little something to
add character to the land

520
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079

 

521
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,110

cool okay let's do a little bit more

522
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
cool okay let's do a little bit more
 

523
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,470
cool okay let's do a little bit more
terraforming

524
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480

 

525
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,310

there's a spot over here where the river

526
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
there's a spot over here where the river
 

527
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,470
there's a spot over here where the river
seems to brush up against this pool here

528
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
seems to brush up against this pool here
 

529
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,310
seems to brush up against this pool here
but it doesn't connect too well

530
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
but it doesn't connect too well
 

531
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,590
but it doesn't connect too well
so let's let's make that a bit wider

532
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
so let's let's make that a bit wider
 

533
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:09,670
so let's let's make that a bit wider
so that it's easy to get a boat through

534
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680

 

535
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,269

uh-huh much better much much better

536
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
uh-huh much better much much better
 

537
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,910
uh-huh much better much much better
so the next one i want to do is a a

538
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
so the next one i want to do is a a
 

539
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,310
so the next one i want to do is a a
bigger one

540
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
bigger one
 

541
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,790
bigger one
uh i would like to make my own river

542
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
uh i would like to make my own river
 

543
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,750
uh i would like to make my own river
that goes

544
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
that goes
 

545
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,190
that goes
at the base of this mountain i'm on

546
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,200
at the base of this mountain i'm on
 

547
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,030
at the base of this mountain i'm on
right now that kind of follows the

548
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
right now that kind of follows the
 

549
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,750
right now that kind of follows the
bottom of it

550
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
bottom of it
 

551
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,829
bottom of it
that will go from here

552
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
that will go from here
 

553
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,190
that will go from here
cut through there and then

554
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200

 

555
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,550

see let's hop over here

556
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
see let's hop over here
 

557
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,910
see let's hop over here
there's gonna be a lot of blocks

558
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
there's gonna be a lot of blocks
 

559
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,829
there's gonna be a lot of blocks
involved with this one

560
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:41,839
involved with this one
 

561
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,870
involved with this one
yes it'll come through and go

562
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
yes it'll come through and go
 

563
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,069
yes it'll come through and go
around like that

564
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
around like that
 

565
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,949
around like that
then in and then connect with this big

566
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
then in and then connect with this big
 

567
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,430
then in and then connect with this big
pool water here

568
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
pool water here
 

569
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,470
pool water here
because this one's all on its own right

570
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
because this one's all on its own right
 

571
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,949
because this one's all on its own right
now

572
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
now
 

573
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,949
now
it would be cool if it was connected

574
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959

 

575
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:10,550

all right let's see

576
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,560

 

577
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,870

it's going to be hard to see where i

578
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
it's going to be hard to see where i
 

579
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,590
it's going to be hard to see where i
want to go

580
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
want to go
 

581
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,750
want to go
when i'm down here it's easy to see from

582
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
when i'm down here it's easy to see from
 

583
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,150
when i'm down here it's easy to see from
above

584
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
above
 

585
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,750
above
uh i'll probably make the river about

586
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
uh i'll probably make the river about
 

587
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,990
uh i'll probably make the river about
five between five and ten wide

588
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000

 

589
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,269

yeah so go through here

590
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
yeah so go through here
 

591
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:35,110
yeah so go through here
um through here

592
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
um through here
 

593
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,310
um through here
take out this tree

594
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320

 

595
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,509

shouldn't be too tough

596
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
shouldn't be too tough
 

597
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,069
shouldn't be too tough
all right here i go

598
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:48,079
all right here i go
 

599
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,710
all right here i go
okay so the strategy with this one i

600
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,720
okay so the strategy with this one i
 

601
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,910
okay so the strategy with this one i
just cut a

602
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
just cut a
 

603
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,110
just cut a
pretty thin path all the way through

604
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120
pretty thin path all the way through
 

605
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,509
pretty thin path all the way through
uh where i wanted it to go like what

606
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:57,519
uh where i wanted it to go like what
 

607
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,509
uh where i wanted it to go like what
shape i wanted to take

608
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
shape i wanted to take
 

609
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,269
shape i wanted to take
and now i got tnt running all the way

610
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
and now i got tnt running all the way
 

611
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,189
and now i got tnt running all the way
down i think if i light it

612
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
down i think if i light it
 

613
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,710
down i think if i light it
it should make a five wide or so

614
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
it should make a five wide or so
 

615
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,069
it should make a five wide or so
area for the river with a nice

616
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
area for the river with a nice
 

617
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,990
area for the river with a nice
nice shape to its nice depth and

618
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
nice shape to its nice depth and
 

619
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,350
nice shape to its nice depth and
everything

620
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
everything
 

621
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,560
everything
so let's see what happens

622
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:19,570

 

623
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,790

[Music]

624
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
[Music]
 

625
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,110
[Music]
so far so good

626
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120

 

627
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,110

it's cutting pretty deep i'll have to

628
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120
it's cutting pretty deep i'll have to
 

629
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,710
it's cutting pretty deep i'll have to
widen the top i think

630
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720

 

631
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:41,509

although it was mostly stone there

632
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519

 

633
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:52,069

there's a ravine

634
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079

 

635
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:58,069

i think that would be good

636
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
i think that would be good
 

637
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,990
i think that would be good
and excellent

638
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
and excellent
 

639
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,189
and excellent
so let's go check out what that looks

640
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:03,199
so let's go check out what that looks
 

641
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:10,230
so let's go check out what that looks
like from above now

642
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,240

 

643
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:17,350

yeah all right i think that'll work

644
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360

 

645
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,269

so with this i'm going to

646
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279

 

647
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,509

probably put a layer of leaves

648
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
probably put a layer of leaves
 

649
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,750
probably put a layer of leaves
and then water above that and then take

650
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:27,760
and then water above that and then take
 

651
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,829
and then water above that and then take
out the leaves

652
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
out the leaves
 

653
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,509
out the leaves
i think that's the easiest way of doing

654
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:31,519
i think that's the easiest way of doing
 

655
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,030
i think that's the easiest way of doing
it

656
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040

 

657
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:42,470

that's pretty good this looks so cool

658
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
that's pretty good this looks so cool
 

659
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,670
that's pretty good this looks so cool
okay never ever record with an open

660
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
okay never ever record with an open
 

661
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,230
okay never ever record with an open
bottle

662
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
bottle
 

663
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,829
bottle
near your mic because last clip was

664
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
near your mic because last clip was
 

665
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,350
near your mic because last clip was
reverberating very very badly from that

666
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
reverberating very very badly from that
 

667
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,110
reverberating very very badly from that
even though it wasn't even close to me

668
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
even though it wasn't even close to me
 

669
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,910
even though it wasn't even close to me
it somehow picked it up

670
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
it somehow picked it up
 

671
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,189
it somehow picked it up
it's the second time i've done that now

672
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
it's the second time i've done that now
 

673
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,189
it's the second time i've done that now
but yeah i'm just going through here

674
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:03,199
but yeah i'm just going through here
 

675
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,470
but yeah i'm just going through here
with the leaves

676
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
with the leaves
 

677
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,949
with the leaves
it's i'm using leaves because they're

678
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
it's i'm using leaves because they're
 

679
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,430
it's i'm using leaves because they're
the probably one of the easiest blocks

680
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
the probably one of the easiest blocks
 

681
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,629
the probably one of the easiest blocks
to get in this game

682
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:10,639
to get in this game
 

683
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,350
to get in this game
either leaves or netherrack i would say

684
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
either leaves or netherrack i would say
 

685
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,389
either leaves or netherrack i would say
um and also when i clean these up i can

686
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
um and also when i clean these up i can
 

687
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,310
um and also when i clean these up i can
actually use shears instead of wasting a

688
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
actually use shears instead of wasting a
 

689
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,389
actually use shears instead of wasting a
diamond tool on them

690
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
diamond tool on them
 

691
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,509
diamond tool on them
which is good it's going to take me

692
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
which is good it's going to take me
 

693
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,470
which is good it's going to take me
about six

694
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
about six
 

695
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,230
about six
years or so to remove these

696
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240

 

697
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,670

so yeah i'm gonna connect it to there

698
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:35,680
so yeah i'm gonna connect it to there
 

699
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,030
so yeah i'm gonna connect it to there
then i got to put ice on top or or water

700
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,040
then i got to put ice on top or or water
 

701
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,550
then i got to put ice on top or or water
buckets i'll probably use iso just

702
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
buckets i'll probably use iso just
 

703
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,590
buckets i'll probably use iso just
because it's easier

704
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
because it's easier
 

705
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,949
because it's easier
i also went through and just cleaned it

706
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
i also went through and just cleaned it
 

707
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,389
i also went through and just cleaned it
up a bit too because there's a few

708
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
up a bit too because there's a few
 

709
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,269
up a bit too because there's a few
random blocks places i didn't want

710
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279
random blocks places i didn't want
 

711
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,670
random blocks places i didn't want
and i may as well block this too

712
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
and i may as well block this too
 

713
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,590
and i may as well block this too
and yeah so in places

714
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
and yeah so in places
 

715
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,110
and yeah so in places
the wall is a little high

716
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
the wall is a little high
 

717
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,230
the wall is a little high
actually the water is going to be at

718
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
actually the water is going to be at
 

719
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,310
actually the water is going to be at
this level so it's only a one block

720
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,320
this level so it's only a one block
 

721
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,749
this level so it's only a one block
height

722
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:03,759
height
 

723
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,590
height
but if i want i can try smooth that out

724
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
but if i want i can try smooth that out
 

725
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:12,549
but if i want i can try smooth that out
too

726
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559

 

727
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,150

just a lot of minor minor tweaking here

728
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
just a lot of minor minor tweaking here
 

729
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,750
just a lot of minor minor tweaking here
and there

730
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,760

 

731
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,510

i got the ice running all the way down

732
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
i got the ice running all the way down
 

733
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,870
i got the ice running all the way down
i'm kind of curious to see how it'll do

734
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
i'm kind of curious to see how it'll do
 

735
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,190
i'm kind of curious to see how it'll do
how much water will actually cover this

736
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
how much water will actually cover this
 

737
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,750
how much water will actually cover this
area once we break it all

738
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
area once we break it all
 

739
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,590
area once we break it all
and the water is driving me crazy

740
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,600
and the water is driving me crazy
 

741
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,950
and the water is driving me crazy
because with the

742
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:36,960
because with the
 

743
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,070
because with the
latest snapshot

744
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
latest snapshot
 

745
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,190
latest snapshot
the water can push you around really bad

746
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
the water can push you around really bad
 

747
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,270
the water can push you around really bad
and you can't get out of it sometimes

748
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
and you can't get out of it sometimes
 

749
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,510
and you can't get out of it sometimes
even

750
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520

 

751
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,750

so i'm having the water push me as we go

752
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
so i'm having the water push me as we go
 

753
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,830
so i'm having the water push me as we go
here

754
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840

 

755
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,750

seems to be working yeah it's filling it

756
00:17:59,750 --> 00:17:59,760
seems to be working yeah it's filling it
 

757
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,110
seems to be working yeah it's filling it
filling all up

758
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120

 

759
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,630

it's so hard not being able to fight the

760
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
it's so hard not being able to fight the
 

761
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,270
it's so hard not being able to fight the
current though

762
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280

 

763
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,710

okay then i have it coming out here

764
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720

 

765
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,590

let's make it to make water come all the

766
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
let's make it to make water come all the
 

767
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,150
let's make it to make water come all the
way to the edge there

768
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160
way to the edge there
 

769
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,990
way to the edge there
see like i can't i can't walk up to that

770
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
see like i can't i can't walk up to that
 

771
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,830
see like i can't i can't walk up to that
ice block or swim up to it i have to

772
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
ice block or swim up to it i have to
 

773
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:34,950
ice block or swim up to it i have to
actually ender pearl

774
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960

 

775
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,789

yeah it's that's working pretty good

776
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:36,799
yeah it's that's working pretty good
 

777
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,070
yeah it's that's working pretty good
this won't take long

778
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
this won't take long
 

779
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,909
this won't take long
very very nice

780
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919

 

781
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,990

all right guys are you ready for it

782
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
all right guys are you ready for it
 

783
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,710
all right guys are you ready for it
check it out

784
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
check it out
 

785
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,029
check it out
that is a very convincing river it's

786
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
that is a very convincing river it's
 

787
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,830
that is a very convincing river it's
hard to believe that was man-made

788
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
hard to believe that was man-made
 

789
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,110
hard to believe that was man-made
so it started there

790
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120

 

791
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,350

curves very nicely could use a little

792
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
curves very nicely could use a little
 

793
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,390
curves very nicely could use a little
touching up yet

794
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
touching up yet
 

795
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,310
touching up yet
but

796
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320

 

797
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,070

goes around very gentle curves to

798
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
goes around very gentle curves to
 

799
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,870
goes around very gentle curves to
it

800
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880

 

801
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,870

the tnt gives it a nice level of

802
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
the tnt gives it a nice level of
 

803
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,669
the tnt gives it a nice level of
randomness too

804
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
randomness too
 

805
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,950
randomness too
and yeah

806
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
and yeah
 

807
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,750
and yeah
oh i missed the spot

808
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:27,760

 

809
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,549

there we go so let's uh let's test this

810
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:30,559
there we go so let's uh let's test this
 

811
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:30,950
there we go so let's uh let's test this
out

812
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
out
 

813
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,350
out
because it's meant for a boat so let's

814
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
because it's meant for a boat so let's
 

815
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,789
because it's meant for a boat so let's
make sure we can take a boat through it

816
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
make sure we can take a boat through it
 

817
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,110
make sure we can take a boat through it
it'd be cool if at some point i get it

818
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
it'd be cool if at some point i get it
 

819
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,150
it'd be cool if at some point i get it
so

820
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,160
so
 

821
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,390
so
all the major locations in my world you

822
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,400
all the major locations in my world you
 

823
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,430
all the major locations in my world you
can get to by boat

824
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440

 

825
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,270

yeah moving full speed here no problem

826
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
yeah moving full speed here no problem
 

827
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,390
yeah moving full speed here no problem
will we be able to get around here

828
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400

 

829
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,830

oh man just grazed it just grazed it

830
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:03,840
oh man just grazed it just grazed it
 

831
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,950
oh man just grazed it just grazed it
that's so cool it's a nice ride

832
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960

 

833
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,710

this is the other spot we were working

834
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
this is the other spot we were working
 

835
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,310
this is the other spot we were working
at

836
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
at
 

837
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,990
at
i gotta slow down a little bit there i

838
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
i gotta slow down a little bit there i
 

839
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,110
i gotta slow down a little bit there i
think

840
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120

 

841
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,549

very cool our overhang

842
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:22,559

 

843
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,350

comes out to here

844
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360

 

845
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,789

that's cool i like that

846
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
that's cool i like that
 

847
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,590
that's cool i like that
so for that river we just made i i'm

848
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:33,600
so for that river we just made i i'm
 

849
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,110
so for that river we just made i i'm
gonna try to get some trees running

850
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
gonna try to get some trees running
 

851
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,110
gonna try to get some trees running
along it too i think that'd be cool

852
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
along it too i think that'd be cool
 

853
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,950
along it too i think that'd be cool
and some vines hanging down maybe some

854
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
and some vines hanging down maybe some
 

855
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,149
and some vines hanging down maybe some
vines in the overhang there

856
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
vines in the overhang there
 

857
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,909
vines in the overhang there
um this here i think is a pretty big

858
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
um this here i think is a pretty big
 

859
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,190
um this here i think is a pretty big
