uh so the thing about it though i'm
 

69
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,310
uh so the thing about it though i'm
having a hard time finding the location

70
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
having a hard time finding the location
 

71
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,069
having a hard time finding the location
to build it

72
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
to build it
 

73
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,030
to build it
uh because the way it works in these

74
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
uh because the way it works in these
 

75
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,630
uh because the way it works in these
flower forests

76
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
flower forests
 

77
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,830
flower forests
and i was just doing a little bit of

78
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
and i was just doing a little bit of
 

79
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,550
and i was just doing a little bit of
testing it's

80
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
testing it's
 

81
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,469
testing it's
the flowers they always generate in the

82
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
the flowers they always generate in the
 

83
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,670
the flowers they always generate in the
same spot

84
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
same spot
 

85
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,749
same spot
and it's hard to find a place where you

86
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
and it's hard to find a place where you
 

87
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,510
and it's hard to find a place where you
get where you get all the different

88
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
get where you get all the different
 

89
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,030
get where you get all the different
types of flowers in a very small space

90
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
types of flowers in a very small space
 

91
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,630
types of flowers in a very small space
um and where where you see the flowers

92
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
um and where where you see the flowers
 

93
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,270
um and where where you see the flowers
right now

94
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
right now
 

95
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,749
right now
is not where they generate it's like

96
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
is not where they generate it's like
 

97
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,030
is not where they generate it's like
random

98
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
random
 

99
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,430
random
this the flowers that's that

100
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
this the flowers that's that
 

101
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,949

explain yourself etho what are you

102
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
explain yourself etho what are you
 

103
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,350
explain yourself etho what are you
saying uh the flowers that you see in a

104
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
saying uh the flowers that you see in a
 

105
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,869
saying uh the flowers that you see in a
flower forest are not

106
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
flower forest are not

flower forest are not
what spawns there when you grow them uh

108
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
what spawns there when you grow them uh
 

109
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,630
what spawns there when you grow them uh
usually i think so

110
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640

 

111
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,550

i guess we just try somewhere how about

112
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
i guess we just try somewhere how about
 

113
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,150
i guess we just try somewhere how about
we we go over here

114
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
we we go over here
 

115
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,350
we we go over here
i could be wrong on that actually

116
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
i could be wrong on that actually
 

117
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,150
i could be wrong on that actually
so these are the red ones see if we get

118
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
so these are the red ones see if we get
 

119
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,070
so these are the red ones see if we get
red ones

120
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
red ones
 

121
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,750
red ones
i think this just grew here this purple

122
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
i think this just grew here this purple
 

123
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,750
i think this just grew here this purple
one yeah so this is not like where you

124
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
one yeah so this is not like where you
 

125
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,949
one yeah so this is not like where you
find these

126
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
find these
 

127
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,630
find these
if you grow them here and if we break

128
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
if you grow them here and if we break
 

129
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,509
if you grow them here and if we break
these

130
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
these
 

131
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,750
these
we will always get those in that spot

132
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
we will always get those in that spot
 

133
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,350
we will always get those in that spot
and that block

134
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
and that block
 

135
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,990
and that block
see we just got another one there so we

136
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
see we just got another one there so we
 

137
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,430
see we just got another one there so we
got to find

138
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
got to find
 

139
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,070
got to find
where to build this thing and apparently

140
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
where to build this thing and apparently
 

141
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,550
where to build this thing and apparently
you can

142
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
you can
 

143
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,070
you can
even get dandelions here i didn't

144
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
even get dandelions here i didn't
 

145
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,990
even get dandelions here i didn't
realize that i found a spot that grew

146
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
realize that i found a spot that grew
 

147
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,910
realize that i found a spot that grew
dandelions

148
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
dandelions
 

149
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,949

they don't spawn in the biome anywhere
 

153
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,670
they don't spawn in the biome anywhere

all the flowers that were here before
 

173
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,589
all the flowers that were here before
pretty much so that we can get a good

174
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
pretty much so that we can get a good
 

175
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,710
pretty much so that we can get a good
idea

176
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
idea
 

177
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,710
idea
of what's gonna grow here without them

178
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
of what's gonna grow here without them
 

179
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,750
of what's gonna grow here without them
you know like

180
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
you know like
 

181
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,710
you know like
affecting or confusing us like what

182
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
affecting or confusing us like what
 

183
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,309
affecting or confusing us like what
grows where

184
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
grows where
 

185
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,789
grows where
um and i figured it would be best to do

186
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
um and i figured it would be best to do
 

187
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,550
um and i figured it would be best to do
like a long narrow form

188
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
like a long narrow form
 

189
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,509
like a long narrow form
instead of a like a square one so that

190
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
instead of a like a square one so that
 

191
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:45,990
instead of a like a square one so that
we can

192
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
we can
 

193
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,190
we can
cover as much area as possible

194
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
cover as much area as possible
 

195
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,830
cover as much area as possible
okay we got poppies here poppies

196
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
okay we got poppies here poppies
 

197
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,270
okay we got poppies here poppies
and i'm gonna try

00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
and i'm gonna try
 

199
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,869
and i'm gonna try
i'm gonna pick the spot that seems to

200
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
i'm gonna pick the spot that seems to
 

201
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,390
i'm gonna pick the spot that seems to
give us

202
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
give us
 

203
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,630
give us
um all the different types in as little

204
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
um all the different types in as little
 

205
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,229
um all the different types in as little
area as possible we might have to build

206
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
area as possible we might have to build
 

207
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,509
area as possible we might have to build
a pretty big farm

208
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
a pretty big farm
 

209
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,670
a pretty big farm
but we will see okay so i found a pretty

210
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
but we will see okay so i found a pretty
 

211
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,630
but we will see okay so i found a pretty
nice spot

212
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
nice spot
 

213
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,789
nice spot
right here this looks like where we're

214
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
right here this looks like where we're
 

215
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,990
right here this looks like where we're
gonna build it

216
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
gonna build it
 

217
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,589
gonna build it
i drew lots of flowers so we could

218
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
i drew lots of flowers so we could
 

219
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,110
i drew lots of flowers so we could
clearly see

220
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
clearly see
 

221
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,509
clearly see
uh where they where they grow which what

222
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
uh where they where they grow which what
 

223
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,629
uh where they where they grow which what
shape they make

224
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
shape they make
 

225
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,230
shape they make
uh in their growth pattern and like from

226
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
uh in their growth pattern and like from
 

227
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,310
uh in their growth pattern and like from
here to these poppies

228
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
here to these poppies
 

229
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,150
here to these poppies
is good this is great because we have

230
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
is good this is great because we have
 

231
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,390
is good this is great because we have
every single type except for dandelions

232
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
every single type except for dandelions
 

233
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,510
every single type except for dandelions
in that we have poppies we have these

234
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
in that we have poppies we have these
 

235
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,909
in that we have poppies we have these
helium or whatever the as are blue it's

236
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
helium or whatever the as are blue it's
 

237
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,230
helium or whatever the as are blue it's
we have the red tulips orange tulips

white tulips the pink tulips
 

241
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,430
white tulips the pink tulips
and then we have the oxide daisies

242
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
and then we have the oxide daisies
 

243
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,310
and then we have the oxide daisies
and that's about it right just

244
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
and that's about it right just
 

245
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,590
and that's about it right just
dandelions we're missing dandelions

246
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
dandelions we're missing dandelions
 

247
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,510
dandelions we're missing dandelions
but i haven't found another spot for

248
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
but i haven't found another spot for
 

249
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,710
but i haven't found another spot for
them this is the only one on this

250
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
them this is the only one on this
 

251
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,030
them this is the only one on this
mountain top that i found a spot so

252
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
mountain top that i found a spot so
 

253
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,390
mountain top that i found a spot so
not going to worry about them so my plan

254
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
not going to worry about them so my plan
 

255
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,870
not going to worry about them so my plan
is to flatten out the top of this a bit

256
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
is to flatten out the top of this a bit
 

257
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,430
is to flatten out the top of this a bit
and then

258
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
and then
 

259
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,590
and then
start setting up some pistons or

260
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
start setting up some pistons or
 

261
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,870
start setting up some pistons or
dispensers or some

262
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
dispensers or some
 

263
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,830
dispensers or some
some stuff like that and here it is

264
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
some stuff like that and here it is
 

265
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,830
some stuff like that and here it is
everybody so i just finished building

266
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
everybody so i just finished building
 

267
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,629
everybody so i just finished building
the flower farm tested it out for a bit

268
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
the flower farm tested it out for a bit
 

269
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,790
the flower farm tested it out for a bit
and it seems to be pretty good actually

270
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
and it seems to be pretty good actually
 

271
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,310
and it seems to be pretty good actually
uh we'll try it again here in just a

272
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
uh we'll try it again here in just a
 

273
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,909
uh we'll try it again here in just a
second so it

274
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
second so it
 

275
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,590
second so it
is fully automatic it will grow

276
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
is fully automatic it will grow
 

277
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,350
is fully automatic it will grow
the flowers then it will harvest them

278
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
the flowers then it will harvest them
 

279
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,189
the flowers then it will harvest them
and then it will collect them and store

280
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
and then it will collect them and store
 

281
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,710
and then it will collect them and store
them in chests so

282
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
them in chests so
 

283
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,950
them in chests so
all i gotta do is flip a lever and it

284
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
all i gotta do is flip a lever and it
 

285
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,110
all i gotta do is flip a lever and it
does its thing pretty much

286
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
does its thing pretty much
 

287
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,749
does its thing pretty much
i just emptied these all there's nothing

288
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
i just emptied these all there's nothing
 

289
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,710
i just emptied these all there's nothing
in them

290
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
in them
 

291
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,870
in them
so let's see what we get with however

292
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
so let's see what we get with however
 

293
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,029
so let's see what we get with however
long we run it here

294
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
long we run it here
 

295
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,270
long we run it here
um redstone it's always like a

296
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
um redstone it's always like a
 

297
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,469
um redstone it's always like a
parkour experience trying to get

298
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
parkour experience trying to get
 

299
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,390
parkour experience trying to get
out of it and in it and yeah anyway

300
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
out of it and in it and yeah anyway
 

301
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,550
out of it and in it and yeah anyway
so here's the lever

302
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
so here's the lever
 

303
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,150
so here's the lever
and i'll explain it as it runs for a bit

304
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160

 

305
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,029

pretty cool so all it is is you got the

306
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
pretty cool so all it is is you got the
 

307
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:05,990
pretty cool so all it is is you got the
grass

308
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
grass
 

309
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,749
grass
pistons push the grass to the left and

310
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
pistons push the grass to the left and
 

311
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,430
pistons push the grass to the left and
then those ones push them to the right

312
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
then those ones push them to the right
 

313
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,309
then those ones push them to the right
and

314
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
and
 

315
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,790
and
every time the blocks shift it forces

316
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
every time the blocks shift it forces
 

317
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,430
every time the blocks shift it forces
whatever's planted on them to pop off

318
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
whatever's planted on them to pop off
 

319
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,790
whatever's planted on them to pop off
and then we got all these mine carts

320
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
and then we got all these mine carts
 

321
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,150
and then we got all these mine carts
running underneath these hopper mine

322
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
running underneath these hopper mine
 

323
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,790
running underneath these hopper mine
carts

324
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
carts
 

325
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,230
carts
they have they can pick up

326
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
they have they can pick up
 

327
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,950
they have they can pick up
whatever's above through the blocks and

328
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
whatever's above through the blocks and
 

329
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,070
whatever's above through the blocks and
then they drop them off

330
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
then they drop them off
 

331
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,110
then they drop them off
at these hoppers i'm curious to see if

332
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
at these hoppers i'm curious to see if
 

333
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,749
at these hoppers i'm curious to see if
they'll be able to keep up i'm not sure

334
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
they'll be able to keep up i'm not sure
 

335
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,950
they'll be able to keep up i'm not sure
this one's been here for a long time

336
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
this one's been here for a long time
 

337
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,029
this one's been here for a long time
why is it taking so long to unload

338
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039

 

339
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,029

and why only this one oh you know what

340
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
and why only this one oh you know what
 

341
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,070
and why only this one oh you know what
maybe yeah look at this it looks like

342
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
maybe yeah look at this it looks like
 

343
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,990
maybe yeah look at this it looks like
the flowers are all kind of going

344
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
the flowers are all kind of going
 

345
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,870
the flowers are all kind of going
to the left side a bit i wonder if

346
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
to the left side a bit i wonder if
 

347
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,390
to the left side a bit i wonder if
there's a preference to that

348
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
there's a preference to that
 

349
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,749
there's a preference to that
like which way they hop the right side

350
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
like which way they hop the right side
 

351
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,350
like which way they hop the right side
doesn't have many

352
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
doesn't have many
 

353
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,749
doesn't have many
left side has a ton

354
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759

 

355
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,189

there might be some tweaking and stuff

356
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
there might be some tweaking and stuff
 

357
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,830
there might be some tweaking and stuff
we need to do this with this

358
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
we need to do this with this
 

359
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,029
we need to do this with this
all right did this finish yet not yet

360
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
all right did this finish yet not yet
 

361
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,150
all right did this finish yet not yet
or did it just pick up more i'm not sure

362
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
or did it just pick up more i'm not sure
 

363
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,790
or did it just pick up more i'm not sure
all right anyway we got all these

364
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
all right anyway we got all these
 

365
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,710
all right anyway we got all these
dispensers on the left and right side of

366
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
dispensers on the left and right side of
 

367
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,510
dispensers on the left and right side of
the thing

368
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
the thing
 

369
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,510
the thing
these are filled with bone meal and

370
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
these are filled with bone meal and
 

371
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,230
these are filled with bone meal and
there is one two three per side four

372
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
there is one two three per side four
 

373
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,950
there is one two three per side four
five six

374
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
five six
 

375
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,150
five six
total

376
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160

 

377
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,430

uh and the chests are filling up with

378
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
uh and the chests are filling up with
 

379
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,230
uh and the chests are filling up with
the drops as

380
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
the drops as
 

381
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,350
the drops as
the hopper minecarts drop them off seems

382
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
the hopper minecarts drop them off seems
 

383
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,070
the hopper minecarts drop them off seems
like they can keep up pretty good

384
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
like they can keep up pretty good
 

385
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,510
like they can keep up pretty good
i actually built another

386
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
i actually built another
 

387
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,309
i actually built another
collection area over on this side so

388
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
collection area over on this side so
 

389
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:44,710
collection area over on this side so
that

390
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
that
 

391
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,629
that
we could uh have two hopper mine carts

392
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
we could uh have two hopper mine carts
 

393
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,830
we could uh have two hopper mine carts
going back and forth and they would

394
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
going back and forth and they would
 

395
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,390
going back and forth and they would
bounce off each other

396
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
bounce off each other
 

397
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,550
bounce off each other
like if it couldn't keep up that's why i

398
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
like if it couldn't keep up that's why i
 

399
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,670
like if it couldn't keep up that's why i
put these ones in here

400
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
put these ones in here
 

401
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,270
put these ones in here
but it seems like it's it's good with

402
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
but it seems like it's it's good with
 

403
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,790
but it seems like it's it's good with
just one minecart so i might be able to

404
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
just one minecart so i might be able to
 

405
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,430
just one minecart so i might be able to
remove these

406
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440

 

407
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,150

and yeah it seems like it's okay

408
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
and yeah it seems like it's okay
 

409
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,830
and yeah it seems like it's okay
let's let's shut it off for a moment and

410
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
let's let's shut it off for a moment and
 

411
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,189
let's let's shut it off for a moment and
make sure it's picking up everything

412
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
make sure it's picking up everything
 

413
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,830
make sure it's picking up everything
because i'm not sure if it actually

414
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840
because i'm not sure if it actually
 

415
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,830
because i'm not sure if it actually
is

416
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
is
 

417
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,189
is
all right

418
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199

 

419
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,430

all right yeah you can see some stuff

420
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
all right yeah you can see some stuff
 

421
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,110
all right yeah you can see some stuff
disappearing

422
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
disappearing
 

423
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,430
disappearing
looks like the minecart at this row is

424
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
looks like the minecart at this row is
 

425
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,029
looks like the minecart at this row is
dropping stuff off at the moment it

426
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
dropping stuff off at the moment it
 

427
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:25,990
dropping stuff off at the moment it
should come by to pick

428
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
should come by to pick
 

429
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,150
should come by to pick
them up or you know it might be getting

430
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
them up or you know it might be getting
 

431
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,710
them up or you know it might be getting
backed up

432
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
backed up
 

433
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,469
backed up
like as i run it longer here oh there it

434
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
like as i run it longer here oh there it
 

435
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,389
like as i run it longer here oh there it
goes

436
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
goes
 

437
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,870
goes
this one for sure is taking the longest

438
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
this one for sure is taking the longest
 

439
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,509
this one for sure is taking the longest
though

440
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
though
 

441
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,029
though
this row for some reason that's kind of

442
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
this row for some reason that's kind of
 

443
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,990
this row for some reason that's kind of
weird

444
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000

 

445
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,070

um where is that mine cart

446
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080

 

447
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,829

okay it's over here oh it just picked up

448
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
okay it's over here oh it just picked up
 

449
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,829
okay it's over here oh it just picked up
a lot of stuff

450
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:52,839

 

451
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,350

um see

452
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
um see
 

453
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,790
um see
the thing is there's more than five

454
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
the thing is there's more than five
 

455
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,470
the thing is there's more than five
different types of flowers so

456
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
different types of flowers so
 

457
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,829
different types of flowers so
on a single pass i don't think the

458
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
on a single pass i don't think the
 

459
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,150
on a single pass i don't think the
minecart can get them all

460
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160

 

461
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,509

all right let's see if it'll pick up the

462
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
all right let's see if it'll pick up the
 

463
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,790
all right let's see if it'll pick up the
rest of these because i'm not sure

464
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
rest of these because i'm not sure
 

465
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,550
rest of these because i'm not sure
hopper minecarts can have trouble

466
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
hopper minecarts can have trouble
 

467
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,990
hopper minecarts can have trouble
picking them up if they're like right

468
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
picking them up if they're like right
 

469
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,870
picking them up if they're like right
along the edge like this

470
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
along the edge like this
 

471
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,269
along the edge like this
which i think might be what is happening

472
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
which i think might be what is happening
 

473
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,590
which i think might be what is happening
yeah then grab them

474
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600

 

475
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,430

should be on this end

476
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440

 

477
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,870

i think it's bouncing back and forth

478
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
i think it's bouncing back and forth
 

479
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,790
i think it's bouncing back and forth
like he can't grab anything else yeah

480
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
like he can't grab anything else yeah
 

481
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,750
like he can't grab anything else yeah
okay so all this stuff on this edge is

482
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
okay so all this stuff on this edge is
 

483
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,070
okay so all this stuff on this edge is
not getting picked up for some reason

484
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
not getting picked up for some reason
 

485
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,070
not getting picked up for some reason
i'm guessing it's it's like the north

486
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
i'm guessing it's it's like the north
 

487
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,990
i'm guessing it's it's like the north
south or west south or east south or

488
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
south or west south or east south or
 

489
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,110
south or west south or east south or
whatever

490
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
whatever
 

491
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,910
whatever
i forget what the the rule was uh but

492
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
i forget what the the rule was uh but
 

493
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,710
i forget what the the rule was uh but
the negative

494
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
the negative
 

495
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,990
the negative
towards the negative

496
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000

 

497
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,590

right yeah this is negative so that that

498
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
right yeah this is negative so that that
 

499
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,670
right yeah this is negative so that that
direction has a problem compared to

500
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
direction has a problem compared to
 

501
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,630
direction has a problem compared to
towards the positive

502
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
towards the positive
 

503
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,310
towards the positive
okay so just a couple more things about

504
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
okay so just a couple more things about
 

505
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,070
okay so just a couple more things about
this farm and then we'll go do something

506
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
this farm and then we'll go do something
 

507
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,550
this farm and then we'll go do something

uh turns out the dispenser
underneath here was not working at all

512
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
underneath here was not working at all
 

513
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,710
underneath here was not working at all
so got that fixed

514
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
so got that fixed
 

515
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,470
so got that fixed
and also i never really explained what

516
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
and also i never really explained what
 

517
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,230
and also i never really explained what
this is this is a monostable circuit if

518
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
this is this is a monostable circuit if
 

519
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,269
this is this is a monostable circuit if
you couldn't tell

520
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
you couldn't tell
 

521
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,870
you couldn't tell
that makes it so it just sends a quick

522
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
that makes it so it just sends a quick
 

523
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,829
that makes it so it just sends a quick
short pulse uh to the whole thing that

524
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
short pulse uh to the whole thing that
 

525
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,430
short pulse uh to the whole thing that
way the pistons don't stay

526
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
way the pistons don't stay
 

527
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,670
way the pistons don't stay
extended for very long they just push it

528
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
extended for very long they just push it
 

529
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,269
extended for very long they just push it
and then go back

530
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
and then go back
 

531
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,910
and then go back
and then this is the timer right here

532
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
and then this is the timer right here
 

533
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,350
and then this is the timer right here
and let's take a look

534
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
and let's take a look
 

535
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,069
and let's take a look
at those mine carts are really annoying

536
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
at those mine carts are really annoying
 

537
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,190
at those mine carts are really annoying
me

538
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
me
 

539
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,949
me
i should maybe make a shutoff for those

540
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
i should maybe make a shutoff for those
 

541
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,790
i should maybe make a shutoff for those
as well

542
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
as well
 

543
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,590
as well
uh this is the thing i'm using to

544
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600

 

545
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,069

make the minecarts unload so when they

546
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
make the minecarts unload so when they
 

547
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,829
make the minecarts unload so when they
arrive here

548
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
arrive here
 

549
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,829
arrive here
uh when stuff is passing through the

550
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
uh when stuff is passing through the
 

551
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,990
uh when stuff is passing through the
item hopper the comparator turns on

552
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
item hopper the comparator turns on
 

553
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,630
item hopper the comparator turns on
goes to redstone torch then up to this

554
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
goes to redstone torch then up to this
 

555
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,110
goes to redstone torch then up to this
block

556
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
block
 

557
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,190
block
to the left and then

558
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
to the left and then
 

559
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,949
to the left and then
when this block is powered the power

560
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
when this block is powered the power
 

561
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,350
when this block is powered the power
rail's on the minecart has something in

562
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
rail's on the minecart has something in
 

563
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,550
rail's on the minecart has something in
it

564
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
it
 

565
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,269
it
uh this turns on this turns off this

566
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
uh this turns on this turns off this
 

567
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,190
uh this turns on this turns off this
turns off and the power rail turns off

568
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
turns off and the power rail turns off
 

569
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,350
turns off and the power rail turns off
as well so the minecart stops at this

570
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
as well so the minecart stops at this
 

571
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,670
as well so the minecart stops at this
spot to unload um

572
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
spot to unload um
 

573
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,509
spot to unload um
yeah so that's about it uh oh yeah and

574
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
yeah so that's about it uh oh yeah and
 

575
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,350
yeah so that's about it uh oh yeah and
this is what we got for running it this

576
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
this is what we got for running it this
 

577
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,150
this is what we got for running it this
is like

578
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
is like
 

579
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,630
is like
two minutes of running the sad thing

580
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
two minutes of running the sad thing
 

581
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,269
two minutes of running the sad thing
about

582
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
about
 

583
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,150
about
this farm is it's like too good it's too

584
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
this farm is it's like too good it's too
 

585
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,230
this farm is it's like too good it's too
good it's kind of fun to watch it do it

586
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
good it's kind of fun to watch it do it
 

587
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,750
good it's kind of fun to watch it do it
do its thing here but we have enough

588
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
do its thing here but we have enough
 

589
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,670
do its thing here but we have enough
flowers already that will probably last

590
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
flowers already that will probably last
 

591
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,190
flowers already that will probably last
forever there's a definitely a

592
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
forever there's a definitely a
 

593
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,110
forever there's a definitely a
preference towards the pink tulips

594
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
preference towards the pink tulips
 

595
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,190
preference towards the pink tulips
although one of the dispensers wasn't

596
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
although one of the dispensers wasn't
 

597
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,829
although one of the dispensers wasn't
working so

598
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839

 

599
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,269

yeah like in this area here it looks

600
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
yeah like in this area here it looks
 

601
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,470
yeah like in this area here it looks
like there's red and orange tulips there

602
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
like there's red and orange tulips there
 

603
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,430
like there's red and orange tulips there
and maybe some white ones that we

604
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
and maybe some white ones that we
 

605
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,030
and maybe some white ones that we
weren't getting

606
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
weren't getting
 

607
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,030
weren't getting
um but yeah pretty cool

608
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
um but yeah pretty cool
 

609
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,030
um but yeah pretty cool
the reason i i built this by the way i

610
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
the reason i i built this by the way i
 

611
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,470
the reason i i built this by the way i
was like walking around

612
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
was like walking around
 

613
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,949
was like walking around
the surface of like above the man tape

614
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
the surface of like above the man tape
 

615
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:05,910
the surface of like above the man tape
and

616
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
and
 

617
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,230
and
i got to thinking you know just if i put

618
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
i got to thinking you know just if i put
 

619
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,990
i got to thinking you know just if i put
some flowers around here some bushes

620
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
some flowers around here some bushes
 

621
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,590
some flowers around here some bushes
it would start to look a lot nicer and

622
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
it would start to look a lot nicer and
 

623
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,829
it would start to look a lot nicer and
it's like i don't have any flowers so

624
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
it's like i don't have any flowers so
 

625
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,509
it's like i don't have any flowers so
that's why i built the farm here so

626
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
that's why i built the farm here so
 

627
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,190
that's why i built the farm here so
maybe

628
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
maybe
 

629
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,190
maybe
we'll start adding details to the

630
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
we'll start adding details to the
 

631
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,389
we'll start adding details to the
surface of our world

632
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
surface of our world
 

633
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,310
surface of our world
a little later try to make things look

634
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
a little later try to make things look
 

635
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,509
a little later try to make things look
nicer

636
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519
nicer
 

637
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,710
nicer
oh yeah and uh i let this thing run and

638
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
oh yeah and uh i let this thing run and
 

639
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,550
oh yeah and uh i let this thing run and
it ran out of bone meal and all the ones

640
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
it ran out of bone meal and all the ones
 

641
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,590
it ran out of bone meal and all the ones
that were

642
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
that were
 

643
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,190
that were
on that left side they they kept

644
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
on that left side they they kept
 

645
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,710
on that left side they they kept
bouncing off and then eventually they

646
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
bouncing off and then eventually they
 

647
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,990
bouncing off and then eventually they
all got picked up

648
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
all got picked up
 

649
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,590
all got picked up
too so it wasn't a problem

650
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600

 

651
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,269

get your ugly nose out of the hole
 

679
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,430
get your ugly nose out of the hole
all right everybody so today we are

680
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
all right everybody so today we are
 

681
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,430
all right everybody so today we are
going to be doing something

682
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440
going to be doing something
 

683
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,190
going to be doing something
starting something that i've wanted to

684
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
starting something that i've wanted to
 

685
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,590
starting something that i've wanted to
do for a very very long time

686
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
do for a very very long time
 

687
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,670
do for a very very long time
in minecraft and i just i just never did

688
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
in minecraft and i just i just never did
 

689
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,710
in minecraft and i just i just never did
it

690
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
it
 

691
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,910
it
i tried to do it i just never really

692
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
i tried to do it i just never really
 

693
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,269
i tried to do it i just never really
got dedicated into it i guess um

694
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
got dedicated into it i guess um
 

695
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,750
got dedicated into it i guess um
for the longest time i've wanted to make

696
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
for the longest time i've wanted to make
 

697
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,910
for the longest time i've wanted to make
super horses in this game and i

698
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
super horses in this game and i
 

699
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,470
super horses in this game and i
like see if i can breed two crummy

700
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
like see if i can breed two crummy
 

701
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,990
like see if i can breed two crummy
horses and get them to the point where

702
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
horses and get them to the point where
 

703
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,430
horses and get them to the point where
they're really really good uh

704
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
they're really really good uh
 

705
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,750
they're really really good uh
this is something i sort of tried to do

706
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
this is something i sort of tried to do
 

707
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,389
this is something i sort of tried to do
on the minecraft server originally

708
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
on the minecraft server originally
 

709
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,230
on the minecraft server originally
but the idea just never really worked

710
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
but the idea just never really worked
 

711
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,189
but the idea just never really worked
out because i couldn't test things

712
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
out because i couldn't test things
 

713
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,269
out because i couldn't test things
accurately because of little bits of

714
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
accurately because of little bits of
 

715
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,750
accurately because of little bits of
latency and and whatnot

716
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
latency and and whatnot
 

717
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,269
latency and and whatnot
but in my single player world here it

718
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:07,279
but in my single player world here it
 

719
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,870
but in my single player world here it
should be pretty easy

720
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
should be pretty easy
 

721
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,470
should be pretty easy
two three four five six seven eight

722
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
two three four five six seven eight
 

723
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,670
two three four five six seven eight
um two three four five six

724
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:15,680
um two three four five six
 

725
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,030
um two three four five six
seven eight so basically if you guys

726
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
seven eight so basically if you guys
 

727
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,949
seven eight so basically if you guys
remember i'm setting up the jump wall

728
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
remember i'm setting up the jump wall
 

729
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,949
remember i'm setting up the jump wall
that i had on minecraft server

730
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:22,959
that i had on minecraft server
 

731
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,710
that i had on minecraft server
where we can test the different heights

732
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720
where we can test the different heights
 

733
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,870
where we can test the different heights
that the horses jump

734
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
that the horses jump
 

735
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,750
that the horses jump
and my strategy my plan to this whole

736
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:29,760
and my strategy my plan to this whole
 

737
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,949
and my strategy my plan to this whole
thing

738
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
thing
 

739
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,550
thing
is to

740
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560

 

741
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,110

breed two separate lines of horses

742
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
breed two separate lines of horses
 

743
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,389
breed two separate lines of horses
basically i'm going to breed

744
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
basically i'm going to breed
 

745
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,949
basically i'm going to breed
one line for speed and then one line for

746
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
one line for speed and then one line for
 

747
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,590
one line for speed and then one line for
jumping

748
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
jumping
 

749
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,870
jumping
we're going to start with the jumping

750
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:42,880
we're going to start with the jumping
 

751
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,389
we're going to start with the jumping
just because i think it's going to be

752
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
just because i think it's going to be
 

753
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,189
just because i think it's going to be
easier to

754
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:45,199
easier to
 

755
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,389
easier to
figure out it's a lot easier to visually

756
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,399
figure out it's a lot easier to visually
 

757
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,710
figure out it's a lot easier to visually
see

758
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720

 

759
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,310

what what their jumping height is and

760
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
what what their jumping height is and
 

761
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,910
what what their jumping height is and
you don't need to build anything too

762
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
you don't need to build anything too
 

763
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,350
you don't need to build anything too
fancy or

764
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
fancy or
 

765
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,269
fancy or
or question whether it's accurate or

766
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
or question whether it's accurate or
 

767
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,870
or question whether it's accurate or
anything like that so we'll start with

768
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:58,880
anything like that so we'll start with
 

769
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,350
anything like that so we'll start with
this

770
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
this
 

771
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,269
this
the jumping and then

772
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
the jumping and then
 

773
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,750
the jumping and then
we'll breed them for speed and then once

774
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
we'll breed them for speed and then once
 

775
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,790
we'll breed them for speed and then once
we got a super

776
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
we got a super
 

777
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,710
we got a super
fast horse or a bunch of super fast

778
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
fast horse or a bunch of super fast
 

779
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,829
fast horse or a bunch of super fast
horses and a bunch of super high jumping

780
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:10,839
horses and a bunch of super high jumping
 

781
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:11,990
horses and a bunch of super high jumping
horses

782
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
horses
 

783
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,310
horses
we will then try to combine them to get

784
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,320
we will then try to combine them to get
 

785
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,829
we will then try to combine them to get
a super fast high jumping horse

786
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
a super fast high jumping horse
 

787
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,750
a super fast high jumping horse
yeah i think i'm doing this right these

788
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:19,760
yeah i think i'm doing this right these
 

789
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,069
yeah i think i'm doing this right these
snow slabs these are really important

790
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
snow slabs these are really important
 

791
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,629
snow slabs these are really important
i'm using them because they allow us to

792
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
i'm using them because they allow us to
 

793
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,550
i'm using them because they allow us to
go by eighths of the block which is

794
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
go by eighths of the block which is
 

795
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,470
go by eighths of the block which is
about the highest accuracy you can get

796
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
about the highest accuracy you can get
 

797
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,310
about the highest accuracy you can get
in minecraft

798
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
in minecraft
 

799
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,389
in minecraft
for vertical height so it says 68.0

800
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
for vertical height so it says 68.0
 

801
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,389
for vertical height so it says 68.0
every slab adds a one or a 0.125 to the

802
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
every slab adds a one or a 0.125 to the
 

803
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,990
every slab adds a one or a 0.125 to the
block height

804
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
block height
 

805
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,949
block height
with this set up so we should be able to

806
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959
with this set up so we should be able to
 

807
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,749
with this set up so we should be able to
figure this out very accurately

808
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:45,759
figure this out very accurately
 

809
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,150
figure this out very accurately
and so the reason i'm not like doing the

810
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
and so the reason i'm not like doing the
 

811
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,030
and so the reason i'm not like doing the
two

812
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,040
two
 

813
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,870
two
stats at the same time on the horses

814
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880
stats at the same time on the horses
 

815
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,949
stats at the same time on the horses
it's because it's very unlikely

816
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
it's because it's very unlikely
 

817
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,310
it's because it's very unlikely
especially when you get to the higher

818
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,320
especially when you get to the higher
 

819
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,710
especially when you get to the higher
extremes with the horse

820
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
extremes with the horse
 

821
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,389
extremes with the horse
speed or jumping that you're going to

822
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399
speed or jumping that you're going to
 

823
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,030
speed or jumping that you're going to
get both stats to be

824
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
get both stats to be
 

825
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,230
get both stats to be
better on the baby horse

826
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
better on the baby horse
 

827
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,590
better on the baby horse
so oops

828
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,600
so oops
 

829
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,629
so oops
so we're gonna just try one stat at a

830
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:10,639
so we're gonna just try one stat at a
 

831
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,350
so we're gonna just try one stat at a
time

832
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
time
 

833
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,710
time
if that goes well then we will try for

834
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:14,720
if that goes well then we will try for
 

835
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,870
if that goes well then we will try for
the very rare chance of getting

836
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
the very rare chance of getting
 

837
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,590
the very rare chance of getting
two stats to be better together which

838
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
two stats to be better together which
 

839
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,150
two stats to be better together which
is very rare but we will we will see

840
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
is very rare but we will we will see
 

841
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,310
is very rare but we will we will see
what happens with that

842
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
what happens with that
 

843
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,269
what happens with that
oh we're out anyway i'm going to finish

844
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
oh we're out anyway i'm going to finish

00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
been breeding over the past few episodes
 

849
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,749
been breeding over the past few episodes
we will

850
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
we will
 

851
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,069
we will
bring them here and start testing them

852
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
bring them here and start testing them
 

853
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,829
bring them here and start testing them
out and uh

854
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
out and uh
 

855
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,310
out and uh
and labeling them i guess sounds wrong i

856
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
and labeling them i guess sounds wrong i
 

857
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,749
and labeling them i guess sounds wrong i
think we'll keep them at the village

858
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
think we'll keep them at the village
 

859
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,110
think we'll keep them at the village
here too

here too
 

861
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,189
here too
maybe we'll make a little some stalls

862
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
maybe we'll make a little some stalls
 

863
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,790
maybe we'll make a little some stalls
for them

864
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
for them
 

865
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,310
for them
over along this fence or something but

866
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
over along this fence or something but
 

867
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,470
over along this fence or something but
actually the the reason i built the gold

868
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
actually the the reason i built the gold
 

869
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,150
actually the the reason i built the gold
farm originally was for this

870
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
farm originally was for this
 

871
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,150
farm originally was for this
project i wanted the gold farm for

872
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
project i wanted the gold farm for
 

873
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,069
project i wanted the gold farm for
golden carrots so that i could

874
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
golden carrots so that i could
 

875
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,189
golden carrots so that i could
breed them easily and just

876
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
breed them easily and just
 

877
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,390
breed them easily and just
up until this point i still haven't done

878
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
up until this point i still haven't done
 

879

i'm very excited to finally do this
 

883
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,470
i'm very excited to finally do this
project and we'll see what happens with

884
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,480
project and we'll see what happens with
 

885
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,470
project and we'll see what happens with
it

886
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
it
 

887
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,429
it
aha so let me show you guys how this is

888
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
aha so let me show you guys how this is
 

889
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,029
aha so let me show you guys how this is
going to go

890
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
going to go
 

891
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,350
going to go
because organization is going to be so

892
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,360
because organization is going to be so
 

893
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,789
because organization is going to be so
important to this

894
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
important to this
 

895
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,870
important to this
if we don't keep track of the horses and

896
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
if we don't keep track of the horses and

and their
their jumping heights and all that we

900
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
their jumping heights and all that we
 

901
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,270
their jumping heights and all that we
will never figure it out so i

902
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
will never figure it out so i
 

903
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,270
will never figure it out so i
all along the back wall of this village

904
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,280
all along the back wall of this village
 

905
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,630
all along the back wall of this village
i set up

906
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
i set up
 

907
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,470
i set up
like 40 stalls or something crazy

908
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
like 40 stalls or something crazy
 

909
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,630
like 40 stalls or something crazy
which we will store the horses in

910
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
which we will store the horses in
 

911
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,310
which we will store the horses in
according to their jump height so i got

912
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
according to their jump height so i got
 

913
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,669
according to their jump height so i got
it written on the back here what their

914
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
it written on the back here what their
 

915
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,270
it written on the back here what their
jumping height is

916
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,280
jumping height is
 

917
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,909
jumping height is
i moved all the horses over here from

918
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
i moved all the horses over here from
 

919
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,630
i moved all the horses over here from
the man tave all the ones that

920
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
the man tave all the ones that
 

921
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,669
the man tave all the ones that
we bred with zenith and my super horse

922
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
we bred with zenith and my super horse
 

923
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,070
we bred with zenith and my super horse
um so these are like the best horses i

924
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
um so these are like the best horses i
 

925
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,830
um so these are like the best horses i
can get and we're gonna start off with

926
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
can get and we're gonna start off with
 

927
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,430
can get and we're gonna start off with
them

928
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
them
 

929
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,510
them
um so basically we just gotta go up to

930
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
um so basically we just gotta go up to
 

931
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,390
um so basically we just gotta go up to
our wall here

932
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
our wall here
 

933
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,909
our wall here
start categorizing them and drop them

934
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
start categorizing them and drop them
 

935
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,710
start categorizing them and drop them
off in their

936
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720
off in their
 

937
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,029
off in their
stalls i got labels on the wall here

938
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
stalls i got labels on the wall here
 

939
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,750
stalls i got labels on the wall here
let's see what this guy can do

940
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
let's see what this guy can do
 

941
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,830
let's see what this guy can do
this guy is not going to last long

942
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840

 

943
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,230

unfortunately pretty much every horse

944
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,240
unfortunately pretty much every horse
 

945
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,990
unfortunately pretty much every horse
that we breed in this project is going

946
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
that we breed in this project is going
 

947
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,310
that we breed in this project is going
to get killed eventually

948
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
to get killed eventually
 

949
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,310
to get killed eventually
um if they're good jumpers it will just

950
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
um if they're good jumpers it will just
 

951
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,070
um if they're good jumpers it will just
take longer before they get killed

952
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
take longer before they get killed
 

953
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,110
take longer before they get killed
or before they get the axe

954
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
or before they get the axe
 

955
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,470
or before they get the axe
all right sees i think he's below

956
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
all right sees i think he's below
 

957
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,190
all right sees i think he's below
average

958
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
average
 

959
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,870
average
if i remember right three was the

960
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:32,880
if i remember right three was the
 

961
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,510
if i remember right three was the
average for horses

962
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
average for horses
 

963
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,430
average for horses
okay he's getting there he's almost a

964
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
okay he's getting there he's almost a
 

965
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,430
okay he's getting there he's almost a
three

966
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,440
three
 

967
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,830
three
oh oh he's very close to three can you

968
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:41,840
oh oh he's very close to three can you
 

969
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,430
oh oh he's very close to three can you
do three

970
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
do three
 

971
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,990
do three
oh he's just short so he's just slightly

972
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
oh he's just short so he's just slightly
 

973
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,590
oh he's just short so he's just slightly
below average

974
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
below average
 

975
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,190
below average
i believe so he's a two point

976
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
i believe so he's a two point
 

977
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,390
i believe so he's a two point
eight something something another

978
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
eight something something another
 

979
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,909
eight something something another
so let's go write them off to a stall

980
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:57,919
so let's go write them off to a stall
 

981
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,750
so let's go write them off to a stall
and i'm going to be doing that with all

982
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
and i'm going to be doing that with all
 

983
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,190
and i'm going to be doing that with all
these guys and then we're going to take

984
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
these guys and then we're going to take
 

985
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,470
these guys and then we're going to take
our two best ones and

986
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
our two best ones and
 

987
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,750
our two best ones and
and work off of them so let's see

988
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
and work off of them so let's see
 

989
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,470
and work off of them so let's see
two just under three right

990
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,480
two just under three right
 

991
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,990
two just under three right
yeah so he would go in this stall here

992
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
yeah so he would go in this stall here
 

993
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,310
yeah so he would go in this stall here
can he make it over the fence even

994
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
can he make it over the fence even
 

995
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,590
can he make it over the fence even
just barely all right

996
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
just barely all right
 

997
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,110
just barely all right
cool so let me diagnose the rest of our

998
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,120
cool so let me diagnose the rest of our
 

999
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,710
cool so let me diagnose the rest of our
horses here i think there's about 10 or

1000
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
horses here i think there's about 10 or
 

1001
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,029
horses here i think there's about 10 or
so

1002
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,039
so
 

1003
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,310
so
maybe a little less

1004
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320

 

1005
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,630

so here we go this is what we ended up

1006
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
so here we go this is what we ended up
 

1007
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,470
so here we go this is what we ended up
with and all these horses they had the

1008
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
with and all these horses they had the
 

1009
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,510
with and all these horses they had the
same parents

1010
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:31,520
same parents
 

1011
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,909
same parents
but there's variations within them with

1012
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
but there's variations within them with
 

1013
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,750
but there's variations within them with
their jumping heights by quite a bit

1014
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
their jumping heights by quite a bit
 

1015
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,470
their jumping heights by quite a bit
so the best guy over here is 3.375

1016
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,480
so the best guy over here is 3.375
 

1017
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,990
so the best guy over here is 3.375
and then we have three here at 2.75 so

1018
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000
and then we have three here at 2.75 so
 

1019
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,070
and then we have three here at 2.75 so
there's a bit of variation there

1020
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,080
there's a bit of variation there
 

1021
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,590
there's a bit of variation there
so what we're going to do we're going to

1022
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
so what we're going to do we're going to
 

1023
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,190
so what we're going to do we're going to
take this guy here

1024
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
take this guy here
 

1025
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,230
take this guy here
this one here um if you take their

1026
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
this one here um if you take their
 

1027
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,150
this one here um if you take their
numbers

1028
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,160
numbers
 

1029
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,510
numbers
3.125 plus 3.375

1030
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,520
3.125 plus 3.375
 

1031
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,470
3.125 plus 3.375
best case scenario it's gonna randomly

1032
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,480
best case scenario it's gonna randomly
 

1033
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:00,950
best case scenario it's gonna randomly
roll

1034
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
roll
 

1035
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,870
roll
a 5.5 for the new horse so over here

1036
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:04,880
a 5.5 for the new horse so over here
 

1037
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,909
a 5.5 for the new horse so over here
so add 5.5 add those three numbers

1038
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:07,919
so add 5.5 add those three numbers
 

1039
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,029
so add 5.5 add those three numbers
together you get 12

1040
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:09,039
together you get 12
 

1041
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,990
together you get 12
and divide that by three and best case

1042
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,000
and divide that by three and best case
 

1043
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,470
and divide that by three and best case
our

1044
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,480
our
 

1045
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,990
our
our baby horse is gonna get a four

1046
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
our baby horse is gonna get a four
 

1047
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,630
our baby horse is gonna get a four
worst case scenario it will be

1048
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
worst case scenario it will be
 

1049
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,950
worst case scenario it will be
let me check this 2.56 so

1050
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:24,960
let me check this 2.56 so
 

1051
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,149
let me check this 2.56 so
probably somewhere around here

1052
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:28,159
probably somewhere around here
 

1053
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,029
probably somewhere around here
um so let's do it and we'll see what

1054
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,039
um so let's do it and we'll see what
 

1055
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,110
um so let's do it and we'll see what
happens

1056
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
happens
 

1057
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,830
happens
see i guess i'll just jump them together

1058
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
see i guess i'll just jump them together
 

1059
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,630
see i guess i'll just jump them together
i don't know

1060
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640

 

1061
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,350

all right oh yeah i can figure out which

1062
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,360
all right oh yeah i can figure out which
 

1063
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,789
all right oh yeah i can figure out which
one's the baby because it won't have a

1064
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799
one's the baby because it won't have a
 

1065
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,110
one's the baby because it won't have a
saddle on two which is important

1066
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,120
saddle on two which is important
 

1067
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,789
saddle on two which is important
otherwise i'll mix them up really easily

1068
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:48,799
otherwise i'll mix them up really easily
 

1069
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,630
otherwise i'll mix them up really easily
for some reason in this snapshot i'm

1070
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
for some reason in this snapshot i'm
 

1071
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,909
for some reason in this snapshot i'm
using oops

1072
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:51,919
using oops
 

1073
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,510
using oops
the baby horses are like full grown here

1074
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,520
the baby horses are like full grown here
 

1075
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,990
the baby horses are like full grown here
i don't know why i still haven't updated

1076
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
i don't know why i still haven't updated
 

1077
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,190
i don't know why i still haven't updated
to the latest one so i don't know if

1078
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,200
to the latest one so i don't know if
 

1079
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,270
to the latest one so i don't know if
that's fixed or not yet

1080
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
that's fixed or not yet
 

1081
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,549
that's fixed or not yet
i can't get on this guy oh this is

1082
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
i can't get on this guy oh this is

terrible
i guess because it's baby right let's

1086
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,520
i guess because it's baby right let's
 

1087
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,029
i guess because it's baby right let's
feed him

1088
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:11,039

 

1089
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,310

how about now well that is weird it's

1090
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,320
how about now well that is weird it's
 

1091
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,190
how about now well that is weird it's
doing something

1092
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
doing something
 

1093
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,870
doing something
very strange with the camera

1094
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880

 

1095
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,149

oh man what is going on

1096
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
oh man what is going on
 

1097
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,789
oh man what is going on
it like makes the camera jump every time

1098
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
it like makes the camera jump every time
 

1099
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,310
it like makes the camera jump every time
i click them

1100
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,320
i click them
 

1101
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,590
i click them
alright let's grow him up a little bit

1102
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:29,600
alright let's grow him up a little bit
 

1103
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,549
alright let's grow him up a little bit
more i don't think he's fully grown

1104
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
more i don't think he's fully grown
 

1105
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,510
more i don't think he's fully grown
no still can't get on

1106
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,520

 

1107
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,470

still can't get on i don't know what's

1108
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:40,480
still can't get on i don't know what's
 

1109
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,110
still can't get on i don't know what's
going on here

1110
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
going on here
 

1111
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,549
going on here
there we go okay so now it's fully grown

1112
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
there we go okay so now it's fully grown
 

1113
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,630
there we go okay so now it's fully grown
we gotta tame them right oh we tame the

1114
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
we gotta tame them right oh we tame the
 

1115
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,950
we gotta tame them right oh we tame the
first time

1116
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:50,960
first time
 

1117
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,350
first time
probably because i gave them extra sugar

1118
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
probably because i gave them extra sugar
 

1119
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,750
probably because i gave them extra sugar
get the saddle on

1120
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760
get the saddle on
 

1121
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,190
get the saddle on
get them out of there and we'll go test

1122
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
get them out of there and we'll go test
 

1123
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,230
get them out of there and we'll go test
them out so again best case

1124
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
them out so again best case
 

1125
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,669
them out so again best case
we'll get a 4.0 out of him

1126
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:03,679
we'll get a 4.0 out of him
 

1127
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,430
we'll get a 4.0 out of him
but it's most likely going to be more

1128
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,440
but it's most likely going to be more
 

1129
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,070
but it's most likely going to be more
average than that

1130
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,080
average than that
 

1131
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,710
average than that
okay it's not terrible it's not terrible

1132
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:16,720

 

1133
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,270

3.25 there that's pretty good

1134
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280

 

1135
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,870

let's try here oh i think that might be

1136
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880
let's try here oh i think that might be
 

1137
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,830
let's try here oh i think that might be
it

1138
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
it
 

1139
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,789
it
try one more time yeah so it's a

1140
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:31,799
try one more time yeah so it's a
 

1141
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,630
try one more time yeah so it's a
3.25 which

1142
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:34,640
3.25 which
 

1143
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,310
3.25 which
uh let's go back there i can't remember

1144
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:36,320
uh let's go back there i can't remember
 

1145
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,710
uh let's go back there i can't remember
i think that's better than

1146
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,720
i think that's better than
 

1147
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,310
i think that's better than
what it could have been better than like

1148
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:42,320
what it could have been better than like
 

1149
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,669
what it could have been better than like
the average between the two yeah i guess

1150
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:45,679
the average between the two yeah i guess
 

1151
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,149
the average between the two yeah i guess
it's right right between them right all

1152
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:48,159
it's right right between them right all
 

1153
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,669
it's right right between them right all
right so

1154
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679
right so
 

1155
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,830
right so
next time we will breed this one with

1156
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
next time we will breed this one with
 

1157
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,190
next time we will breed this one with
this one and

1158
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,200
this one and
 

1159
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,909
this one and
eventually we will slowly work our way

1160
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
eventually we will slowly work our way
 

1161
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,110
eventually we will slowly work our way
up here and that's why this is a

1162
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
up here and that's why this is a
 

1163
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,190
up here and that's why this is a
long-term project because

1164
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,200
long-term project because
 

1165
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,870
long-term project because
i can't just like breed this guy with

1166
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:00,880
i can't just like breed this guy with
 

1167
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,549
i can't just like breed this guy with
this one right now we gotta wait 10

1168
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:02,559
this one right now we gotta wait 10
 

1169
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,909
this one right now we gotta wait 10
