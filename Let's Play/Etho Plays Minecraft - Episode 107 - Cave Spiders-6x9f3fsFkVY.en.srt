natural light and see how that affects

138
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:00,690
natural light and see how that affects
 

139
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,920
natural light and see how that affects
them

140
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:01,930
them
 

141
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,320

I don't know if this is common knowledge

142
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,330
I don't know if this is common knowledge
 

143
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,689
I don't know if this is common knowledge
or not but this is news to me that light

or not but this is news to me that light
 

145
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:20,040
or not but this is news to me that light
affects these guys where's that a-hole

146
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,050
affects these guys where's that a-hole
 

147
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:28,879
affects these guys where's that a-hole
oh I didn't put in a very good place

148
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:28,889

 

149
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,170

yeah Mon there you now we have natural

150
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:34,180
yeah Mon there you now we have natural
 

151
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,770
yeah Mon there you now we have natural
light over here let's see if they'll run

152
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:36,780
light over here let's see if they'll run
 

153
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,680
light over here let's see if they'll run
back now that they have a closer a

154
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:40,690
back now that they have a closer a
 

155
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:46,320
back now that they have a closer a
source of it now it doesn't mind being

156
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,330
source of it now it doesn't mind being
 

157
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,029
source of it now it doesn't mind being
over here so in a way you can kind of

158
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
over here so in a way you can kind of
 

159
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,150
over here so in a way you can kind of
make changes for them using light and

160
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,160
make changes for them using light and
 

161
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,820
make changes for them using light and
only light so actually in my cave

162
00:05:59,820 --> 00:05:59,830

long but I should be fine now okay we
made it back in one piece we're slowly

200
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:24,760
made it back in one piece we're slowly
 

201
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,610
made it back in one piece we're slowly
getting more and more resources here

202
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:26,620
getting more and more resources here
 

203
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,240
getting more and more resources here
we're actually doing pretty good I've

204
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,250
we're actually doing pretty good I've
 

205
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,010
we're actually doing pretty good I've
been doing some tunneling off-camera

206
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:32,020
been doing some tunneling off-camera
 

207
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,890
been doing some tunneling off-camera
just because I don't want to draw it out

208
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:34,900
just because I don't want to draw it out
 

209
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,189
just because I don't want to draw it out
too much in the lp I just want just want

210
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:38,199
too much in the lp I just want just want
 

211
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,180
too much in the lp I just want just want
to do it every so often a little bit

212
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,190
to do it every so often a little bit
 

213
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,879
to do it every so often a little bit
today I would like to take on that

214
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:44,889
today I would like to take on that
 

215
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:48,930
today I would like to take on that
abandoned mine shaft in the LP but

216
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:48,940
abandoned mine shaft in the LP but
 

217
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,089
abandoned mine shaft in the LP but
general tunneling isn't overly exciting

218
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:51,099
general tunneling isn't overly exciting
 

219
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:53,790
general tunneling isn't overly exciting
so I did some of it off camera basically

220
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:53,800
so I did some of it off camera basically
 

221
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:01,399
so I did some of it off camera basically
over here is the ravine just over here

222
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:01,409

 

223
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:04,800

yeah we're here so we got a nice open

224
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:04,810
yeah we're here so we got a nice open
 

225
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,339
yeah we're here so we got a nice open
space here I'm thinking I might build my

226
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:08,349
space here I'm thinking I might build my
 

227
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:10,920
space here I'm thinking I might build my
mob system in the ravine here I'll like

228
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:10,930
mob system in the ravine here I'll like
 

229
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,620
mob system in the ravine here I'll like
hollow out a big area near the bottom

230
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:13,630
hollow out a big area near the bottom
 

231
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,969
hollow out a big area near the bottom
and then I'll just hollow out like I got

232
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:17,979
and then I'll just hollow out like I got
 

233
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:20,540
and then I'll just hollow out like I got
a nice flat wall here I could just build

234
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:20,550
a nice flat wall here I could just build
 

235
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,430
a nice flat wall here I could just build
the hostile mob system in that no

236
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
the hostile mob system in that no
 

237
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,070
the hostile mob system in that no
problem and I'll get resources doing it

238
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
problem and I'll get resources doing it
 

239
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,240
problem and I'll get resources doing it
it's kind of like building my

240
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,250
it's kind of like building my
 

241
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,570
it's kind of like building my
underground style with the mob evader

242
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:30,580
underground style with the mob evader
 

243
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,670
underground style with the mob evader
except since I'm underground living

244
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:32,680
except since I'm underground living
 

245
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,560
except since I'm underground living
underground I can do a sky trap

246
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:34,570
underground I can do a sky trap
 

247
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,620
underground I can do a sky trap
underground and I won't have a big ugly

248
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:37,630
underground and I won't have a big ugly
 

249
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,290
underground and I won't have a big ugly
tower in the sky so that'll work out

250
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:40,300
tower in the sky so that'll work out
 

251
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,240
tower in the sky so that'll work out
good got the ravine here this goes down

252
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,250
good got the ravine here this goes down
 

253
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,760
good got the ravine here this goes down
to lava level this tunnel here oh hey

254
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:50,770
to lava level this tunnel here oh hey
 

255
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,640
to lava level this tunnel here oh hey
buddy it's not really lit up the

256
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:53,650
buddy it's not really lit up the
 

257
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:59,939

259
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:03,220

yeah that goes up to the surface there

260
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:03,230
yeah that goes up to the surface there
 

261
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,980
yeah that goes up to the surface there
we also have another path to the surface

262
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:05,990
we also have another path to the surface
 

263
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:16,600
we also have another path to the surface
um forget where grass is spreading

264

it trying to get all these different
 

269
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,239
it trying to get all these different
tunnels but it takes its sweet time

270
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:25,249
tunnels but it takes its sweet time
 

271
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:34,329
tunnels but it takes its sweet time
that's for sure yeah the band and

that's for sure yeah the band and
 

273
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,019
that's for sure yeah the band and
mineshaft is just over here and I know

274
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:38,029
mineshaft is just over here and I know
 

275
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:41,009
mineshaft is just over here and I know
the spider spawner is closed because I

276
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:41,019
the spider spawner is closed because I
 

277
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:43,509
the spider spawner is closed because I
had one of the chief spiders chasing me

278
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519
had one of the chief spiders chasing me
 

279
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,210
had one of the chief spiders chasing me
the other day when I got near it so it's

280
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:46,220
the other day when I got near it so it's

oh yeah up there there's a path here
 

285
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:54,009
oh yeah up there there's a path here
that goes around just kind of nice goes

286
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:54,019
that goes around just kind of nice goes
 

287
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:57,460
that goes around just kind of nice goes
around and slightly slopes up to this

288
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:57,470
around and slightly slopes up to this
 

289
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,439
around and slightly slopes up to this
area here and this goes to the surface

290
00:09:59,439 --> 00:09:59,449
area here and this goes to the surface
 

291
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:05,470
area here and this goes to the surface
and it's raining apparently

292
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:05,480

 

293
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,810

so one plan I've had I'm having with

294
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:08,820
so one plan I've had I'm having with
 

295
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,110
so one plan I've had I'm having with
this new base is I kinda decided I

296
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,120
this new base is I kinda decided I
 

297
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,200
this new base is I kinda decided I
wanted all the areas to be accessible by

298
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,210
wanted all the areas to be accessible by
 

299
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,940
wanted all the areas to be accessible by
boat if that makes sense I did that in

300
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:19,950
boat if that makes sense I did that in
 

301
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,480
boat if that makes sense I did that in
my original starter world kind of in my

302
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:23,490
my original starter world kind of in my
 

303
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,420
my original starter world kind of in my
house I had like all these water roads

304
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:25,430
house I had like all these water roads
 

305
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,420
house I had like all these water roads
and it was pretty cool so I want to do

306
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:29,430
and it was pretty cool so I want to do
 

307
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,090
and it was pretty cool so I want to do
that it'll be like a mix of still water

308
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,100
that it'll be like a mix of still water
 

309
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,510
that it'll be like a mix of still water
areas and eats roads and elevators and

310
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:35,520
areas and eats roads and elevators and
 

311
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,740
areas and eats roads and elevators and
stuff so I'm thinking up now I'm hungry

312
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:39,750
stuff so I'm thinking up now I'm hungry
 

313
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,700
stuff so I'm thinking up now I'm hungry
again aren't I

314

thinking I'll try have a water thing

320
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:04,890
thinking I'll try have a water thing
 

321
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:10,190
thinking I'll try have a water thing
going around here nice water path it'll

322
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,200
going around here nice water path it'll
