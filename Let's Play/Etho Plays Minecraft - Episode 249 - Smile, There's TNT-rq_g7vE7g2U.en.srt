225
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,450
going on here I'll show you where we're
at I've been working on the interface of

226
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:36,460
at I've been working on the interface of
 

227
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,450
at I've been working on the interface of
our pets and this is what we got this is

228
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:39,460
our pets and this is what we got this is
 

229
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,330
our pets and this is what we got this is
where we're at and it's it's pretty good

230
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:42,340
where we're at and it's it's pretty good
 

231
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,670
where we're at and it's it's pretty good
I'm happy with us this looks pretty good

232
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:44,680
I'm happy with us this looks pretty good
 

233
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,120
I'm happy with us this looks pretty good
I would say so we have our our emotion

234
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,130
I would say so we have our our emotion
 

235
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,060
I would say so we have our our emotion
our face over there of our pets which is

236
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,070
our face over there of our pets which is
 

237
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,060
our face over there of our pets which is
blanked at the moment we have our stat

238
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,070
blanked at the moment we have our stat
 

239
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,629
blanked at the moment we have our stat
bars three on the left and two on the

240
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:57,639
bars three on the left and two on the
 

241
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,159
bars three on the left and two on the
right I think we're going to put buttons

242
00:07:59,159 --> 00:07:59,169
right I think we're going to put buttons
 

243
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:01,500
right I think we're going to put buttons
or maybe other ways of interacting at

244
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:01,510
or maybe other ways of interacting at
 

245
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,940
or maybe other ways of interacting at
the bottom slot there because there's

246
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:02,950
the bottom slot there because there's
 

247
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:08,820
the bottom slot there because there's
only what was it five stats plus age so

248
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:08,830
only what was it five stats plus age so
 

249
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,710
only what was it five stats plus age so
age happiness on your health wait

250
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
age happiness on your health wait
 

251
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,140
age happiness on your health wait
attention that we were going to do so

252
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,150
attention that we were going to do so
 

253
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,270
attention that we were going to do so
that's the age bar is going to be over

254
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
that's the age bar is going to be over
 

255
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,440
that's the age bar is going to be over
top there that that big bar there so I

256
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:19,450
top there that that big bar there so I
 

257
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,090
top there that that big bar there so I
do this a free spot where we can have

258
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:21,100
do this a free spot where we can have
 

259
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,439
do this a free spot where we can have
buttons or something else that we might

260
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:22,449
buttons or something else that we might
 

261
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:26,400
buttons or something else that we might
need and in the item frames I think I'll

262
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:26,410
need and in the item frames I think I'll
 

263
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,540
need and in the item frames I think I'll
use a visual indicator for what the stat

264
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:30,550
use a visual indicator for what the stat
 

265
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,930
use a visual indicator for what the stat
bar is and then we'll also have signs on

266
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:33,940
bar is and then we'll also have signs on
 

267
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,110
bar is and then we'll also have signs on
the right of each of the stat bars like

268
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
the right of each of the stat bars like
 

269
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,320
the right of each of the stat bars like
over here my bad guys accidentally

270
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,330
over here my bad guys accidentally
 

271
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,120
over here my bad guys accidentally
stopped recording their press the wrong

272
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,130
stopped recording their press the wrong
 

273
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,670
stopped recording their press the wrong
button yeah we'll have step four signs

274
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:44,680
button yeah we'll have step four signs
 

275
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,650
button yeah we'll have step four signs
on the right and left of our bars so

276
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:48,660
on the right and left of our bars so
 

277
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,000
on the right and left of our bars so
actually let's figure out what we want

278
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,010
actually let's figure out what we want
 

279
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,850
actually let's figure out what we want
where so if we we know where age is

280
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:53,860
where so if we we know where age is
 

281
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,370
where so if we we know where age is
going happiness on your health wait

282
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:56,380
going happiness on your health wait
 

283
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,800
going happiness on your health wait
attention health is probably the top

284
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:58,810
attention health is probably the top
 

285
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,230
attention health is probably the top
priority bar because one South goes down

286
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,240
priority bar because one South goes down
 

287
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,680
priority bar because one South goes down
to zero our pet dies so top priority may

288
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:04,690
to zero our pet dies so top priority may
 

289
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,449
to zero our pet dies so top priority may
be let's put that at the top left here

290
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:08,459
be let's put that at the top left here
 

291
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:13,769
be let's put that at the top left here
go health the reason why I want the item

292
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:13,779
go health the reason why I want the item
 

293
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,660
go health the reason why I want the item
frames in addition to the signs is

294
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:15,670
frames in addition to the signs is
 

295
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,480
frames in addition to the signs is
because I there's no way just by looking

296
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:18,490
because I there's no way just by looking
 

297
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,100
because I there's no way just by looking
from a distance we could tell what that

298
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,110
from a distance we could tell what that
 

299
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,960
from a distance we could tell what that
bar does the only way we could get that

300
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:21,970
bar does the only way we could get that
 

301
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,970
bar does the only way we could get that
effect like I can't read that can you

302
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:23,980
effect like I can't read that can you
 

303
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,510
effect like I can't read that can you
read that I can't read that so the only

304
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:27,520
read that I can't read that so the only
 

305
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,490
read that I can't read that so the only
way we can actually see what the bars

306
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:29,500
way we can actually see what the bars
 

307
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,800
way we can actually see what the bars
are from a distance is with item frames

308
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:31,810
are from a distance is with item frames
 

309
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,540
are from a distance is with item frames
I I figure but then you know it might

310
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:36,550
I I figure but then you know it might
 

311
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,870
I I figure but then you know it might
not be

312
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
not be
 

313
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,670
not be
clear what the item frame represents so

314
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:38,680
clear what the item frame represents so
 

315
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,550
clear what the item frame represents so
that's what we have the signs also to go

316
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:41,560
that's what we have the signs also to go
 

317
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,530
that's what we have the signs also to go
along with it even though I'll memorize

318
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:43,540
along with it even though I'll memorize
 

319
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,030
along with it even though I'll memorize
it pretty quick I'm sure

320
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
it pretty quick I'm sure
 

321
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,610
it pretty quick I'm sure
so do health the top left then happiness

322
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:50,620
so do health the top left then happiness
 

323
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,490
so do health the top left then happiness
is going to be really important for the

324
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:53,500
is going to be really important for the
 

325
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,620
is going to be really important for the
overwhelm well-being of our pets so

326
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:55,630
overwhelm well-being of our pets so
 

327
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,630
overwhelm well-being of our pets so
let's put that next happiness and I

328
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
let's put that next happiness and I
 

329
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,320
let's put that next happiness and I
guess let's do weights below that the

330
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,330
guess let's do weights below that the
 

331
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,750
guess let's do weights below that the
weight of our pets so ideally weight is

332
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:06,760
weight of our pets so ideally weight is
 

333
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,720
weight of our pets so ideally weight is
kind of a special stat we like for

334
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:09,730
kind of a special stat we like for
 

335
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,850
kind of a special stat we like for
mostly stats we want them to maxed out

336
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:11,860
mostly stats we want them to maxed out
 

337
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,610
mostly stats we want them to maxed out
we want health to be maxed at 5 we want

338
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:14,620
we want health to be maxed at 5 we want
 

339
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,370
we want health to be maxed at 5 we want
happiness to be at 5 but with weights we

340
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:17,380
happiness to be at 5 but with weights we
 

341
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,850
happiness to be at 5 but with weights we
want it at 3 ideally because at 5 is

342
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:20,860
want it at 3 ideally because at 5 is
 

343
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,020
want it at 3 ideally because at 5 is
overweight at 1 is under weights and

344
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,030
overweight at 1 is under weights and
 

345
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,090
overweight at 1 is under weights and
both of those will affect the health of

346
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:27,100
both of those will affect the health of
 

347
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,820
both of those will affect the health of
our pet so that's going to be a little

348
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:29,830
our pet so that's going to be a little
 

349
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,490
our pet so that's going to be a little
bit more tricky to deal with then on

350
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:32,500
bit more tricky to deal with then on
 

351
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,410
bit more tricky to deal with then on
this side what else do we have we have

352
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:34,420
this side what else do we have we have
 

353
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,230
this side what else do we have we have
hunger actually hunger is kind of

354
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:37,240
hunger actually hunger is kind of
 

355
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,970
hunger actually hunger is kind of
important mm-hmm maybe I should put

356
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:41,980
important mm-hmm maybe I should put
 

357
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,190
important mm-hmm maybe I should put
hunger little health

358
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,200

 

359
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,900

yeah those those all go together pretty

360
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:48,910
yeah those those all go together pretty
 

361
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,570
yeah those those all go together pretty
well don't they health hunger weights

362
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:51,580
well don't they health hunger weights
 

363
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,480
well don't they health hunger weights
those are all fairly related so we'll

364
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:54,490
those are all fairly related so we'll
 

365
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,340
those are all fairly related so we'll
move happiness will put hunger here and

366
00:10:59,340 --> 00:10:59,350
move happiness will put hunger here and
 

367
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,230
move happiness will put hunger here and
I'm going to use I think a cook stick to

368
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,240
I'm going to use I think a cook stick to
 

369
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,420
I'm going to use I think a cook stick to
represent that in the item frame which I

370
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:03,430
represent that in the item frame which I
 

371
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,080
represent that in the item frame which I
have on me so let's put that in already

372
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,090
have on me so let's put that in already
 

373
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:12,540
have on me so let's put that in already
perfect on this side I guess let's do

374
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:12,550
perfect on this side I guess let's do
 

375
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:18,410
perfect on this side I guess let's do
happiness at the top right happiness oh

376
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:18,420
happiness at the top right happiness oh
 

377
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,670
happiness at the top right happiness oh
that actually works out perfect because

378
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:20,680
that actually works out perfect because
 

379
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,230
that actually works out perfect because
well I'm going to say for this

380
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,240
well I'm going to say for this
 

381
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,860
well I'm going to say for this
interactive spot here I think it's going

382
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:28,870
interactive spot here I think it's going
 

383
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,900
interactive spot here I think it's going
to affect our attention level but I

384
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:33,910
to affect our attention level but I
 

385
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,460
to affect our attention level but I
guess it's also going to fit hunger and

386
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:35,470
guess it's also going to fit hunger and
 

387
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,450
guess it's also going to fit hunger and
other things so never mind never mind ok

388
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:39,460
other things so never mind never mind ok
 

389
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,710
other things so never mind never mind ok
so that's what we're going to put sup I

390
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
so that's what we're going to put sup I
 

391
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,460
so that's what we're going to put sup I
might add one more block to the right of

392
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,470
might add one more block to the right of
 

393
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,490
might add one more block to the right of
signs like we have here two blocks so

394
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:47,500
signs like we have here two blocks so
 

395
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,040
signs like we have here two blocks so
just the one

396
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,050
just the one
 

397
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,470
just the one
probably look better but we're not going

398
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:51,480
probably look better but we're not going
 

399
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,000
probably look better but we're not going
to worry too much about looks for just

400
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,010
to worry too much about looks for just
 

401
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:58,460
to worry too much about looks for just
the moments um yeah that would be better

402
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:58,470
the moments um yeah that would be better
 

403
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,269
the moments um yeah that would be better
I think okay what's next what's next

404
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:02,279
I think okay what's next what's next
 

405
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,449
I think okay what's next what's next
let's do let's do the face let's

406
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:05,459
let's do let's do the face let's
 

407
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,030
let's do let's do the face let's
consider the face so we've we've been

408
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,040
consider the face so we've we've been
 

409
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,009
consider the face so we've we've been
over this before our different emotions

410
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:10,019
over this before our different emotions
 

411
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:14,920
over this before our different emotions
we know what we want with that oops

412
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:14,930
we know what we want with that oops
 

413
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,720
we know what we want with that oops
so I'll just outline the happy face

414
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:17,730
so I'll just outline the happy face
 

415
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:24,590
so I'll just outline the happy face
again a happy face is like that

416
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:24,600
again a happy face is like that
 

417
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,400
again a happy face is like that
ah it's gonna be so cool when it's all

418
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,410
ah it's gonna be so cool when it's all
 

419
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:34,009
ah it's gonna be so cool when it's all
done yeah I like the courts for the for

420
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:34,019
done yeah I like the courts for the for
 

421
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,800
done yeah I like the courts for the for
the emotion thing it's it's pretty good

422
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:36,810
the emotion thing it's it's pretty good
 

423
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,259
the emotion thing it's it's pretty good
people suggest that I should use colored

424
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:39,269
people suggest that I should use colored
 

425
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:42,530
people suggest that I should use colored
wool and quartz and maybe we'll do that

426
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:42,540
wool and quartz and maybe we'll do that
 

427
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,720
wool and quartz and maybe we'll do that
instead of sandstone but we'll just do

428
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:44,730
instead of sandstone but we'll just do
 

429
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,840
instead of sandstone but we'll just do
this for now and the reason I picked

430
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:47,850
this for now and the reason I picked
 

431
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,120
this for now and the reason I picked
this positioning for everything by the

432
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,130
this positioning for everything by the
 

433
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,650
this positioning for everything by the
way this works out really nice because

434
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:51,660
way this works out really nice because
 

435
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,370
way this works out really nice because
this this height of this walkway right

436
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:55,380
this this height of this walkway right
 

437
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,440
this this height of this walkway right
here and the the left and right of it

438
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,450
here and the the left and right of it
 

439
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,230
here and the the left and right of it
the horizontal positioning when we walk

440
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,240
the horizontal positioning when we walk
 

441
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,090
the horizontal positioning when we walk
up to it standing right here we're

442
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,100
up to it standing right here we're
 

443
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,210
up to it standing right here we're
perfectly Center with our face here

444
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:08,220
perfectly Center with our face here
 

445
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,790
perfectly Center with our face here
which is nice from a distance we can see

446
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
which is nice from a distance we can see
 

447
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,750
which is nice from a distance we can see
what how our pet is feeling even that

448
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:14,760
what how our pet is feeling even that
 

449
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,370
what how our pet is feeling even that
will work out really well this is

450
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:16,380
will work out really well this is
 

451
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,230
will work out really well this is
actually at two four blocks wide area

452
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
actually at two four blocks wide area
 

453
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,710
actually at two four blocks wide area
four block wide area and I might remove

454
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
four block wide area and I might remove
 

455
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,769
four block wide area and I might remove
one more block over here so we can get

456
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:27,779
one more block over here so we can get
 

457
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,040
one more block over here so we can get
it centered you know five watt five wide

458
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,050
it centered you know five watt five wide
 

459
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:36,710
it centered you know five watt five wide
area here so that'll work out pretty

460
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
area here so that'll work out pretty
 

461
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:44,780
area here so that'll work out pretty
good um so yeah our face our emotions um

462
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:44,790
good um so yeah our face our emotions um
 

463
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,240
good um so yeah our face our emotions um
we'll need Pistons behind this and I

464
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,250
we'll need Pistons behind this and I
 

465
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,790
we'll need Pistons behind this and I
just to represent all the the mouse

466
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:51,800
just to represent all the the mouse
 

467
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,310
just to represent all the the mouse
aspects of it we'll need an area like

468
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:55,320
aspects of it we'll need an area like
 

469
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,230
aspects of it we'll need an area like
this with pistons behind so let's get

470
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
this with pistons behind so let's get
 

471
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,740
this with pistons behind so let's get
those down we'll use sticky pistons

472
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:02,750
those down we'll use sticky pistons
 

473
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,800
those down we'll use sticky pistons
and we're going to have to this is going

474
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:05,810
and we're going to have to this is going
 

475
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,300
and we're going to have to this is going
to be kind of tough to do whoa that was

476
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:07,310
to be kind of tough to do whoa that was
 

477
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,559
to be kind of tough to do whoa that was
weird that was a glitch that could be a

478
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:11,569
weird that was a glitch that could be a
 

479
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:18,300
weird that was a glitch that could be a
face - ah

480
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,310

 

481
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,210

that will be our mouth controls the top

482
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:22,220
that will be our mouth controls the top
 

483
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,449
that will be our mouth controls the top
two blocks on the eyes we decide we were

484
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:25,459
two blocks on the eyes we decide we were
 

485
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:27,490
two blocks on the eyes we decide we were
not going to change ever but the bottom

486
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:27,500
not going to change ever but the bottom
 

487
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,970
not going to change ever but the bottom
two might change so we'll need pistons

488
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:30,980
two might change so we'll need pistons
 

489
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,420
two might change so we'll need pistons
behind those as well

490
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:33,430
behind those as well
 

491
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,769
behind those as well
certain faces will make use of it and

492
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:35,779
certain faces will make use of it and
 

493
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:39,400
certain faces will make use of it and
other ones won't I'm saying faces I

494
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:39,410
other ones won't I'm saying faces I
 

495
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,050
other ones won't I'm saying faces I
should be saying emotions certain

496
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:41,060
should be saying emotions certain
 

497
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,309
should be saying emotions certain
emotions so we'll have two Pistons per

498
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:45,319
emotions so we'll have two Pistons per
 

499
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:50,230
emotions so we'll have two Pistons per
eye and we'll do the same over here I

500
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
eye and we'll do the same over here I
 

501
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,710
eye and we'll do the same over here I
should go get some work quartz morning

502
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
should go get some work quartz morning
 

503
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:07,240
should go get some work quartz morning
song I love that so much sweets so those

504
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,250
song I love that so much sweets so those
 

505
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,549
song I love that so much sweets so those
are all our pistons the hard part now is

506
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:09,559
are all our pistons the hard part now is
 

507
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:13,150
are all our pistons the hard part now is
we got a wire that to express six

508
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,160
we got a wire that to express six
 

509
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,009
we got a wire that to express six
different emotions on the face so that's

510
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:18,019
different emotions on the face so that's
 

511
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:22,049
different emotions on the face so that's
going to be kind of tough to do actually

512
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:22,059

 

513
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:24,369

let's take a look at the ravine is by

514
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:24,379
let's take a look at the ravine is by
 

515
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:28,660
let's take a look at the ravine is by
behind here so we have lots of lots of

516
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:28,670
behind here so we have lots of lots of
 

517
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,949
behind here so we have lots of lots of
space to work you know I should actually

518
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:29,959
space to work you know I should actually
 

519
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:32,559
space to work you know I should actually
get rid of that lab because I'm going to

520
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:32,569
get rid of that lab because I'm going to
 

521
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:34,030
get rid of that lab because I'm going to
fall on that at some point while we're

522
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,040
fall on that at some point while we're
 

523
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,860
fall on that at some point while we're
on this if I don't

524
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:37,870

 

525
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:45,720

sorry leva bye bye okay cool

526
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:45,730

 

527
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,210

so I feel what we should work on now is

528
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:49,220
so I feel what we should work on now is
 

529
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,130
so I feel what we should work on now is
maybe figuring out how we're going to do

530
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:51,140
maybe figuring out how we're going to do
 

531
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,500
maybe figuring out how we're going to do
the mouse on our pet here how are we

532
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:53,510
the mouse on our pet here how are we
 

533
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,000
the mouse on our pet here how are we
going to wire it because it's kind of a

534
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,010
going to wire it because it's kind of a
 

535
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,850
going to wire it because it's kind of a
complicated thing would be good to get

536
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:57,860
complicated thing would be good to get
 

537
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,660
complicated thing would be good to get
that out of the way pretty early on this

538
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:00,670
that out of the way pretty early on this
 

539
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,550
that out of the way pretty early on this
by the way pet names do you guys have

540
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:03,560
by the way pet names do you guys have
 

541
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,550
by the way pet names do you guys have
pet names the the one I'm kind of

542
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
pet names the the one I'm kind of
 

543
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,380
pet names the the one I'm kind of
feeling right now is maybe we'll call

544
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:08,390
feeling right now is maybe we'll call
 

545
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:12,280
feeling right now is maybe we'll call
our pet hop drop so one idea or maybe

546
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,290
our pet hop drop so one idea or maybe
 

547
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,050
our pet hop drop so one idea or maybe
every time it dies it should maybe give

548
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:14,060
every time it dies it should maybe give
 

549
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,480
every time it dies it should maybe give
it a different name but hop drop is what

550
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:16,490
it a different name but hop drop is what
 

551
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,190
it a different name but hop drop is what
I'm thinking at the moment unless you

552
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,200
I'm thinking at the moment unless you
 

553
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,430
I'm thinking at the moment unless you
guys have better ideas

554
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:20,440
guys have better ideas
 

555
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,270
guys have better ideas
but yeah the mouse is kind of

556
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:22,280
but yeah the mouse is kind of
 

557
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,250
but yeah the mouse is kind of
complicated I don't know how I'm going

558
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:24,260
complicated I don't know how I'm going
 

559
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,230
complicated I don't know how I'm going
to wire it to be honest at the moment

560
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,240
to wire it to be honest at the moment
 

561
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,450
to wire it to be honest at the moment
but I do know the method I'm going to

562
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:28,460
but I do know the method I'm going to
 

563
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,130
but I do know the method I'm going to
take for figuring it out so maybe I'll

564
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:30,140
take for figuring it out so maybe I'll
 

565
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,140
take for figuring it out so maybe I'll
share that with you and give you an idea

566
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,150
share that with you and give you an idea
 

567
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,750
share that with you and give you an idea
how how to figure these kinds of things

568
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:34,760
how how to figure these kinds of things
 

569
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,060
how how to figure these kinds of things
out so we're just going to build a

570
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,070
out so we're just going to build a
 

571
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,060
out so we're just going to build a
second Mouse here that we can work with

572
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,070
second Mouse here that we can work with
 

573
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:45,340
second Mouse here that we can work with
easily whoops so it's a five wide two

574
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:45,350
easily whoops so it's a five wide two
 

575
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,280
easily whoops so it's a five wide two
tall thing we're working with here and

576
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,290
tall thing we're working with here and
 

577
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,750
tall thing we're working with here and
we have there's six emotions on our face

578
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:52,760
we have there's six emotions on our face
 

579
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,610
we have there's six emotions on our face
that we're going to do but I think the

580
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:54,620
that we're going to do but I think the
 

581
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,130
that we're going to do but I think the
mouse only changes for four different

582
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:57,140
mouse only changes for four different
 

583
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:03,070
mouse only changes for four different
ways so we have our happy oops get our

584
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:03,080
ways so we have our happy oops get our
 

585
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:09,850
ways so we have our happy oops get our
happy face we have our neutral face meet

586
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:09,860
happy face we have our neutral face meet
 

587
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,600
happy face we have our neutral face meet
that's what it was

588
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:10,610
that's what it was
 

589
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,030
that's what it was
yeah neutral face and then we have our

590
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,040
yeah neutral face and then we have our
 

591
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,550
yeah neutral face and then we have our
sad face and then we also have a dead

592
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:18,560
sad face and then we also have a dead
 

593
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,790
sad face and then we also have a dead
face so for pet dies they look like that

594
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:21,800
face so for pet dies they look like that
 

595
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,620
face so for pet dies they look like that
so how do we go about figure out how to

596
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:26,630
so how do we go about figure out how to
 

597
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,050
so how do we go about figure out how to
wire this well you'll notice one of the

598
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,060
wire this well you'll notice one of the
 

599
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,700
wire this well you'll notice one of the
one of the tricks to it is we got to

600
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:33,710
one of the tricks to it is we got to
 

601
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,440
one of the tricks to it is we got to
figure out like if we were to there's

602
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:35,450
figure out like if we were to there's
 

603
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,050
figure out like if we were to there's
ten different Pistons here 14 total

604
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,060
ten different Pistons here 14 total
 

605
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,440
ten different Pistons here 14 total
counting eyes if we were to connect our

606
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:41,450
counting eyes if we were to connect our
 

607
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,440
counting eyes if we were to connect our
like six different wires to all 14 of

608
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,450
like six different wires to all 14 of
 

609
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,410
like six different wires to all 14 of
those Pistons individually the wiring

610
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:47,420
those Pistons individually the wiring
 

611
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,120
those Pistons individually the wiring
would be crazy that's not going to work

612
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,130
would be crazy that's not going to work
 

613
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,560
would be crazy that's not going to work
so what we got to do is look for

614
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:50,570
so what we got to do is look for
 

615
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,920
so what we got to do is look for
patterns or ways of simplifying the

616
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:53,930
patterns or ways of simplifying the
 

617
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,980
patterns or ways of simplifying the
wiring so with all these different faces

618
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:56,990
wiring so with all these different faces
 

619
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,330
wiring so with all these different faces
one pattern unnoticed

620
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:58,340
one pattern unnoticed
 

621
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:05,470
one pattern unnoticed
thing is ah Stilton the it's always

622
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:05,480
thing is ah Stilton the it's always
 

623
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,310
thing is ah Stilton the it's always
inverted like if this piston is is out

624
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:09,320
inverted like if this piston is is out
 

625
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,220
inverted like if this piston is is out
this one is not this one's out this one

626
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:12,230
this one is not this one's out this one
 

627
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,110
this one is not this one's out this one
is not it's that way for all these

628
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,120
is not it's that way for all these
 

629
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,590
is not it's that way for all these
different phases like neutral phase this

630
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
different phases like neutral phase this
 

631
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,230
different phases like neutral phase this
whole top row would not be extended

632
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,240
whole top row would not be extended
 

633
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,620
whole top row would not be extended
while this bottom one is so with that in

634
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:23,630
while this bottom one is so with that in
 

635
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,500
while this bottom one is so with that in
mind we might be able to do something

636
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:26,510
mind we might be able to do something
 

637
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,779
mind we might be able to do something
like this and just have a redstone torch

638
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:30,789
like this and just have a redstone torch
 

639
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:34,330
like this and just have a redstone torch
nope if you got to go up one more block

640
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:34,340
nope if you got to go up one more block
 

641
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,620
nope if you got to go up one more block
for that to work

642
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:35,630
for that to work
 

643
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:41,019
for that to work
well no work either it would kind of

644
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:41,029
well no work either it would kind of
 

645
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:45,370
well no work either it would kind of
work this is being powered at the moment

646
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:45,380
work this is being powered at the moment
 

647
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:51,810
work this is being powered at the moment
oh wait no it's not it's not won't work

648
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:51,820
oh wait no it's not it's not won't work
 

649
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,310
oh wait no it's not it's not won't work
so now we play around with it to figure

650
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,320
so now we play around with it to figure
 

651
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,529
so now we play around with it to figure
out how to make that work that's not

652
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:56,539
out how to make that work that's not
 

653
00:18:56,539 --> 00:19:06,810
out how to make that work that's not
going to work which is a bit challenging

654
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:06,820

 

655
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,460

mmm see it's kind of hard because the

656
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:09,470
mmm see it's kind of hard because the
 

657
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,240
mmm see it's kind of hard because the
redstone torch will actually power so

658
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,250
redstone torch will actually power so
 

659
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,930
redstone torch will actually power so
many blocks below it like even a torch

660
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:16,940
many blocks below it like even a torch
 

661
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:23,169
many blocks below it like even a torch
here I'll power both if we can figure

662
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:23,179
here I'll power both if we can figure
 

663
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:25,120
here I'll power both if we can figure
this out though that'll reduce the

664
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,130
this out though that'll reduce the
 

665
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,159
this out though that'll reduce the
number of separate ways we have to run

666
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:27,169
number of separate ways we have to run
 

667
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,440
number of separate ways we have to run
the wire from ten ten different

668
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:29,450
the wire from ten ten different
 

669
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,230
the wire from ten ten different
connections to just five if we can do

670
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240
connections to just five if we can do
 

671
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,450
connections to just five if we can do
that so I'll see if I can figure

672
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:34,460
that so I'll see if I can figure
 

673
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,130
that so I'll see if I can figure
something out here okay so I got rid of

674
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:39,140
something out here okay so I got rid of
 

675
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,399
something out here okay so I got rid of
the stake from oh there it is I want

676
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:42,409
the stake from oh there it is I want
 

677
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:45,210
the stake from oh there it is I want
that back from our item frames here and

678
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:45,220
that back from our item frames here and
 

679
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,529
that back from our item frames here and
instead I've been thinking about it

680
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:47,539
instead I've been thinking about it
 

681
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:52,779
instead I've been thinking about it
maybe for hunger let's use an apple it's

682
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:52,789
maybe for hunger let's use an apple it's
 

683
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:54,850
maybe for hunger let's use an apple it's
easier to see the steak was really hard

684
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:54,860
easier to see the steak was really hard
 

685
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,740
easier to see the steak was really hard
to see a little bit brighter for weight

686
00:19:59,740 --> 00:19:59,750
to see a little bit brighter for weight
 

687
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:07,029
to see a little bit brighter for weight
I was thinking we could use an anvil for

688
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:07,039
I was thinking we could use an anvil for
 

689
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,049
I was thinking we could use an anvil for
health maybe a bone you know

690
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:11,059
health maybe a bone you know
 

691
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:16,149
health maybe a bone you know
take care of your bones and happiness a

692
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:16,159
take care of your bones and happiness a
 

693
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,430
take care of your bones and happiness a
flower we can change these these are

694
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:18,440
flower we can change these these are
 

695
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,850
flower we can change these these are
just ideas flower for happiness and this

696
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:21,860
just ideas flower for happiness and this
 

697
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,470
just ideas flower for happiness and this
kind of looks like a toy like a ball

698
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:23,480
kind of looks like a toy like a ball
 

699
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,879
kind of looks like a toy like a ball
maybe use that for attention like we got

700
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:27,889
maybe use that for attention like we got
 

701
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:31,739
maybe use that for attention like we got
to play with our pets if that gets slow

702
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:31,749
to play with our pets if that gets slow
 

703
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:37,560
to play with our pets if that gets slow
what does that look like good for now

704
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:37,570
what does that look like good for now
 

705
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,019
what does that look like good for now
okay so I did figure this out we got to

706
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:41,029
okay so I did figure this out we got to
 

707
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:44,259
okay so I did figure this out we got to
do something like this and so this is

708
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:44,269
do something like this and so this is
 

709
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:47,230
do something like this and so this is
going to add three three wide three tall

710
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,240
going to add three three wide three tall
 

711
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,989
going to add three three wide three tall
to our wiring but this allows me to

712
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:49,999
to our wiring but this allows me to
 

713
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,810
to our wiring but this allows me to
invert it perfectly without the Pistons

714
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:52,820
invert it perfectly without the Pistons
 

715
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:59,649
invert it perfectly without the Pistons
interfering with each other so we can

716
00:20:59,649 --> 00:20:59,659
interfering with each other so we can
 

717
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,930
interfering with each other so we can
use that that takes our connections from

718
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:01,940
use that that takes our connections from
 

719
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,239
use that that takes our connections from
ten down to five which is a lot simpler

720
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:04,249
ten down to five which is a lot simpler
 

721
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:07,960
ten down to five which is a lot simpler
that halves it basically it's just I got

722
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:07,970
that halves it basically it's just I got
 

723
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,999
that halves it basically it's just I got
to connect to this block here that goes

724
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:10,009
to connect to this block here that goes
 

725
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:13,690
to connect to this block here that goes
to a torch which inverts it and then

726
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:13,700
to a torch which inverts it and then
 

727
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,899
to a torch which inverts it and then
goes to repeater to the left here and

728
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:16,909
goes to repeater to the left here and
 

729
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:20,409
goes to repeater to the left here and
also repeater down below so those

730
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:20,419
also repeater down below so those
 

731
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:24,190
also repeater down below so those
alternates so now can we simplify it

732
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,200
alternates so now can we simplify it
 

733
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,850
alternates so now can we simplify it
even more are there any other patterns

734
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:27,860
even more are there any other patterns
 

735
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,529
even more are there any other patterns
we can see in the mouth here there's one

736
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:32,539
we can see in the mouth here there's one
 

737
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:38,619
we can see in the mouth here there's one
I noticed as well this this column here

738
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:38,629
I noticed as well this this column here
 

739
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,960
I noticed as well this this column here
and this one is always the same with all

740
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:40,970
and this one is always the same with all
 

741
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,590
and this one is always the same with all
the faces and same with this and this

742
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:44,600
the faces and same with this and this
 

743
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,039
the faces and same with this and this
column they're always the same so if

744
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:48,049
column they're always the same so if
 

745
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:50,529
column they're always the same so if
this one's extended this one is extended

746
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:50,539
this one's extended this one is extended
 

747
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:54,129
this one's extended this one is extended
with all the faces or or vice versa like

748
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:54,139
with all the faces or or vice versa like
 

749
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:58,869
with all the faces or or vice versa like
if we go to a happy face just the

750
00:21:58,869 --> 00:21:58,879
if we go to a happy face just the
 

751
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:02,109
if we go to a happy face just the
reverse of that this one is extended

752
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:02,119
reverse of that this one is extended
 

753
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,749
reverse of that this one is extended
this one's extended so this one's

754
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:04,759
this one's extended so this one's
 

755
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,430
this one's extended so this one's
extended this was extended so that

756
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:06,440
extended this was extended so that
 

757
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,549
extended this was extended so that
simplifies it a little bit as well we

758
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:09,559
simplifies it a little bit as well we
 

759
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,619
simplifies it a little bit as well we
can connect those together just see

760
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:11,629
can connect those together just see
 

761
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:16,869
can connect those together just see
creeper no um so maybe I'll try connect

762
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:16,879
creeper no um so maybe I'll try connect
 

763
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:20,150
creeper no um so maybe I'll try connect
those and see how that goes

764
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,160

 

765
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,370

I'm not really done with the redstone

766
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:22,380
I'm not really done with the redstone
 

767
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,930
I'm not really done with the redstone
here but I'll just show you this to give

768
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:23,940
here but I'll just show you this to give
 

769
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,090
here but I'll just show you this to give
you an idea of what we've done we went

770
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:26,100
you an idea of what we've done we went
 

771
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,450
you an idea of what we've done we went
from needing 10 different connections to

772
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:29,460
from needing 10 different connections to
 

773
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,640
from needing 10 different connections to
control our mouth all the way down to 3

774
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:33,650
control our mouth all the way down to 3
 

775
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,510
control our mouth all the way down to 3
control all 4 emotions we need or all 4

776
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:38,520
control all 4 emotions we need or all 4
 

777
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,510
control all 4 emotions we need or all 4
different mouths setups we need just by

778
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
different mouths setups we need just by
 

779
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,210
different mouths setups we need just by
using these 3 Pistons in different ways

780
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:44,220
using these 3 Pistons in different ways
 

781
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:49,310
using these 3 Pistons in different ways
so happy face we can make a neutral face

782
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:49,320
so happy face we can make a neutral face
 

783
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,230
so happy face we can make a neutral face
by flipping this all right we can make a

784
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
by flipping this all right we can make a
 

785
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,440
by flipping this all right we can make a
sad face by flipping these 2 then and

786
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,450
sad face by flipping these 2 then and
 

787
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,760
sad face by flipping these 2 then and
then we can make our dead face by

788
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:01,770
then we can make our dead face by
 

789
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:05,360
then we can make our dead face by
flipped in the middle one so there might

790
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,370
flipped in the middle one so there might
 

791
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,460
flipped in the middle one so there might
be more patterns to this yet I'm going

792
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:07,470
be more patterns to this yet I'm going
 

793
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,710
be more patterns to this yet I'm going
to look into it and if we find more

794
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:09,720
to look into it and if we find more
 

795
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,440
to look into it and if we find more
it'll get even simpler hopefully

796

is let's let's get it here which will we

818
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,170
is let's let's get it here which will we
 

819
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,520
is let's let's get it here which will we
need this for a level 2 will be sad face

820
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:49,530
need this for a level 2 will be sad face
 

821
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,890
need this for a level 2 will be sad face
which again we need this for the same

822
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:51,900
which again we need this for the same
 

823
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,050
which again we need this for the same
thing so there's no change there so

824
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:54,060
thing so there's no change there so
 

825
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,030
thing so there's no change there so
that's simple we can connect those two

826
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,040
that's simple we can connect those two
 

827
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,780
that's simple we can connect those two
together but then when we get to level 3

828
00:23:59,780 --> 00:23:59,790
together but then when we get to level 3
 

829
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,840
together but then when we get to level 3
here it's going to be neutral face so

830
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:02,850
here it's going to be neutral face so
 

831
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:08,960
here it's going to be neutral face so
then flip that that's neutral face level

832
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:08,970
then flip that that's neutral face level
 

833
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:14,300
then flip that that's neutral face level
4 and 5 is going to be happy face the

only thing different between the two is

836
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:16,350
only thing different between the two is
 

837
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,560
only thing different between the two is
the eyes so we have to take that into

839
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,740
the eyes so we have to take that into
account to wait what are we doing here

840

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,260
be like 2530 minutes total and that's
 

953
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,290
