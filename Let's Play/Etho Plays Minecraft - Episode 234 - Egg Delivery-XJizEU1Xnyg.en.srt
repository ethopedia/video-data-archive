00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:16,769
something about this I'll probably have
 

101
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:21,379
something about this I'll probably have
to make this solid over here still

102
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:21,389
to make this solid over here still
 

103
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:22,849

107
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:29,599
don't know where to make it go this is
all loaded though we got weakness in

108
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:29,609
all loaded though we got weakness in
 

109
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,710
all loaded though we got weakness in
there we got minecarts it's all sets and

110

I started working on this roof just a

112
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:36,989
I started working on this roof just a
 

113
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:39,860
I started working on this roof just a
few moments ago what I think I'm going

114
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:39,870
few moments ago what I think I'm going
 

115
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,890
few moments ago what I think I'm going
to do my place both sides there we're

116
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:42,900
to do my place both sides there we're
 

117
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,969
to do my place both sides there we're
going to have a three by three thing and

118
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:45,979
going to have a three by three thing and
 

119
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:48,920
going to have a three by three thing and
then I think we should do it like this

120
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:48,930
then I think we should do it like this
 

121
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:56,390
then I think we should do it like this
have have this indented of bits well

122
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
have have this indented of bits well
 

123
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,050
have have this indented of bits well
that's it that's the dress up there

124
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,060
that's it that's the dress up there
 

125
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:09,249
that's it that's the dress up there
we'll stick a lever there try this out

126
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:09,259

 

127
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:12,110

like that have those going all the way

128
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,120
like that have those going all the way
 

129
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,360
like that have those going all the way
along here see what it looks like from

130
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,370
along here see what it looks like from
 

131
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,099
along here see what it looks like from
below that's pretty cool the other

132
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:19,109
below that's pretty cool the other
 

133
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,259
below that's pretty cool the other
option is I could have like stairs and

134
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:21,269
option is I could have like stairs and
 

135
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,969
option is I could have like stairs and
half slabs but I think it looks better

136
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:22,979
half slabs but I think it looks better
 

137
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:23,870
half slabs but I think it looks better
with the sharper

138
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:23,880
with the sharper
 

139
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,530
with the sharper
and then we could try it though we

140
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:27,540
and then we could try it though we
 

141
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,560
and then we could try it though we
should try it if we did it

142
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:32,570

 

143
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,640

where are we over here so it's step full

144
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:37,650
where are we over here so it's step full
 

145
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:43,040
where are we over here so it's step full
blocks we could do this and then have

146
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,050
blocks we could do this and then have
 

147
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,200
blocks we could do this and then have
these running across maybe we'll just

148
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,210
these running across maybe we'll just
 

149
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,140
these running across maybe we'll just
remove this one so we can see properly

150
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,150

 

151
00:04:53,150 --> 00:05:01,670

that and then the shovel it's too good I

152
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
that and then the shovel it's too good I
 

153
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:16,180
that and then the shovel it's too good I
tell you okay that there and cover it up

154
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,190

 

155
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,280

let's see there you go so that might be

156
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,290
let's see there you go so that might be
 

157
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,000
let's see there you go so that might be
cool to know I think I like I liked it

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,010
cool to know I think I like I liked it
 

159
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,440
cool to know I think I like I liked it
the first way first the first time most

160
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,450
the first way first the first time most
 

161
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,730
the first way first the first time most

so in a recent patch they made it to

480
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,490
so in a recent patch they made it to
 

481
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:26,010
so in a recent patch they made it to
where items will just go upward if

482
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,020
where items will just go upward if
 

483
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,910
where items will just go upward if
they're inside a block so if we have

484
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:29,920
they're inside a block so if we have
 

485
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,630
they're inside a block so if we have
that in there and we extend this I think

486
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:33,640
that in there and we extend this I think
 

487
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,060
that in there and we extend this I think
it'll go well actually we got to make

488
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,070
it'll go well actually we got to make
 

489
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,590
it'll go well actually we got to make
that solid one second

490
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
that solid one second
 

491
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,090
that solid one second
it's got to be solid blocks all the way

492
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:42,100
it's got to be solid blocks all the way
 

493
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,690
it's got to be solid blocks all the way
up okay so now if we extend that I think

494
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:48,700
up okay so now if we extend that I think
 

495
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,510
up okay so now if we extend that I think
it'll either go up it might shoot out

496
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:51,520
it'll either go up it might shoot out
 

497
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,310
it'll either go up it might shoot out
through the piston area here I'm not

498
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:53,320
through the piston area here I'm not
 

499
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,660
through the piston area here I'm not
sure that's what we've got to figure out

500
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:54,670
sure that's what we've got to figure out
 

501
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,100
sure that's what we've got to figure out
first of all okay well it went up I'm

502
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,110
first of all okay well it went up I'm
 

503
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,880
first of all okay well it went up I'm
pretty sure it went up anyway let's just

504
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:02,890
pretty sure it went up anyway let's just
 

505
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,700
pretty sure it went up anyway let's just
try this one more time with eggs like

506
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:05,710
try this one more time with eggs like
 

507
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,350
try this one more time with eggs like
it's going to make a difference I just

508
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
it's going to make a difference I just
 

509
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,420
it's going to make a difference I just
want to see it again make sure all is

510
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:09,430
want to see it again make sure all is
 

511
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,260
want to see it again make sure all is
good ooh let's throw them in front of

512
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:13,270
good ooh let's throw them in front of
 

513
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:21,740
good ooh let's throw them in front of
the piston there we go yeah and Dada

514
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:21,750
the piston there we go yeah and Dada
 

515
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,000
the piston there we go yeah and Dada
they really fly out though I thought

516
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,010
they really fly out though I thought
 

517
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,010
they really fly out though I thought
they would just sit on top but they like

518
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,020
they would just sit on top but they like
 

519
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,590
they would just sit on top but they like
fly they like get to the top and then

520
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:28,600
fly they like get to the top and then
 

521
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,760
fly they like get to the top and then
they go whoa okay so that's that's the

522
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:32,770
they go whoa okay so that's that's the
 

523
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,440
they go whoa okay so that's that's the
basic idea I'm going to get like

524
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:34,450
basic idea I'm going to get like
 

525
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,530
basic idea I'm going to get like
chickens inside

526
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:35,540
chickens inside
 

527
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,160
chickens inside
that area and then squish them and they

528
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,170
that area and then squish them and they
 

529
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,410
that area and then squish them and they
won't suffocate in glass when they lay

530
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:41,420
won't suffocate in glass when they lay
 

531
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,230
won't suffocate in glass when they lay
an egg it should just automatically go

532
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
an egg it should just automatically go
 

533
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,579
an egg it should just automatically go
straight up and the nice thing about

534
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:45,589
straight up and the nice thing about
 

535
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:48,100
straight up and the nice thing about
that usually with chicken firms you got

536
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,110
that usually with chicken firms you got
 

537
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,680
that usually with chicken firms you got
to keep them in water and when they lay

538
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:50,690
to keep them in water and when they lay
 

539
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,300
to keep them in water and when they lay
an egg the water pushes it to wherever

540
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:52,310
an egg the water pushes it to wherever
 

541
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,850
an egg the water pushes it to wherever
you want it to go and then they sort of

542
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:54,860
you want it to go and then they sort of
 

543
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,889
you want it to go and then they sort of
just jump around in the water and splash

544
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:56,899
just jump around in the water and splash
 

545
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:01,150
just jump around in the water and splash
around and that's okay but it does cause

546
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:01,160
around and that's okay but it does cause
 

547
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,579
around and that's okay but it does cause
extra leg because there's sound files

548
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:03,589
extra leg because there's sound files
 

549
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:08,220
extra leg because there's sound files
that have to play and unload and and

550
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,230
that have to play and unload and and
 

551
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,120
that have to play and unload and and
that when they're in the water

552
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,130
that when they're in the water
 

553
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,040
that when they're in the water
there's particle effects from the

554
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,050
there's particle effects from the
 

555
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,660
there's particle effects from the
splashing water and the chicken

556
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:13,670
splashing water and the chicken
 

557
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:22,480
splashing water and the chicken
splashing and to make a less laggy farm

558
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,490
splashing and to make a less laggy farm
 

559
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,509
splashing and to make a less laggy farm
or egg farm this will work pretty good I

560
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
or egg farm this will work pretty good I
 

561
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,829
or egg farm this will work pretty good I
think

562
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:28,839

 

563
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:31,300

okay we know what's and how we're doing

564
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,310
okay we know what's and how we're doing
 

565
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,800
okay we know what's and how we're doing
its but now we got to figure out where

566
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:32,810
its but now we got to figure out where
 

567
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,389
its but now we got to figure out where
where are we going to put this chicken

568
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:34,399
where are we going to put this chicken
 

569
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,579
where are we going to put this chicken
farm so this area is pretty much full

570
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:38,589
farm so this area is pretty much full
 

571
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:42,280
farm so this area is pretty much full
get the sheeps over there sheeps sheep

572
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,290
get the sheeps over there sheeps sheep
 

573
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:47,980
get the sheeps over there sheeps sheep
over there this is one possibility in

574
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:47,990
over there this is one possibility in
 

575
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,930
over there this is one possibility in
this little spot here we don't need what

576
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:49,940
this little spot here we don't need what
 

577
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,519
this little spot here we don't need what
we don't need much space might have

578
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:54,529
we don't need much space might have
 

579
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:58,269
we don't need much space might have
stuff below that interferes though still

580
00:16:58,269 --> 00:16:58,279
stuff below that interferes though still
 

581
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,939
stuff below that interferes though still
haven't figured a definite use for this

582
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:00,949
haven't figured a definite use for this
 

583
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:05,579
haven't figured a definite use for this
room I think it's too big though

584
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:05,589

 

585
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:11,470

everything else is pretty much hello it

586
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:11,480
everything else is pretty much hello it
 

587
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,970
everything else is pretty much hello it
else is pretty much full around here I

588
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:12,980
else is pretty much full around here I
 

589
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,370
else is pretty much full around here I
guess I'm sure we could find a spot

590
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:15,380
guess I'm sure we could find a spot
 

591
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,860
guess I'm sure we could find a spot
though there is this area here that

592
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:19,870
though there is this area here that
 

593
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,949
though there is this area here that
might work right now my chickens are in

594
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:23,959
might work right now my chickens are in
 

595
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:30,430
might work right now my chickens are in
there splashing around um

596
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:30,440

 

597
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,460

see if we were to let's just try over

598
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:33,470
see if we were to let's just try over
 

599
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,150
see if we were to let's just try over
there I think I want the chickens over

600
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,160
there I think I want the chickens over
 

601
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,700
there I think I want the chickens over
16 blocks away from me - if possible and

602
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:39,710
16 blocks away from me - if possible and
 

603
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,060
16 blocks away from me - if possible and
if we do that I don't think we'll get

604
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,070
if we do that I don't think we'll get
 

605
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,160
if we do that I don't think we'll get
the sound from them for just like

606
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,170
the sound from them for just like
 

607
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,120
the sound from them for just like
walking by here I'm not going to hit the

608
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,130
walking by here I'm not going to hit the
 

609
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,300
walking by here I'm not going to hit the
cow face yeah that's that's the cow face

610
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:52,310
cow face yeah that's that's the cow face
 

611
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,460
cow face yeah that's that's the cow face
the wall right there so that's not going

612
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:54,470
the wall right there so that's not going
 

613
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,420
the wall right there so that's not going
to work too bad

614
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:58,430
to work too bad
 

615
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,870
to work too bad
that would've been really good you know

616
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:01,880
that would've been really good you know
 

617
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,950
that would've been really good you know

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
them in the ender chest yes finally
 

623
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,900
them in the ender chest yes finally
we're gonna fix this guy's I keep saying

624
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:15,910
we're gonna fix this guy's I keep saying
 

625

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:30,830
wonderful ah what a relief I've actually
 

631
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,380
wonderful ah what a relief I've actually
thought about replacing a lot of this

632
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:32,390
thought about replacing a lot of this
 

633
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,210
thought about replacing a lot of this
clothes stone with lamps because I I

634
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:34,220
clothes stone with lamps because I I
 

635
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,230
clothes stone with lamps because I I
like the lamp look a lot more and maybe

636
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
like the lamp look a lot more and maybe
 

637
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,730
like the lamp look a lot more and maybe
getting rid of these trapdoors I'm just

638
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:39,740
getting rid of these trapdoors I'm just
 

639
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,150
getting rid of these trapdoors I'm just
having lamps in those corners I don't

640
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,160
having lamps in those corners I don't
 

641
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,420
having lamps in those corners I don't
know

642
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:43,430
know
 

643
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:49,960
know
it'd be worth doing um there's this spot

644
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:49,970
it'd be worth doing um there's this spot
 

645
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,120
it'd be worth doing um there's this spot
here - I've always wanted to do

646
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,130
here - I've always wanted to do
 

647
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,290
here - I've always wanted to do
something with I was thinking about

648
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:53,300
something with I was thinking about
 

649
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:59,530
something with I was thinking about
putting a snow golem here mmm probably

650
00:18:59,530 --> 00:18:59,540
putting a snow golem here mmm probably
 

651
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,310
putting a snow golem here mmm probably
too cluttered though whoo this is stuff

652
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:03,320
too cluttered though whoo this is stuff
 

653
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,780
too cluttered though whoo this is stuff
I thought I would have found a spot by

654
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:04,790
I thought I would have found a spot by
 

655
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,020
I thought I would have found a spot by
now piston elevators on the way there

656
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,030
now piston elevators on the way there
 

657
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,520
now piston elevators on the way there
hmm

658
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:11,530

 

659
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,750

and it's going to be a place we can

660
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
and it's going to be a place we can
 

661
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,140
and it's going to be a place we can
easily access I don't think there is any

662
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,150
easily access I don't think there is any
 

663
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,870
easily access I don't think there is any
free spots left anymore well I guess

664
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:19,880
free spots left anymore well I guess
 

665
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,380
free spots left anymore well I guess
there's this right

666
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:22,390
there's this right
 

667
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,060
there's this right
that's the drop-down I use for the cows

668
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,070
that's the drop-down I use for the cows
 

669
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,100
that's the drop-down I use for the cows
I don't think I'll ever need that again

670
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,110
I don't think I'll ever need that again
 

671
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,310
I don't think I'll ever need that again
though so we could maybe just seal that

672
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
though so we could maybe just seal that
 

673
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:41,240
though so we could maybe just seal that
up and use this

674
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,250

 

675
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,350

you know what this worked out pretty

676
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:43,360
you know what this worked out pretty
 

677
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,870
you know what this worked out pretty
good I think his idea I wanted to fill

678
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:45,880
good I think his idea I wanted to fill
 

679
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,300
good I think his idea I wanted to fill
in a small empty space around here that

680
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,310
in a small empty space around here that
 

681
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,870
in a small empty space around here that
I wasn't able to do anything with and I

682
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:51,880
I wasn't able to do anything with and I
 

683
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,930
I wasn't able to do anything with and I
think I got it I looked down and where I

684
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:54,940
think I got it I looked down and where I
 

685
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,000
think I got it I looked down and where I
dug down and there's actually nothing

686
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,010
dug down and there's actually nothing
 

687
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,650
dug down and there's actually nothing
below I thought I would hit the portal

688
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:58,660
below I thought I would hit the portal
 

689
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,860
below I thought I would hit the portal
room so that's good we got to go down to

690
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:01,870
room so that's good we got to go down to
 

691
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,660
room so that's good we got to go down to
why 25 I think is where I want it so

692
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:06,670
why 25 I think is where I want it so
 

693
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,320
why 25 I think is where I want it so
pretty far down and just see what

694
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,330
pretty far down and just see what
 

695
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,400
pretty far down and just see what
happens we don't need much space because

696
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,410
happens we don't need much space because
 

697
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,290
happens we don't need much space because
all all it's doing is transporting the

698
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:16,300
all all it's doing is transporting the
 

699
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,750
all all it's doing is transporting the
eggs up we found gold and we'll probably

700
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,760
eggs up we found gold and we'll probably
 

701
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,360
eggs up we found gold and we'll probably
build some other room down here at the

702
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,370
build some other room down here at the
 

703
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,480
build some other room down here at the
bottom where we can load in chickens and

704
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:27,490
bottom where we can load in chickens and
 

705
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,970
bottom where we can load in chickens and
we can maybe fry them or do anything

706
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:29,980
we can maybe fry them or do anything
 

707
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,750
we can maybe fry them or do anything
else we want but just the egg delivery

708
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
else we want but just the egg delivery
 

709
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,270
else we want but just the egg delivery
area needs to be up there and we'll

710
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:36,280
area needs to be up there and we'll
 

711
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,600
area needs to be up there and we'll
probably have some storage chests if we

712
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:39,610
probably have some storage chests if we
 

713
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,000
probably have some storage chests if we
dig this way what we hit this is two

714
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,010
dig this way what we hit this is two
 

715
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:49,740
dig this way what we hit this is two
towards our base okay that's the portal

716
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:49,750
towards our base okay that's the portal
 

717
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,850
towards our base okay that's the portal
room that's what I thought it's going to

718
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:50,860
room that's what I thought it's going to
 

719
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,930
room that's what I thought it's going to
hit but it comes in word enough that it

720
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:54,940
hit but it comes in word enough that it
 

721
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,550
hit but it comes in word enough that it
doesn't excellent and this is just caved

722
00:20:59,550 --> 00:20:59,560
doesn't excellent and this is just caved
 

723
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,850
doesn't excellent and this is just caved
down here I got nothing built below

724
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:01,860
down here I got nothing built below
 

725
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,470
down here I got nothing built below
below that so we're we're in the clear

726
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:04,480
below that so we're we're in the clear
 

727
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:16,390
below that so we're we're in the clear
here cool and get back up no oops

728
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400

 

729
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,030

when at first you don't succeed try try

730
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,040
when at first you don't succeed try try
 

731
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,299
when at first you don't succeed try try
again

732
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:21,309
again
 

733
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:26,890
again
right there we go okay how should we

734
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:26,900
right there we go okay how should we
 

735
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,630
right there we go okay how should we
design this what should we use for the

736
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
design this what should we use for the
 

737
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,799
design this what should we use for the
backing maybe I think the main thing

738
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:32,809
backing maybe I think the main thing
 

739
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:35,560
backing maybe I think the main thing
I've been using is this stone brick so

740
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:35,570
I've been using is this stone brick so
 

741
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,360
I've been using is this stone brick so
if we want to keep this look going on I

742
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:37,370
if we want to keep this look going on I
 

743
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,560
if we want to keep this look going on I
just have to stone brick up here too if

744
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:41,570
just have to stone brick up here too if
 

745
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,290
just have to stone brick up here too if
we don't like it we can always switch it

746
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:43,300
we don't like it we can always switch it
 

747
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:54,040
we don't like it we can always switch it
so get some of this and fill it in now

748
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,050
so get some of this and fill it in now
 

749
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,720
so get some of this and fill it in now
there's probably going to be some

750
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:55,730
there's probably going to be some
 

751
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:01,750
there's probably going to be some
believers - maybe two levers one of them

752
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
believers - maybe two levers one of them
 

753
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,830
believers - maybe two levers one of them
we will want it to turn off the egg

754
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
we will want it to turn off the egg
 

755
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,610
we will want it to turn off the egg
delivery so if we if we do or if we have

756
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:09,620
delivery so if we if we do or if we have
 

757
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,520
delivery so if we if we do or if we have
that power that lever

758
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:11,530
that power that lever
 

759
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,610
that power that lever
it'll be like let's see do we want it

760
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:15,620
it'll be like let's see do we want it
 

761
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,820
it'll be like let's see do we want it
there or do we want the eggs to come up

762
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:18,830
there or do we want the eggs to come up
 

763
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,590
there or do we want the eggs to come up
here or here

764
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:22,600

 

765
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,780

maybe maybe inside this little yeah that

766
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:25,790
maybe maybe inside this little yeah that
 

767
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,210
maybe maybe inside this little yeah that
looks good we'll have it in there so

768
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:28,220
looks good we'll have it in there so
 

769
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,540
looks good we'll have it in there so
we'll just make just go out one more and

770
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:31,550
we'll just make just go out one more and
 

771
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:36,280
we'll just make just go out one more and
we could probably put some lights back

772
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,290
we could probably put some lights back
 

773
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:41,380
we could probably put some lights back
there put them away again I keep doing

774
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:41,390
there put them away again I keep doing
 

775
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,850
there put them away again I keep doing
that I'm scared I'm gonna lose these

776
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:42,860
that I'm scared I'm gonna lose these
 

777
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,330
that I'm scared I'm gonna lose these
things because they take redstone even

778
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:46,340
things because they take redstone even
 

779
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,100
things because they take redstone even
though I have 50 repeaters on me I'm not

okay
 

785
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:57,280
okay
he's powered actually we got a power arm

786
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,290
he's powered actually we got a power arm
 

787
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:01,930
he's powered actually we got a power arm
from behind for running a lever free up

788
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:01,940
from behind for running a lever free up
 

789
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,860

don't think I have to use blast for
 

795
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,950
don't think I have to use blast for
forgetting the eggs up I think in these

forgetting the eggs up I think in these
 

797
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,250
forgetting the eggs up I think in these
other things too any solid block okay

798
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:21,260
other things too any solid block okay
 

799
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:28,260
other things too any solid block okay
and goods legs will come up here

800
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:28,270
and goods legs will come up here
 

801
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,330
and goods legs will come up here
that'll give us lights we want chess

802
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:31,340
that'll give us lights we want chess
 

803
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:36,940
that'll give us lights we want chess
also for storage mmm

804
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:36,950
also for storage mmm
 

805
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,720
also for storage mmm
oops could maybe put a chest there and

806
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:40,730
oops could maybe put a chest there and
 

807
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:47,050
oops could maybe put a chest there and
one there we got to get the levers

808
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,060
one there we got to get the levers
 

809
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,550
one there we got to get the levers
though levers don't forget about the

810
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:48,560
though levers don't forget about the
 

811
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,900
though levers don't forget about the
levers so probably have a lever here for

812
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:51,910
levers so probably have a lever here for
 

813
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:56,860
levers so probably have a lever here for
turning the delivery on or off should we

814
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:56,870
turning the delivery on or off should we
 

815
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,950
turning the delivery on or off should we
have one there too what would that do

816
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:01,960

 

817
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,800

what else could we make that do if we

818
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:05,810
what else could we make that do if we
 

819
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,950
what else could we make that do if we
set up if we set up a killing thing for

820
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:08,960
set up if we set up a killing thing for
 

821
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,920
set up if we set up a killing thing for
them we could maybe move the chickens up

822
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:11,930
them we could maybe move the chickens up
 

823
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:15,240
them we could maybe move the chickens up
here with minecarts somewhere over here

824
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,250
here with minecarts somewhere over here
 

825
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,880
here with minecarts somewhere over here
and have an automatic cooker thing for

826
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:18,890
and have an automatic cooker thing for
 

827
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,860
and have an automatic cooker thing for
them or something I don't know we

828
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:20,870
them or something I don't know we
 

829
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:26,710
them or something I don't know we
probably need one lever yeah so this

830
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:26,720
probably need one lever yeah so this
 

831
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,450
probably need one lever yeah so this
will change with wood I guess like

832
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:31,460
will change with wood I guess like
 

833
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,170
will change with wood I guess like
planks and I've I've been using jungle

834
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:35,180
planks and I've I've been using jungle
 

835
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,430
planks and I've I've been using jungle
wood now I don't really use the regular

836
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:36,440
wood now I don't really use the regular
 

837
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,760
wood now I don't really use the regular
planks for making sticks and stuff one

838
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:42,770
planks for making sticks and stuff one
 

839
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,870
planks for making sticks and stuff one
sec okay I got some ideas here ah gonna

840
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
sec okay I got some ideas here ah gonna
 

841
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,920
sec okay I got some ideas here ah gonna
make some of these first I think they're

842
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:50,930
make some of these first I think they're
 

843
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,380
make some of these first I think they're
just having a sign that says fresh eggs

844
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,390
just having a sign that says fresh eggs
 

845
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,060
just having a sign that says fresh eggs
or something up here whoops

846
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,070

 

847
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,300

whoopsies

848
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:58,310

okay fresh eggs or something like that
but I forgot we have item frames let's

852
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:03,920
but I forgot we have item frames let's
 

853
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:10,230
but I forgot we have item frames let's
use item frames why not

854
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,240

 

855
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,590

yeah yeah that's pretty cool another

856
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
yeah yeah that's pretty cool another
 

857
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,360
yeah yeah that's pretty cool another
option if we have the lever on that side

858
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,370
option if we have the lever on that side
 

859
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,960
option if we have the lever on that side
we might want to just put it over there

860
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:17,970
we might want to just put it over there
 

861
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:24,200
we might want to just put it over there
bounce out the look then the other thing

862
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,210
bounce out the look then the other thing
 

863
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,310
bounce out the look then the other thing
I'm not sure what to make this block

864
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,320
I'm not sure what to make this block
 

865
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,520
I'm not sure what to make this block
like if it can be solid I might just

866
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:29,530
like if it can be solid I might just
 

867
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:34,620
like if it can be solid I might just
make it glass after all the chess is the

868
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:34,630
make it glass after all the chess is the
 

869
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,170
make it glass after all the chess is the
other thing we got to think about we

870
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:37,180
other thing we got to think about we
 

871
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:42,720
other thing we got to think about we
could have them like that these fences

872
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:42,730
could have them like that these fences
 

873
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:46,280
could have them like that these fences
we could either pull back to there

874
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,290
we could either pull back to there
 

875
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:50,760
we could either pull back to there
keep it open or another option I guess

876
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:50,770
keep it open or another option I guess
 

877
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,040
keep it open or another option I guess
this will depend on how the eggs fly

878
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,050
this will depend on how the eggs fly
 

879
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,020
this will depend on how the eggs fly
when they when they reach the top here -

880
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,030
when they when they reach the top here -
 

881
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,360
when they when they reach the top here -
like if they're flying out over here or

882
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,370
like if they're flying out over here or
 

883
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,550
like if they're flying out over here or
something crazy we might need to contain

884
00:25:59,550 --> 00:25:59,560
something crazy we might need to contain
 

885
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,020
something crazy we might need to contain
them with a fence so the other options

886
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,030
them with a fence so the other options
 

887
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,400
them with a fence so the other options
we could have a fence gate there and

888
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,410
we could have a fence gate there and
 

889
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,390
we could have a fence gate there and
when we want to get eggs just open it up

890
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:08,400
when we want to get eggs just open it up
 

891
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,460
when we want to get eggs just open it up
and close it or something like that I

892
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:11,470
and close it or something like that I
 

893
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,720
and close it or something like that I
don't know I think for now let's just

894
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:12,730
don't know I think for now let's just
 

895
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,700
don't know I think for now let's just
keep it open though feels a bit better

896
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:16,710
keep it open though feels a bit better
 

897
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,740
keep it open though feels a bit better
we could have the chests there or I also

898
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:19,750
we could have the chests there or I also
 

899
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:24,420
we could have the chests there or I also
thought maybe what we should do oops

900
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:24,430
thought maybe what we should do oops
 

901
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:30,870
thought maybe what we should do oops
holy C it's going to be tough to do I

902
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:30,880
holy C it's going to be tough to do I
 

903
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,540
holy C it's going to be tough to do I
brought some of these yeah we got to do

904
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:36,550
brought some of these yeah we got to do
 

905
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,620
brought some of these yeah we got to do
it from underneath don't we remove this

906
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:40,630
it from underneath don't we remove this
 

907
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,720
it from underneath don't we remove this
block and instead use a stair going that

908
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:45,730
block and instead use a stair going that
 

909
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,480
block and instead use a stair going that
way I think would be best and same for

910
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:48,490
way I think would be best and same for
 

911
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,240
way I think would be best and same for
this side

912
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,250
this side
 

913
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:57,930
this side
oops okay and then what we could do is

914
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:57,940
oops okay and then what we could do is
 

915
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,970
oops okay and then what we could do is
have a double chest there extra storage

916
00:26:59,970 --> 00:26:59,980
have a double chest there extra storage
 

917
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,500
have a double chest there extra storage
if we want to do it that way use the

918
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:04,510
if we want to do it that way use the
 

919
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,530
if we want to do it that way use the
chest on the ground and then just have

920
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:07,540
chest on the ground and then just have
 

921
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:13,000
chest on the ground and then just have
this let's see what this looks like

922
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,010

 

923
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,010

that's that's another possibility better

924
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,020
that's that's another possibility better
 

925
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,590
that's that's another possibility better
for function you get more storage not as

926
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:18,600
for function you get more storage not as
 

927
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,150
for function you get more storage not as
good for looks so I don't think if you

928
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:23,160
good for looks so I don't think if you
 

929
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,650
good for looks so I don't think if you
have a chest here I think they change to

930
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:24,660
have a chest here I think they change to
 

931
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,550
have a chest here I think they change to
the hitbox can you actually click you

932
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:28,560
the hitbox can you actually click you
 

933
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,470
the hitbox can you actually click you
can click through them oh wow I didn't

934
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
can click through them oh wow I didn't
 

935
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,240
can click through them oh wow I didn't
know that

936
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,250
know that
 

937
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,060
know that
ci is able to click the double chest

938
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,070
ci is able to click the double chest
 

939
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:39,380
ci is able to click the double chest
below yeah because I think they made

940
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:39,390
below yeah because I think they made
 

941
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,120
below yeah because I think they made
these smaller let's just check that

942
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,130
these smaller let's just check that
 

943
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,900
these smaller let's just check that
right now now we're at Y 52 if you go on

944
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:44,910
right now now we're at Y 52 if you go on
 

945
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,250
right now now we're at Y 52 if you go on
top it's eight point eight seven five

946
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:48,260
top it's eight point eight seven five
 

947
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,550
top it's eight point eight seven five
tall

948
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:49,560
tall
 

949
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:56,480
tall
instead of a full block now hmm we could

950
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:56,490
instead of a full block now hmm we could
 

951
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,270
instead of a full block now hmm we could
have super storage and it would look

952
00:27:59,270 --> 00:27:59,280
have super storage and it would look
 

953
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,900
have super storage and it would look
pretty much the same then I'll think

954
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:02,910
pretty much the same then I'll think
 

955
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,850
pretty much the same then I'll think
about it anyway I think I've used up the

956
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:04,860
about it anyway I think I've used up the
 

957
