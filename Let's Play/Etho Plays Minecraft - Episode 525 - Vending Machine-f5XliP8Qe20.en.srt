different episode and we will never talk
 

17
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,609
different episode and we will never talk
about it again okay so I have an idea to

18
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:28,619
about it again okay so I have an idea to
 

19
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,380
about it again okay so I have an idea to
start us off with today a building

20
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:30,390
start us off with today a building
 

21
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,290
start us off with today a building
project should go fairly quickly I would

22
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:33,300
project should go fairly quickly I would
 

23
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,819
project should go fairly quickly I would
think it's a little bit complicated but

24
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:34,829
think it's a little bit complicated but
 

25
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,590
think it's a little bit complicated but
not crazy

26
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:36,600
not crazy
 

27
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,840
not crazy
there's two two things I've been wanting

28
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:38,850
there's two two things I've been wanting
 

29
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,240
there's two two things I've been wanting
to do and we're gonna combine the two

to do and we're gonna combine the two
 

31
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,889
to do and we're gonna combine the two
ideas together first off I've been

ideas together first off I've been
 

33
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,200
ideas together first off I've been
wanting to build a vending machine inner

34
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,210
wanting to build a vending machine inner
 

35
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,619
wanting to build a vending machine inner
worlds which is basically a building

36
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:48,629
worlds which is basically a building
 

37
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,160
worlds which is basically a building
that will give us stuff we use a lot

38
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,170
that will give us stuff we use a lot
 

39
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,209
that will give us stuff we use a lot
like we'll be able to refill like

40
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:53,219
like we'll be able to refill like
 

41
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,479
like we'll be able to refill like
rockets and or pearls food scaffolding

42
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:56,489
rockets and or pearls food scaffolding
 

43
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,840
rockets and or pearls food scaffolding
torches bones for bone meal wood and

44
00:00:59,840 --> 00:00:59,850
torches bones for bone meal wood and
 

45
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,540
torches bones for bone meal wood and
stone are eight things I use pretty

46
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:02,550
stone are eight things I use pretty
 

47
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,270
stone are eight things I use pretty
often in our let's play series here and

48
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
often in our let's play series here and
 

49
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,310
often in our let's play series here and
often I run out and I have to go all the

50
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:07,320
often I run out and I have to go all the
 

51
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,609
often I run out and I have to go all the
way back to the man cave to refill and

52
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:09,619
way back to the man cave to refill and
 

53
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:12,140
way back to the man cave to refill and
they're not even organized at the man

54
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,150
they're not even organized at the man
 

55
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,030
they're not even organized at the man
cave so I have to like run around

56
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,040
cave so I have to like run around
 

57
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,789
cave so I have to like run around
gathering gunpowder and whatever to to

58
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
gathering gunpowder and whatever to to
 

59
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,410
gathering gunpowder and whatever to to
make rockets and and that kind of stuff

60
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:18,420
make rockets and and that kind of stuff
 

61
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,649
make rockets and and that kind of stuff
how cool would it be if we had all that

62
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:21,659
how cool would it be if we had all that
 

63
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,770
how cool would it be if we had all that
stuff just in a place where we could go

64
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:24,780
stuff just in a place where we could go
 

65
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,840
stuff just in a place where we could go
and refill alright that's the plan so

66
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:26,850
and refill alright that's the plan so
 

67
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,850
and refill alright that's the plan so
I've also been wanting to use the new

68
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:28,860
I've also been wanting to use the new
 

69
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,120
I've also been wanting to use the new
lecterns for like a redstone II project

70
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,130
lecterns for like a redstone II project
 

71
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,510
lecterns for like a redstone II project
so we're gonna use those as our controls

72
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:34,520
so we're gonna use those as our controls
 

73
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,069
so we're gonna use those as our controls
for the vending machine so what you can

74
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:37,079
for the vending machine so what you can
 

75
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,620
for the vending machine so what you can
do with these is put a book and quill on

76
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:39,630
do with these is put a book and quill on
 

77
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,200
do with these is put a book and quill on
them and they actually emit red stone

78
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,210
them and they actually emit red stone
 

79
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,090
them and they actually emit red stone
using comparators so check this out if

80
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:47,100
using comparators so check this out if
 

81
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,569
using comparators so check this out if
you put a comparator on there with some

82
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:49,579
you put a comparator on there with some
 

83
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:53,420
you put a comparator on there with some
dusts depending on what page you are on

84
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:53,430
dusts depending on what page you are on
 

85
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,730
dusts depending on what page you are on
it will emit a signal that's different

86
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:55,740
it will emit a signal that's different
 

87
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,130
it will emit a signal that's different
so right now it's one a distance of one

88
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:58,140
so right now it's one a distance of one
 

89
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,499
so right now it's one a distance of one
if we go over a page to two it's a

90
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:00,509
if we go over a page to two it's a
 

91
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,080
if we go over a page to two it's a
distance of three and one of the neat

92
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,090
distance of three and one of the neat
 

93
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,580
distance of three and one of the neat
things about these lecterns is you

94
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:04,590
things about these lecterns is you
 

95
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,230
things about these lecterns is you
actually have a pretty good amount of

96
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
actually have a pretty good amount of
 

97
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,359
actually have a pretty good amount of
control over how far the redstone emits

98
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:08,369
control over how far the redstone emits
 

99
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,910
control over how far the redstone emits
based on how many pages are in the book

100
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:10,920
based on how many pages are in the book
 

101
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,910
based on how many pages are in the book
so if we want like a one to one

102
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
so if we want like a one to one
 

103
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,060
so if we want like a one to one
Paige / redstone distance all we got to

104
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,070
Paige / redstone distance all we got to
 

105
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,460
Paige / redstone distance all we got to
do is create like 15 pages so we're

106
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:19,470
do is create like 15 pages so we're
 

107
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,000
do is create like 15 pages so we're
gonna add 15 to the book like so now

108
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,010
gonna add 15 to the book like so now
 

109
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,780
gonna add 15 to the book like so now
when we flip through here we're at 1 for

110
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:26,790
when we flip through here we're at 1 for
 

111
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,690
when we flip through here we're at 1 for
one page - oh I didn't hit done

112
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:31,700
one page - oh I didn't hit done
 

113
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,880
one page - oh I didn't hit done
oopsies alright let's try that again if

114
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:34,890
oopsies alright let's try that again if
 

115
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,230
oopsies alright let's try that again if
you don't hit done it doesn't save your

116
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:36,240
you don't hit done it doesn't save your
 

117
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:44,030
you don't hit done it doesn't save your
changes alright we hit done oh wait a

118
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,040
changes alright we hit done oh wait a
 

119
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,230
changes alright we hit done oh wait a
minute wait a minute maybe I actually

120
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:45,240
minute wait a minute maybe I actually
 

121
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,920
minute wait a minute maybe I actually
have to write something on the 15th page

122
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:47,930
have to write something on the 15th page
 

123
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,470
have to write something on the 15th page
let's put an A there and now it's 15

124
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:51,480
let's put an A there and now it's 15
 

125
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,830
let's put an A there and now it's 15
pages long ok ok so now that it's 15

126
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:54,840
pages long ok ok so now that it's 15
 

127
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,520
pages long ok ok so now that it's 15
pages at page one distance of 1/2

128
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:58,530
pages at page one distance of 1/2
 

129
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,930
pages at page one distance of 1/2
distance of 2 3 is 3 4 is 4 and so on

130
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:02,940
distance of 2 3 is 3 4 is 4 and so on
 

131
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,830
distance of 2 3 is 3 4 is 4 and so on
and so forth so that is pretty cool the

132
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:06,840
and so forth so that is pretty cool the
 

133
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,050
and so forth so that is pretty cool the
plan with our vending machine here is

134
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,060
plan with our vending machine here is
 

135
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,790
plan with our vending machine here is
we're gonna use two lecterns the first

136
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
we're gonna use two lecterns the first
 

137
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,460
we're gonna use two lecterns the first
one's gonna choose what item we're gonna

138
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:13,470
one's gonna choose what item we're gonna
 

139
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,200
one's gonna choose what item we're gonna
get out of the vending machine and the

140
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,210
get out of the vending machine and the
 

141
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,620
get out of the vending machine and the
second one is gonna be how many of that

142
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:18,630
second one is gonna be how many of that
 

143
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,290
second one is gonna be how many of that
item we're gonna get out of it and then

144
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:21,300
item we're gonna get out of it and then
 

145
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,400
item we're gonna get out of it and then
there'll be a button in the middle to

146
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,410
there'll be a button in the middle to
 

147
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,650
there'll be a button in the middle to
actually call the item is the plan so

148
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:26,660
actually call the item is the plan so
 

149
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,530
actually call the item is the plan so
kind of figured we would do it in our

150
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:30,540
kind of figured we would do it in our
 

151
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,270
kind of figured we would do it in our
village here just so that we have some

152
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,280
village here just so that we have some
 

153
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,550
village here just so that we have some
redstone devices in our village if you

154
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
redstone devices in our village if you
 

155
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,470
redstone devices in our village if you
build something purely decorative

156
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
build something purely decorative
 

157
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,650
build something purely decorative
I find you never use it actually so if

158
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:39,660
I find you never use it actually so if
 

159
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,420
I find you never use it actually so if
we actually want to like go to this

160
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:41,430
we actually want to like go to this
 

161
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,730
we actually want to like go to this
village and use it we need some some

162
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:43,740
village and use it we need some some
 

163
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,780
village and use it we need some some
practical useful redstone devices here

164
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:46,790
practical useful redstone devices here
 

165
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,699
practical useful redstone devices here
or farms or something of that nature

166
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:49,709
or farms or something of that nature
 

167
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,310
or farms or something of that nature
or will never go here so we're gonna add

168
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:52,320
or will never go here so we're gonna add
 

169
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,640
or will never go here so we're gonna add
a vending machine I think over there's

170
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:55,650
a vending machine I think over there's
 

171
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,520
a vending machine I think over there's
my plan how's it gonna look so we can

172
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:58,530
my plan how's it gonna look so we can
 

173
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,380
my plan how's it gonna look so we can
have a path that runs through here still

174
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:00,390
have a path that runs through here still
 

175
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,510
have a path that runs through here still
if we want yeah I think we'll do that

176
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:04,520
if we want yeah I think we'll do that
 

177
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,100
if we want yeah I think we'll do that
we're gonna use the two lecterns like

178
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,110
we're gonna use the two lecterns like
 

179
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,620
we're gonna use the two lecterns like
over here I'm also gonna set up like I

180
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:12,630
over here I'm also gonna set up like I
 

181
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,180
over here I'm also gonna set up like I
brought some other stuff with us like a

182
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,190
brought some other stuff with us like a
 

183
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,190
brought some other stuff with us like a
stonecutter we'll probably set up a

184
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,200
stonecutter we'll probably set up a
 

185
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,460
stonecutter we'll probably set up a
little workstation sort of thing here

186
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:19,470
little workstation sort of thing here
 

187
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,420
little workstation sort of thing here
probably some crafting tables just so

188
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:23,430
probably some crafting tables just so
 

189
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,730
probably some crafting tables just so
it's it's nice and practical and useful

190
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:25,740
it's it's nice and practical and useful
 

191
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,680
it's it's nice and practical and useful
to us as we're working on the

192
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,690
to us as we're working on the
 

193
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,570
to us as we're working on the
village will have all these things at

194
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:29,580
village will have all these things at
 

195
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,720
village will have all these things at
arm's reach I wish probably an

196
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:32,730
arm's reach I wish probably an
 

197
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,100
arm's reach I wish probably an
enderchest here too because I'm just

198
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,110
enderchest here too because I'm just
 

199
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,490
enderchest here too because I'm just
kind of scattering them on the floor

200
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,500
kind of scattering them on the floor
 

201
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:43,100
kind of scattering them on the floor
they will snake this and put it looks

202
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,110
they will snake this and put it looks
 

203
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,220
they will snake this and put it looks
like she put that in the middle over

204
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,230
like she put that in the middle over
 

205
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,300
like she put that in the middle over
here yeah something like that oh and if

206
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:50,310
here yeah something like that oh and if
 

207
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,240
here yeah something like that oh and if
we could cover this we can still access

208
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,250
we could cover this we can still access
 

209
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,130
we could cover this we can still access
just don't get it through the block

210
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:55,140
just don't get it through the block
 

211
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,140
just don't get it through the block
because it's the ender chest is a little

212
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,150
because it's the ender chest is a little
 

213
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,480
because it's the ender chest is a little
bit lower right so now the thing about

214
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,490
bit lower right so now the thing about
 

215
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,620
bit lower right so now the thing about
these lecterns is they will actually

216
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:02,630
these lecterns is they will actually
 

217
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,850
these lecterns is they will actually
which is our book this one here we'll

218
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:04,860
which is our book this one here we'll
 

219
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,420
which is our book this one here we'll
put that there

220
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:05,430
put that there
 

221
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,030
put that there
this one here they'll actually emit the

222
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,040
this one here they'll actually emit the
 

223
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,770
this one here they'll actually emit the
signal through a block as well so we can

224
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:09,780
signal through a block as well so we can
 

225
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,500
signal through a block as well so we can
we can keep a brick piece of brick over

226
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:12,510
we can keep a brick piece of brick over
 

227
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,910
we can keep a brick piece of brick over
there and then put the comparator on the

228
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:13,920
there and then put the comparator on the
 

229
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,700
there and then put the comparator on the
other side and it'll pick up the signal

230
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:16,710
other side and it'll pick up the signal
 

231
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,570
other side and it'll pick up the signal
through the wall so we'll do that and

232
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:19,580
through the wall so we'll do that and
 

233
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,610
through the wall so we'll do that and
I'm going to try hide most of our stuff

234
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:22,620
I'm going to try hide most of our stuff
 

235
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,690
I'm going to try hide most of our stuff
underground here is my plan so maybe

236
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:25,700
underground here is my plan so maybe
 

237
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,190
underground here is my plan so maybe
we'll set up a water stream that comes

238
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:28,200
we'll set up a water stream that comes
 

239
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,420
we'll set up a water stream that comes
up from underground with our items and

240
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:31,430
up from underground with our items and
 

241
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,520
up from underground with our items and
then I want them to like fall out here

242
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:34,530
then I want them to like fall out here
 

243
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,610
then I want them to like fall out here
on to us uh-huh yeah so this is pretty

244
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:37,620
on to us uh-huh yeah so this is pretty
 

245
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,409
on to us uh-huh yeah so this is pretty
much all we need for our vending machine

246
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:39,419
much all we need for our vending machine
 

247
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,900
much all we need for our vending machine
just this little little tiny thing so

248
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:41,910
just this little little tiny thing so
 

249
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,970
just this little little tiny thing so
we'll choose our item here we'll choose

250
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:43,980
we'll choose our item here we'll choose
 

251
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,310
we'll choose our item here we'll choose
how much hit the button and then this

252
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
how much hit the button and then this
 

253
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,020
how much hit the button and then this
water stream is gonna deliver it to us

254
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,030
water stream is gonna deliver it to us
 

255
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,909
water stream is gonna deliver it to us
basically so this is all we need for a

256
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
basically so this is all we need for a
 

257
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,030
basically so this is all we need for a
footprint this is tiny little building

258
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,040
footprint this is tiny little building
 

259
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,950
footprint this is tiny little building
now I did realize something here like we

260
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
now I did realize something here like we
 

261
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,110
now I did realize something here like we
have this beast of a building over here

262
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
have this beast of a building over here
 

263
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,790
have this beast of a building over here
this is kind of what we want to do over

264
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
this is kind of what we want to do over
 

265
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,150
this is kind of what we want to do over
here as well and all we got is this tiny

266
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
here as well and all we got is this tiny
 

267
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,080
here as well and all we got is this tiny
little stupid thing so why am i hiding

268
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,090
little stupid thing so why am i hiding
 

269
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,030
little stupid thing so why am i hiding
the redstone underground if we want a

270
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,040
the redstone underground if we want a
 

271
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,860
the redstone underground if we want a
big massive building here I think

272
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:09,870
big massive building here I think
 

273
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,900
big massive building here I think
because the redstone is gonna be like a

274
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:11,910
because the redstone is gonna be like a
 

275
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,810
because the redstone is gonna be like a
big glob like a big big blob of redstone

276
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:14,820
big glob like a big big blob of redstone
 

277
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,000
big glob like a big big blob of redstone
and it's not gonna have much shape to

278
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,010
and it's not gonna have much shape to
 

279
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,980
and it's not gonna have much shape to
its like that like this building has so

280
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:18,990
its like that like this building has so
 

281
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,170
its like that like this building has so
we're still gonna hide that underground

282
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:21,180
we're still gonna hide that underground
 

283
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,930
we're still gonna hide that underground
and my plan is like when we start up a

284
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:23,940
and my plan is like when we start up a
 

285
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,640
and my plan is like when we start up a
second building it's gonna connect to

286
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,650
second building it's gonna connect to
 

287
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,100
second building it's gonna connect to
this and like stack on top of this

288
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,110
this and like stack on top of this
 

289
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,070
this and like stack on top of this
thing's roof and combine together so

290
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,080
thing's roof and combine together so
 

291
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
thing's roof and combine together so
we'll have a big massive thing over here

292
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,090
we'll have a big massive thing over here
 

293
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,150
we'll have a big massive thing over here
as well in the future they'll probably

294
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:35,160
as well in the future they'll probably
 

295
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,930
as well in the future they'll probably
like spread out this way but we should

296
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:38,940
like spread out this way but we should
 

297
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,400
like spread out this way but we should
still height at the Redstone underground

298
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:40,410
still height at the Redstone underground
 

299
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,540
still height at the Redstone underground
just so we can shape

300
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:41,550
just so we can shape
 

301
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,779
just so we can shape
shape things better and yeah so this is

302
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:44,789
shape things better and yeah so this is
 

303
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:47,210
shape things better and yeah so this is
what we're gonna do we're gonna run a

304
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:47,220
what we're gonna do we're gonna run a
 

305
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,300
what we're gonna do we're gonna run a
comparator chain Underground's so we can

306
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,310
comparator chain Underground's so we can
 

307
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,010
comparator chain Underground's so we can
hide the redstone down there and this is

308
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,020
hide the redstone down there and this is
 

309
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,719
hide the redstone down there and this is
neat like if we go to page four doing

310
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:56,729
neat like if we go to page four doing
 

311
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:59,140
neat like if we go to page four doing
this little pattern with the comparators

312
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,150
this little pattern with the comparators
 

313
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,339
this little pattern with the comparators
we can check it out here you see it's a

314
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:01,349
we can check it out here you see it's a
 

315
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:03,170
we can check it out here you see it's a
distance of four so it keeps the signal

316
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,180
distance of four so it keeps the signal
 

317
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,210
distance of four so it keeps the signal
strength even though it ran through this

318
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,220
strength even though it ran through this
 

319
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,899
strength even though it ran through this
whole chain of things so that's all good

320
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:08,909
whole chain of things so that's all good
 

321
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:12,680
whole chain of things so that's all good
we can we can keep what the lectern says

322
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:12,690
we can we can keep what the lectern says
 

323
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,740
we can we can keep what the lectern says
here and use it all the way over here

324
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:14,750
here and use it all the way over here
 

325
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,570
here and use it all the way over here
all right good stuff so we got our

326
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:17,580
all right good stuff so we got our
 

327
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,249
all right good stuff so we got our
interface figured out here now we're

328
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:19,259
interface figured out here now we're
 

329
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,960
interface figured out here now we're
gonna get to actually building the

330
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:20,970
gonna get to actually building the
 

331
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,240
gonna get to actually building the
redstone a vending machine part of this

332
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,250
redstone a vending machine part of this
 

333
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,670
redstone a vending machine part of this
and should go pretty quick I kind of got

334
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
and should go pretty quick I kind of got
 

335
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,390
and should go pretty quick I kind of got
it planned out already so this signal we

336
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,400
it planned out already so this signal we
 

337
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,159
it planned out already so this signal we
get from the lectern you see the first

338
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:31,169
get from the lectern you see the first
 

339
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,550
get from the lectern you see the first
four on right now the other four are off

340
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:33,560
four on right now the other four are off
 

341
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,110
four on right now the other four are off
that's not really useful to us we need

342
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,120
that's not really useful to us we need
 

343
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,059
that's not really useful to us we need
to be able to control like one single

344
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:38,069
to be able to control like one single
 

345
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:41,779
to be able to control like one single
device so we're gonna do a trick here we

346
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:41,789
device so we're gonna do a trick here we
 

347
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:45,409
device so we're gonna do a trick here we
extend this look what happens here so

348
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:45,419
extend this look what happens here so
 

349
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,809
extend this look what happens here so
it's a signal strength of four you'll

350
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:47,819
it's a signal strength of four you'll
 

351
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,450
it's a signal strength of four you'll
see the first three though it's on down

352
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:50,460
see the first three though it's on down
 

353
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,689
see the first three though it's on down
below here and on up above beyond that

354
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:53,699
below here and on up above beyond that
 

355
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,409
below here and on up above beyond that
it's off and off right there's only one

356
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:57,419
it's off and off right there's only one
 

357
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,200
it's off and off right there's only one
spot where it's on below and off above

358
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,210
spot where it's on below and off above
 

359
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,339
spot where it's on below and off above
and we set up a giant or like a bigger

360
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:04,349
and we set up a giant or like a bigger
 

361
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:07,610
and we set up a giant or like a bigger
and array here to check all eight of

362
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:07,620
and array here to check all eight of
 

363
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,709
and array here to check all eight of
them and the one that it's on below and

364
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:09,719
them and the one that it's on below and
 

365
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:13,219
them and the one that it's on below and
off above is the one that will let us

366
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:13,229
off above is the one that will let us
 

367
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:16,159
off above is the one that will let us
signal through so we put some torches

368
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:16,169
signal through so we put some torches
 

369
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:21,249
signal through so we put some torches
there some torches on top and basically

370
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:21,259
there some torches on top and basically
 

371
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:23,689
there some torches on top and basically
the repeater down here takes the signal

372
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:23,699
the repeater down here takes the signal
 

373
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,290
the repeater down here takes the signal
from the bottom and then we add another

374
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:27,300
from the bottom and then we add another
 

375
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,320
from the bottom and then we add another
set of repeaters for the top so it takes

376
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,330
set of repeaters for the top so it takes
 

377
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,630
set of repeaters for the top so it takes
it from here and then combines the two

378
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
it from here and then combines the two
 

379
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,490
it from here and then combines the two
together and it finds the one where it's

380
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:34,500
together and it finds the one where it's
 

381
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,639
together and it finds the one where it's
it's on here and off above and that's

382
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:37,649
it's on here and off above and that's
 

383
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,560
it's on here and off above and that's
the torch that turns on over here all

384
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:39,570
the torch that turns on over here all
 

385
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,079
the torch that turns on over here all
the other ones will be off so that is

386
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:42,089
the other ones will be off so that is
 

387
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,040
the other ones will be off so that is
pretty cool

388
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,050
pretty cool
 

389
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,710
pretty cool
then we're gonna use that torch to power

390
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:45,720
then we're gonna use that torch to power
 

391
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,389
then we're gonna use that torch to power
some sticky pistons set those on set

392
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
some sticky pistons set those on set
 

393
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,910
some sticky pistons set those on set
those up over here put some blocks above

394
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:52,920
those up over here put some blocks above
 

395
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,780
those up over here put some blocks above
these

396
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:54,790
these
 

397
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,860
these
oopsies and something like that and now

398
00:08:59,860 --> 00:08:59,870
oopsies and something like that and now
 

399
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,300
oopsies and something like that and now
we're gonna add a platform here that'll

400
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,310
we're gonna add a platform here that'll
 

401
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,360
we're gonna add a platform here that'll
send a redstone signal into whatever

402
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,370
send a redstone signal into whatever
 

403
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,710
send a redstone signal into whatever
Pistons are up alright and up roll up so

404
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
Pistons are up alright and up roll up so
 

405
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,509
Pistons are up alright and up roll up so
just set some repeaters here with some

406
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
just set some repeaters here with some
 

407
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,139
just set some repeaters here with some
redstone dust and we just got this thing

408
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:17,149
redstone dust and we just got this thing
 

409
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:19,300
redstone dust and we just got this thing
done already so yeah when this gets

410
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,310
done already so yeah when this gets
 

411
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,190
done already so yeah when this gets
powered it's only gonna let the signal

412
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
powered it's only gonna let the signal
 

413
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,500
powered it's only gonna let the signal
through here and depending on what the

414
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:23,510
through here and depending on what the
 

415
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,110
through here and depending on what the
lectern said that will adjust which one

416
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,120
lectern said that will adjust which one
 

417
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,240
lectern said that will adjust which one
gets chosen and then we use that to

418
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,250
gets chosen and then we use that to
 

419
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,040
gets chosen and then we use that to
control some droppers I think we're

420
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,050
control some droppers I think we're
 

421
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,509
control some droppers I think we're
gonna do them like this

422
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:34,519
gonna do them like this
 

423
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,620
gonna do them like this
we'll set one up here we're gonna do two

424
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:38,630
we'll set one up here we're gonna do two
 

425
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,720
we'll set one up here we're gonna do two
because like if you're just sending a

426
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:40,730
because like if you're just sending a
 

427
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,040
because like if you're just sending a
signal to one of them it can kind of

428
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,050
signal to one of them it can kind of
 

429
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,800
signal to one of them it can kind of
take a long time to get the items out if

430
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:44,810
take a long time to get the items out if
 

431
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,240
take a long time to get the items out if
we have two sets of droppers it'll be

432
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,250
we have two sets of droppers it'll be
 

433
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,670
we have two sets of droppers it'll be
twice as quick okay so then we want to

434
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:48,680
twice as quick okay so then we want to
 

435
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,259
twice as quick okay so then we want to
be able to fill these droppers with our

436
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:50,269
be able to fill these droppers with our
 

437
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:52,090
be able to fill these droppers with our
items nice and easy so we're gonna have

438
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:52,100
items nice and easy so we're gonna have
 

439
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,190
items nice and easy so we're gonna have
one set of hoppers facing into this one

440
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,200
one set of hoppers facing into this one
 

441
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,980
one set of hoppers facing into this one
another set facing down into these ones

442
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:56,990
another set facing down into these ones
 

443
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,160
another set facing down into these ones
and we'll combine the two together and

444
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,170
and we'll combine the two together and
 

445
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,440
and we'll combine the two together and
also this is where we're gonna set up a

446
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:02,450
also this is where we're gonna set up a
 

447
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,150
also this is where we're gonna set up a
water stream to bring our items to us so

448
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,160
water stream to bring our items to us so
 

449
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,680
water stream to bring our items to us so
I made this eight blocks long on purpose

450
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:08,690
I made this eight blocks long on purpose
 

451
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,940
I made this eight blocks long on purpose
because that's as far as water will

452
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:09,950
because that's as far as water will
 

453
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,870
because that's as far as water will
reach and it'll go underneath and then

454
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:13,880
reach and it'll go underneath and then
 

455
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,540
reach and it'll go underneath and then
up a water elevator here it's the plan

456
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:18,550
up a water elevator here it's the plan
 

457
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,000
up a water elevator here it's the plan
and finally here what we do is we

458
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,010
and finally here what we do is we
 

459
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,500
and finally here what we do is we
connect the two sets of droppers

460
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:23,510
connect the two sets of droppers
 

461
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,269
connect the two sets of droppers
together with a couple hoppers like this

462
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
together with a couple hoppers like this
 

463
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,269
together with a couple hoppers like this
we put some chests above this is what's

464
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:28,279
we put some chests above this is what's
 

465
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,460
we put some chests above this is what's
gonna hold our big stash of items like

466
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:30,470
gonna hold our big stash of items like
 

467
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,590
gonna hold our big stash of items like
our rockets and and torches and whatever

468
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:32,600
our rockets and and torches and whatever
 

469
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,840
our rockets and and torches and whatever
and now check this out when we put some

470
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:34,850
and now check this out when we put some
 

471
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,319
and now check this out when we put some
items in it evenly splits them into this

472
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:38,329
items in it evenly splits them into this
 

473
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:40,949
items in it evenly splits them into this
dropper and this one here the lower one

474
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
dropper and this one here the lower one
 

475
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,689
dropper and this one here the lower one
so that's pretty cool and we set this up

476
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:43,699
so that's pretty cool and we set this up
 

477
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,370
so that's pretty cool and we set this up
just so that they'll be close to the

478
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:45,380
just so that they'll be close to the
 

479
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,710
just so that they'll be close to the
surface so we can probably just have

480
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:47,720
surface so we can probably just have
 

481
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,269
surface so we can probably just have
some trap doors or something above the

482
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
some trap doors or something above the
 

483
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,220
some trap doors or something above the
chest and easily refill it just by

484
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,230
chest and easily refill it just by
 

485
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,980
chest and easily refill it just by
walking over top here it was quite a

486
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:53,990
walking over top here it was quite a
 

487
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,810
walking over top here it was quite a
while ago now but it looks like it's

488
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:55,820
while ago now but it looks like it's
 

489
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,620
while ago now but it looks like it's
still here

490
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:56,630
still here
 

491
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,210
still here
remember when we set up this cannon we

492
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:58,220
remember when we set up this cannon we
 

493
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,699
remember when we set up this cannon we
came up with a fancy little redstone

494
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:00,709
came up with a fancy little redstone
 

495
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:02,650
came up with a fancy little redstone
device here this is the last piece of

496
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:02,660
device here this is the last piece of
 

497
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,439
device here this is the last piece of
our vending machine puzzle this is a

498
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:05,449
our vending machine puzzle this is a
 

499
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:07,780
our vending machine puzzle this is a
variable timer we came up with

500
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:07,790
variable timer we came up with
 

501
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,770
variable timer we came up with
that's let's see it shot out six ladders

502
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:11,780
that's let's see it shot out six ladders
 

503
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,260
that's let's see it shot out six ladders
that time depending on where this item

504
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,270
that time depending on where this item
 

505
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,660
that time depending on where this item
frame is rotated affects how many items

506
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:16,670
frame is rotated affects how many items
 

507
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,120
frame is rotated affects how many items
we get they'll be between two to nine

508
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,130
we get they'll be between two to nine
 

509
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,870
we get they'll be between two to nine
pulses at that time we got five if we

510
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
pulses at that time we got five if we
 

511
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,600
pulses at that time we got five if we
rotate it one more time it'll be four so

512
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:25,610
rotate it one more time it'll be four so
 

513
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,830
rotate it one more time it'll be four so
what we're gonna do is get rid of the

514
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:26,840
what we're gonna do is get rid of the
 

515
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,020
what we're gonna do is get rid of the
item frame and use a lectern instead and

516
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,030
item frame and use a lectern instead and
 

517
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,050
item frame and use a lectern instead and
like copy this over to our vending

518
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:32,060
like copy this over to our vending
 

519
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:38,140

521
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,730
machine all right guys we got it all
together here and I've been testing it

522
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:39,740
together here and I've been testing it
 

523
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,650
together here and I've been testing it
out and I keep having a problem where

524
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:41,660
out and I keep having a problem where
 

525
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,980
out and I keep having a problem where
the items land in between the hoppers

went from two droppers down to one

588
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,030
went from two droppers down to one
 

589
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,360
went from two droppers down to one
realized one was way too slow went up to

590
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,370
realized one was way too slow went up to
 

591
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,940
realized one was way too slow went up to
four now per item so this like we had it

592
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:09,950
four now per item so this like we had it
 

593
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,770
four now per item so this like we had it
before if the Pistons up sends power

594
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:11,780
before if the Pistons up sends power
 

595
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,590
before if the Pistons up sends power
into this block activates this dropper

596
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:14,600
into this block activates this dropper
 

597
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,110
into this block activates this dropper
and this one we have an observer here to

598
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
and this one we have an observer here to
 

599
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,030
and this one we have an observer here to
detect when this gets activated sends

600
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
detect when this gets activated sends
 

601
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,470
detect when this gets activated sends
power up here to the other dropper and

602
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
power up here to the other dropper and
 

603
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,639
power up here to the other dropper and
likewise

604
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:21,649
likewise
 

605
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:25,210
likewise
this detects this dropper and then this

606
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:25,220
this detects this dropper and then this
 

607
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,920
this detects this dropper and then this
observer detects one this detects this

608
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:26,930
observer detects one this detects this
 

609
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,069
observer detects one this detects this
and sends power here to this one alright

610
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:30,079
and sends power here to this one alright
 

611
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,379
and sends power here to this one alright
I made this so we can go inside to

612
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:32,389
I made this so we can go inside to
 

613
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:36,519
I made this so we can go inside to
refill them so 4 times 9 that's 36

614
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:36,529
refill them so 4 times 9 that's 36
 

615
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,199
refill them so 4 times 9 that's 36
stacks of items which is quite a bit

616
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:38,209
stacks of items which is quite a bit
 

617
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:39,460
stacks of items which is quite a bit
it'll take a while before we need to

618
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:39,470
it'll take a while before we need to
 

619
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,900
it'll take a while before we need to
refill so that should be okay we don't

620
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:43,910
refill so that should be okay we don't
 

621
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,400
refill so that should be okay we don't
really need a chest it would have been

622
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:45,410
really need a chest it would have been
 

623
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,829
really need a chest it would have been
nice if we could have had an auto fill

624
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:47,839
nice if we could have had an auto fill
 

625
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,929
nice if we could have had an auto fill
with a chest or something but it'll be

626
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:49,939
with a chest or something but it'll be
 

627
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:52,480
with a chest or something but it'll be
fine now the other big thing here though

00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:57,579
issues they had like a startup time
 

633
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:59,859
issues they had like a startup time
before it started activating so I had to

634
00:13:59,859 --> 00:13:59,869
before it started activating so I had to
 

635
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:03,429
before it started activating so I had to
redesign that as well basically the

636
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:03,439
redesign that as well basically the
 

637
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:06,129
redesign that as well basically the
lectern comes down here for the amount

638
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:06,139
lectern comes down here for the amount
 

639
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:09,699
lectern comes down here for the amount
of items and goes to this comparator

640
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:09,709
of items and goes to this comparator
 

641
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,639
of items and goes to this comparator
which is interested track mode and this

642
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:12,649
which is interested track mode and this
 

643
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:16,449
which is interested track mode and this
is our button press over here goes to a

644
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:16,459
is our button press over here goes to a
 

645
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:19,600
is our button press over here goes to a
monostable to this little doohickey to

this pulsar and not gonna go super

648
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:23,749
this pulsar and not gonna go super
 

649
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:24,910

detailed in that hopefully you

650
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:24,920
detailed in that hopefully you
 

651
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,610
detailed in that hopefully you
understood the way we send the button

652
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:27,620
understood the way we send the button
 

653
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,639
understood the way we send the button
press down below by the way is I got a

654
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:30,649
press down below by the way is I got a
 

655
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:32,079
press down below by the way is I got a
piston that pushes a redstone block

656
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:32,089
piston that pushes a redstone block
 

657
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:34,119
piston that pushes a redstone block
downward because there wasn't enough

658
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:34,129
downward because there wasn't enough
 

659
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:38,799
downward because there wasn't enough
space to like run a spiral of a redstone

660
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:38,809
space to like run a spiral of a redstone
 

661
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,090
space to like run a spiral of a redstone
downwards so we have to do something

662
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:40,100
downwards so we have to do something
 

663
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,100
downwards so we have to do something
fancy so over here we can choose how

664
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,110
fancy so over here we can choose how
 

665
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,100
fancy so over here we can choose how
many items goes from 8 to 40 is

666
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,110
many items goes from 8 to 40 is
 

667
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,919
many items goes from 8 to 40 is
generally I don't want more than a stack

668
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:50,929
generally I don't want more than a stack
 

669
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:53,410
generally I don't want more than a stack
the idea is just 3 fill because I always

670
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:53,420
the idea is just 3 fill because I always

up the stack we don't want to go beyond

676
00:14:59,410 --> 00:14:59,420
up the stack we don't want to go beyond
 

677
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,449
up the stack we don't want to go beyond
that let's see let's try it out right

678
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:04,459
that let's see let's try it out right
 

679
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:05,980
that let's see let's try it out right
now we got some stone in there and I put

680
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:05,990
now we got some stone in there and I put
 

681
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,900
now we got some stone in there and I put
some dirt in for the wood just to test

682
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:07,910
some dirt in for the wood just to test
 

683
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:13,239
some dirt in for the wood just to test
it so let's go for eight stone press

684
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:13,249
it so let's go for eight stone press
 

685
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:16,179
it so let's go for eight stone press
that there's a little bit of delay like

686
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:16,189
that there's a little bit of delay like
 

687
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:17,710
that there's a little bit of delay like
it takes a couple seconds but we get it

688
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:17,720
it takes a couple seconds but we get it
 

689
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,119
it takes a couple seconds but we get it
pretty quick let's go up to the max

690
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:22,129
pretty quick let's go up to the max
 

691
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,389
pretty quick let's go up to the max
let's go to 40 press the button

692
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:25,399
let's go to 40 press the button
 

693
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,460
let's go to 40 press the button
everything is fairly quick I'm happy

694
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:27,470
everything is fairly quick I'm happy
 

695
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,059
everything is fairly quick I'm happy
with that

696
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:30,069

 

697
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:33,220

doo-doo-doo-doo and we got our 40 so

698
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,230
doo-doo-doo-doo and we got our 40 so
 

699
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,889
doo-doo-doo-doo and we got our 40 so
that's cool all right

700
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:34,899
that's cool all right
 

701
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:37,259
that's cool all right
some of these aren't accurate I found

702
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:37,269
some of these aren't accurate I found
 

703
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:45,569
some of these aren't accurate I found
out let's try this 129 let's see just a

704
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:45,579
out let's try this 129 let's see just a
 

705
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:49,199
out let's try this 129 let's see just a
weird way Oh II did get 29 okay that

706
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:49,209
weird way Oh II did get 29 okay that
 

707
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:50,910
weird way Oh II did get 29 okay that
that one might be accurate let's go to

708
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:50,920
that one might be accurate let's go to
 

709
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,960
that one might be accurate let's go to
25 it'll be like plus or minus one

710
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:54,970
25 it'll be like plus or minus one
 

711
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,569
25 it'll be like plus or minus one
sometimes so we have 26 instead 25 if we

712
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:00,579
sometimes so we have 26 instead 25 if we
 

713
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:04,499
sometimes so we have 26 instead 25 if we
do it again we'll get 24 and if we do it

714
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:04,509
do it again we'll get 24 and if we do it
 

715
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:07,980
do it again we'll get 24 and if we do it
again we'll get 26 again it's a little

716
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:07,990
again we'll get 26 again it's a little
 

717
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,049
again we'll get 26 again it's a little
strange it's only a couple that do that

718
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:10,059
strange it's only a couple that do that
 

719
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:12,749
strange it's only a couple that do that
though it I'm not entirely sure why you

720
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:12,759
though it I'm not entirely sure why you
 

721
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:13,949
though it I'm not entirely sure why you
have something to do with the observers

722
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:13,959
have something to do with the observers
 

723
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,879
have something to do with the observers
and bud powering it's time it'll be 26

724
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:17,889
and bud powering it's time it'll be 26
 

725
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:25,079
and bud powering it's time it'll be 26
again uh-huh anyways let's try switch to

726
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:25,089
again uh-huh anyways let's try switch to
 

727
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:26,759
again uh-huh anyways let's try switch to
a different item so we only have dirt

728
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:26,769
a different item so we only have dirt
 

729
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:27,829
a different item so we only have dirt
there for now

730
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
there for now
 

731
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,980
there for now
let's go to 15 what where'd this come

732
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:31,990
let's go to 15 what where'd this come
 

733
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,919
let's go to 15 what where'd this come
from

734
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:33,929
from
 

735
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:38,460
from
uh-oh do we have a an issue so we got

736
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:38,470
uh-oh do we have a an issue so we got
 

737
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,989
uh-oh do we have a an issue so we got
plus one that time plus 150 15 does this

738
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:42,999
plus one that time plus 150 15 does this
 

739
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:49,079
plus one that time plus 150 15 does this
give an item when we cycle oh oh it does

740
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:49,089
give an item when we cycle oh oh it does
 

741
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:54,989
give an item when we cycle oh oh it does
no that's really bad okay

742
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:54,999
no that's really bad okay
 

743
00:16:54,999 --> 00:17:04,970
no that's really bad okay
can I fix that it's not supposed to

744
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:04,980

 

745
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,350

like if I put a block there it doesn't

746
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
like if I put a block there it doesn't
 

747
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,670
like if I put a block there it doesn't
happen all right hmm uh-huh

748
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:11,680
happen all right hmm uh-huh
 

749
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,350
happen all right hmm uh-huh
okay we figure it out why it's not

750
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
okay we figure it out why it's not
 

751
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,200
okay we figure it out why it's not
accurate as well now so it doesn't

752
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,210
accurate as well now so it doesn't
 

753
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,010
accurate as well now so it doesn't
happen normally like if I cycle normally

754
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:19,020
happen normally like if I cycle normally
 

755
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,540
happen normally like if I cycle normally
it doesn't shoot out blocks constantly

756
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:21,550
it doesn't shoot out blocks constantly
 

757
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:27,180
it doesn't shoot out blocks constantly
right what happens is we hit this we get

758
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,190
right what happens is we hit this we get
 

759
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:32,190
right what happens is we hit this we get
our items let's turn this up all right

760
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:32,200
our items let's turn this up all right
 

761
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,330
our items let's turn this up all right
and apparently we're bud powering one of

762
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:36,340
and apparently we're bud powering one of
 

763
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,700
and apparently we're bud powering one of
the droppers so when this observer

764
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:38,710
the droppers so when this observer
 

765
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,690
the droppers so when this observer
powers up here it also powers this one

766
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:41,700
powers up here it also powers this one
 

767
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,300
powers up here it also powers this one
but powers it right from this block so

768
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,310
but powers it right from this block so
 

769
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,900
but powers it right from this block so
whenever this updates again it shoots

770
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:48,910
whenever this updates again it shoots
 

771
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,300
whenever this updates again it shoots
out another item which is a little bit

772
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,310
out another item which is a little bit
 

773
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,520
out another item which is a little bit
annoying uh-huh

774
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:53,530
annoying uh-huh
 

775
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,320
annoying uh-huh
but anyways we got to stock it up with

776
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,330
but anyways we got to stock it up with
 

777
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,690
but anyways we got to stock it up with
supplies now so we need paper for

778
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:57,700
supplies now so we need paper for
 

779
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:03,570
supplies now so we need paper for
rockets let's do it we can get the bones

780
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:03,580
rockets let's do it we can get the bones
 

781
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,340
rockets let's do it we can get the bones
in the gunpowder we need from our mob

782
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:05,350
in the gunpowder we need from our mob
 

783
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,800
in the gunpowder we need from our mob
system here which still works pretty

784
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:07,810
system here which still works pretty
 

785
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,470
system here which still works pretty
good by the way the odd issue every now

786
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
good by the way the odd issue every now
 

787
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,420
good by the way the odd issue every now

they're not falling off the edges now I

946
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:12,530
they're not falling off the edges now I
 

947
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,310
they're not falling off the edges now I
think more are getting for the middle

948
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,320
think more are getting for the middle
 

949
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,740
think more are getting for the middle
for sure right but there's a bunch head

950
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:20,750
for sure right but there's a bunch head
 

951
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,060
for sure right but there's a bunch head
there just like sitting there now that

952
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,070
there just like sitting there now that
 

953
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,409
there just like sitting there now that
that aren't even trying to get to the

954
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:23,419
that aren't even trying to get to the
 

955
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:26,020
that aren't even trying to get to the
middle so if we made it a three-wide

956
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,030
middle so if we made it a three-wide
 

957
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,659
middle so if we made it a three-wide
that should solve everything and it

958
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:28,669
that should solve everything and it
 

959
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:30,220
that should solve everything and it
looks like our platform down below isn't

960
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,230
looks like our platform down below isn't
 

961
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,900
looks like our platform down below isn't
loaded with Enderman anymore

962
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:32,910
loaded with Enderman anymore

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,330

 

965
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,230

well I made a couple more changes to the

966
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:39,240
well I made a couple more changes to the
 

967
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,690
well I made a couple more changes to the
farm here but overall it's really

968
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:41,700
farm here but overall it's really
 

969
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,870
farm here but overall it's really
efficient again we got no problem ok

970
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:44,880
efficient again we got no problem ok
 

971
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,570
efficient again we got no problem ok
enough XP like we we farm it faster than

972
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:47,580
enough XP like we we farm it faster than
 

973
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,070
enough XP like we we farm it faster than
we can take it in so there's not really

974
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,080
we can take it in so there's not really
 

975
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,540
we can take it in so there's not really
any points making 3 wide actually so we

976
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:53,550
any points making 3 wide actually so we
 

977
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,890
any points making 3 wide actually so we
won't be able to take the XP in any

978
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:54,900
won't be able to take the XP in any
 

979
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,830
won't be able to take the XP in any
faster even if we made the farm slightly

980
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:57,840
faster even if we made the farm slightly
 

981
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,760
faster even if we made the farm slightly
more efficient you know that's fine I

982
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:01,770
more efficient you know that's fine I
 

983
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,530
more efficient you know that's fine I
decide to get rid of all those magma

annoying and put carpet down as well to
 

989
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:11,300

hopefully reduce teleporting although I

990
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:11,310
hopefully reduce teleporting although I
 

991
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,100

quite sure about that not really having

994
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:16,350
quite sure about that not really having
 

995
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,680
quite sure about that not really having
much teleporting issues just the odd guy

996
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:18,690
much teleporting issues just the odd guy
 

997
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:23,840
much teleporting issues just the odd guy
here and there but yeah overall I think

/ / ice glass sea lanterns so I was able

1046
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:24,540
/ / ice glass sea lanterns so I was able
 

1047
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,230
/ / ice glass sea lanterns so I was able
to extend it all the way to our

1048
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:27,240
to extend it all the way to our
 

1049
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,420
to extend it all the way to our
underwater base now so maybe I'll

1050
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:29,430
underwater base now so maybe I'll
 

1051
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,090
underwater base now so maybe I'll
actually get to working on this thing

1052
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:31,100
actually get to working on this thing
 

1053
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,210
actually get to working on this thing
now that we can get here quickly so we

1054
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:35,220
now that we can get here quickly so we
 

1055
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,950
now that we can get here quickly so we
started it like zero zero our nether

1056
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
started it like zero zero our nether
 

1057
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,140
started it like zero zero our nether
tunnels 1,500 blocks along this

1058
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,150
tunnels 1,500 blocks along this
 

1059
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,630
tunnels 1,500 blocks along this
direction now and like a hundred blocks

1060
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:41,640
direction now and like a hundred blocks
 

1061
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,860
direction now and like a hundred blocks
on the z-coordinate 138 so I thought

1062
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:45,870
on the z-coordinate 138 so I thought
 

1063
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,360
on the z-coordinate 138 so I thought
that was kind of cool the only thing

1064
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,370
that was kind of cool the only thing
 

1065
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,010
that was kind of cool the only thing
we're missing is a couple rails I'm

1066

we're missing is a couple rails I'm
 

1067
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,430
we're missing is a couple rails I'm
