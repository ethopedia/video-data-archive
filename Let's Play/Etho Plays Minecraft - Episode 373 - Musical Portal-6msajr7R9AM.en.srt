episode should be called musical portal

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,210
episode should be called musical portal
 

23
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,369
episode should be called musical portal
that is what we're going to be doing

24
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:46,379
that is what we're going to be doing
 

25
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,369
that is what we're going to be doing
first off here let me introduce you to

first off here let me introduce you to
 

27
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,910
first off here let me introduce you to
the concept as I get the stuff together

28
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
the concept as I get the stuff together
 

29
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,069
the concept as I get the stuff together
I guess I'll just grab all my redstone

30
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:55,079
I guess I'll just grab all my redstone
 

31
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,000
I guess I'll just grab all my redstone
stuff droppers yes so I tried this out

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,010
stuff droppers yes so I tried this out
 

33
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,590
stuff droppers yes so I tried this out
today and create it finally this is an

34
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:00,600
today and create it finally this is an
 

35
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,920
today and create it finally this is an
idea I've had for quite a while and

36
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:02,930
idea I've had for quite a while and
 

37
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,719
idea I've had for quite a while and
tried it out today it actually sounds

38
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:05,729
tried it out today it actually sounds
 

39
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:07,490
tried it out today it actually sounds
pretty cool so we're gonna build it in

40
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:07,500
pretty cool so we're gonna build it in
 

41
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,050
pretty cool so we're gonna build it in
our world here so I can show you guys

42
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:09,060
our world here so I can show you guys
 

43
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,200
our world here so I can show you guys
and so we have as a permanent feature

44
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,210
and so we have as a permanent feature
 

45
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,940
and so we have as a permanent feature
too because I think it's something I

46
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:13,950
too because I think it's something I
 

47
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,800
too because I think it's something I
want to keep in our world but we're

48
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:15,810
want to keep in our world but we're
 

49
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,450
want to keep in our world but we're
going to build it in the end just so

50
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:17,460
going to build it in the end just so
 

51
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,940
going to build it in the end just so
that there's no worries about it causing

52
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:19,950
that there's no worries about it causing
 

53
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,370
that there's no worries about it causing
leg or anything like that not at all

54
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:22,380
leg or anything like that not at all
 

55
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,149
leg or anything like that not at all
whatever so let's head on over to the

56
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
whatever so let's head on over to the
 

57
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,330
whatever so let's head on over to the
end okay oh we probably need more note

58
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:29,340
end okay oh we probably need more note
 

59
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,300
end okay oh we probably need more note
blocks actually so the concept is I

60
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:32,310
blocks actually so the concept is I
 

61
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,460
blocks actually so the concept is I
wanted to hear what it would sound like

62
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:34,470
wanted to hear what it would sound like
 

63
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,910
wanted to hear what it would sound like
if we built a redstone device that

64
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
if we built a redstone device that
 

65
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,520
if we built a redstone device that
randomly played music for us that's

66
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:40,530
randomly played music for us that's
 

67
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,889
randomly played music for us that's
that's the goal with this thing try it

68
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:42,899
that's the goal with this thing try it
 

69
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,590
that's the goal with this thing try it
it out it is pretty interesting I think

70
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
it out it is pretty interesting I think
 

71
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,990
it out it is pretty interesting I think
you guys are going to like this so we're

72
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
you guys are going to like this so we're
 

73
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,940
you guys are going to like this so we're
going to build the device by our end

74
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:49,950
going to build the device by our end
 

75
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,160
going to build the device by our end
portal in the end and it'll be a cool

76
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,170
portal in the end and it'll be a cool
 

77
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,590
portal in the end and it'll be a cool
thing that we hear every time we we

78
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
thing that we hear every time we we
 

79
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,060
thing that we hear every time we we
leave the end and return to the normal

80
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,070
leave the end and return to the normal
 

81
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,929
leave the end and return to the normal
world here so let's take our cool ice

82
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:02,939
world here so let's take our cool ice
 

83
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,690
world here so let's take our cool ice
road here oh and I'm hungry if only I

84
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:08,700
road here oh and I'm hungry if only I
 

85
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,000
road here oh and I'm hungry if only I
could inject food

86
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,010
could inject food
 

87
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,229
could inject food
liquidly liquidly yeah sure into into my

88
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
liquidly liquidly yeah sure into into my
 

89
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,809
liquidly liquidly yeah sure into into my
body but you know I never did check this

90
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:18,819
body but you know I never did check this
 

91
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:21,929
body but you know I never did check this
out I left a torch here let's just peek

92
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:21,939
out I left a torch here let's just peek
 

93
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:24,960
out I left a torch here let's just peek
really quickly to to mark the spot

94
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:24,970
really quickly to to mark the spot
 

95
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,240
really quickly to to mark the spot
because this is where the tape spiders

96
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,250
because this is where the tape spiders
 

97
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,660
because this is where the tape spiders
fell down and I saw there was a zombie

98
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:29,670
fell down and I saw there was a zombie
 

99
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,830
fell down and I saw there was a zombie
spawner here where's the cave spider

100
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
spawner here where's the cave spider
 

101
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,569
spawner here where's the cave spider
spawner this little sidetrack there's

102
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:36,579
spawner this little sidetrack there's
 

103
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,729
spawner this little sidetrack there's
definitely a tape spider spawner right

104
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:38,739
definitely a tape spider spawner right
 

105
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:41,690
definitely a tape spider spawner right
around here somewhere

106
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:41,700
around here somewhere
 

107
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:49,410
around here somewhere
very close I think maybe not I thought

108
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:49,420
very close I think maybe not I thought
 

109
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,069
very close I think maybe not I thought
there was is it above us maybe they're

110
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:53,079
there was is it above us maybe they're
 

111
00:02:53,079 --> 00:03:01,940
there was is it above us maybe they're
not spawning now no it's not there

112
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:01,950

 

113
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,319

curious now okay I found it somehow I

116
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:07,690
curious now okay I found it somehow I
 

117
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,330
curious now okay I found it somehow I
did not see this when I was building the

118
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:09,340
did not see this when I was building the
 

119
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,309
did not see this when I was building the
tunnel even though it's right next to

120
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:11,319
tunnel even though it's right next to
 

121
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,349
tunnel even though it's right next to
the tunnel like right right next to it

122
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:15,359
the tunnel like right right next to it
 

123
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:19,470
the tunnel like right right next to it
uh-huh okay I guess because this wall

124
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:19,480
uh-huh okay I guess because this wall
 

125
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,559
uh-huh okay I guess because this wall
was here I didn't see it anyway let's

126
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:22,569
was here I didn't see it anyway let's
 

127
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,629
was here I didn't see it anyway let's
make our way over to the end and we will

128
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:24,639
make our way over to the end and we will
 

129
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,710
make our way over to the end and we will
start building this thing hmm

130
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
start building this thing hmm
 

131
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,280
start building this thing hmm
you know our end here is pretty messy so

132
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,290
you know our end here is pretty messy so
 

133
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,140
you know our end here is pretty messy so
I'm going to do some infrastructure to

134
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,150
I'm going to do some infrastructure to
 

135
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,080
I'm going to do some infrastructure to
it too we're going to try make it look a

136
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,090
it too we're going to try make it look a
 

137
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,289
it too we're going to try make it look a
little nicer I'm going to build a road

138
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:40,299
little nicer I'm going to build a road
 

139
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,680
little nicer I'm going to build a road
like a little path and an area around

140
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:43,690
like a little path and an area around
 

141
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,990
like a little path and an area around
the portal here out of ice and then

142
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
the portal here out of ice and then
 

143
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,970
the portal here out of ice and then
along the path is where we'll put the

144
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:47,980
along the path is where we'll put the
 

145
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,159
along the path is where we'll put the
note blocks like we'll line both sides

146
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:50,169
note blocks like we'll line both sides
 

147
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:54,180
note blocks like we'll line both sides
with note blocks that play music so this

148
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,190
with note blocks that play music so this
 

149
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:00,300
with note blocks that play music so this
will go from here to where is it where's

150
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:00,310
will go from here to where is it where's
 

151
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,149
will go from here to where is it where's
where do we come in at yeah over here

152
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:03,159
where do we come in at yeah over here
 

153
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,099
where do we come in at yeah over here
so probably go up to here I'll have an

154
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:05,109
so probably go up to here I'll have an
 

155
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:06,659
so probably go up to here I'll have an
elevator that will bring us up to this

156
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:06,669
elevator that will bring us up to this
 

157
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:09,240
elevator that will bring us up to this
path we're building and if we want to

158
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,250
path we're building and if we want to
 

159
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,189
path we're building and if we want to
leave the end it'll be really easy to

160
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:11,199
leave the end it'll be really easy to
 

161
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,069
leave the end it'll be really easy to
get out this eats road I'll probably

162
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:14,079
get out this eats road I'll probably
 

163
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,020
get out this eats road I'll probably
have to shorten it it doesn't need to be

164
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,030
have to shorten it it doesn't need to be
 

165
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,870
have to shorten it it doesn't need to be
this long anymore so I'll just like chop

166
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
this long anymore so I'll just like chop
 

167
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,699
this long anymore so I'll just like chop
it back maybe up to there or something

168
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:20,709
it back maybe up to there or something
 

169
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,020
it back maybe up to there or something
because it's in the way as well right

170
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,030
because it's in the way as well right
 

171
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,330
because it's in the way as well right
now

172
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:23,340
now
 

173
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,120
now
yeah I'm probably gonna die here so here

174
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,130
yeah I'm probably gonna die here so here
 

175
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:35,910
yeah I'm probably gonna die here so here

glad they did that need to get some dirt

180
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,120
glad they did that need to get some dirt
 

181
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,510

so we got kind of a new look going on

186
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:54,700
so we got kind of a new look going on
 

187
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,910
so we got kind of a new look going on
here we got the packed ice and stone

188
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:56,920
here we got the packed ice and stone
 

189
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,360
here we got the packed ice and stone
brick I kind of like it maybe one or two

190
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,370
brick I kind of like it maybe one or two
 

191
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,090
brick I kind of like it maybe one or two
more colors mixed in would look cool got

192
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:03,100
more colors mixed in would look cool got
 

193
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,730
more colors mixed in would look cool got
like a drop down around the portal which

194
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:05,740
like a drop down around the portal which
 

195
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,600
like a drop down around the portal which
I like as well

196
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:06,610
I like as well
 

197
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,300
I like as well
this item stream will be able to lower

198
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:09,310
this item stream will be able to lower
 

199
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,730
this item stream will be able to lower
down to this level and get rid of this

200
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:11,740
down to this level and get rid of this
 

201
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,940
down to this level and get rid of this
garbage so that's cool but we're going

202
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:14,950
garbage so that's cool but we're going
 

203
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,430
garbage so that's cool but we're going
to put in the note block randomizers now

204
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
to put in the note block randomizers now
 

205
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,710
to put in the note block randomizers now
I'm going to show you how to do it

206
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
I'm going to show you how to do it
 

207
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,550
I'm going to show you how to do it
actually really simple so let's get to

208
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:23,560
actually really simple so let's get to
 

209
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,430
actually really simple so let's get to
it here basically I got the foundation

210
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:26,440
it here basically I got the foundation
 

211
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,840
it here basically I got the foundation
laid for it all along here I'm going to

212
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:30,850
laid for it all along here I'm going to
 

213
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,850
laid for it all along here I'm going to
put dirt so let me get the piano sound

214
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:32,860
put dirt so let me get the piano sound
 

215
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,860
put dirt so let me get the piano sound
from the note blocks because I think

216
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:34,870
from the note blocks because I think
 

217
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,480
from the note blocks because I think
that sounded the best I tried a couple

218
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:36,490
that sounded the best I tried a couple
 

219
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,260
that sounded the best I tried a couple
different ones today and pretty much

220
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:40,270
different ones today and pretty much
 

221
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,940
different ones today and pretty much
only like the piano but we'll experiment

222
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:41,950
only like the piano but we'll experiment
 

223
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,270
only like the piano but we'll experiment
with it just to play around with it put

224
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
with it just to play around with it put
 

225
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,320
with it just to play around with it put
note blocks on top that one you when we

226
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,330
note blocks on top that one you when we
 

227
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,920
note blocks on top that one you when we
hit them piano sound all right and I'm

228
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:52,930
hit them piano sound all right and I'm
 

229
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,219
hit them piano sound all right and I'm
gonna put 13 down I don't know much

230
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:56,229
gonna put 13 down I don't know much
 

231
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:00,060
gonna put 13 down I don't know much
about music theory okay so somebody else

232
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,070
about music theory okay so somebody else
 

233
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,250
about music theory okay so somebody else
might have better results with what I'm

234
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:02,260
might have better results with what I'm
 

235
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,350
might have better results with what I'm
doing here just because they know what

236
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:04,360
doing here just because they know what
 

237
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,480
doing here just because they know what
they're doing there's a lot of different

238
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:06,490
they're doing there's a lot of different
 

239
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,680
they're doing there's a lot of different
ways you could do it there's lots of

240
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:07,690
ways you could do it there's lots of
 

241
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,430
ways you could do it there's lots of
different probabilities you could have

242
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:10,440
different probabilities you could have
 

243
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,930
different probabilities you could have
there's different amounts of note blocks

244
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:12,940
there's different amounts of note blocks
 

245
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,219
there's different amounts of note blocks
different tunes and frequency of

246
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:16,229
different tunes and frequency of
 

247
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:18,510
different tunes and frequency of
activating the note blocks there's lots

248
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:18,520
activating the note blocks there's lots
 

249
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,460
activating the note blocks there's lots
of variables to this thing so there if

250
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:20,470
of variables to this thing so there if
 

251
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,230
of variables to this thing so there if
you want to try it play around with it

252
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
you want to try it play around with it
 

253
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,730
you want to try it play around with it
you might come up with something cool

254
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:23,740
you might come up with something cool
 

255
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,650
you might come up with something cool
but this is just what I did earlier

256
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:25,660
but this is just what I did earlier
 

257
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,920
but this is just what I did earlier
today and I thought it was pretty good

258
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:27,930
today and I thought it was pretty good
 

259
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,980
today and I thought it was pretty good
so do that's alright we are going to

260
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:31,990
so do that's alright we are going to
 

261
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,500
so do that's alright we are going to
make a bunch of randomizers here so

262
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:34,510
make a bunch of randomizers here so
 

263
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,140
make a bunch of randomizers here so
comparators going and terminer mad at me

264
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,150
comparators going and terminer mad at me
 

265
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,670
comparators going and terminer mad at me
again darn it

266
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:38,680
again darn it
 

267
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,500
again darn it
and down below we'll have droppers do

268
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:43,510
and down below we'll have droppers do
 

269
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,430
and down below we'll have droppers do
not use dispensers here they don't work

270
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,440
not use dispensers here they don't work
 

271
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,560
not use dispensers here they don't work
so you drop your schooling all along

272
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:48,570
so you drop your schooling all along
 

273
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,030
so you drop your schooling all along
we'll have to fill these with items this

274
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,040
we'll have to fill these with items this
 

275
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,180
we'll have to fill these with items this
is what determines our probability so I

276
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,190
is what determines our probability so I
 

277
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,440
is what determines our probability so I
tried earlier today having nine items in

278
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:58,450
tried earlier today having nine items in
 

279
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:03,450
tried earlier today having nine items in
here so which what we got to do let's

280
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:03,460
here so which what we got to do let's
 

281
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,430
here so which what we got to do let's
see and by the way I have this extra

282
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
see and by the way I have this extra
 

283
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,170
see and by the way I have this extra
repeater at the end here so that we can

284
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:07,180
repeater at the end here so that we can
 

285
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,820
repeater at the end here so that we can
lower the wiring one block and then

286
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:08,830
lower the wiring one block and then
 

287
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:14,270
lower the wiring one block and then
cover over it like oops like like this

288
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,280
cover over it like oops like like this
 

289
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,500
cover over it like oops like like this
kind of thing so we can hide the wiring

290
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:16,510
kind of thing so we can hide the wiring
 

291
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,370
kind of thing so we can hide the wiring
later let me go back up here my crafting

292
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:20,380
later let me go back up here my crafting
 

293
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,620
later let me go back up here my crafting
bench this is one of those times where I

294
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:22,630
bench this is one of those times where I
 

295
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,180
bench this is one of those times where I
really should have just made a second

296
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,190
really should have just made a second
 

297
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,520
really should have just made a second
crafting bench like I usually do and

298
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:26,530
crafting bench like I usually do and
 

299
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,170
crafting bench like I usually do and
have them like right next to each other

300
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:28,180
have them like right next to each other
 

301
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,250
have them like right next to each other
but I went all the way back here we need

302
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:32,260
but I went all the way back here we need
 

303
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,650
but I went all the way back here we need
what items

304
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:34,660
what items
 

305
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,760
what items
yes let's grab some more items and grass

306
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:38,770
yes let's grab some more items and grass
 

307
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,270
yes let's grab some more items and grass
blocks were work I guess some slabs sure

308
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
blocks were work I guess some slabs sure
 

309
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,970
blocks were work I guess some slabs sure
fences why not all right we need swords

310
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:44,980
fences why not all right we need swords
 

311
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,930
fences why not all right we need swords
all right so you need an item that will

312
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:48,940
all right so you need an item that will
 

313
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,970
all right so you need an item that will
transmit the power signal more than one

314
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:50,980
transmit the power signal more than one
 

315
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,520
transmit the power signal more than one
block so something that only has one per

316
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:53,530
block so something that only has one per
 

317
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,150
block so something that only has one per
stack like a sword and I did not do that

318

00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:08,890
or I mean that glass I thought it was
 

325
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,560
or I mean that glass I thought it was

326
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:10,570
gonna go off the edge here okay my
 

327
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,130
gonna go off the edge here okay my
inventory is too full so in each of

328
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,140
inventory is too full so in each of
 

329
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,860
inventory is too full so in each of
these we need eight regular items that

330
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:16,870
these we need eight regular items that
 

331
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,590
these we need eight regular items that
stack to 64 right so we'll put that in

332
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:19,600
stack to 64 right so we'll put that in
 

333
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:26,640
stack to 64 right so we'll put that in
and this and this stick why not and the

334
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:26,650
and this and this stick why not and the
 

335
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,710
and this and this stick why not and the
item that will travel three blocks from

336
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
item that will travel three blocks from
 

337
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,210
item that will travel three blocks from
the comparator is the sword alright and

338
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:33,220
the comparator is the sword alright and
 

339
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,940
the comparator is the sword alright and
fence and what else do we have one more

340
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:38,950
fence and what else do we have one more
 

341
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,460
fence and what else do we have one more
junk item come on it's gotta be another

342
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:41,470
junk item come on it's gotta be another
 

343
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:47,550
junk item come on it's gotta be another
one

344
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:47,560

 

345
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,070

yeah there might have been a better

346
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,080
yeah there might have been a better
 

347
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,860
yeah there might have been a better
choice there above this will have

348
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:53,870
choice there above this will have
 

349
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,120
choice there above this will have
hoppers then and down this line more

350
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,130
hoppers then and down this line more
 

351
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,740
hoppers then and down this line more
wire this is what's going to activate

352
00:08:59,740 --> 00:08:59,750
wire this is what's going to activate
 

353
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,730
wire this is what's going to activate
them all okay and then we're going to

354
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:03,740
them all okay and then we're going to
 

355
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,769
them all okay and then we're going to
hook a clock up to this and it's going

356
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:05,779
hook a clock up to this and it's going
 

357
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,810
hook a clock up to this and it's going
to constantly activate these randomizers

358
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:07,820
to constantly activate these randomizers
 

359
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,690
to constantly activate these randomizers
and if the sword goes into the hopper

360
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:10,700
and if the sword goes into the hopper
 

361
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,150
and if the sword goes into the hopper
then it will travel three blocks and

362
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,160
then it will travel three blocks and
 

363
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,050
then it will travel three blocks and
activate the note block all right so let

364
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,060
activate the note block all right so let
 

365
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,850
activate the note block all right so let
me finish this up here and we will try

366
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:18,860
me finish this up here and we will try
 

367
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,570
me finish this up here and we will try
it out oh all righty so we are pretty

368
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:22,580
it out oh all righty so we are pretty
 

369
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,730
it out oh all righty so we are pretty
much ready to go here we just have one

370
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:24,740
much ready to go here we just have one
 

371
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,730
much ready to go here we just have one
more thing left to do we have to tune

372
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:27,740
more thing left to do we have to tune
 

373
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,010
more thing left to do we have to tune
the note blocks so currently they're all

374
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,020
the note blocks so currently they're all
 

375
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:35,170
the note blocks so currently they're all
the same the default the way I did it

376
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:35,180
the same the default the way I did it
 

377
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,030
the same the default the way I did it
and again I don't really know what I'm

378
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
and again I don't really know what I'm
 

379
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,740
and again I don't really know what I'm
doing here I just added two to each each

380
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:41,750
doing here I just added two to each each
 

381
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,880
doing here I just added two to each each
one down the line so this one's at 0 1 2

382
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:45,890
one down the line so this one's at 0 1 2
 

383
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,790
one down the line so this one's at 0 1 2
1 2 3 4 5 oops sometimes I do that when

384
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:51,800
1 2 3 4 5 oops sometimes I do that when
 

385
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,640
1 2 3 4 5 oops sometimes I do that when
I'm counting 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2

386
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:57,650
I'm counting 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2
 

387
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:03,910
I'm counting 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and etc etc and it does

388
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and etc etc and it does
 

389
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,030
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and etc etc and it does
something like this when we're all done

390
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,040

 

391
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,499

so we are skipping one of the notes in

392
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:12,509
so we are skipping one of the notes in
 

393
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,840
so we are skipping one of the notes in
between each note block I don't know if

394
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:14,850
between each note block I don't know if
 

395
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,889
between each note block I don't know if
that's a problem or not

396
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:15,899
that's a problem or not
 

397
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:20,809
that's a problem or not
sounds interesting regardless I don't

398
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:20,819
sounds interesting regardless I don't
 

399
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:21,049
sounds interesting regardless I don't
know

400
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:21,059
know
 

401
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:23,030
know
so let me finish Sudanese and we'll

402
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
so let me finish Sudanese and we'll
 

403
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,829
so let me finish Sudanese and we'll
start started up here yay we are finally

404
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
start started up here yay we are finally
 

405
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,689
start started up here yay we are finally
ready to go here so get this all tuned

406
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:29,699
ready to go here so get this all tuned
 

407
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:34,569
ready to go here so get this all tuned
correctly right yeah that sounded right

408
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:34,579
correctly right yeah that sounded right
 

409
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:37,069
correctly right yeah that sounded right
we're gonna start it up here what do you

410
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:37,079
we're gonna start it up here what do you
 

411
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,230
we're gonna start it up here what do you
think it's gonna sound like random note

412
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,240
think it's gonna sound like random note
 

413
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,769
think it's gonna sound like random note
blocks being played I had no idea that's

414
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:42,779
blocks being played I had no idea that's
 

415
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,480
blocks being played I had no idea that's
why I wanted to try it earlier today

416
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:44,490
why I wanted to try it earlier today
 

417
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,340
why I wanted to try it earlier today
I thought it was going to be very

418
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:46,350
I thought it was going to be very
 

419
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,590
I thought it was going to be very
chaotic but I was I didn't think it was

420
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:48,600
chaotic but I was I didn't think it was
 

421
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,749
chaotic but I was I didn't think it was
too bad you can be the judge of it

422
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:50,759
too bad you can be the judge of it
 

423
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,819
too bad you can be the judge of it
yourself though so I'm only going to do

424
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:52,829
yourself though so I'm only going to do
 

425
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:55,609
yourself though so I'm only going to do
one side to start off with and then

426
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:55,619
one side to start off with and then
 

427
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:57,679
one side to start off with and then
we'll try adding a second side to it and

428
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:57,689
we'll try adding a second side to it and
 

429
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:16,809
we'll try adding a second side to it and
we'll see the difference okay here we go

430
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:16,819

 

431
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:24,530

aha so that's it basically um let's go

432
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:24,540
aha so that's it basically um let's go
 

433
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,059
aha so that's it basically um let's go
look at the hoppers here the redstone so

434
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:29,069
look at the hoppers here the redstone so
 

435
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:30,919
look at the hoppers here the redstone so
you see most the time the pulse is short

436
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:30,929
you see most the time the pulse is short
 

437
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:33,259
you see most the time the pulse is short
sometimes it gets extended here though

438
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:33,269
sometimes it gets extended here though
 

439
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:37,009
sometimes it gets extended here though
the repeater and that happens when the

440
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:37,019
the repeater and that happens when the
 

441
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,509
the repeater and that happens when the
sword goes into the item hoppers yep

442
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
sword goes into the item hoppers yep
 

443
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,019
sword goes into the item hoppers yep
there there there so every time that

444
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:45,029
there there there so every time that
 

445
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,689
there there there so every time that
happens it'll play the note fruit for

446
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:47,699
happens it'll play the note fruit for
 

447
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:52,549
happens it'll play the note fruit for
down here um so that means there's 13

448
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:52,559
down here um so that means there's 13
 

449
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,269
down here um so that means there's 13
note blocks

450
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
note blocks
 

451
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,199
note blocks
hey you don't you steal that dirt don't

452
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:57,209
hey you don't you steal that dirt don't
 

453
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:59,220
hey you don't you steal that dirt don't
you steal that dirt

454
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,230
you steal that dirt
 

455
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,950
you steal that dirt
13 note blocks and they're being played

456
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:01,960
13 note blocks and they're being played
 

457
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,350
13 note blocks and they're being played
one out of a nine chance that means on

458
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:04,360
one out of a nine chance that means on
 

459
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,880
one out of a nine chance that means on
average there's going to be like one and

460
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:08,890
average there's going to be like one and
 

461
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,840
average there's going to be like one and
a half no blocks activated each time or

462
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:12,850
a half no blocks activated each time or
 

463
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,810
a half no blocks activated each time or
so well that's that's probably not right

464
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:17,820
so well that's that's probably not right
 

465
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,700
so well that's that's probably not right
but quite often to note blocks or more

466
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:20,710
but quite often to note blocks or more
 

467
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,390
but quite often to note blocks or more
get played

468
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:21,400
get played
 

469
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,520
get played
sometimes only one sometimes none

470
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:23,530
sometimes only one sometimes none
 

471
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,360
sometimes only one sometimes none
there'll be a delay right there I think

472
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:27,370
there'll be a delay right there I think
 

473
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,280
there'll be a delay right there I think
there's a delay

474
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,290

 

475
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,750

you got like it's replaying there for

476
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
you got like it's replaying there for
 

477
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,090
you got like it's replaying there for
there that was a long delay there anyway

478
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,100
there that was a long delay there anyway
 

479
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,760
there that was a long delay there anyway
that's one set of them I kind of like

480
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:41,770
that's one set of them I kind of like
 

481
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,970
that's one set of them I kind of like
out sounds more with - to be honest

482
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:43,980
out sounds more with - to be honest
 

483
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,190
out sounds more with - to be honest
we'll start up the second one here just

484
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
we'll start up the second one here just
 

485
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,120
we'll start up the second one here just
adds more I don't more life to it I

486
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,130
adds more I don't more life to it I
 

487
00:12:51,130 --> 00:13:07,700
adds more I don't more life to it I
guess with more being played

488
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:07,710

 

489
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,920

I don't know why but I could just listen

490
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:09,930
I don't know why but I could just listen
 

491
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,380
I don't know why but I could just listen
to this for so long because you never

492
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:12,390
to this for so long because you never
 

493
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,720
to this for so long because you never
know what's coming next with the sounds

494
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:14,730
know what's coming next with the sounds
 

495
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:22,840
know what's coming next with the sounds
that I'm I just think it's kind of neat

496
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:22,850

 

497
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,889

every now and then you'll just pick up

498
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:24,899
every now and then you'll just pick up
 

499
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,970
every now and then you'll just pick up
like these random patterns that happen

500
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:27,980
like these random patterns that happen
 

501
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,920
like these random patterns that happen
and it's cool

502
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:32,930

 

503
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,329

all right now just really quickly we're

504
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:35,339
all right now just really quickly we're
 

505
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,760
all right now just really quickly we're
going to try a couple random mixes just

506
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:37,770
going to try a couple random mixes just
 

507
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,610
going to try a couple random mixes just
to to see what it's like so we have now

508
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:40,620
to to see what it's like so we have now
 

509
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:58,910
to to see what it's like so we have now
piano and whatchamacallit bass drum bass

510
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:58,920
piano and whatchamacallit bass drum bass
 

511
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:17,660
piano and whatchamacallit bass drum bass
drums in bass guitar snare drums and

512
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:17,670
drums in bass guitar snare drums and
 

513
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:31,070
drums in bass guitar snare drums and
bass guitar now and I think this will be

514
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,080
bass guitar now and I think this will be
 

515
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:48,560
bass guitar now and I think this will be
our last one bass guitar and piano

516
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:48,570

 

517
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,329

but anyways guys I thought that was a

518
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:51,339
but anyways guys I thought that was a
 

519
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:53,550
but anyways guys I thought that was a
pretty cool little interesting project I

520
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:53,560
pretty cool little interesting project I
 

521
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,180
pretty cool little interesting project I
hope you felt the same way lots of

522
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,190
hope you felt the same way lots of
 

523
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,769
hope you felt the same way lots of
variables to it if you set this up

524
00:14:58,769 --> 00:14:58,779
variables to it if you set this up
 

525
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,000
variables to it if you set this up
different than what I've done here

526
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,010
different than what I've done here
 

527
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,350
different than what I've done here
you'll probably get a different sound

528
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
you'll probably get a different sound
 

529
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,720
you'll probably get a different sound
out of it might sound better or worse I

530
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:03,730
out of it might sound better or worse I
 

531
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,230
out of it might sound better or worse I
don't know that's something I didn't

532
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:07,240
don't know that's something I didn't
 

533
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,030
don't know that's something I didn't
mention is you can also play around with

534
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,040
mention is you can also play around with
 

535
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,329
mention is you can also play around with
a tempo on it so this is sort of what I

536
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:12,339
a tempo on it so this is sort of what I
 

537
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:14,250
a tempo on it so this is sort of what I
had it at here just two ticks on the

538
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:14,260
had it at here just two ticks on the
 

539
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,600
had it at here just two ticks on the
repeater this is equivalent to 0.4

540
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:18,610
repeater this is equivalent to 0.4
 

541
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,930
repeater this is equivalent to 0.4
seconds between notes but you can you

542
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:21,940
seconds between notes but you can you
 

543
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:29,400
seconds between notes but you can you
know add more delay if you want and it

544
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,410
know add more delay if you want and it
 

545
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,900
know add more delay if you want and it
changes things quite a bit

546
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:30,910
changes things quite a bit
 

547
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:40,970
changes things quite a bit
ah if you set it to one something

548
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:40,980
ah if you set it to one something
 

549
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:50,160
ah if you set it to one something
something important happens so hoppers

550
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,170
something important happens so hoppers
 

551
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,769
something important happens so hoppers
they have a speed to them and if you try

552
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:52,779
they have a speed to them and if you try
 

553
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,690
they have a speed to them and if you try
to go too quickly they'll not they won't

554
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:54,700
to go too quickly they'll not they won't
 

555
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,040
to go too quickly they'll not they won't
be able to put the items out of it

556
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,050
be able to put the items out of it
 

557
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,130
be able to put the items out of it
anymore two ticks on the repeater is as

558
00:15:59,130 --> 00:15:59,140
anymore two ticks on the repeater is as
 

559
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,490
anymore two ticks on the repeater is as
quick as the hoppers can run so yeah

560
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:02,500
quick as the hoppers can run so yeah
 

561
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,230
quick as the hoppers can run so yeah
items get stuck in here and then that

562
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
items get stuck in here and then that
 

563
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
items get stuck in here and then that
throws off the probability and

564
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,250
throws off the probability and
 

565
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,519
throws off the probability and
everything but yeah anyway let's go do

566
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:11,529
everything but yeah anyway let's go do
 

567
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:12,300
everything but yeah anyway let's go do
something else

568
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,310
something else
 

569
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,860
something else
ah you know we never did got 14 other

570
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:16,870
ah you know we never did got 14 other
 

571
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,810
ah you know we never did got 14 other
stars let's make some beacons here and

572
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:18,820
stars let's make some beacons here and
 

573
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,569
stars let's make some beacons here and
so I can actually use them last episode

574
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:21,579
so I can actually use them last episode
 

575
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:23,280
so I can actually use them last episode
we bought 15 Wizards

576

well actually was 14 turns out one of
 

579
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,199
well actually was 14 turns out one of
them didn't spawn so that's why we were

580
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:28,209
them didn't spawn so that's why we were
 

581
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:32,519
them didn't spawn so that's why we were
short I have more obsidian there that's

582

586
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
we go very low on sand right now I might
 

587
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,319
we go very low on sand right now I might
need to go harvest some soon all right

into TNT but I am no longer getting my
 

607
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:15,300
into TNT but I am no longer getting my
sand from the same place anymore I need

608
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:15,310
sand from the same place anymore I need
 

609
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,130
sand from the same place anymore I need
to find a new place because I don't want

quartz on me I'm going to mine this down
and we will head over to the Nexus and

634
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:51,610
and we will head over to the Nexus and
 

635
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,140
and we will head over to the Nexus and
just do a little bit of building there

636
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,150
just do a little bit of building there
 

637
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:59,130
just do a little bit of building there
you can put it anywhere here I'll but I

638
00:17:59,130 --> 00:17:59,140
you can put it anywhere here I'll but I
 

639
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,130
you can put it anywhere here I'll but I
need the material don't I darn um

640
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,140
need the material don't I darn um
 

641
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,010
need the material don't I darn um
alright I'll have to go get some of that

642
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,020
alright I'll have to go get some of that
 

643
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,020
alright I'll have to go get some of that
um I'm at yeah I'm actually low on tools

644
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,030
um I'm at yeah I'm actually low on tools
 

645
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,150
um I'm at yeah I'm actually low on tools
right now I never thought that was going

646
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
right now I never thought that was going
 

647
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,610
right now I never thought that was going
to happen again but turns out I haven't

648
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:14,620
to happen again but turns out I haven't
 

649
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,440
to happen again but turns out I haven't
enchanted anything in a very long time

650
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:16,450
enchanted anything in a very long time
 

651
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,880
enchanted anything in a very long time
and just about used them all up

652
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:19,890
and just about used them all up
 

653
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,760
and just about used them all up
let's see and buy low on tools I mean I

654
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:23,770
let's see and buy low on tools I mean I
 

655
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,150
let's see and buy low on tools I mean I
still have a lot here obviously but most

656
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,160
still have a lot here obviously but most
 

657
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,550
still have a lot here obviously but most
of them are not like really good stuff

658
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:31,560
of them are not like really good stuff
 

659
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,320
of them are not like really good stuff
see efficiency for let's combine that

660
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,330
see efficiency for let's combine that
 

661
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,250
see efficiency for let's combine that
with this so we get efficiency five see

662
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:38,260
with this so we get efficiency five see
 

663
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,760
with this so we get efficiency five see
if that will work

664
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:38,770
if that will work
 

665
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:43,950
if that will work
Oh with the anvils gun

666
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:43,960
Oh with the anvils gun
 

667
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,660
Oh with the anvils gun
oh there we go

still has the chicken guts on it I feel
 

671
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,840
still has the chicken guts on it I feel
so bad nine levels okay that's not bad

672
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:56,850
so bad nine levels okay that's not bad
 

673
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,460
so bad nine levels okay that's not bad
okay we got enough levels for mining all

674
00:18:59,460 --> 00:18:59,470
okay we got enough levels for mining all
 

675
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,480

00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:27,990
efficiency for unbreaking 3 and
 

689
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,860
efficiency for unbreaking 3 and
efficiency for still touch 1 it doesn't

efficiency for still touch 1 it doesn't
 

691
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,080
efficiency for still touch 1 it doesn't
get any better than that that maxes is

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,090
get any better than that that maxes is
 

693
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,000
get any better than that that maxes is
out efficiency 5 so touch 1 unbreaking 3

694
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,010
out efficiency 5 so touch 1 unbreaking 3

we will not to area Terra Firma craft we

698
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,370
we will not to area Terra Firma craft we
 

699
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:53,600
we will not to area Terra Firma craft we
will call this our Pro pick all right

701
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,400

you see this this is why I don't really

702
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:56,410
you see this this is why I don't really
 

703
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,980
you see this this is why I don't really
mind getting garbage enchantments like

704
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:58,990
mind getting garbage enchantments like
 

705
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,590
mind getting garbage enchantments like
if you just get unbreaking 3 not a big

706
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
if you just get unbreaking 3 not a big
 

707
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,960
if you just get unbreaking 3 not a big
deal you just combine it and then you

708
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:03,970
deal you just combine it and then you
 

709
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,970
deal you just combine it and then you
have a good good shovel on your second

710
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:05,980
have a good good shovel on your second
 

711

up my enchantments because of that

714
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:11,860
up my enchantments because of that
 

715
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,560
up my enchantments because of that
eventually it all kind of just works out

716
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:13,570
eventually it all kind of just works out

using them here I wasn't planning on
 

753
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,020
using them here I wasn't planning on
using them but I kind of worried that in

754
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,030
using them but I kind of worried that in
 

755
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,100
using them but I kind of worried that in
general people don't like them which

756
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,110
general people don't like them which
 

757
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,419
general people don't like them which
kind of makes me sad because I like

758

kind of makes me sad because I like
 

759
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:12,880
kind of makes me sad because I like
comfort I'm gonna wanted to use them for

760
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:12,890
comfort I'm gonna wanted to use them for
 

761
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,120
comfort I'm gonna wanted to use them for
a few things and I worried people are

762
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,130
a few things and I worried people are
 

763
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,350
a few things and I worried people are
gonna like anything I build with them um

764
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
gonna like anything I build with them um
 

765

I'll probably do it anyway okay so let's

766
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:24,980
I'll probably do it anyway okay so let's
 

767
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,039
I'll probably do it anyway okay so let's
keep going here and we will see what it

keep going here and we will see what it
 

769
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:33,789
keep going here and we will see what it
looks like when it's all done all right

770
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:33,799
looks like when it's all done all right
 

771
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,919
looks like when it's all done all right
so I pretty much got all the walls

772
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:35,929
so I pretty much got all the walls
 

773
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:37,810
so I pretty much got all the walls
finished here this is what its gonna

774
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:37,820
finished here this is what its gonna
 

775
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,830
finished here this is what its gonna
look like that's pretty good right I

776
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:40,840
look like that's pretty good right I
 

777
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,440
look like that's pretty good right I

drive me crazy this is just the lower
part of it though that's actually going

788
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:56,510
part of it though that's actually going
 

789
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,840
part of it though that's actually going
to be about at least eight blocks taller

790
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:58,850
