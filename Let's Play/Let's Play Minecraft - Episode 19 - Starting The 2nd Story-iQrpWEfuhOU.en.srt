00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:48,260

going to put a door in here so that we

164
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,270
going to put a door in here so that we
 

165
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:58,730
going to put a door in here so that we
can access this to make sure the door is

166
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:58,740
can access this to make sure the door is
 

167
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,850
can access this to make sure the door is
facing this way is right now the only

168
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:01,860
facing this way is right now the only
 

169
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,600
facing this way is right now the only
way I can get inside this mob area is to

170
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:05,610
way I can get inside this mob area is to
 

171
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,300
way I can get inside this mob area is to
go down to the pads there and swim up

172
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:08,310
go down to the pads there and swim up
 

173
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,659
go down to the pads there and swim up
like the mobs do so now I got an easy

174
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:11,669
like the mobs do so now I got an easy
 

175
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:25,589
like the mobs do so now I got an easy
way to get in and add water stuff

176
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599

 

177
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:39,420

so first thing I'm going to do going to

178
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:39,430
so first thing I'm going to do going to
 

179
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:55,620
so first thing I'm going to do going to
place the door here the reason for this

180
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:55,630
place the door here the reason for this
 

181
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,150
place the door here the reason for this
is if I want them to go up another level

182
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,160
is if I want them to go up another level
 

183
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,790
is if I want them to go up another level
I'm going to have a junction here so

184
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
I'm going to have a junction here so
 

185
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,990
I'm going to have a junction here so
that I'll have the option even though I

186
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,000
that I'll have the option even though I
 

187
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,249
that I'll have the option even though I
probably won't want them going up

188
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:08,259
probably won't want them going up
 

189
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:23,809
probably won't want them going up
another level but oh yeah um I need to

190
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:23,819

 

191
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:31,610

we're gonna have to go down and copy it

192
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:31,620

 

193
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,290

okay so diagonal stream this new level

194
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:37,300
okay so diagonal stream this new level
 

195
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,410
okay so diagonal stream this new level
is lowered talking and the door is

196
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:40,420
is lowered talking and the door is
 

197
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:46,800
is lowered talking and the door is
actually down one level so that means I

198
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:46,810
actually down one level so that means I
 

199
00:09:46,810 --> 00:10:03,410
actually down one level so that means I
want to stay down one block maybe not

200
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:03,420

 

201
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:13,499

this other doors in the way down so

202
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:13,509
this other doors in the way down so
 

203
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:18,240
this other doors in the way down so
we'll keep it there and we're actually

204
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,250
we'll keep it there and we're actually
 

205
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:27,030
we'll keep it there and we're actually
going to make a three way Junction here

206
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040

 

207
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,200

we're not going to deal with the spiders

208
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,210
we're not going to deal with the spiders
 

209
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:41,890
we're not going to deal with the spiders
yet okay we're going to want this door

210
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:41,900
yet okay we're going to want this door
 

211
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:54,340
yet okay we're going to want this door
to open the other way I think and so we

212
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:54,350
to open the other way I think and so we
 

213
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,780
to open the other way I think and so we
got a block there we're going to remove

214
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:55,790
got a block there we're going to remove
 

215
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,170
got a block there we're going to remove
this one so it has to attach to this

216
00:10:59,170 --> 00:10:59,180
this one so it has to attach to this
 

217
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:11,760
this one so it has to attach to this
block okay that's good and so we want a

218
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:11,770
block okay that's good and so we want a
 

219
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,470
block okay that's good and so we want a
diagonal stream that comes to this

220
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
diagonal stream that comes to this
 

221
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:30,640
diagonal stream that comes to this
corner here and my game keeps getting

222
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:30,650
corner here and my game keeps getting
 

223
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,180
corner here and my game keeps getting
laggy I think I might have to switch

224
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,190
laggy I think I might have to switch
 

225
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:43,060
laggy I think I might have to switch
back to standard definition it's really

226
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,070
back to standard definition it's really
 

227
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:52,210
back to standard definition it's really
annoying me a lot of glass okay it will

228
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:52,220
annoying me a lot of glass okay it will
 

229
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:58,800
annoying me a lot of glass okay it will
be a sign here I thought it matters much

230
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:58,810

 

231
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,420

and if I want to go up another level

232
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:01,430
and if I want to go up another level
 

233
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:09,030
and if I want to go up another level
there will be water where this block is

234
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040

 

235
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:16,750

okay I grabbed some more glass and going

236
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:16,760
okay I grabbed some more glass and going
 

237
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:23,430
okay I grabbed some more glass and going
to hook up some levers to our doors here

238
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440

 

239
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:31,180

and I'm still lagging yeah that one's

240
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,190
and I'm still lagging yeah that one's
 

241
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:39,460
and I'm still lagging yeah that one's
good oh and the spider thing might be an

242
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:39,470
good oh and the spider thing might be an
 

243
00:12:39,470 --> 00:13:06,720
good oh and the spider thing might be an
issue what to do with the spiders I just

244
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:06,730
issue what to do with the spiders I just
 

245
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,830
issue what to do with the spiders I just
just build over top it and we can route

246
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:11,840
just build over top it and we can route
 

247
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:36,490
just build over top it and we can route
them out lower we will need to capital

248
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:36,500
them out lower we will need to capital
 

249
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:50,580
them out lower we will need to capital
either here

250
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:50,590

 

251
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,260

all right I don't think my mom strap is

252
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,270
all right I don't think my mom strap is
 

253
00:13:53,270 --> 00:14:01,150
all right I don't think my mom strap is
working as well more for some reason I

254
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,160
working as well more for some reason I
 

255
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,550
working as well more for some reason I
don't know something got changed and one

256
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:03,560
don't know something got changed and one
 

257
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,290
don't know something got changed and one
of the patches but there's just as many

258
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:05,300
of the patches but there's just as many
 

259
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,970
of the patches but there's just as many
guys now so I'll probably have to do

260
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:09,980
guys now so I'll probably have to do
 

261
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,970
guys now so I'll probably have to do
some maintenance on it soon figure out

262
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:12,980
some maintenance on it soon figure out
 

263
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:18,340
some maintenance on it soon figure out
what the problem is okay we can control

264
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,350
what the problem is okay we can control
 

265
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,950
what the problem is okay we can control
the doors now and get some water all

266
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:23,960
the doors now and get some water all
 

267
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,510
the doors now and get some water all
right so I built the water spring over

268
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:25,520
right so I built the water spring over
 

269
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,650
right so I built the water spring over
here just temporary I filled this tube

270
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:29,660
here just temporary I filled this tube
 

271
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,400
here just temporary I filled this tube
up of water and I brought some stairs

272
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:33,410
up of water and I brought some stairs
 

273
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:38,590
up of water and I brought some stairs
with me and we're going to place stairs

274
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:38,600
with me and we're going to place stairs
 

275
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:45,660
with me and we're going to place stairs
here not that way

276
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:45,670

 

277
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,860

like that the reason for that is because

278
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:50,870
like that the reason for that is because
 

279
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,620
like that the reason for that is because
sometimes mobs can stuck and get stuck

280
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:53,630
sometimes mobs can stuck and get stuck
 

281
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,390
sometimes mobs can stuck and get stuck
in this set to block space where the

282
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:55,400
in this set to block space where the
 

283
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:55,990
in this set to block space where the
door is

284
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
door is
 

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,650
door is
and they won't move because they can't

286
00:14:59,650 --> 00:14:59,660
and they won't move because they can't
 

287
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,210
and they won't move because they can't
see outside of the space until another

288
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:04,220
see outside of the space until another
 

289
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:12,460
see outside of the space until another
mob comes up and pushes them up we're

290
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:12,470
mob comes up and pushes them up we're
 

291
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:22,370
mob comes up and pushes them up we're
going to have to do that over here too

292
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:22,380

 

293
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:33,480

okay all right

294
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:33,490
okay all right
 

295
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,080
okay all right
and so we need to make a diagonal stream

296
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,090
and so we need to make a diagonal stream
 

297
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:45,720
and so we need to make a diagonal stream
of water right over here and we're going

298
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:45,730
of water right over here and we're going
 

299
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:54,920
of water right over here and we're going
to do that so we place one block here Oh

300
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:54,930
to do that so we place one block here Oh
 

301
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:04,700
to do that so we place one block here Oh
actually forgot a source block here and

302
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:04,710
actually forgot a source block here and
 

303
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,410
actually forgot a source block here and
another one there so it creates a

304
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:07,420
another one there so it creates a
 

305
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,770
another one there so it creates a
diagnose stream of water that pushes

306
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:10,780
diagnose stream of water that pushes
 

307
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,420
diagnose stream of water that pushes
towards this corner and that is

308
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:15,430
towards this corner and that is
 

309
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,300
towards this corner and that is
important because the door hinge is on

310
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:18,310
important because the door hinge is on
 

311
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,140
important because the door hinge is on
this left side so we need them against

312
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,150
this left side so we need them against
 

313
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,880
this left side so we need them against
this right side otherwise we're going to

314
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:23,890
this right side otherwise we're going to
 

315
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,790
this right side otherwise we're going to
run it to this hinge and same with other

316
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
run it to this hinge and same with other
 

317
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,290
run it to this hinge and same with other
door it's pushing them to the left side

318
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:31,300
door it's pushing them to the left side
 

319
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,990
door it's pushing them to the left side
so they go under to the end on the right

320
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,000
so they go under to the end on the right
 

321
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:46,670
so they go under to the end on the right
side okay

322
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:46,680

 

323
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,780

of course the lever is going to be

324
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:48,790
of course the lever is going to be
 

325
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,850
of course the lever is going to be
reversed from each other though because

326
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:50,860
reversed from each other though because
 

327
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,350
reversed from each other though because
the doors are reversed and

328
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:56,360

 

329
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:07,960

from there I'm going to place I'm going

330
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:07,970
from there I'm going to place I'm going
 

331
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:16,299
from there I'm going to place I'm going
to place one water block here and then

332
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:16,309
to place one water block here and then
 

333
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:24,159
to place one water block here and then
another one like these uh those two

334
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:24,169
another one like these uh those two
 

335
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:29,620
another one like these uh those two
blocks are December in like that so now

336
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:29,630
blocks are December in like that so now
 

337
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,649
blocks are December in like that so now
we have a three-way junction they can

338
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:32,659
we have a three-way junction they can
 

339
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:36,039
we have a three-way junction they can
either go up if I continue to make this

340
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:36,049
either go up if I continue to make this
 

341
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:40,450
either go up if I continue to make this
higher if both doors are closed if that

342
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:40,460
higher if both doors are closed if that
 

343
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,789
higher if both doors are closed if that
door is open they will go this way if

344
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
door is open they will go this way if
 

345
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,340
door is open they will go this way if
that door is open then the world this

346
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:48,350
that door is open then the world this
 

347
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,450
that door is open then the world this
way and if they're both opens well then

348
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:52,460
way and if they're both opens well then
 

349
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,810
way and if they're both opens well then
it depends on whichever stream they

350
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:55,820
it depends on whichever stream they
 

351
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,279
it depends on whichever stream they
touch first okay and the reason we have

352
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:00,289
touch first okay and the reason we have
 

353
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:05,649
touch first okay and the reason we have
two streams one of these is going to go

354
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:05,659
two streams one of these is going to go
 

355
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:09,930
two streams one of these is going to go
to the mob sorter probably this one and

356
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:09,940
to the mob sorter probably this one and
 

357
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,200
to the mob sorter probably this one and
this one is going to be for if we don't

358
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,210
this one is going to be for if we don't
