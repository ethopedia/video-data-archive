with this project I thought I was gonna

238

with this project I thought I was gonna
 

239
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,880
with this project I thought I was gonna
build it and then it's I'll never want

build it and then it's I'll never want
 

241

still
that's what enderpearls are for at each

258
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
that's what enderpearls are for at each
 

259
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,749
that's what enderpearls are for at each
of these hoppers I need to program

260
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
of these hoppers I need to program
 

261
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,909
of these hoppers I need to program
it's an item filter I need to program

262
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
it's an item filter I need to program
 

263
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,409
it's an item filter I need to program
what item goes into each of these and

264
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:39,419
what item goes into each of these and
 

265
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,869
what item goes into each of these and
basically I have to do something like

266
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:42,879
basically I have to do something like
 

267
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,040
basically I have to do something like
this remove one and then put the item

268
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,050
this remove one and then put the item
 

269
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,339
this remove one and then put the item
there that we want it to be these have

270
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:50,349
there that we want it to be these have
 

271
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:52,469
there that we want it to be these have
to be a junk filler item so we can't

272
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
to be a junk filler item so we can't
 

273
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,959
to be a junk filler item so we can't
just use glass we have to I think what

274
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:54,969
just use glass we have to I think what
 

275
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:57,330
just use glass we have to I think what
we'll do let's try this out I think I'll

276
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:57,340
we'll do let's try this out I think I'll
 

277
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,739
we'll do let's try this out I think I'll
use cobblestone

278
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:00,749

 

279
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:02,909

do we have a stack of cobblestone

280
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:02,919
do we have a stack of cobblestone
 

281
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:04,860
do we have a stack of cobblestone
there's got to be tons of cobblestone in

282
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:04,870
there's got to be tons of cobblestone in
 

283
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,110
there's got to be tons of cobblestone in
here or answer yeah I'm gonna try to

284
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
here or answer yeah I'm gonna try to
 

285
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,730
here or answer yeah I'm gonna try to
name this I'm pretty sure this works

286
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:08,740
name this I'm pretty sure this works
 

287
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,820
name this I'm pretty sure this works
though we will name our filler product

288
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:13,830
though we will name our filler product
 

289
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,999
though we will name our filler product
filler oh so clever

290
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:17,009
filler oh so clever
 

291
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,350
filler oh so clever
all right so normal cobblestone

292
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
all right so normal cobblestone
 

293
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,029
all right so normal cobblestone
shouldn't stack with that I'm pretty

294
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
shouldn't stack with that I'm pretty
 

295
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,589
shouldn't stack with that I'm pretty
sure let's grab some of that before I

296
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:22,599
sure let's grab some of that before I
 

297
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:24,499
sure let's grab some of that before I
forget it

298
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:24,509
forget it
 

299
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:31,679
forget it
there we go so if I want to store let's

300
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:31,689
there we go so if I want to store let's
 

301
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:34,350
there we go so if I want to store let's
say stone bricks in one of these I would

302
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,360
say stone bricks in one of these I would
 

303
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,200
say stone bricks in one of these I would
have to let me up here I'm losing it

304
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,210
have to let me up here I'm losing it
 

305
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,990
have to let me up here I'm losing it
okay there we go I would have to put the

306
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,000
okay there we go I would have to put the
 

307
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,140
okay there we go I would have to put the
filler in what was it I have to get up

308
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,150
filler in what was it I have to get up
 

309
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,139
filler in what was it I have to get up
to 17 and then the item I actually want

310
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:49,149
to 17 and then the item I actually want
 

311
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:52,050
to 17 and then the item I actually want
to store at this place so let's say well

312
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:52,060
to store at this place so let's say well
 

313
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,079
to store at this place so let's say well
I said another or a stone brick right so

314
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,089
I said another or a stone brick right so
 

315
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,629
I said another or a stone brick right so
I'd do that and now if I put regular

316
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:57,639
I'd do that and now if I put regular
 

317
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,519
I'd do that and now if I put regular

this corner here it's got to go in a
 

475
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,780
this corner here it's got to go in a
corner alright so you need three

476
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:30,790
corner alright so you need three
 

477
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,920
corner alright so you need three
dispensers for the bonemeal so do dis

478
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:34,930
dispensers for the bonemeal so do dis
 

479
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,069
dispensers for the bonemeal so do dis
dis and dis this over here is where the

480
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
dis and dis this over here is where the
 

481
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,759
dis and dis this over here is where the
soil will go for the crop and I didn't

482
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:41,769
soil will go for the crop and I didn't
 

483
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,100
soil will go for the crop and I didn't
bring any with me for some reason and

484
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,110
bring any with me for some reason and
 

485
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,280
bring any with me for some reason and
then the pressure plates to activate the

486
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:47,290
then the pressure plates to activate the
 

487
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,689
then the pressure plates to activate the
whole thing is here this will activate

488
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:48,699
whole thing is here this will activate
 

489
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:52,110
whole thing is here this will activate
the clock that makes it run put a

490
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,120
the clock that makes it run put a
 

491
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,230
the clock that makes it run put a
comparator down over here let's take out

492
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:55,240
comparator down over here let's take out
 

493
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,840
comparator down over here let's take out
a little bit more of this wall so this

494
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:57,850
a little bit more of this wall so this
 

495
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,350
a little bit more of this wall so this
one's not gonna use a piston this one

496
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:00,360
one's not gonna use a piston this one
 

497
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,600
one's not gonna use a piston this one
harvests a crop using darkness which is

498
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:03,610
harvests a crop using darkness which is
 

499
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,230
harvests a crop using darkness which is
kind of cool it's a little bit quieter

500
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
kind of cool it's a little bit quieter
 

501
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,350
kind of cool it's a little bit quieter
see I think we do that and then go up

502
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:10,360
see I think we do that and then go up
 

503
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:19,710
see I think we do that and then go up
here perhaps maybe not I forget how this

504
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:19,720
here perhaps maybe not I forget how this
 

505
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,329
here perhaps maybe not I forget how this
goes I think that maybe a repeater was

506
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:21,339
goes I think that maybe a repeater was
 

507
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:23,879
goes I think that maybe a repeater was
here yeah I think that's right and then

508
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:23,889
here yeah I think that's right and then
 

509
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:25,199
here yeah I think that's right and then
you go up like this and we got to run

510
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:25,209
you go up like this and we got to run
 

511
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:29,550
you go up like this and we got to run
wire to all three of the dispensers hey

512
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:29,560
wire to all three of the dispensers hey
 

513
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,550
wire to all three of the dispensers hey
you hey that's where the crops go get

514
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
you hey that's where the crops go get
 

515
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,550
you hey that's where the crops go get
out of there crazy guy alright goes up

516
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
out of there crazy guy alright goes up
 

517
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,309
out of there crazy guy alright goes up
to over here and we got a run one to

518
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:41,319
to over here and we got a run one to
 

519
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:43,439
to over here and we got a run one to
this this dispenser here too so let's

520
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:43,449
this this dispenser here too so let's
 

521
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:47,490
this this dispenser here too so let's
put a slab here let's do a crafting

522
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:47,500
put a slab here let's do a crafting
 

523
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,189
put a slab here let's do a crafting
table going alright and just let's make

524
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:53,199
table going alright and just let's make
 

525
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:57,449
table going alright and just let's make
a stand out of this hey these guys man

526
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:57,459
a stand out of this hey these guys man
 

527
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:03,629
a stand out of this hey these guys man
get out of here trying to work made you

528
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:03,639
get out of here trying to work made you
 

529
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,920
get out of here trying to work made you
go up and then to that I guess I think

530
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:07,930
go up and then to that I guess I think
 

531
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,340
go up and then to that I guess I think
that works like that okay

532
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:11,350
that works like that okay
 

533
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,129
that works like that okay
and I believe actually let's lower this

534
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:14,139
and I believe actually let's lower this
 

535
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:19,379
and I believe actually let's lower this
by one and then have a repeater go to

536
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:19,389
by one and then have a repeater go to
 

537
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:22,170
by one and then have a repeater go to
here it's got to be set to three and

538
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:22,180
here it's got to be set to three and
 

539
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,259
here it's got to be set to three and
when this power is this block here I

540
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:27,269
when this power is this block here I
 

541
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,290
when this power is this block here I
actually no no that doesn't work what am

542
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:31,300
actually no no that doesn't work what am
 

543
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,269
actually no no that doesn't work what am
i doing I think it's gotta go like this

544
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
i doing I think it's gotta go like this
 

545
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,030
i doing I think it's gotta go like this
actually just wire and then the dirt

546
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,040
actually just wire and then the dirt
 

547
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,370
actually just wire and then the dirt
blocks here and when power goes to this

548
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:38,380
blocks here and when power goes to this
 

549
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,379
blocks here and when power goes to this
redstone wire it updates the dirt block

550
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:40,389
redstone wire it updates the dirt block
 

551
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:44,210
redstone wire it updates the dirt block
and that causes it to uproot the wheat

552
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:44,220
and that causes it to uproot the wheat
 

553
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:51,660
and that causes it to uproot the wheat
right so this is this is a repeater we

554
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:51,670
right so this is this is a repeater we
 

555
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,449
right so this is this is a repeater we
got to set to three then yeah so I think

556
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:54,459
got to set to three then yeah so I think
 

557
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,710
got to set to three then yeah so I think
that works all right turn this to

558
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:58,720
that works all right turn this to
 

559
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,680
that works all right turn this to
subtraction mode and oh you know what's

560
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:04,690
subtraction mode and oh you know what's
 

561
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,870
subtraction mode and oh you know what's
wrong try to figure out what's wrong

562
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
wrong try to figure out what's wrong
 

563
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,329
wrong try to figure out what's wrong
with this stupid thing this is a slab

564
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:09,339
with this stupid thing this is a slab
 

565
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:12,329
with this stupid thing this is a slab
it's not a full block let's get a full

566
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:12,339
it's not a full block let's get a full
 

567
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,800
it's not a full block let's get a full
block there so we can actually send some

568
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:13,810
block there so we can actually send some
 

569
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:20,430
block there so we can actually send some
power through it all right all right so

570
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:20,440
power through it all right all right so
 

571
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,400
power through it all right all right so
we're gonna put some water over here or

572
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,410
we're gonna put some water over here or
 

573
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,000
we're gonna put some water over here or
somewhere where it'll hydrate the soil

574
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,010
somewhere where it'll hydrate the soil
 

575
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,150
somewhere where it'll hydrate the soil
hide it over here is good

576
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,160
hide it over here is good
 

577
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,009
hide it over here is good
all right and now to actually collect

578
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:32,019
all right and now to actually collect
 

579
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:33,809
all right and now to actually collect
the stuff that drops what we'll do is

580
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:33,819
the stuff that drops what we'll do is
 

581
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:38,730
the stuff that drops what we'll do is
we'll dig down I don't know what is that

582
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:38,740
we'll dig down I don't know what is that
 

583
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,030
we'll dig down I don't know what is that
what is that from is that gonna be in

584
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,040
what is that from is that gonna be in
 

585
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,650
what is that from is that gonna be in
the way hopefully not so we'll have a

586
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:46,660
the way hopefully not so we'll have a
 

587
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,189
the way hopefully not so we'll have a
hopper going to the side and track and

588
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:50,199
hopper going to the side and track and
 

589
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:54,420
hopper going to the side and track and
then a hopper minecarts I hope there's

590
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:54,430
then a hopper minecarts I hope there's
 

591
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,329
then a hopper minecarts I hope there's
enough space here did this work oh yeah

592
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:57,339
enough space here did this work oh yeah
 

593
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:59,370
enough space here did this work oh yeah
I think it's good so I'll pick up items

594
00:14:59,370 --> 00:14:59,380
I think it's good so I'll pick up items
 

595
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,920
I think it's good so I'll pick up items
through this block so if we throw stuff

596
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:01,930
through this block so if we throw stuff
 

597
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,449
through this block so if we throw stuff
on here it goes through through the

598
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:03,459
on here it goes through through the
 

599
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:06,059
on here it goes through through the
block into the hopper minecarts then we

600
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:06,069
block into the hopper minecarts then we
 

601
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:10,559
block into the hopper minecarts then we
until this and I think we're pretty much

602
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:10,569
until this and I think we're pretty much
 

603
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:13,009
until this and I think we're pretty much
good to go we got some bone meal in here

604
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:13,019
good to go we got some bone meal in here
 

605
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:18,569
good to go we got some bone meal in here
all right put a block there so now one

606
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:18,579
all right put a block there so now one
 

607
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:21,509
all right put a block there so now one
last thing in order to make it dark what

608
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
last thing in order to make it dark what
 

609
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,269
last thing in order to make it dark what
we'll do is put a slab upside down slab

610
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:24,279
we'll do is put a slab upside down slab
 

611
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,260
we'll do is put a slab upside down slab
like that that makes

612
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:25,270
like that that makes
 

613
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,350
like that that makes
totally darked in the space but we can

614
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:28,360
totally darked in the space but we can
 

615
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,030
totally darked in the space but we can
still interact with it

616
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,040
still interact with it
 

617
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,950
still interact with it
and is it working yeah it's working cool

618
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:34,960
and is it working yeah it's working cool
 

619
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,090
and is it working yeah it's working cool
so that's pretty much all there is to it

620
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,100
so that's pretty much all there is to it
 

621
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:45,180
so that's pretty much all there is to it
runs fairly quickly uh-huh so I'm gonna

622
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,190
runs fairly quickly uh-huh so I'm gonna
 

623
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,480
runs fairly quickly uh-huh so I'm gonna
also add in some extra storage here for

624
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:48,490
also add in some extra storage here for
 

625
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,100
also add in some extra storage here for
each of these for bone meal and then

626
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,110
each of these for bone meal and then
 

627
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,950
each of these for bone meal and then
some chests down below to pick up the

628
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:52,960
some chests down below to pick up the
 

629
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,510
some chests down below to pick up the

something I've seen people do is you put

732
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:32,809
something I've seen people do is you put
 

733
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:35,020
something I've seen people do is you put
stone slabs around the top then or I'll

734
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,030
stone slabs around the top then or I'll
 

735
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:40,740
stone slabs around the top then or I'll
spruce wood so we'll try that out and

736
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:40,750
spruce wood so we'll try that out and
 

737
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,240
spruce wood so we'll try that out and
then we'll add windows and stuff to it

738
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,250
then we'll add windows and stuff to it
 

739
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,419
then we'll add windows and stuff to it
as well and see if it looks half decent

740
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:46,429
as well and see if it looks half decent
 

741
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:48,190
as well and see if it looks half decent
if it does maybe we will be able to

742
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,200
if it does maybe we will be able to
 

743
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,460

little thought into this I'm just sort
 

765
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,430
little thought into this I'm just sort
of doing it and seeing how bad it will

766
