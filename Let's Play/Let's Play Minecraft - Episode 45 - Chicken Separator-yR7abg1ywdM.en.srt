over a bit because we're going to be
working on this middle area and the

working on this middle area and the
 

181
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,440

first thing we're going to try to do
 

183
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,830
first thing we're going to try to do
with this passive mob system is make a

184
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
with this passive mob system is make a
 

185
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:26,080
with this passive mob system is make a
chicken separator and to do that we

186
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,090
chicken separator and to do that we
 

187
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,090
chicken separator and to do that we
pretty much just need to draw in all the

188
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,100
pretty much just need to draw in all the
 

189
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,920
pretty much just need to draw in all the
mobs through a layer of water since

the water but I'm a little bit concerned
 

197
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:49,010
the water but I'm a little bit concerned
that this might not work because the mob

a chance that cow might have landed on a
 

291
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:39,040
a chance that cow might have landed on a
chicken I will just slow them down

292
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,050

 

293
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,500

either way you see how he's like yeah

294
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:42,510
either way you see how he's like yeah
 

295
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,890
either way you see how he's like yeah
he's falling through either way from

296
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:45,900
he's falling through either way from
 

297
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,720
he's falling through either way from
jumping around he pushes his way through

298
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:47,730
jumping around he pushes his way through
 

299
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,760
jumping around he pushes his way through
so even this should wear I mean

300
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:49,770
so even this should wear I mean
 

301
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:56,390
so even this should wear I mean
especially if I make this a long you

302
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:56,400
especially if I make this a long you
 

303
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,550
especially if I make this a long you
know we watch what I got recorded here

304
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
know we watch what I got recorded here
 

305
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,300
know we watch what I got recorded here
and see if I can notice anything though

306
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,310
and see if I can notice anything though
 

307
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:08,270
and see if I can notice anything though
what happened with that cow okay so I

308
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:08,280

309
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,130
what happened with that cow okay so I
couldn't really tell what happened

310
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:10,140
couldn't really tell what happened
 

311
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,750

but it doesn't really doesn't really
 

317
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,810
but it doesn't really doesn't really
matter because this seems to be working

318
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:22,820
matter because this seems to be working
 

319
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,910
matter because this seems to be working
so I'm going to raise the water one

320
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
so I'm going to raise the water one
 

321
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:35,370
so I'm going to raise the water one
block though which I'll probably do now

322
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:35,380
block though which I'll probably do now
 

323
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,010
block though which I'll probably do now

things a little more tricky so I'm going
to have to make a long path or something

464
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:07,309
to have to make a long path or something
 

465
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:14,740
to have to make a long path or something
out here so that they can and that's

466
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:14,750
out here so that they can and that's
 

467
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,940

00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:28,440
so I've been watching it for a while now
and it seems to work very well that I've

474
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,450
and it seems to work very well that I've
 

475
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,549
and it seems to work very well that I've
shortened it completely and it still

476
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:32,559
shortened it completely and it still
 

477
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,310
shortened it completely and it still
seems to work um some things I've done

478

482
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,090
here's final whereabouts I need to
 

483
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,840
here's final whereabouts I need to
collect all the items together

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:49,850

 

485
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:56,440

and so at the moment there is no mobs on

486
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:56,450
and so at the moment there is no mobs on
 

487
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,560
and so at the moment there is no mobs on
the spawning pads above last time I

488
00:20:59,560 --> 00:20:59,570
the spawning pads above last time I
 

489
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,630
the spawning pads above last time I
walked away they like instantly started

490
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:01,640
walked away they like instantly started
 

491
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:08,100
walked away they like instantly started
spawning let's see if it happens again

492
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,110

 

493
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:14,400

it was nighttime though

494
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:14,410

 

495
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:21,210

they aren't this time you have four four

496
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:21,220
they aren't this time you have four four
 

497
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,730
they aren't this time you have four four
up there last time I just walked away

498
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:23,740
up there last time I just walked away
 

499
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:31,910
up there last time I just walked away
and like instantly 20 spawned up there

500
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:31,920

 

501
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:55,620

the pig fell through they seem to fight

502
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:55,630
the pig fell through they seem to fight
 

503
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:03,920
the pig fell through they seem to fight
falling down pretty good

504
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:03,930

 

505
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,570

and so basically all this does is it

506
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:06,580
and so basically all this does is it
 

507
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,670
and so basically all this does is it
makes chickens take this path here all

508
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:08,680
makes chickens take this path here all
 

509
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,960
makes chickens take this path here all
the other moms take this path down below

510
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:11,970
the other moms take this path down below
 

511
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,950
the other moms take this path down below
and so next thing I'm going to attach to

512
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:16,960
and so next thing I'm going to attach to
 

513
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,670
and so next thing I'm going to attach to
this is a pig separator which should be

514
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:22,680
this is a pig separator which should be
 

515
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:35,340
this is a pig separator which should be
fairly easy to um something about the

516
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:35,350
fairly easy to um something about the
 

517
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:40,830
fairly easy to um something about the
spawning pads they're not done I do plan

518
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:40,840
spawning pads they're not done I do plan
 

519
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,070
spawning pads they're not done I do plan
on making them a lot more efficient I'll

520
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,080
on making them a lot more efficient I'll
 

521
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,380
on making them a lot more efficient I'll
probably cut them into boat cut them

522
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:49,390
probably cut them into boat cut them
 

523
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,880
probably cut them into boat cut them
into quarters is these big spawning pads

524
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:52,890
into quarters is these big spawning pads
 

525
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,610
into quarters is these big spawning pads
takes a while for the guys to walk off

526
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:56,620
takes a while for the guys to walk off
 

527
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,540
takes a while for the guys to walk off
into the water so I'll probably do it

528
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:00,550
into the water so I'll probably do it
 

529
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:05,710
into the water so I'll probably do it
like I have my hostile spawning pads

530
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:05,720

 

531
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:15,710

which worked very well and I think

532
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:15,720
which worked very well and I think
 

533
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,480
which worked very well and I think
that's where we're going to end it today

534
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:17,490
that's where we're going to end it today
 

535
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,129
that's where we're going to end it today

544
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:36,120
the nether I want to set up a base that
 

545
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,180

train station at some point I should
 

553
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:55,389
train station at some point I should
call it a minecart station I guess and

554
00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:55,399
call it a minecart station I guess and
 

555

going to try get more down on this small
system because and a half way done I'm

566
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:19,769
system because and a half way done I'm
 

567
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:23,320
system because and a half way done I'm
curious to see how it will turn out too
