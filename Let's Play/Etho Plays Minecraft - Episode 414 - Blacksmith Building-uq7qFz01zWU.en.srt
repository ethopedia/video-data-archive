to work my mouse kept sticking in my my

160
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:58,980
to work my mouse kept sticking in my my
 

161
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,009
to work my mouse kept sticking in my my
cursor was going up and down when I

162
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:01,019
cursor was going up and down when I
 

163
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,580
cursor was going up and down when I
stranded the spin anyways here we are in

164
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:04,590
stranded the spin anyways here we are in
 

165
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,490
stranded the spin anyways here we are in
the nether I finished up the redstone

166
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:06,500
the nether I finished up the redstone
 

167
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,720
the nether I finished up the redstone
circuitry here so it does a full loop

168
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:08,730
circuitry here so it does a full loop
 

169
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,819
circuitry here so it does a full loop
now let me just give you a quick

170
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:10,829
now let me just give you a quick
 

171
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:14,000
now let me just give you a quick
demonstration so this lever turns the

172
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,010
demonstration so this lever turns the
 

173
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,600
demonstration so this lever turns the
power on this one controls

174
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:15,610
power on this one controls
 

175
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,789
power on this one controls
system that allows the signal to pass

176
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:17,799
system that allows the signal to pass
 

177
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,640
system that allows the signal to pass
through or not goes all the way around

178
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:20,650
through or not goes all the way around
 

179
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,960
through or not goes all the way around
oh look at that

180
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:21,970
oh look at that
 

181
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,770
oh look at that
so cool if we retract the piston then

182
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:25,780
so cool if we retract the piston then
 

183
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,420
so cool if we retract the piston then
the signal can't get through so these

184
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:27,430
the signal can't get through so these
 

185
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,700
the signal can't get through so these
all just turn off but what that allows

186
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:29,710
all just turn off but what that allows
 

187
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,780
all just turn off but what that allows
us to do if I ever get sick of the

188
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:33,790
us to do if I ever get sick of the
 

189
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,490
us to do if I ever get sick of the
pattern or whatever we got our light

190
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:35,500
pattern or whatever we got our light
 

191
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,200
pattern or whatever we got our light
show here I can always change it up we

192
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,210
show here I can always change it up we
 

193
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,450
show here I can always change it up we
can kind of program it in so if we turn

194
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:39,460
can kind of program it in so if we turn
 

195
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,310
can kind of program it in so if we turn
the power on if we want like a quick

196
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,320
the power on if we want like a quick
 

197
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,770
the power on if we want like a quick
pulse do something like that and then

198
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:43,780
pulse do something like that and then
 

199
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,030
pulse do something like that and then
only a couple lights turn on and you

200
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,040
only a couple lights turn on and you
 

201
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,040
only a couple lights turn on and you
have didn't even have several signals

202
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,050
have didn't even have several signals
 

203
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,730
have didn't even have several signals
going around at the same time oh I did

204
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:53,740
going around at the same time oh I did
 

205
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,850
going around at the same time oh I did
that wrong I'm still learning okay this

206
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:56,860
that wrong I'm still learning okay this
 

207
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,620
that wrong I'm still learning okay this
has to be there we have to keep it like

208
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:58,630
has to be there we have to keep it like
 

209
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,659
has to be there we have to keep it like
that

210
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:02,669

 

211
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,159

okay unpowered this is a little bit more

212
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:05,169
okay unpowered this is a little bit more
 

213
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:06,990
okay unpowered this is a little bit more
to do than I thought but yeah we didn't

214
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,000
to do than I thought but yeah we didn't
 

215
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,580
to do than I thought but yeah we didn't
have like several lights going around if

216
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:08,590
have like several lights going around if
 

217
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,560
have like several lights going around if
we want or just one we can have a really

218
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:10,570
we want or just one we can have a really
 

219
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,900
we want or just one we can have a really
long one really short pulse whatever we

220
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:12,910
long one really short pulse whatever we
 

221
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,030
long one really short pulse whatever we
want is pretty much possible and then to

222
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:15,040
want is pretty much possible and then to
 

223
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,830
want is pretty much possible and then to
clear it we just pulled that lever and

224
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:16,840
clear it we just pulled that lever and
 

225
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,940
clear it we just pulled that lever and
it all gets reset that's pretty cool I

226
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:19,950
it all gets reset that's pretty cool I
 

227
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:25,500
it all gets reset that's pretty cool I
think what I'm gonna do have a quick

228
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,510
think what I'm gonna do have a quick
 

229
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,650
think what I'm gonna do have a quick
pulse yes okay there we go that'll be

230
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:28,660
pulse yes okay there we go that'll be
 

231
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,210
pulse yes okay there we go that'll be
our light show for right now if I want I

232
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:30,220
our light show for right now if I want I
 

233
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,710
our light show for right now if I want I
can change it later just kind of keeps

234
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:31,720
can change it later just kind of keeps
 

235
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,110
can change it later just kind of keeps
going around and around it's not causing

236
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,120
going around and around it's not causing
 

237
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,760
going around and around it's not causing
too much leg either so let's that's

238
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:35,770
too much leg either so let's that's
 

239
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,469
too much leg either so let's that's
pretty good I think I like it

240
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:39,479
pretty good I think I like it
 

241
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,850
pretty good I think I like it
okay we're kind of zipping around our

242
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:41,860
okay we're kind of zipping around our
 

243
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,560
okay we're kind of zipping around our
world here today all over the place

244
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:43,570
world here today all over the place
 

245
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,810
world here today all over the place
sorry about that but I did want to stop

246
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:45,820
sorry about that but I did want to stop
 

247
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,670
sorry about that but I did want to stop
by the Nexus here really quick just to

248
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
by the Nexus here really quick just to
 

249
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,550
by the Nexus here really quick just to
point out something I was having trouble

250
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
point out something I was having trouble
 

251
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,409
point out something I was having trouble
with item elevator here right in the

252
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:52,419
with item elevator here right in the
 

253
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,300
with item elevator here right in the
comments you guys told me what the

254
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,310
comments you guys told me what the
 

255
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,450
comments you guys told me what the
problem is and it is something I did not

256
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:57,460
problem is and it is something I did not
 

257
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,250
problem is and it is something I did not
realize with these item elevators

258
00:05:59,250 --> 00:05:59,260
realize with these item elevators
 

259
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,210
realize with these item elevators
apparently there's a speed limit to them

260
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:02,220
apparently there's a speed limit to them
 

261
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,460
apparently there's a speed limit to them
did you know that I didn't know that you

262
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:05,470
did you know that I didn't know that you
 

263
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,330
did you know that I didn't know that you
cannot just like have a long ice like a

264
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:09,340
cannot just like have a long ice like a
 

265
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,430
cannot just like have a long ice like a
long chain of ice here and have the

266
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
long chain of ice here and have the
 

267
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,350
long chain of ice here and have the
items go full-speed into it you have to

268
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
items go full-speed into it you have to
 

269
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,260
items go full-speed into it you have to
slow it down before it enters elevator

270
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,270
slow it down before it enters elevator
 

271
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,920
slow it down before it enters elevator
like you guys said three blocks before

272
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:18,930
like you guys said three blocks before
 

273
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,250
like you guys said three blocks before
slow it down otherwise items might shoot

274
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:23,260
slow it down otherwise items might shoot
 

275
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,560
slow it down otherwise items might shoot
out like I was having trouble with which

276
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:25,570
out like I was having trouble with which
 

277
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,430
out like I was having trouble with which
I had no idea no idea you also

278
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
I had no idea no idea you also
 

279
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,530
I had no idea no idea you also
said I should close this up here to like

280
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:31,540
said I should close this up here to like
 

281
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,570
said I should close this up here to like
make this a solid 3x3 so won't jump out

282
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:36,580
make this a solid 3x3 so won't jump out
 

283
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,860
make this a solid 3x3 so won't jump out
of the corners or anything like that I

284
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:37,870
of the corners or anything like that I
 

285
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,380
of the corners or anything like that I
think it's good on that side all right

286
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:40,390
think it's good on that side all right
 

287
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,060
think it's good on that side all right
so hopefully that'll fix the trouble I

288
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,070
so hopefully that'll fix the trouble I
 

289
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,830
so hopefully that'll fix the trouble I
was having with this and you know what

290
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
was having with this and you know what
 

291
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,090
was having with this and you know what
this made me realize I had trouble with

292
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:48,100
this made me realize I had trouble with
 

293
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,980
this made me realize I had trouble with
these item elevators before and I didn't

294
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:49,990
these item elevators before and I didn't
 

295
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,900
these item elevators before and I didn't
realize it in the end

296
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:51,910
realize it in the end
 

297
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,910
realize it in the end
oh is that okay yeah I think that's okay

298
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:56,920
oh is that okay yeah I think that's okay
 

299
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,580
oh is that okay yeah I think that's okay
in the end I was having trouble with the

300
00:06:59,580 --> 00:06:59,590
in the end I was having trouble with the
 

301
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,890
in the end I was having trouble with the
thing that dispensed our ender pearls I

302
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:01,900
thing that dispensed our ender pearls I
 

303
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,530
thing that dispensed our ender pearls I
was losing about half the ender pearls I

304
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:04,540
was losing about half the ender pearls I
 

305
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,980
was losing about half the ender pearls I
had no idea why I bet you it's because

306
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:06,990
had no idea why I bet you it's because
 

307
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,510
had no idea why I bet you it's because
my item elevators messed up there so I

308
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
my item elevators messed up there so I
 

309
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,640
my item elevators messed up there so I
just want to go check that out again

310
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:11,650
just want to go check that out again
 

311
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,530
just want to go check that out again
we're zipping all around our world today

312
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:13,540
we're zipping all around our world today
 

313
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,110
we're zipping all around our world today
but to the end is where we're heading

314
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,120
but to the end is where we're heading
 

315
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,750
but to the end is where we're heading
next

316
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:17,760
next
 

317
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,580
next

know what I realized we've been doing a

358
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
know what I realized we've been doing a
 

359
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,680
know what I realized we've been doing a
lot of redstone projects lately like a

360
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:25,690
lot of redstone projects lately like a
 

361
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,840
lot of redstone projects lately like a
lot of them we haven't done a lot of

362
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:27,850
lot of them we haven't done a lot of
 

363
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,280
lot of them we haven't done a lot of
building lately so I kind of felt like

364
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,290
building lately so I kind of felt like
 

365
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,010
building lately so I kind of felt like
doing some building today and we're

366
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,020
doing some building today and we're
 

367
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,290
doing some building today and we're
gonna maybe build something over here we

368
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:34,300
gonna maybe build something over here we
 

369
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,750
gonna maybe build something over here we
got this big empty field got a couple

370
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:36,760
got this big empty field got a couple
 

371
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,500
got this big empty field got a couple
trees here but nothing else really a

372
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:40,510
trees here but nothing else really a
 

373
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,240
trees here but nothing else really a
little while ago we built this fence you

374
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,250
little while ago we built this fence you
 

375
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,350
little while ago we built this fence you
guy said you liked it

376
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
guy said you liked it
 

377
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,079
guy said you liked it
this path needs a bit of work yet but

378
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,089
this path needs a bit of work yet but
 

379
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,240
this path needs a bit of work yet but
with this fence you thought it would

380
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,250
with this fence you thought it would
 

381
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,370
with this fence you thought it would
look better if we had maybe some breaks

382
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:50,380
look better if we had maybe some breaks
 

383
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,970
look better if we had maybe some breaks
in it like a gate for example somewhere

384
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:53,980
in it like a gate for example somewhere
 

385
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,290
in it like a gate for example somewhere
would probably be nice so I was thinking

386
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:58,300
would probably be nice so I was thinking
 

387
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,389
would probably be nice so I was thinking
we could build a couple houses or

388
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
we could build a couple houses or
 

389
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,579
we could build a couple houses or
buildings in this area here and then

390
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:02,589
buildings in this area here and then
 

391
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,259
buildings in this area here and then
might have the path branch off through

392
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:04,269
might have the path branch off through
 

393
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,600
might have the path branch off through
the fence come out this way I have a bed

394
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:08,610
the fence come out this way I have a bed
 

395
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,460
the fence come out this way I have a bed
right over there I use that bed all the

396
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:11,470
right over there I use that bed all the
 

397
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,960
right over there I use that bed all the
time it's just kind of sitting out in

398
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:12,970
time it's just kind of sitting out in
 

399
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,600
time it's just kind of sitting out in
the open if we build some houses here

400
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,610
the open if we build some houses here
 

401
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,699
the open if we build some houses here
maybe we can throw the bed inside there

402
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:17,709
maybe we can throw the bed inside there
 

403
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,819
maybe we can throw the bed inside there
and have a couple other things here too

404
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:19,829
and have a couple other things here too
 

405
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:23,579
and have a couple other things here too
would be cool ah first place I'm going

406
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:23,589
would be cool ah first place I'm going
 

407
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,590
would be cool ah first place I'm going
to build is maybe over here we have a

408
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
to build is maybe over here we have a
 

409
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,730
to build is maybe over here we have a
nice flat spot pretty open and I was

410
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:29,740
nice flat spot pretty open and I was
 

411
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,440
nice flat spot pretty open and I was
going to build a blacksmith all right

412
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,450
going to build a blacksmith all right
 

413
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,940
going to build a blacksmith all right
that's our plan we'll see how this goes

414
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:35,950
that's our plan we'll see how this goes
 

415
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,800
that's our plan we'll see how this goes
if it goes well we might build more more

416
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:37,810
if it goes well we might build more more
 

417
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,960
if it goes well we might build more more
buildings here so we could have like an

418
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:39,970
buildings here so we could have like an
 

419
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,850
buildings here so we could have like an
inn and salon or a bar or something like

420
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:44,860
inn and salon or a bar or something like
 

421
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,069
inn and salon or a bar or something like
that there's a lot of options for for

422
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:47,079
that there's a lot of options for for
 

423
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:49,050
that there's a lot of options for for
little village but we'll start with a

424
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:49,060
little village but we'll start with a
 

425
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,220
little village but we'll start with a
blacksmith and first off most important

piece is the furnace try to decide how
 

429
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,189
piece is the furnace try to decide how
much space we need you know I don't know

430
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:02,199
much space we need you know I don't know
 

431
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:03,480
much space we need you know I don't know
how big the building's going to be I

432
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:03,490
how big the building's going to be I
 

433
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,430
how big the building's going to be I
don't want it to be too too crazy big

434
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
don't want it to be too too crazy big
 

435
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,360
don't want it to be too too crazy big
but if it does end up big I don't want

436
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,370
but if it does end up big I don't want
 

437
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,519
but if it does end up big I don't want
it to like encroach on the fence there

438
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:11,529
it to like encroach on the fence there
 

439
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,439
it to like encroach on the fence there
and our farm so maybe we'll try move it

440
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:13,449
and our farm so maybe we'll try move it
 

441
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:16,860
and our farm so maybe we'll try move it
a little bit this way and just don't

442
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:16,870
a little bit this way and just don't
 

443
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,569
a little bit this way and just don't
want it to close this tree we just kind

444
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:18,579
want it to close this tree we just kind
 

445
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:20,939
want it to close this tree we just kind
of want to snuggle snuggle it in here if

446
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:20,949
of want to snuggle snuggle it in here if
 

447
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:25,139
of want to snuggle snuggle it in here if
we can all right yes it's probably a

448
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:25,149
we can all right yes it's probably a
 

449
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:27,420
we can all right yes it's probably a
decent spot so I'm gonna start with the

450
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:27,430
decent spot so I'm gonna start with the
 

451
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,810
decent spot so I'm gonna start with the
furnace brought some netherrack let's do

452
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:30,820
furnace brought some netherrack let's do
 

453
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,639

something like this light it on fire
 

455
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:35,910
something like this light it on fire
and nothing too crazy we'll just do a

456
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
and nothing too crazy we'll just do a
 

457
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,160
and nothing too crazy we'll just do a
little one all right I think possibly

469
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,160
long time as I've you probably I can't
wait to see the changes

470
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,170
wait to see the changes
 

471
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,560
wait to see the changes
and explore the end content and all that

472
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:58,570
and explore the end content and all that
 

473
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,220
and explore the end content and all that
stuff should be fun alright so maybe

474
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,230
stuff should be fun alright so maybe
 

475
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,400
stuff should be fun alright so maybe
we'll just do something like this and

476
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,410
we'll just do something like this and
 

477
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,880
we'll just do something like this and
build up the back a little bit here

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:08,890
build up the back a little bit here
 

479
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,260
build up the back a little bit here
let's let's try two different things

480
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:10,270
let's let's try two different things
 

481
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,240
let's let's try two different things
here we'll try with the stare at this

482
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,250
here we'll try with the stare at this
 

483
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,570
here we'll try with the stare at this
height so like this oh it's nighttime

484
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:15,580
height so like this oh it's nighttime
 

485
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,900
height so like this oh it's nighttime
good thing I got that bed right bias I

486
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:18,910
good thing I got that bed right bias I
 

487
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,580
good thing I got that bed right bias I
use that all the time like seriously

488
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:20,590
use that all the time like seriously
 

489
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,270

00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:23,280

 

491
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,560

alright that's kind of cool or we could

492
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:25,570
alright that's kind of cool or we could
 

493
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,240
alright that's kind of cool or we could
lower by one do something like this

494
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,250
lower by one do something like this
 

495
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,240
lower by one do something like this
maybe is that good

496
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,250
maybe is that good
 

497
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,980
maybe is that good
alright building isn't exactly my

498
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:34,990
alright building isn't exactly my
 

499
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,830
alright building isn't exactly my
specialty oh that's that that's actually

500
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:37,840
specialty oh that's that that's actually
 

501
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,250
specialty oh that's that that's actually
pretty good looking too now I'm never a

502
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:41,260
pretty good looking too now I'm never a
 

503
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,730
pretty good looking too now I'm never a
hard time choosing alright maybe then

504
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:44,740
hard time choosing alright maybe then
 

505
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:51,990
hard time choosing alright maybe then
what we'll do is build this out and we

506
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
what we'll do is build this out and we
 

507
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,840
what we'll do is build this out and we
do actually let's not put this right

508
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:54,850
do actually let's not put this right
 

509
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,770
do actually let's not put this right
here let's maybe move this forward one

510
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:57,780
here let's maybe move this forward one
 

511
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,700
here let's maybe move this forward one
because I don't want it to line up with

512
00:11:59,700 --> 00:11:59,710
because I don't want it to line up with
 

513
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,200
because I don't want it to line up with
the chimney alright and then every three

514
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,210
the chimney alright and then every three
 

515
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,680
the chimney alright and then every three
spots I like to work with odd numbers do

516
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:07,690
spots I like to work with odd numbers do
 

517
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,790
spots I like to work with odd numbers do
something like that we're just going to

518
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800
something like that we're just going to
 

519
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,740
something like that we're just going to
build a covering over top this area too

520
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:10,750
build a covering over top this area too
 

521
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,770
build a covering over top this area too
and this will be like kinda outside but

522
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:13,780
and this will be like kinda outside but
 

523
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,380
and this will be like kinda outside but
with a covering they'll feel pretty open

524
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:16,390
with a covering they'll feel pretty open
 

525
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,740
with a covering they'll feel pretty open
I hope alright get another one over here

526
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:19,750
I hope alright get another one over here
 

527
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,550
I hope alright get another one over here
and just put back a little fence here I

528
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:23,560
and just put back a little fence here I
 

529
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,100
and just put back a little fence here I
brought some spruce fences that could do

530
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,110
brought some spruce fences that could do
 

531
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,460
brought some spruce fences that could do
something like this

532
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:28,470
something like this
 

533
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,740
something like this
running along alright get rid of all

534
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:34,750
running along alright get rid of all
 

535
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,350
running along alright get rid of all
these rocks I don't really like these

536
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
these rocks I don't really like these
 

537
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,620
these rocks I don't really like these
rocks you know I tried it out and after

538
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:40,630
rocks you know I tried it out and after
 

539
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,390
rocks you know I tried it out and after
living with it for a little while I

540
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:42,400
living with it for a little while I
 

541
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,970
living with it for a little while I
don't like them too much should should

542
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:44,980
don't like them too much should should
 

543
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,650
don't like them too much should should
should do something different with it I

544
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:46,660
should do something different with it I
 

545
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,160
should do something different with it I
think alright then we will do more

546
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,170
think alright then we will do more
 

547
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,740
think alright then we will do more
fences like this and build this up

548
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:54,750
fences like this and build this up
 

549
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,970
fences like this and build this up
alright give me a little bit of time to

550
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:56,980
alright give me a little bit of time to
 

551
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,110
alright give me a little bit of time to
build off camera here we will try

552
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,120
build off camera here we will try
 

553
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,100
build off camera here we will try
actually I'm going to build a roof over

554
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,110
actually I'm going to build a roof over
 

555
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,000
actually I'm going to build a roof over
this because it'll probably take a

556
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,010
this because it'll probably take a
 

557
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,770
this because it'll probably take a
little while okay guys I think I got the

558
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:07,780
little while okay guys I think I got the
 

559
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,450
little while okay guys I think I got the
shape of the roof figure it out here I

560
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:09,460
shape of the roof figure it out here I
 

561
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:09,840
shape of the roof figure it out here I
just

562
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:09,850
just
 

563
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,259
just
realize something though it's quite

564
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:13,269
realize something though it's quite
 

565
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:15,949
realize something though it's quite
possible it's low enough to catch fire

566
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:15,959
possible it's low enough to catch fire
 

567
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,519
possible it's low enough to catch fire
that's my only concern but we will have

568
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:20,529
that's my only concern but we will have
 

569
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,620
that's my only concern but we will have
to see because I was thinking we could

570
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:22,630
to see because I was thinking we could
 

571
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,400
to see because I was thinking we could
have a beam over here running down the

572
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,410
have a beam over here running down the
 

573
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,579
have a beam over here running down the
middle is that far enough because what

574
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:29,589
middle is that far enough because what
 

575
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:34,050
middle is that far enough because what
does it do it goes one I think that's my

576
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,060
does it do it goes one I think that's my
 

577
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,579
does it do it goes one I think that's my
answer

578
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:34,589
answer
 

579
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:37,949
answer
yeah that's not gonna work is it darn it

580
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:37,959
yeah that's not gonna work is it darn it
 

581
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:42,420
yeah that's not gonna work is it darn it
what if I put stone here cuz I don't

582
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:42,430
what if I put stone here cuz I don't
 

583
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,800
what if I put stone here cuz I don't
really want it to be a super high

584
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:43,810
really want it to be a super high
 

585
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,610
really want it to be a super high
ceiling as a thing I'm just going to put

586
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:47,620
ceiling as a thing I'm just going to put
 

587
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,800
ceiling as a thing I'm just going to put
stone in those two spots because it goes

588
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:49,810
stone in those two spots because it goes
 

589
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:56,970
stone in those two spots because it goes
1 2 3 4 5 I think this can still catch

590
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:56,980
1 2 3 4 5 I think this can still catch
 

591
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,009
1 2 3 4 5 I think this can still catch
fire can it I think that's the limit

592
00:13:59,009 --> 00:13:59,019
fire can it I think that's the limit
 

593
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:04,620
fire can it I think that's the limit
it's got to go one higher yeah I think

594
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:04,630
it's got to go one higher yeah I think
 

595
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,360
it's got to go one higher yeah I think
so I'm going to leave it for a sec just

596
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,370
so I'm going to leave it for a sec just
 

597
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:17,639
so I'm going to leave it for a sec just
to be sure dope very cool so we got our

598
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:17,649
to be sure dope very cool so we got our
 

599
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,429
to be sure dope very cool so we got our
blacksmith covering area out by the

600
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:20,439
blacksmith covering area out by the
 

601
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:24,120
blacksmith covering area out by the
furnace it's not quite done I don't know

602
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,130
furnace it's not quite done I don't know
 

603
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,220
furnace it's not quite done I don't know
what to do here what do we do it kind of

604
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,230
what to do here what do we do it kind of
 

605
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,949
what to do here what do we do it kind of
messed up my pattern I had going on so

606
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
messed up my pattern I had going on so
 

607
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,929
messed up my pattern I had going on so
gonna do something special on that end I

608
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:30,939
gonna do something special on that end I
 

609
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:33,150
gonna do something special on that end I
guess don't know like I tried to add

610
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,160
guess don't know like I tried to add
 

611
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,590
guess don't know like I tried to add
some detail to this thing I put some

612
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:34,600
some detail to this thing I put some
 

613
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,879
some detail to this thing I put some
beams across here I don't know if that

614
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:35,889
beams across here I don't know if that
 

615
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:37,590
beams across here I don't know if that
was a good idea or not it makes it a

616
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
was a good idea or not it makes it a
 

617
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,329
was a good idea or not it makes it a
little bit more closed feeling a little

618
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:39,339
little bit more closed feeling a little
 

619
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:42,329
little bit more closed feeling a little
bit more square but it does make

620
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:42,339
bit more square but it does make
 

621
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:47,429
bit more square but it does make
structural reasoning right it makes

622
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:47,439
structural reasoning right it makes
 

623
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:51,240
structural reasoning right it makes
sense like I also put beams across this

624
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,250
sense like I also put beams across this
 

625
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,050
sense like I also put beams across this
way too

626
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,060
way too
 

627
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,050
way too
and from a distance it looks pretty

628
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:55,060
and from a distance it looks pretty
 

629
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,120
and from a distance it looks pretty
decent I would say you might want to do

630
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,130
decent I would say you might want to do
 

631
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,600
decent I would say you might want to do
a couple more things to it but from from

632
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:00,610
a couple more things to it but from from
 

633
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,019
a couple more things to it but from from
the kind of diagonal side angle over

634
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:04,029
the kind of diagonal side angle over
 

635
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,329
the kind of diagonal side angle over
here I think that looks pretty good like

636
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:06,339
here I think that looks pretty good like
 

637
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,949
here I think that looks pretty good like
that's that's what we're going to see

638
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:07,959
that's that's what we're going to see
 

639
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,329
that's that's what we're going to see
most often as we go down this path

640
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:09,339
most often as we go down this path
 

641
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:12,600
most often as we go down this path
that's that's a view we get something

642
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:12,610
that's that's a view we get something
 

643
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,980
that's that's a view we get something
like that so yeah that's all right so

644
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:16,990
like that so yeah that's all right so
 

645
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,990
like that so yeah that's all right so
the idea is we're going to have a path

646
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,000
the idea is we're going to have a path
 

647
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,509
the idea is we're going to have a path
probably somewhere around here and it'll

648
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
probably somewhere around here and it'll
 

649
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,350
probably somewhere around here and it'll
connect to this building

650
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
connect to this building
 

651
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,249
connect to this building
I like this go around to blacksmith area

652
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:29,259

 

653
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:33,819

should we do gravel here gravel or or

654
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:33,829
should we do gravel here gravel or or
 

655
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:34,509
should we do gravel here gravel or or
dirt

656
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:34,519
dirt
 

657
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,329
dirt
I'm not sure I did bring gravel with us

658
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:37,339
I'm not sure I did bring gravel with us
 

659
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:40,239
I'm not sure I did bring gravel with us
and andesite try mix up some some stuff

660
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:40,249
and andesite try mix up some some stuff
 

661
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:43,119
and andesite try mix up some some stuff
I also brought puzzle as a possibility

662
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:43,129
I also brought puzzle as a possibility
 

663
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:46,350
I also brought puzzle as a possibility
we'll try gravel first so but basically

664
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:46,360
we'll try gravel first so but basically
 

665
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,780
we'll try gravel first so but basically
I'm gonna have a rough ground ass type

666
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:49,790
I'm gonna have a rough ground ass type
 

667
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm gonna have a rough ground ass type
of area and I want the house like

668
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:55,610
of area and I want the house like
 

669
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,160
of area and I want the house like
there's going to be a house - like a

670
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,170
there's going to be a house - like a
 

671
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,919
there's going to be a house - like a
building - this I want the front

672
00:15:59,919 --> 00:15:59,929
building - this I want the front
 

673
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:02,710
building - this I want the front
entrance to be right around here is the

674
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
entrance to be right around here is the
 

675
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
entrance to be right around here is the
plan and it'll it'll go like this and

676
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:04,730
plan and it'll it'll go like this and
 

677
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,079
plan and it'll it'll go like this and
make an L they'll go down along this way

678
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:08,089
make an L they'll go down along this way
 

679
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:11,530
make an L they'll go down along this way
is the plan so it's probably going to go

680
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:11,540
is the plan so it's probably going to go
 

681
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,449
is the plan so it's probably going to go
into our field here a little bit but I

682
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:13,459
into our field here a little bit but I
 

683
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:15,150
into our field here a little bit but I
think that's fine

684
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,160
think that's fine
 

685
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:21,100
think that's fine
what I also want to do had an idea if

686
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,110
what I also want to do had an idea if
 

687
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,629
what I also want to do had an idea if
the house is going to be over here let's

688
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:22,639
the house is going to be over here let's
 

689
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,470
the house is going to be over here let's
make a basement for it like a cellar or

690
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
make a basement for it like a cellar or
 

691
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,659
make a basement for it like a cellar or
or something some sort of underground

692
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:28,669
or something some sort of underground
 

693
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:31,239
or something some sort of underground
type of thing to it we'll start that

694
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:31,249
type of thing to it we'll start that
 

695
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:34,449
type of thing to it we'll start that
over here okay

696
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:34,459
over here okay
 

697
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,949
over here okay
so we're gonna have some stairs going

698
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:35,959
so we're gonna have some stairs going
 

699
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:40,659
so we're gonna have some stairs going
down I think that's good we'll try it

700
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:40,669
down I think that's good we'll try it
 

701
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:44,530
down I think that's good we'll try it
like this like this it'll go down into

702
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:44,540
like this like this it'll go down into
 

703
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,169
like this like this it'll go down into
our basement just a little area could

704
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:47,179
our basement just a little area could
 

705
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,419
our basement just a little area could
make some fig barrels or something under

706
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:49,429
make some fig barrels or something under
 

707
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:50,799
make some fig barrels or something under
there and make it look like a wine

708
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:50,809
there and make it look like a wine

don't know something crazy
some random contraption underneath would

714
00:16:59,530 --> 00:16:59,540
some random contraption underneath would
 

715
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:04,480
some random contraption underneath would
be cool to something with character so

716
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:04,490
be cool to something with character so
 

717
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,460
be cool to something with character so
we got our furnace we're gonna need an

not either we'll see um yeah starting to
come together here feels good

802
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:11,789
come together here feels good
 

803
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,730
come together here feels good
of course it's going to look a lot

804
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:13,740
of course it's going to look a lot
 

805
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,720
of course it's going to look a lot
better once we go through for a final

806
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:16,730
better once we go through for a final
 

807
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,980
better once we go through for a final
run-through and just add more detail

808

run-through and just add more detail
 

809
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,019
run-through and just add more detail
like like this like bushes and stuff

810
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:21,029
like like this like bushes and stuff
 

811
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:23,659
like like this like bushes and stuff
it's the detail that really makes a

the Sun rises in the East sets in the

828
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:44,610
the Sun rises in the East sets in the
 

829
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,360
the Sun rises in the East sets in the
West so that makes that the south which

830
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,370
West so that makes that the south which
 

831
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,070
West so that makes that the south which
means this side of the house is actually

832
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,080
means this side of the house is actually
 

833
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,760
means this side of the house is actually
on the No

834
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:49,770
on the No
 

835
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,410
on the No
earth so there wouldn't really be any

836
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:51,420
earth so there wouldn't really be any
 

837
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,420
earth so there wouldn't really be any
windows here ah so we're going to put

838
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:56,430
windows here ah so we're going to put
 

839
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,950
windows here ah so we're going to put
the big windows on the other side of the

840
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:57,960
the big windows on the other side of the
 

841
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,140
the big windows on the other side of the
house especially since yeah it's not

842
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,150
house especially since yeah it's not
 

843
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,790
house especially since yeah it's not
going to have as much character as the

844
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:04,800
going to have as much character as the
 

845
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,460
going to have as much character as the
front side probably so throw windows on

846
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:07,470
front side probably so throw windows on
 

847
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,350
front side probably so throw windows on
that side will be good and yeah it's

848
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:12,360

that side will be good and yeah it's
going to continue on with it a little

850
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:13,650
going to continue on with it a little
 

851

going to continue on with it a little
bit more here

you this is our street view first off so

858
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,130
you this is our street view first off so
 

859
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,190
you this is our street view first off so
this is an angle we're going to see the

860
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
this is an angle we're going to see the
 

861
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,900
this is an angle we're going to see the
building from most often as we go down

862
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:38,910
building from most often as we go down
 

863
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,860
building from most often as we go down
this path here

864
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:39,870
this path here
 

865
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,920
this path here
I think that's alright and if we go down

866
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:42,930
I think that's alright and if we go down
 

867
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,380
I think that's alright and if we go down
here now we got leaves along the path

868
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,390
here now we got leaves along the path
 

869
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,010
here now we got leaves along the path
here

870
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,020
here
 

871
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,290
here
