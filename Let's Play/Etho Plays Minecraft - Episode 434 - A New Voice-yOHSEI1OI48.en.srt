00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,960
start off with today I got another
redstone riddle for you you remember

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:20,970
redstone riddle for you you remember
 

11
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,810
redstone riddle for you you remember
that one we did a couple episodes ago a

12
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:23,820
that one we did a couple episodes ago a
 

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,269
that one we did a couple episodes ago a
lot of you seem to like that well I got

14
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:26,279
lot of you seem to like that well I got
 

15
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:27,980
lot of you seem to like that well I got
another tricky thing for you to figure

16
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:27,990
another tricky thing for you to figure
 

17
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,080
another tricky thing for you to figure
out we're going to do this one quickly

18
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,090
out we're going to do this one quickly
 

19
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,220
out we're going to do this one quickly
though I'm going to give you the answer

20
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:31,230
though I'm going to give you the answer
 

21
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,500
though I'm going to give you the answer
right away instead of waiting an episode

22
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:33,510
right away instead of waiting an episode
 

23
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,750
right away instead of waiting an episode
so a lot of you probably know there is

24
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
so a lot of you probably know there is
 

25
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,150
so a lot of you probably know there is
such a thing as locking repeaters in the

26
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
such a thing as locking repeaters in the
 

27
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,150
such a thing as locking repeaters in the
game so now if I try to give power to

28
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:41,160
game so now if I try to give power to
 

29
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,770
game so now if I try to give power to
this repeater it doesn't accept it

30
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:42,780
this repeater it doesn't accept it
 

31
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,630
this repeater it doesn't accept it
because it's locked up if you have the

32
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
because it's locked up if you have the
 

33
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,369
because it's locked up if you have the
repeater on the side it locks its rights

34
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:46,379
repeater on the side it locks its rights
 

35
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,150
repeater on the side it locks its rights
and if we unlock it allows the power to

36
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
and if we unlock it allows the power to
 

37
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,310
and if we unlock it allows the power to
go through then we can lock it if we

38
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
go through then we can lock it if we
 

39
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,650
go through then we can lock it if we
remove the redstone signal it stays

40
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:54,660
remove the redstone signal it stays
 

41
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,729
remove the redstone signal it stays
powered because it's locked on power if

42
00:00:58,729 --> 00:00:58,739
powered because it's locked on power if
 

43
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,910
powered because it's locked on power if
we remove it it loses it and so on and

44
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
we remove it it loses it and so on and
 

45
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,609
we remove it it loses it and so on and
so forth okay so here's the question for

46
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:04,619
so forth okay so here's the question for
 

47
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,200
so forth okay so here's the question for
you guys how well do you know your

48
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,210
you guys how well do you know your
 

49
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,730
you guys how well do you know your
redstone without checking if we power

50
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:10,740
redstone without checking if we power
 

51
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,620
redstone without checking if we power
this redstone dust is it going to lock

52
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:12,630
this redstone dust is it going to lock
 

53
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,880
this redstone dust is it going to lock
the repeater do you know also the other

54
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:16,890
the repeater do you know also the other
 

55
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,800
the repeater do you know also the other
thing we're going to check is if we use

56
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:18,810
thing we're going to check is if we use
 

57
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,330
thing we're going to check is if we use
a comparator does that lock the power do

58
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:23,340
a comparator does that lock the power do
 

59
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,899
a comparator does that lock the power do
you know what are your answers I'll give

60
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:26,909
you know what are your answers I'll give
 

61
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,370
you know what are your answers I'll give
you a couple seconds to think about it

62
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:28,380
you a couple seconds to think about it
 

63
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,240
you a couple seconds to think about it
okay here we go

64
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,250
okay here we go
 

65
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,289
okay here we go
and so this should be locked right now

66
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:33,299
and so this should be locked right now
 

67
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,649
and so this should be locked right now
right it's not okay so redstone dust

68
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:36,659
right it's not okay so redstone dust
 

69
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,620
right it's not okay so redstone dust
does not lock it what about the

70
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:39,630
does not lock it what about the
 

71
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,030
does not lock it what about the
comparator this one's a little bit more

72
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
comparator this one's a little bit more
 

73
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:49,060
comparator this one's a little bit more
tricky ah didn't logits or did it haha

74
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,070
tricky ah didn't logits or did it haha
 

75
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,889
tricky ah didn't logits or did it haha
so comparatives actually do lock a

76
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:51,899
so comparatives actually do lock a
 

77
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,580
so comparatives actually do lock a
repeater but it doesn't draw the graphic

78
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:55,590
repeater but it doesn't draw the graphic
 

79
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,050
repeater but it doesn't draw the graphic
like it doesn't show that it's locks

80
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,060
like it doesn't show that it's locks
 

81
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,420
like it doesn't show that it's locks
even though it should that might be a

82
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,430
even though it should that might be a
 

83
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,209
even though it should that might be a
bug I don't know but yeah you can

84
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:02,219
bug I don't know but yeah you can
 

85
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,920
bug I don't know but yeah you can
actually lock a repeater with a

86
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:03,930
actually lock a repeater with a
 

87
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,389
actually lock a repeater with a
comparator so a to begin with here today

88
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
comparator so a to begin with here today
 

89
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,979
comparator so a to begin with here today

161
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:45,770
near as good as them for some reason
it's a cheap like 50 $80 headset is a

162
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:45,780
it's a cheap like 50 $80 headset is a
 

163
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,740
it's a cheap like 50 $80 headset is a
sad thing and like these expensive

164
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:48,750
sad thing and like these expensive
 

165
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,660
sad thing and like these expensive
headsets and expensive Microsoft tried

166
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:50,670
headsets and expensive Microsoft tried
 

167
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,970
headsets and expensive Microsoft tried
have and haven't come close to comparing

168
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:52,980
have and haven't come close to comparing
 

169
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,890
have and haven't come close to comparing
I don't think this is going to work

170
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:56,900
I don't think this is going to work
 

171
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:04,170
I don't think this is going to work
yeah it's bunching up okay I bet hmm

172
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:04,180
yeah it's bunching up okay I bet hmm
 

173
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,920
yeah it's bunching up okay I bet hmm
maybe we get rid of this piston at the

174
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:07,930
maybe we get rid of this piston at the
 

175
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,890
maybe we get rid of this piston at the
start here instead like every time it

176
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:10,900
start here instead like every time it
 

177
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,380
start here instead like every time it
goes over the pressure plate let's make

178
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:13,390
goes over the pressure plate let's make
 

179
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,439
goes over the pressure plate let's make
a clock that runs that that makes this

180
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:16,449
a clock that runs that that makes this
 

181
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:17,879
a clock that runs that that makes this
happen and every time it goes over the

182
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:17,889
happen and every time it goes over the
 

183
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:19,500
happen and every time it goes over the
pressure plate it refreshes that clock

184
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:19,510
pressure plate it refreshes that clock
 

185
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,770
pressure plate it refreshes that clock
maybe because if we stop the items it's

186
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:22,780
maybe because if we stop the items it's
 

187
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,340
maybe because if we stop the items it's
gonna cause trouble I think oh and there

188
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:26,350
gonna cause trouble I think oh and there
 

189
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,090
gonna cause trouble I think oh and there
goes the redstone yes I don't know if

190
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,100
goes the redstone yes I don't know if
 

191
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,430
goes the redstone yes I don't know if
this sounds as good I downloaded an

192
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:32,440
this sounds as good I downloaded an
 

193
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,020
this sounds as good I downloaded an
equaliser I've been setting it up for a

194
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,030
equaliser I've been setting it up for a
 

195
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,240
equaliser I've been setting it up for a
few hours here I got an equaliser but I

196
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,250
few hours here I got an equaliser but I
 

197
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,400
few hours here I got an equaliser but I
wasn't really able to change things much

198
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:38,410
wasn't really able to change things much
 

199
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,070
wasn't really able to change things much
yet so I might be able to improve the

200
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:41,080
yet so I might be able to improve the
 

201
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,800
yet so I might be able to improve the
sound to me it doesn't sound like my

202
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:43,810
sound to me it doesn't sound like my
 

203
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,850
sound to me it doesn't sound like my
voice is as full compared to what we had

204
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:47,860
voice is as full compared to what we had
 

205
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,860
voice is as full compared to what we had
before but maybe maybe I can I can get

206
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:52,870
before but maybe maybe I can I can get
 

207
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,510
before but maybe maybe I can I can get
it sounding better but I'll see what you

208
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:54,520
it sounding better but I'll see what you
 

209
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,430
it sounding better but I'll see what you
guys say about it maybe it's just my

210
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:56,440
guys say about it maybe it's just my
 

211
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,890
guys say about it maybe it's just my
opinion and you guys are hearing

212
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:58,900
opinion and you guys are hearing
 

213
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,600
opinion and you guys are hearing
something else that sounds better to you

214
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:00,610
something else that sounds better to you
 

215
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,730
something else that sounds better to you
but I can't continue using those old

216
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:04,740
but I can't continue using those old
 

217
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,010
but I can't continue using those old
headsets even though they sound better

218
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,020
headsets even though they sound better
 

219
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,589
headsets even though they sound better
microphone still works perfect on them

220
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:09,599
microphone still works perfect on them
 

221
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,779
microphone still works perfect on them
but the headsets because the frame is

222
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:12,789
but the headsets because the frame is
 

223
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:15,920
but the headsets because the frame is
broken all the weight is on my ears and

224
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:15,930
broken all the weight is on my ears and
 

225
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,390
broken all the weight is on my ears and
since I wear them day in and day out

226
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
since I wear them day in and day out
 

227
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,070
since I wear them day in and day out
it's gotten to the point where my ears

228
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
it's gotten to the point where my ears
 

229
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,890
it's gotten to the point where my ears
feel bruised all the time because all

230
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:22,900
feel bruised all the time because all
 

231
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,000
feel bruised all the time because all
the weights on the ears for hours and it

232
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,010
the weights on the ears for hours and it
 

233
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,920
the weights on the ears for hours and it
really hurts to wear them I can't stand

234
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:28,930
really hurts to wear them I can't stand
 

235
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,420
really hurts to wear them I can't stand
it anymore I have to get a replacement

236
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:30,430
it anymore I have to get a replacement
 

237
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,870
it anymore I have to get a replacement
here so I figured out how to get my 80

238
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
here so I figured out how to get my 80
 

239
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,909
here so I figured out how to get my 80
20:35 worked and finally I was having

240
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
20:35 worked and finally I was having
 

241
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,260
20:35 worked and finally I was having
trouble with it not producing enough

242
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,270
trouble with it not producing enough
 

243
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,180
trouble with it not producing enough
volume but I guess I had the wrong

244
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,190
volume but I guess I had the wrong
 

245
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,830
volume but I guess I had the wrong
cables or plugged into the wrong spot

246
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:42,840
cables or plugged into the wrong spot
 

247
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,890
cables or plugged into the wrong spot
anyways I'm going to try work off-camera

248
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:46,900
anyways I'm going to try work off-camera
 

249
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,240
anyways I'm going to try work off-camera
a little bit on this elevator and see

250
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,250
a little bit on this elevator and see
 

251
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,230
a little bit on this elevator and see
then figure it out alright so well let's

252
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
then figure it out alright so well let's
 

253
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,700
then figure it out alright so well let's
try this out now I got like a little

254
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:53,710
try this out now I got like a little
 

255
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,560
try this out now I got like a little
prototype set up just like a hopper

256
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:55,570
prototype set up just like a hopper
 

257
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,750
prototype set up just like a hopper
timer and that's pretty much all there

258
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:57,760
timer and that's pretty much all there
 

259
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,890
timer and that's pretty much all there
is to it ah I don't know how stable it

260
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:01,900
is to it ah I don't know how stable it
 

261
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,659
is to it ah I don't know how stable it
is though is the problem so we're going

262
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:03,669
is though is the problem so we're going
 

263
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:06,150
is though is the problem so we're going
to put 50 for dirt in here yeah ideally

264
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
to put 50 for dirt in here yeah ideally
 

265
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,520
to put 50 for dirt in here yeah ideally
we want 54 in that hopper up there when

266
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:08,530
we want 54 in that hopper up there when
 

267
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,540
we want 54 in that hopper up there when
this is done so let's get this going and

268
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:11,550
this is done so let's get this going and
 

269
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,170
this is done so let's get this going and
that doesn't work wait a second and

270
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,180
that doesn't work wait a second and
 

271
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,970
that doesn't work wait a second and
break in replace nope

272
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:18,980
break in replace nope
 

273
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:28,130
break in replace nope
there we go okay oh no nope nope nope no

274
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,140
there we go okay oh no nope nope nope no
 

275
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,840
there we go okay oh no nope nope nope no
good we have one piece that shot out

276
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:29,850
good we have one piece that shot out
 

277
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:36,620
good we have one piece that shot out
already oh that's a lot of mobs that is

278
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:36,630
already oh that's a lot of mobs that is
 

279
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,040
already oh that's a lot of mobs that is
a lot of mobs I was wondering where all

280
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,050
a lot of mobs I was wondering where all
 

281
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,890
a lot of mobs I was wondering where all
that noise is coming from ha I guess

282
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:45,900
that noise is coming from ha I guess
 

283
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,440
that noise is coming from ha I guess
there's a water pool over here don't you

284
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,450
there's a water pool over here don't you
 

285
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,820
there's a water pool over here don't you
blow up I was a mile away

286
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:52,830
blow up I was a mile away
 

287
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,560
blow up I was a mile away
oh come on so here's the deal I've been

288
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:57,570
oh come on so here's the deal I've been
 

289
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,510
oh come on so here's the deal I've been
fiddling around with this item elevator

290
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
fiddling around with this item elevator
 

291
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,330
fiddling around with this item elevator
right I get it to the point where it

292
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:02,340
right I get it to the point where it
 

293
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,490
right I get it to the point where it
seems reliable and working and then it

294
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:04,500
seems reliable and working and then it
 

295
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,070
seems reliable and working and then it
just stops working when I start

296
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,080
just stops working when I start
 

297
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,560
just stops working when I start
recording or like I had a bunch of mobs

298
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:09,570
recording or like I had a bunch of mobs
 

299
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,110
recording or like I had a bunch of mobs
here in this jave and then it wasn't

300
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,120
here in this jave and then it wasn't
 

301
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,710
here in this jave and then it wasn't
working properly because like this I

302
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:15,720
working properly because like this I
 

303
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,800
working properly because like this I
think the skeleton AI is laggy in the

304
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:18,810
think the skeleton AI is laggy in the
 

305
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,650
think the skeleton AI is laggy in the
newer versions of Minecraft and if

306
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:21,660
newer versions of Minecraft and if
 

307
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,060
newer versions of Minecraft and if
there's any skeletons nearby the

308
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,070
there's any skeletons nearby the
 

309
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,060
there's any skeletons nearby the
redstone just slows down quite a bit and

310
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,070
redstone just slows down quite a bit and
 

311
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,830
redstone just slows down quite a bit and
starts behaving a little bit weird and

312
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
starts behaving a little bit weird and
 

313
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,900
starts behaving a little bit weird and
that was making the elevator not work

314
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:29,910
that was making the elevator not work
 

315
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,200
that was making the elevator not work
properly ah so I think what we're gonna

316
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,210
properly ah so I think what we're gonna
 

317
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,240
properly ah so I think what we're gonna
do we're just going to do a dropper item

318
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,250
do we're just going to do a dropper item
 

319
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,280
do we're just going to do a dropper item
elevator because I want something 100

320
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,290
elevator because I want something 100
 

321
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,820
elevator because I want something 100
percent reliable and I think this will

322
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:40,830
percent reliable and I think this will
 

323
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,670
percent reliable and I think this will
last the longest like if they update the

324
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
last the longest like if they update the
 

325
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,380
last the longest like if they update the
game I don't think this will ever break

326
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,390
game I don't think this will ever break
 

327
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,250
game I don't think this will ever break
I hope it should be because it's like

328
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:49,260
I hope it should be because it's like
 

329
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,790
I hope it should be because it's like
the official way of doing item elevators

330
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
the official way of doing item elevators
 

331
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,090
the official way of doing item elevators
kind of in a way there isn't there's no

332
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:56,100
kind of in a way there isn't there's no
 

333
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,920
kind of in a way there isn't there's no
actually official way but I think this

334
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:57,930
actually official way but I think this
 

335
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,970
actually official way but I think this
is the most long long term method we

336
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:01,980
is the most long long term method we
 

337
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,080
is the most long long term method we
have available so basically all we're

338
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,090
have available so basically all we're
 

339
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,850
have available so basically all we're
going to do is a big chain of droppers

340
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:07,860
going to do is a big chain of droppers
 

341
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,270
going to do is a big chain of droppers
facing upwards here we have two item

342
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
facing upwards here we have two item
 

343
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,060
facing upwards here we have two item
elevators to replace at the Nexus 4

344
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,070
elevators to replace at the Nexus 4
 

345
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,240
elevators to replace at the Nexus 4
things that need to go a greater

346
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,250
things that need to go a greater
 

347
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,000
things that need to go a greater
distance like vertically I might try to

348
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,010
distance like vertically I might try to
 

349
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,370
distance like vertically I might try to
that other method but for a short

350
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:22,380
that other method but for a short
 

351
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,720
that other method but for a short
distance like this I don't mind using

352
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:23,730
distance like this I don't mind using
 

353
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,940
distance like this I don't mind using
droppers yes all I had to do here is put

354
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:28,950
droppers yes all I had to do here is put
 

355
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,350
droppers yes all I had to do here is put
a bunch of redstone torches on the

356
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:30,360
a bunch of redstone torches on the
 

357
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,300
a bunch of redstone torches on the
outside of the droppers and as they

358
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:32,310
outside of the droppers and as they
 

359
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,580
outside of the droppers and as they
alternates the items go up up the the

360
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:34,590
alternates the items go up up the the
 

361
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,420
alternates the items go up up the the
chain here pretty simple at the bottom

362
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:38,430
chain here pretty simple at the bottom
 

363
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,010
chain here pretty simple at the bottom
though we need to detect if there's any

364
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,020
though we need to detect if there's any
 

365
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,560
though we need to detect if there's any
items entering the droppers and then

366
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:42,570
items entering the droppers and then
 

367
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,870
items entering the droppers and then
cause this to run on a clock sort of

368
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
cause this to run on a clock sort of
 

369
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,480
cause this to run on a clock sort of
thing but we don't know where the bottom

370
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:47,490
thing but we don't know where the bottom
 

371
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,250
thing but we don't know where the bottom
of the chain is right now

372
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,260
of the chain is right now
 

373
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,769
of the chain is right now
I just remembered we're gonna move this

374
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:51,779
I just remembered we're gonna move this
 

375
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:55,579
I just remembered we're gonna move this
item stream lower let me show you what I

376
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:55,589
item stream lower let me show you what I
 

377
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:58,100
item stream lower let me show you what I
did here earlier by the way I installed

378
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,110
did here earlier by the way I installed
 

379
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,790
did here earlier by the way I installed
four buttons here these are item call

380
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:01,800
four buttons here these are item call
 

381
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,500
four buttons here these are item call
buttons so instead of just using this

382
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:03,510
buttons so instead of just using this
 

383
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,380
buttons so instead of just using this
lever we can now like press this one to

384
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:06,390
lever we can now like press this one to
 

385
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,410
lever we can now like press this one to
get like half a stack this one's for one

386
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:09,420
get like half a stack this one's for one
 

387
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,990
get like half a stack this one's for one
stack two stacks or three stacks of

388
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
stack two stacks or three stacks of
 

389
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,900
stack two stacks or three stacks of
items that way we don't have to like

390
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:14,910
items that way we don't have to like
 

391
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,019
items that way we don't have to like
time oh I want I want items I think

392
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:18,029
time oh I want I want items I think
 

393
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:25,090
time oh I want I want items I think
that's about 32 items worth and then

394
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,100

 

395
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,360

unfledged áown here each one of these is

396
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,370
unfledged áown here each one of these is
 

397
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,269
unfledged áown here each one of these is
pretty easy to configure depending on

398
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:32,279
pretty easy to configure depending on
 

399
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,860
pretty easy to configure depending on
how many items are inside is how many

400
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:33,870
how many items are inside is how many
 

401
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,530
how many items are inside is how many
items it's gonna request so if there's

402
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:36,540
items it's gonna request so if there's
 

403
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:43,250
items it's gonna request so if there's
48 I have no idea it's about 4 4 items

404
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:43,260
48 I have no idea it's about 4 4 items
 

405
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,100
48 I have no idea it's about 4 4 items
per one item in the hopper here so 32

406
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,110
per one item in the hopper here so 32
 

407
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,530
per one item in the hopper here so 32
items is 126 items so just about 2

409
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,350
items is 126 items so just about 2
stacks it's not perfect here I'll show

410
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:54,360
stacks it's not perfect here I'll show
 

411
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,690
stacks it's not perfect here I'll show
you show you this working - so requests

412
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:56,700
you show you this working - so requests
 

413

1 stack this light turns on as it's

414
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,160
1 stack this light turns on as it's
 

415
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,350
1 stack this light turns on as it's
running and if we go to the back here Oh

416
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360

 

417
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,110

see that flashing over there

418
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,120
see that flashing over there
 

419
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,880
see that flashing over there
every time that flash is it it gets one

420
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:10,890
every time that flash is it it gets one
 

421
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,650
every time that flash is it it gets one
item out of the Nexus so pretty cool we

422
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:15,660
item out of the Nexus so pretty cool we
 

423
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,079
item out of the Nexus so pretty cool we
were going to move the dropper lower

424
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:21,089
were going to move the dropper lower
 

425
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:22,550
were going to move the dropper lower
down here though because it was really

426
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
down here though because it was really
 

427
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,770
down here though because it was really
loud and annoying like it was at this

428
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:24,780
loud and annoying like it was at this
 

429
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,329
loud and annoying like it was at this
level before and now we have all this

430
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:26,339
level before and now we have all this
 

431
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,340
level before and now we have all this
stuff all this redstone here - so we

432
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,350
stuff all this redstone here - so we
 

433
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,800
stuff all this redstone here - so we
don't actually have space to shoot the

434
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:30,810
don't actually have space to shoot the
 

435
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,750
don't actually have space to shoot the
items into that that water stream we got

436
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:32,760
items into that that water stream we got
 

437
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,210
items into that that water stream we got
over there so we're going to use hoppers

438
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,220
over there so we're going to use hoppers
 

439
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,650
over there so we're going to use hoppers
to go a little bit lower down

440
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:39,660

 

441
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,170

what is this for oh this is to get the

442
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:43,180
what is this for oh this is to get the
 

443
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,190
what is this for oh this is to get the
items up here yeah this is the other

444
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
items up here yeah this is the other
 

445
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,220
items up here yeah this is the other
item elevator we have to replace oh we

446
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,230
item elevator we have to replace oh we
 

447
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,079
item elevator we have to replace oh we
we actually requesting something there

448
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:52,089
we actually requesting something there
 

449
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:56,870
we actually requesting something there
we got some spruce saplings apparently

450
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
we got some spruce saplings apparently
 

451
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,610
we got some spruce saplings apparently
okay so this is a little bit messy but

452
00:10:59,610 --> 00:10:59,620
okay so this is a little bit messy but
 

453
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,660
okay so this is a little bit messy but
it should do the trick

454
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:00,670
it should do the trick
 

455
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:07,259
it should do the trick
so if there's items in here yeah you

456
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:07,269
so if there's items in here yeah you
 

457
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,879
so if there's items in here yeah you
notice that a little slow down in the

458
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:08,889
notice that a little slow down in the
 

459
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:10,650
notice that a little slow down in the
redstone that means is there's like a

460
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:10,660
redstone that means is there's like a
 

461
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,949
redstone that means is there's like a
scale to nearby or something it's pretty

462
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:13,959
scale to nearby or something it's pretty
 

463
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,460
scale to nearby or something it's pretty
nasty must be nighttime yeah yeah it's

464
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:17,470
nasty must be nighttime yeah yeah it's
 

465
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,470
nasty must be nighttime yeah yeah it's
nighttime

466
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
nighttime
 

467
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,350
nighttime

little bit this way though we can hear
 

475
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,290
little bit this way though we can hear
it that noise was really bugging me

476
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:34,300
it that noise was really bugging me
 

477
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,490
it that noise was really bugging me
though because like whenever we would

478
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:35,500
though because like whenever we would
 

479
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,110
though because like whenever we would
drop off items that you would hear that

480
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
drop off items that you would hear that
 

481
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,689
drop off items that you would hear that
clicking sound but now now since it's

482
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:39,699
clicking sound but now now since it's
 

483
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,660
clicking sound but now now since it's
farther away I just did like a huge

484
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:42,670
farther away I just did like a huge
 

485
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,500
farther away I just did like a huge
hopper chain here to get that distance

486
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:45,510
hopper chain here to get that distance
 

487
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,300
hopper chain here to get that distance
so now this is going to be the new item

488
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,310
so now this is going to be the new item
 

489
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,470
so now this is going to be the new item
stream instead of up here so you see how

490
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
stream instead of up here so you see how
 

491
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,449
stream instead of up here so you see how
all the mobs are like stuttering along

492
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:54,459
all the mobs are like stuttering along
 

493
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:58,050
all the mobs are like stuttering along
like this it's got to be the latest AI

494
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,060
like this it's got to be the latest AI
 

495
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,550
like this it's got to be the latest AI
changes right I want to sleep to get rid

496
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
changes right I want to sleep to get rid
 

497
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,920
changes right I want to sleep to get rid
of all the mobs but I don't know if I

498
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:07,930
of all the mobs but I don't know if I
 

499
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,250
of all the mobs but I don't know if I
can safely here let's try now I think as

500
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:11,260
can safely here let's try now I think as
 

501
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,689
can safely here let's try now I think as
soon as they start burning up then

502
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:12,699
soon as they start burning up then
 

503
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,970
soon as they start burning up then
everything's gonna speed up again oh

504
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:16,980

 

505
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,199

please let me sleep I hear a spider
coming there's a zombie slowly getting

508
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
coming there's a zombie slowly getting
 

509
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,540
coming there's a zombie slowly getting
closer they're getting closer no yes I

510
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:27,550
closer they're getting closer no yes I
 

511

closer they're getting closer no yes I
slept oh that was the longest sleep ever

512
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,000

 

513
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,490

okay so I think we got this item stream

514
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:35,500
okay so I think we got this item stream
 

515
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,710
okay so I think we got this item stream
working again and the item elevator and

516
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:37,720
working again and the item elevator and
 

517
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,059
working again and the item elevator and
all that stuff so let's try it out now

518
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:39,069
all that stuff so let's try it out now
 

519
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:43,189
all that stuff so let's try it out now
will drop off 64 stone into the Nexus

520
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:43,199
will drop off 64 stone into the Nexus
 

521
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:45,900
will drop off 64 stone into the Nexus
that's gonna flow down all these hoppers

522
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:45,910
that's gonna flow down all these hoppers
 

523
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:51,720
that's gonna flow down all these hoppers
and go down this chain get your goes

524
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:51,730
and go down this chain get your goes
 

525
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,579
and go down this chain get your goes
so as soon as they enter this dropper

526
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:53,589
so as soon as they enter this dropper
 

527
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:55,949
so as soon as they enter this dropper
auto-detects it makes this clock run

528
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:55,959
auto-detects it makes this clock run
 

529
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,249
auto-detects it makes this clock run
they get shot out I'm picking up the

530
00:12:59,249 --> 00:12:59,259
they get shot out I'm picking up the
 

531
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:03,809
they get shot out I'm picking up the
items so they go down the stream into

532
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:03,819
items so they go down the stream into
 

533
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:07,789
items so they go down the stream into
this hopper puts them into this big

534
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:07,799
this hopper puts them into this big
 

535
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,949
this hopper puts them into this big
dropper elevator thing item elevator we

536
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
dropper elevator thing item elevator we
 

537
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,280
dropper elevator thing item elevator we
did so this is filling up oh yeah I'm

538
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,290
did so this is filling up oh yeah I'm
 

539
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,679
did so this is filling up oh yeah I'm
missing a repeater here still check this

540
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:16,689
missing a repeater here still check this
 

541
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:18,569
missing a repeater here still check this
out by the way somebody told me you can

542
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:18,579
out by the way somebody told me you can
 

543
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:21,329
out by the way somebody told me you can
pick block in survival so if you middle

544
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:21,339
pick block in survival so if you middle
 

545
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:24,629
pick block in survival so if you middle
click on a repeater because I had in my

546
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
click on a repeater because I had in my
 

547
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,259
click on a repeater because I had in my
inventory it selected it's automatically

548
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:27,269
inventory it selected it's automatically
 

549
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:30,749
inventory it selected it's automatically
just so cool like I knew you could do it

550
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:30,759
just so cool like I knew you could do it
 

551
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,189
just so cool like I knew you could do it
and creative but I never knew you could

552
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:32,199
and creative but I never knew you could
 

553
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:34,590
and creative but I never knew you could
do it in survival or or when they they

554
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:34,600
do it in survival or or when they they
 

555
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,349
do it in survival or or when they they
made that possible so I've been using it

556
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:37,359
made that possible so I've been using it
 

557
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,919
made that possible so I've been using it
all the time now okay so now this should

558
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:40,929
all the time now okay so now this should
 

559
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:42,840
all the time now okay so now this should
start making items shoot outs and go up

560
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:42,850
start making items shoot outs and go up
 

561
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,590
start making items shoot outs and go up
the elevator and once this is empty

562
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:46,600
the elevator and once this is empty
 

563
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,090
the elevator and once this is empty
it'll stop let's go check this out I

564
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:50,100
it'll stop let's go check this out I
 

565
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,590
it'll stop let's go check this out I
think I got to put a glass block up here

566
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:52,600
think I got to put a glass block up here
 

567
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,799
think I got to put a glass block up here
yet - I forgot all right yeah here going

568
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:57,809
yet - I forgot all right yeah here going
 

569
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:01,229
yet - I forgot all right yeah here going
items are going into the Nexus good

570
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:01,239
items are going into the Nexus good
 

571
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:03,629
items are going into the Nexus good
yeah we need a glass block here because

572
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:03,639
yeah we need a glass block here because
 

573
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:05,849
yeah we need a glass block here because
sometimes they might shoot over the edge

574
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:05,859
sometimes they might shoot over the edge
 

575
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:09,119
sometimes they might shoot over the edge
otherwise I'll put one here just for

576
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:09,129
otherwise I'll put one here just for
 

577
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:12,989
otherwise I'll put one here just for
safety okay so they're getting aligned

578
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:12,999
safety okay so they're getting aligned
 

579
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:18,479
safety okay so they're getting aligned
properly I believe yeah it looks good so

580
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:18,489
properly I believe yeah it looks good so
 

581
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:22,169
properly I believe yeah it looks good so
I think that's working and now it's it's

582
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:22,179
I think that's working and now it's it's
 

583
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:26,419
I think that's working and now it's it's
quiet over there too which is cool okay

584
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:26,429

 

585
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:29,279

very good so I just installed this other

586
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:29,289
very good so I just installed this other
 

587
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:31,049
very good so I just installed this other
elevator as well this is the one that

588
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:31,059
elevator as well this is the one that
 

589
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:34,319
elevator as well this is the one that
actually delivers the items to us from

590
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:34,329
actually delivers the items to us from
 

591
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:40,289
actually delivers the items to us from
the Nexus so so how do the esses pick up

592
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:40,299
the Nexus so so how do the esses pick up
 

593
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:42,509
the Nexus so so how do the esses pick up
on this microphone I I'm wondering right

594
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:42,519
on this microphone I I'm wondering right
 

595
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,269
on this microphone I I'm wondering right
now that was probably that maybe it

596
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
now that was probably that maybe it
 

597
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,509
now that was probably that maybe it
wasn't too high pitched hopefully not

598
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
wasn't too high pitched hopefully not
 

599
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,619
wasn't too high pitched hopefully not
alright so let's see I did this one a

600
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:52,629
alright so let's see I did this one a
 

601
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:54,539
alright so let's see I did this one a
little bit different than the other one

602
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:54,549
little bit different than the other one
 

603
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:57,359
little bit different than the other one
this one we need to be very fast and we

604
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:57,369
this one we need to be very fast and we
 

605
00:14:57,369 --> 00:14:59,009
this one we need to be very fast and we
want to make sure no items get left

606
00:14:59,009 --> 00:14:59,019
want to make sure no items get left
 

607
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:03,059
want to make sure no items get left
behind inside these droppers so I think

608
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:03,069
behind inside these droppers so I think
 

609
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,060
behind inside these droppers so I think
it's going to be okay let's

610
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,070
it's going to be okay let's
 

611
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,720
it's going to be okay let's
throw in half a stack of dirt so it goes

612
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:08,730
throw in half a stack of dirt so it goes
 

613
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,470
throw in half a stack of dirt so it goes
into the topper here and when there's

614
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
into the topper here and when there's
 

615
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,740
into the topper here and when there's
items in this dropper it makes this

616
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:15,750
items in this dropper it makes this
 

617
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,410
items in this dropper it makes this
comparator turn on and then this clock

618
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:18,420
comparator turn on and then this clock
 

619
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,510
comparator turn on and then this clock
runs activates this comparator clock

620
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:20,520
runs activates this comparator clock
 

621
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,480
runs activates this comparator clock
which ticks very quickly like one one

622
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:23,490
which ticks very quickly like one one
 

623
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,880
which ticks very quickly like one one
tick on one tick off goes up the

624
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:25,890
tick on one tick off goes up the
 

625
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:31,310
tick on one tick off goes up the
staircase here to all the droppers and

626
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:31,320
staircase here to all the droppers and
 

627
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,020
staircase here to all the droppers and
let's just double check nothing got left

628
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,030
let's just double check nothing got left
 

629
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,480
let's just double check nothing got left
in these wrappers so we don't want any

630
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:35,490
in these wrappers so we don't want any
 

631
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,790
in these wrappers so we don't want any
let items left behind if we request an

632
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:37,800
let items left behind if we request an
 

633
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,250
let items left behind if we request an
item we want them all to arrive and to

634
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:40,260
item we want them all to arrive and to
 

635
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,520
item we want them all to arrive and to
arrive very quickly yeah that looks good

636
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:43,530
arrive very quickly yeah that looks good
 

637
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,310
arrive very quickly yeah that looks good
I don't see any there so all the items

638
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
I don't see any there so all the items
 

639
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,920
I don't see any there so all the items
end up in this dropper over here yeah we

640
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:48,930
end up in this dropper over here yeah we
 

641
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,820
end up in this dropper over here yeah we
got 32 good so I think everything is

642
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:52,830
got 32 good so I think everything is
 

643
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,890
got 32 good so I think everything is
pretty much where it needs to be right

644
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:54,900
pretty much where it needs to be right
 

645
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,940
pretty much where it needs to be right
now let's let's actually give this a try

646
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:57,950
now let's let's actually give this a try
 

647
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,920
now let's let's actually give this a try
make sure the Nexus still works here as

648
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:00,930
make sure the Nexus still works here as
 

649
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,070
make sure the Nexus still works here as
it is let's let's see if there's any

650
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,080
it is let's let's see if there's any
 

651
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,410
it is let's let's see if there's any
gravel in there so we want an f7

652
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:06,420
gravel in there so we want an f7
 

653
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:12,020
gravel in there so we want an f7
that is if for some reason this is

654
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,030
that is if for some reason this is
 

655
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,540
that is if for some reason this is
reversed I believe I thought we fixed

656
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:14,550
reversed I believe I thought we fixed
 

657
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,320
reversed I believe I thought we fixed
that and now it's like wrong again I

658
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,330
that and now it's like wrong again I
 

659
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,330
that and now it's like wrong again I
don't know why I spent a long time

660
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:20,340
don't know why I spent a long time
 

661
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,900
don't know why I spent a long time
switching these displays and now they're

662
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:23,910
switching these displays and now they're
 

663
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,050
switching these displays and now they're
they're incorrect all right let's try

664
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,060
they're incorrect all right let's try
 

665
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,910
they're incorrect all right let's try
get half a stack of it I think that's

666
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:28,920
get half a stack of it I think that's
 

667
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,090
get half a stack of it I think that's
actually 30 items we're looking to get

668
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:32,100
actually 30 items we're looking to get
 

669
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,040
actually 30 items we're looking to get
inside this dropper if there is 30

670
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,050
inside this dropper if there is 30
 

671
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,290
inside this dropper if there is 30
gravel in the Nexus I believe there

672
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:36,300
gravel in the Nexus I believe there
 

673
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,710
gravel in the Nexus I believe there
should be let's drop off some junk here

674
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:39,720
should be let's drop off some junk here
 

675
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,950
should be let's drop off some junk here
while we wait is there a thing for

676
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:42,960
while we wait is there a thing for
 

677
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,800
while we wait is there a thing for
buttons we'll find out all right

678
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:47,810

 

679
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:53,930

22 23 29 we're one short

680
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:53,940
22 23 29 we're one short
 

681
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,290
22 23 29 we're one short
I believe did it get left behind

682
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:57,300
I believe did it get left behind
 

683
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,480
I believe did it get left behind
somewhere

684
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:01,490

 

685
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,029

or it could just be that the timings not

686
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
or it could just be that the timings not
 

687
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,340
or it could just be that the timings not
what I thought it was supposed to be

688
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:06,350
what I thought it was supposed to be
 

689
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,370
what I thought it was supposed to be
maybe it is only twenty nine items yeah

690
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:10,380
maybe it is only twenty nine items yeah
 

691
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,909
maybe it is only twenty nine items yeah
I don't see it anywhere there okay the

692
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
I don't see it anywhere there okay the
 

693
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,730
I don't see it anywhere there okay the
other question I have are is our items

694
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:16,740
other question I have are is our items
 

695
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,649
other question I have are is our items
getting stuck in this hopper for a long

696
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:18,659
getting stuck in this hopper for a long
 

697
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:21,139
getting stuck in this hopper for a long
time see the beauty of those other item

698
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:21,149
time see the beauty of those other item
 

699

one you got to handle the items kind of

702
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:25,079
one you got to handle the items kind of
 

703
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,919
one you got to handle the items kind of
one by one which is pretty slow let's

704
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:30,929
one by one which is pretty slow let's
 

705
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:33,139
one by one which is pretty slow let's
try to do that again but let's go down

706
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:33,149
try to do that again but let's go down
 

707
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:37,970
try to do that again but let's go down
here and just monitor what happens to to

708
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:37,980
here and just monitor what happens to to
 

709
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,389
here and just monitor what happens to to
this dropper here so we should get some

710
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:41,399
this dropper here so we should get some
 

711
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:43,010
this dropper here so we should get some
more gravel hopefully coming down the

712
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:43,020
more gravel hopefully coming down the
 

713
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,220
more gravel hopefully coming down the
stream here and here it comes

714
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,230
stream here and here it comes
 

715
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,899
stream here and here it comes
is it getting backed up pretty bad a

716
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:47,909
is it getting backed up pretty bad a
 

717
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:54,500
is it getting backed up pretty bad a
little bit yeah that kind of sucks see

718
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:54,510
little bit yeah that kind of sucks see
 

719
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,149
little bit yeah that kind of sucks see
the old item elevators those would all

720
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:56,159
the old item elevators those would all
 

721
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,810
the old item elevators those would all
get delivered instantly pretty much

722
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:58,820
get delivered instantly pretty much
 

723
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,889
get delivered instantly pretty much
which is a nice benefit of them but I

724
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:03,899
which is a nice benefit of them but I
 

725
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:05,960
which is a nice benefit of them but I
guess I just will try this out for a

726
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:05,970
guess I just will try this out for a
 

727
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,820
guess I just will try this out for a
while and if it's a problem I might

728
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:07,830
while and if it's a problem I might
 

729
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,980
while and if it's a problem I might
change it if it's only going to be a

730
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:09,990
change it if it's only going to be a
 

731
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,720
change it if it's only going to be a
problem if we're like getting over a

732
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:11,730
problem if we're like getting over a
 

733
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,659
problem if we're like getting over a
stack of items really otherwise it's

734
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:14,669
stack of items really otherwise it's
 

735
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:16,190
stack of items really otherwise it's
only like a couple seconds we have to

736
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:16,200
only like a couple seconds we have to
 

737
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,930
only like a couple seconds we have to
wait extra alright guys so let's do a

wait extra alright guys so let's do a
 

739
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,510
wait extra alright guys so let's do a
little bit of building today as well

740
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:22,520
little bit of building today as well
 

741
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,760

745
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:32,690
the man cave has looked pretty bad for a
long long time like all this area here

746
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:32,700
long long time like all this area here
 

747
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,760
long long time like all this area here
it's pretty nice go down here I'm happy

748

with this area I would call is done even

750
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:37,640
with this area I would call is done even
 

751
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,960
with this area I would call is done even
but like over here that hasn't gotten

752
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:41,970
but like over here that hasn't gotten
 

753
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,760
but like over here that hasn't gotten
the same tender loving care as we've

754
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:43,770
the same tender loving care as we've
 

755
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,799
the same tender loving care as we've
given other areas so maybe let's clean

756
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:45,809
given other areas so maybe let's clean
 

757
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:48,740
given other areas so maybe let's clean
it up a little bit to begin with let's

758
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:48,750
it up a little bit to begin with let's
 

759
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,130
it up a little bit to begin with let's
just do a border we're going to mirror

760
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:52,140
just do a border we're going to mirror
 

761
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,139
just do a border we're going to mirror
what we have on the other side I get the

762
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:54,149
what we have on the other side I get the
 

763
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:57,560
what we have on the other side I get the
slime farm there so just change this all

764
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:57,570
slime farm there so just change this all
 

765
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,519
slime farm there so just change this all
out now we could put like a glass window

766
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:01,529
out now we could put like a glass window
 

767
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:04,310
out now we could put like a glass window
thing if we want to keep it exactly the

768
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
thing if we want to keep it exactly the
 

769
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,649
thing if we want to keep it exactly the
same so this should all be glass so one

770
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:09,659
same so this should all be glass so one
 

771
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:12,799
same so this should all be glass so one
issue is I think we have the slime

772
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:12,809
issue is I think we have the slime
 

773
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:13,680
issue is I think we have the slime
minecart

774
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:13,690
minecart
 

775
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,170
minecart
behind here yeah so this is supposed to

776
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:16,180
behind here yeah so this is supposed to
 

777
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,210
behind here yeah so this is supposed to
carry big slimes underneath the tree

778
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:18,220
carry big slimes underneath the tree
 

779
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,540
carry big slimes underneath the tree
farm area but we've we've tried fixing

780
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:21,550
farm area but we've we've tried fixing
 

781
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,370
farm area but we've we've tried fixing
this many times and it keeps breaking

782
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:25,380
this many times and it keeps breaking
 

783
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,210
this many times and it keeps breaking
maybe we'll try one more time and hope

784
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:30,220
maybe we'll try one more time and hope
 

785
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,700
maybe we'll try one more time and hope
for the best I think mine card stuff has

786
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:32,710
for the best I think mine card stuff has
 

787
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,140
for the best I think mine card stuff has
gotten a little bit better since I last

788
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,150
gotten a little bit better since I last
 

789
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,160
gotten a little bit better since I last
attempted to fix that yeah let's make

790
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,170
attempted to fix that yeah let's make
 

791
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,610
attempted to fix that yeah let's make
this all a window or plan to anyway if

792
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:41,620
this all a window or plan to anyway if
 

793
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,000
this all a window or plan to anyway if
we manage to fix it and we'll just do

794
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,010
we manage to fix it and we'll just do
 

795
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,050
we manage to fix it and we'll just do
what we did on the other side kind of

796
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:49,060
what we did on the other side kind of
 

797
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:54,450
what we did on the other side kind of
like us oh and I would really like to

798
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:54,460
like us oh and I would really like to
 

799
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,370
like us oh and I would really like to
move this track like one more block this

800
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:56,380
move this track like one more block this
 

801
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,670
move this track like one more block this
way though so that we could like have a

802
00:19:59,670 --> 00:19:59,680
way though so that we could like have a
 

803
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,710
way though so that we could like have a
wall here well let's plan to do that we

804
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:04,720
wall here well let's plan to do that we
 

805
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,420
wall here well let's plan to do that we
might have to change some things around

806
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:06,430
might have to change some things around
 

807
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:11,220
might have to change some things around
then over here nothing too crazy I guess

808
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,230
then over here nothing too crazy I guess
 

809
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,260
then over here nothing too crazy I guess
we did use stone here so maybe we should

810
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,270
we did use stone here so maybe we should
 

811
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:18,180
we did use stone here so maybe we should
use stone here as well just to try clean

812
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,190
use stone here as well just to try clean
 

813
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,770
use stone here as well just to try clean
it up a little bit we can add some more

814
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:19,780
it up a little bit we can add some more
 

815
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,910
it up a little bit we can add some more
details after we do this do you want to

816
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:23,920
details after we do this do you want to
 

817
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,560
details after we do this do you want to
go all the way did you do all right

818
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:28,570
go all the way did you do all right
 

819
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,520
go all the way did you do all right
that's the flower farm back there yeah

820
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:32,530
that's the flower farm back there yeah
 

821
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,980
that's the flower farm back there yeah
let's get some more this is how I used

822
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:34,990
let's get some more this is how I used
 

823
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,680
let's get some more this is how I used
to build guys just like big walls all

824
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:37,690
to build guys just like big walls all
 

825
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:43,080
to build guys just like big walls all
one type of block um yeah we could add

826
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,090
one type of block um yeah we could add
 

827
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,820
one type of block um yeah we could add
some more details to it though I feel

828
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:44,830
some more details to it though I feel
 

829
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,890
some more details to it though I feel
like we should okay so here's the setup

830
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:49,900
like we should okay so here's the setup
 

831
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,810
like we should okay so here's the setup
with the slime thing basically he's

832
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:51,820
with the slime thing basically he's
 

833
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,880
with the slime thing basically he's
jumping on a pressure plate right now

834
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:53,890
jumping on a pressure plate right now
 

835
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,610
jumping on a pressure plate right now
which is supposed to release a minecart

836
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:56,620
which is supposed to release a minecart
 

837
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,150
which is supposed to release a minecart
that picks them up in the corner but

838
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:00,160
that picks them up in the corner but
 

839
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,850
that picks them up in the corner but
nothing is happening let's take a look

840
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:02,860
nothing is happening let's take a look
 

841
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,740
nothing is happening let's take a look
what's what's going on here why isn't it

842
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:04,750
what's what's going on here why isn't it
 

843
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,190
what's what's going on here why isn't it
working

844
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,200
working
 

845
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,700
working
ah let's try how's this work exactly I

846
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:11,710
ah let's try how's this work exactly I
 

847
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,680
ah let's try how's this work exactly I
think this would release a minecart

848
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:15,690
think this would release a minecart
 

849
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,390
think this would release a minecart
something like that so went into the

850
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,400
something like that so went into the
 

851
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,070
something like that so went into the
corner and didn't pick up a slime at all

852
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,080
corner and didn't pick up a slime at all
 

853
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,660
corner and didn't pick up a slime at all
maybe we will attempt to do that a

854
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:24,670
maybe we will attempt to do that a
 

855
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,190
maybe we will attempt to do that a
couple more times here just to see if

856
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:26,200
couple more times here just to see if
 

857
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,120
couple more times here just to see if
it's possible and

858
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,130
it's possible and
 

859
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:32,750
it's possible and
or it kind of looks like it's not

860
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:32,760

 

861
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,650

doesn't seem like you can pick up the

862
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:34,660
doesn't seem like you can pick up the
 

863
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,990
doesn't seem like you can pick up the
slime through the corner anymore okay so

864
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000
slime through the corner anymore okay so
 

865
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,640
slime through the corner anymore okay so
I was just looking at this I think we

866
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:41,650
I was just looking at this I think we
 

867
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,770
I was just looking at this I think we
could get it to work again but like this

868
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:43,780
could get it to work again but like this
 

869
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,780
could get it to work again but like this
PEZ dispenser I'm pretty sure doesn't

870
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:45,790
PEZ dispenser I'm pretty sure doesn't
 

871
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,190
PEZ dispenser I'm pretty sure doesn't
work anymore

872
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,200
work anymore
 

873
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,700
work anymore
most of this redstone is unnecessary we

874
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:50,710
most of this redstone is unnecessary we
 

875
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,740
most of this redstone is unnecessary we
could really clean things up here and

876
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:52,750
could really clean things up here and
 

877
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,620
could really clean things up here and
simplify it because all of this was

878
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:55,630
simplify it because all of this was
 

879
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:00,260
simplify it because all of this was
basically to make a whatchamacallit

880
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,270
basically to make a whatchamacallit
 

881
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,900
basically to make a whatchamacallit
dispenser full of minecarts like it's

882
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:03,910
dispenser full of minecarts like it's
 

883
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,770
dispenser full of minecarts like it's
such a simple thing now it's insane all

884
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:07,780
such a simple thing now it's insane all
 

885
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:13,250
such a simple thing now it's insane all
right and then do something like that so

886
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:13,260
right and then do something like that so
 

887
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,650
right and then do something like that so
if we put some pressure plates some

888
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:16,660
if we put some pressure plates some
 

889
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,010
if we put some pressure plates some
stone pressure plates over here and here

890
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:20,020
stone pressure plates over here and here
 

891
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,020
stone pressure plates over here and here
when the big slime falls down he should

892
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,030
when the big slime falls down he should
 

893
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,690
when the big slime falls down he should
activate the dispenser chute out of

894
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:24,700
activate the dispenser chute out of
 

895
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,170
activate the dispenser chute out of
minecarts and we need a full block I

896
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:28,180
minecarts and we need a full block I
 

897
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,850
minecarts and we need a full block I
believe for him to actually fit through

898
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:29,860
believe for him to actually fit through
 

899
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,790
believe for him to actually fit through
this gap otherwise like if we do the

900
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:32,800
this gap otherwise like if we do the
 

901
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,840
this gap otherwise like if we do the
cheesy method of this I think that'll

902
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:36,850
cheesy method of this I think that'll
 

903
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,310
cheesy method of this I think that'll
work for the minecart but I don't think

904
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,320
work for the minecart but I don't think
 

905
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,690
work for the minecart but I don't think
it'll actually allow a mob to fit

906
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:39,700
it'll actually allow a mob to fit
 

907
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,480
it'll actually allow a mob to fit
through oh it's not letting the cart go

908
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:42,490
through oh it's not letting the cart go
 

909
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,560
through oh it's not letting the cart go
through either okay yeah so I think we

910
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:46,570
through either okay yeah so I think we
 

911
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,530
through either okay yeah so I think we
need to open this up all right and is

912
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:51,540
need to open this up all right and is
 

913
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,940
need to open this up all right and is
the minecart bouncing off this wall no

914
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:53,950
the minecart bouncing off this wall no
 

915
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,030
the minecart bouncing off this wall no
it's not we might want to put a solid

916
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,040
it's not we might want to put a solid
 

917
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,020
it's not we might want to put a solid
block here too just so it'll move okay

918
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,030
block here too just so it'll move okay
 

919
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:07,260
block here too just so it'll move okay
and let's see let's go down here so this

920
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,270
and let's see let's go down here so this
 

921
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:12,060
and let's see let's go down here so this
will go to where we can get rid of like

922
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,070
will go to where we can get rid of like
 

923
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,460
will go to where we can get rid of like
everything here where's our target I

924
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:14,470
everything here where's our target I
 

925
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,290
everything here where's our target I
guess I should figure out because

926
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:16,300
guess I should figure out because
 

927
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,130
guess I should figure out because
there's that drop area yeah right here

928
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:20,140
there's that drop area yeah right here
 

929
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,490
there's that drop area yeah right here
is where it used to drop and where is

930
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:23,500
is where it used to drop and where is
 

931
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:32,730
is where it used to drop and where is
this track over here okay so we could we

932
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:32,740
this track over here okay so we could we
 

933
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,310
this track over here okay so we could we
want to put like the track over here

934
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
want to put like the track over here
 

935
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,930
want to put like the track over here
maybe that would look pretty good if

936
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:36,940
maybe that would look pretty good if
 

937
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,700
maybe that would look pretty good if
we're trying to make it as a display

938
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:38,710
we're trying to make it as a display
 

939
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,630
we're trying to make it as a display
thing

940
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:40,640
thing
 

941
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,090
thing
break these blocks good there's a button

942
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:44,100
break these blocks good there's a button
 

943
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,380
break these blocks good there's a button
there I don't know what that's for it's

944
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:45,390
there I don't know what that's for it's
 

945
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:51,470
there I don't know what that's for it's
gone destroy it all I say okay so if we

946
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:51,480
gone destroy it all I say okay so if we
 

947

implementing the end rods I've seen
 

1061
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,610
implementing the end rods I've seen
designs like end rod staircases and

1062
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:57,620
designs like end rod staircases and
 

1063
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,710
designs like end rod staircases and
other fancy things just wondering

1064
