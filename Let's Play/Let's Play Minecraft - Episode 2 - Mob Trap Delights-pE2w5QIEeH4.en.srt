anyway
that creeper gave me an idea a few weeks

36
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:38,119
that creeper gave me an idea a few weeks
 

37
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,859
that creeper gave me an idea a few weeks
ago I wanted to make a certain type of

38
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:41,869
ago I wanted to make a certain type of
 

39
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:45,100
ago I wanted to make a certain type of
mob trap I had an idea and I'm going to

40
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,110
mob trap I had an idea and I'm going to
 

41
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,320
mob trap I had an idea and I'm going to
try make it this video it's very simple

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,330
try make it this video it's very simple
 

43
00:01:49,330 --> 00:02:02,219
try make it this video it's very simple
first I'm going to get some wood though

44
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:02,229

 

45
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,449

basically I'm going to need four doors

46
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:04,459
basically I'm going to need four doors
 

47
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:08,020
basically I'm going to need four doors
and a pressure plate and that's pretty

48
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,030
and a pressure plate and that's pretty
 

49
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:17,199
and a pressure plate and that's pretty
much all the trap is all right that's

50
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:17,209
much all the trap is all right that's
 

51
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:27,400
much all the trap is all right that's
good enough and any type of pressure

52
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,410
good enough and any type of pressure
 

53
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:33,069
good enough and any type of pressure
plate so I haven't made sure I don't

54
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:33,079
plate so I haven't made sure I don't
 

55
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,840
plate so I haven't made sure I don't
know if this works for sure but I think

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:34,850
know if this works for sure but I think
 

57
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,590
know if this works for sure but I think
it does I haven't built it off camera or

58
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:38,600
it does I haven't built it off camera or
 

59
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,740
it does I haven't built it off camera or
anything like that so this is the first

60
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:41,750
anything like that so this is the first
 

61
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,180
anything like that so this is the first
time I'm seeing it and the first time

62
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,190
time I'm seeing it and the first time
 

63
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:51,250
time I'm seeing it and the first time
you're seeing it basically just decide

64
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:51,260
you're seeing it basically just decide
 

65
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:57,130
you're seeing it basically just decide
where you want to put it get your four

66
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,140
where you want to put it get your four
 

67
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,729
where you want to put it get your four
doors and I'm going to put it above my

68
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:00,739
doors and I'm going to put it above my
 

69
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:03,220
doors and I'm going to put it above my
little station here because I think

70
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,230
little station here because I think
 

71
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,509
little station here because I think
there'll be lots of that creepers

72
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:04,519
there'll be lots of that creepers
 

73
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,930
there'll be lots of that creepers
walking around here and just put your

74
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:07,940
walking around here and just put your
 

75
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,520
walking around here and just put your
four doors around you

76
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:13,530

 

77
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,380

at and it's your pressure plates put it

78
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:18,390
at and it's your pressure plates put it
 

79
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:25,490
at and it's your pressure plates put it
inside so that doesn't work because the

80
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:25,500
inside so that doesn't work because the
 

81
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,270
inside so that doesn't work because the
doors are reversed but there is a way to

82
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
doors are reversed but there is a way to
 

83
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:48,680
doors are reversed but there is a way to
fix that let's go start over here so if

84
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:48,690
fix that let's go start over here so if
 

85
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,240
fix that let's go start over here so if
you need to reverse doors you need a

86
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,250
you need to reverse doors you need a
 

87
00:03:50,250 --> 00:04:00,199
you need to reverse doors you need a
block next to the door well oh that's

88
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:00,209
block next to the door well oh that's
 

89
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:08,780
block next to the door well oh that's
the hole light up okay so that's the

90
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:08,790
the hole light up okay so that's the
 

91
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,000
the hole light up okay so that's the
wrong way so we need the door hinge on

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,010
wrong way so we need the door hinge on
 

93
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:26,360
wrong way so we need the door hinge on
the side like that so now the door is

94
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,370
the side like that so now the door is
 

95
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,370
the side like that so now the door is
going to be open by default and when

96
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:28,380
going to be open by default and when
 

97
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,870
going to be open by default and when
they step on the pressure plate it

98
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:29,880
they step on the pressure plate it
 

99
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,510
they step on the pressure plate it
closes yeah I think that's what I'm

100
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
closes yeah I think that's what I'm
 

101
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,029
closes yeah I think that's what I'm
going to do

102
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:40,039

 

103
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,070

oh you know what I put the door the

104
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
oh you know what I put the door the
 

105
00:04:42,080 --> 00:05:05,379
oh you know what I put the door the
wrong way ha ha ha okay this time that's

106
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:05,389
wrong way ha ha ha okay this time that's
 

107
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,489
wrong way ha ha ha okay this time that's
what I want so that was on the right

108
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:09,499
what I want so that was on the right
 

109
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:19,360
what I want so that was on the right
side I think yes place the four doors

110
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,370
side I think yes place the four doors
 

111
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:37,589
side I think yes place the four doors
like that get rid of your sand and

112
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:37,599
like that get rid of your sand and
 

113
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:43,059
like that get rid of your sand and
that's our trap so if a creeper walks in

114
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:43,069
that's our trap so if a creeper walks in
 

115
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:45,820
that's our trap so if a creeper walks in
here he's automatically trapped you

116
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:45,830
here he's automatically trapped you
 

117
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:51,239
here he's automatically trapped you
can't get out unless maybe if you jump

118
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:51,249
can't get out unless maybe if you jump
 

119
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:53,679
can't get out unless maybe if you jump
if you jumped you can get out so we're

120
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:53,689
if you jumped you can get out so we're
 

121
00:05:53,689 --> 00:06:06,759
if you jumped you can get out so we're
going to put a block above also and you

122
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:06,769
going to put a block above also and you
 

123
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:09,759
going to put a block above also and you
can use you could use a glass block if

124
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:09,769
can use you could use a glass block if
 

125
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,199
can use you could use a glass block if
you want them to be killed by the

126
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,209
you want them to be killed by the
 

127
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,829
you want them to be killed by the
sunlight I'm just going to use it

128
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:14,839
sunlight I'm just going to use it
 

129
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:21,639
sunlight I'm just going to use it
regular block so I think that should

130
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:21,649
regular block so I think that should
 

131
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:26,860
regular block so I think that should
hold hold them yeah the doors don't open

132
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:26,870
hold hold them yeah the doors don't open
 

133
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,529
hold hold them yeah the doors don't open
now when I jump that's my very simple

134
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:32,539
now when I jump that's my very simple
 

135
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:36,129
now when I jump that's my very simple
mob trap and I'm hopefully I'll capture

136
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:36,139
mob trap and I'm hopefully I'll capture
 

137
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:43,040
mob trap and I'm hopefully I'll capture
somebody tonight see if it works

138
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,050

 

139
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,540

now I'm guessing you can also probably

140
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:45,550
now I'm guessing you can also probably
 

141
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,240
now I'm guessing you can also probably
modify this trap to only catch chickens

142
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,250
modify this trap to only catch chickens
 

143
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,150
modify this trap to only catch chickens
if you want I think all you would need

144
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:51,160
if you want I think all you would need
 

145
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,330
if you want I think all you would need
to do is lower this block by one so let

146
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:54,340
to do is lower this block by one so let
 

147
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,340
to do is lower this block by one so let
the trap is only one block high and only

148
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,350
the trap is only one block high and only
 

149
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,600
the trap is only one block high and only
chickens will be able to fit in it and

150
00:06:59,600 --> 00:06:59,610
chickens will be able to fit in it and
 

151
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,290
chickens will be able to fit in it and
you could probably also change it to the

152
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,300
you could probably also change it to the
 

153
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,210
you could probably also change it to the
base area here to a two by two you

154
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:06,220
base area here to a two by two you
 

155
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,510
base area here to a two by two you
wanted it to catch spiders instead of

156
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
wanted it to catch spiders instead of
 

157
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,360
wanted it to catch spiders instead of
this one by one area but I'm not going

158
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,370
this one by one area but I'm not going
 

159
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,650
this one by one area but I'm not going
to bother trying to do that I'm sure you

160
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:13,660
to bother trying to do that I'm sure you
 

161
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,990
to bother trying to do that I'm sure you
can figure it out if you want using the

162
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
can figure it out if you want using the

169
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,480
personally I'm hoping that creeper will
walk into it randomly tonight and I can

170
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,490
walk into it randomly tonight and I can
 

171
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,320
walk into it randomly tonight and I can
come here and point and laugh at it

172
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,330
come here and point and laugh at it

177
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,280
you can direct mobs into it somehow or
set up many of them I don't know I'll

178
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,290
set up many of them I don't know I'll
 

179
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,000
set up many of them I don't know I'll
leave it up to you that's the design

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,010
leave it up to you that's the design
 

181
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:54,200
leave it up to you that's the design
though very simple alright so I think

182
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,210
though very simple alright so I think
 

183
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,780

going to try make a tree farm because in
 

187
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,500
going to try make a tree farm because in
my last worlds I didn't build a tree

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:07,510
my last worlds I didn't build a tree
 

189
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,010
my last worlds I didn't build a tree
farm and I regretted it later because I

190
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,020
farm and I regretted it later because I
 

191
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,650
farm and I regretted it later because I
thought not just going to fix the

192
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:13,660
thought not just going to fix the
 

193
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,440

did while he did one day I saw on his
 

201
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,570
did while he did one day I saw on his
blog that he fixed it but then like a

202
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:30,580
blog that he fixed it but then like a
 

203
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,340
blog that he fixed it but then like a
few minutes later he he undid the change

204
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,350
few minutes later he he undid the change
 

205
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:39,060
few minutes later he he undid the change
because it was causing crashes and I

206
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,070
because it was causing crashes and I
 

207
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,940
because it was causing crashes and I
don't think he's worked on it since so

208
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:40,950
don't think he's worked on it since so
 

209
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:46,350
don't think he's worked on it since so
I'm going to build a tree farm so that I

210
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:46,360
I'm going to build a tree farm so that I
 

211
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,120
I'm going to build a tree farm so that I
don't run out of wood in this in this

212
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,130
don't run out of wood in this in this
 

213
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,650
don't run out of wood in this in this
world I think I'll just build it

214
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:52,660
world I think I'll just build it
 

215
00:08:52,660 --> 00:09:00,689
world I think I'll just build it
should I find a nice flat spot for it

216
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:00,699

 

217
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:06,939

there's more ocean over there don't need

218
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:06,949
there's more ocean over there don't need
 

219
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:12,160
there's more ocean over there don't need
that probably going to have to build it

220
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,170
that probably going to have to build it
 

221
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,420
that probably going to have to build it
somewhere around here

222
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,430
somewhere around here
 

223
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:24,429
somewhere around here
Oh a peek finally I'm hungry I don't

I'm going to build a tree farm around

232
00:09:57,579 --> 00:09:57,589
I'm going to build a tree farm around
 

233
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:05,199
I'm going to build a tree farm around
here I think and I might have to level

234
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:05,209
here I think and I might have to level
 

235
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:11,009
here I think and I might have to level
this out a bit

236
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:11,019

 

237
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:13,840

I'll probably work on it in my next

238
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:13,850
I'll probably work on it in my next
 

239
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:32,480
I'll probably work on it in my next
state

240
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,490

 

241
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,770

because I'll probably die if I can build

242
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:34,780
because I'll probably die if I can build
 

243
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:44,220
because I'll probably die if I can build
it tonight I really need to make some

244
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,230
it tonight I really need to make some
 

245
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,170
it tonight I really need to make some
kind of storage chest or else I'm going

246
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:46,180
kind of storage chest or else I'm going
 

247
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,600
kind of storage chest or else I'm going
to lose everything so I think I'm going

248
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:51,610
to lose everything so I think I'm going
 

249
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:58,860
to lose everything so I think I'm going
to go hide and work on the road a bit

250
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:58,870
to go hide and work on the road a bit
 

251
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,720
to go hide and work on the road a bit
more I'll probably have lots of projects

252
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:03,730
more I'll probably have lots of projects
 

253
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,620
more I'll probably have lots of projects
going at a time

254
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:04,630
going at a time
 

255
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,090
going at a time
because I don't like to work on just one

256
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,100

where that you can fell down one of
 

261
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,090
where that you can fell down one of
these type of holes

262
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,100
these type of holes
 

263
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:54,680
these type of holes
anyway build the chest store my chunk

264
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:54,690

 

265
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:02,040

and yeah so I'm going to build a furnace

and yeah so I'm going to build a furnace
 

267
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:15,769
and yeah so I'm going to build a furnace
- and then I'll probably make this class

268
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:15,779

 

269
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,569

271
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:20,759
alright so I'm just going to clear out
some more of this area here off camera

272
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:20,769
some more of this area here off camera
 

273
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:24,889
