500
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
to tame them for some reason you can
 

501
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,829
to tame them for some reason you can
still move them around this way

502
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
still move them around this way
 

503
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,269

756
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,360

757
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,990
together in a long time but i do use
this area

758

a lot i go here all the time
 

761
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,590
a lot i go here all the time
and it looks like it's empty again

we need some gray and we need some of

766
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440
we need some gray and we need some of
 

767
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,230
we need some gray and we need some of
this uh

768
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
this uh
 

769
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,069
this uh
light gray stuff so there's lots of that

770
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
light gray stuff so there's lots of that
 

771
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,189
light gray stuff so there's lots of that
here this is brown though right not gray

772
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:45,199
here this is brown though right not gray

here this is brown though right not gray
so i'll probably have to craft the gray

00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
so i'll probably have to craft the gray
 

775
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,069
so i'll probably have to craft the gray

might stand out a little bit i'm not
sure

846
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
sure
 

847
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,189
sure
and also we're gonna need some kind of

848
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
and also we're gonna need some kind of
 

849
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,590
and also we're gonna need some kind of
glass color to go with the nether brick

850
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
glass color to go with the nether brick
 

851
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,550
glass color to go with the nether brick
so i couldn't decide either purple

852
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
so i couldn't decide either purple
 

853
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,230
so i couldn't decide either purple
magenta

854
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,240
magenta
 

855
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,470
magenta
or pink i really don't like pink though

856
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
or pink i really don't like pink though
 

857
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,749
or pink i really don't like pink though
but it might be the best suited we got

858
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:25,759
but it might be the best suited we got
 

859
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,269
but it might be the best suited we got
the most purple honest though so that's

860
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279
the most purple honest though so that's
 

861
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:27,829
the most purple honest though so that's
probably what

862
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
probably what
 

863
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,949
probably what
we'll go for and finally for the walls

864
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
we'll go for and finally for the walls
 

865
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,550
we'll go for and finally for the walls
uh just in general we're gonna use this

866
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
uh just in general we're gonna use this
 

867
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,710
uh just in general we're gonna use this
gray clay stuff

868
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
gray clay stuff
 

869
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,230
gray clay stuff
so i think those colors all kind of work

870
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
so i think those colors all kind of work
 

871
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,389
so i think those colors all kind of work
together that's that's the plan here

872
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
together that's that's the plan here
 

873
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,990
together that's that's the plan here
let's get to it

874
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
let's get to it
 

875
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,910
let's get to it
um so when i asked you guys what we

876
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920
um so when i asked you guys what we
 

877
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,430
um so when i asked you guys what we
should do for this building the number

878
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
should do for this building the number
 

879
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:43,829
should do for this building the number
one

880
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
one
 

881
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,030
one
thing that was suggested is we we make

882
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
thing that was suggested is we we make
 

883
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,870
thing that was suggested is we we make
it so we can still see the rail stuff

884
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880
it so we can still see the rail stuff
 

885
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,350
it so we can still see the rail stuff
down there don't cover it up totally

886
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
down there don't cover it up totally
 

887
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,389
down there don't cover it up totally
so let's start with that

888
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
so let's start with that
 

889
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,069
so let's start with that
first i'm going to just put a rip

890
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
first i'm going to just put a rip
 

891
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,189
first i'm going to just put a rip
rim a trim something

892
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
rim a trim something
 

893
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,150
rim a trim something
around the chest here to get us going uh

894
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
around the chest here to get us going uh
 

895
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,110
around the chest here to get us going uh
this is the very

896
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
this is the very
 

897
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,829
this is the very
center right so this is a good starting

898
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
center right so this is a good starting
 

899
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,949
center right so this is a good starting
point

900
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
point
 

901
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,270
point
and then my plan is to maybe put glass

902
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
and then my plan is to maybe put glass
 

903
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,309
and then my plan is to maybe put glass
over here and

904
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319
over here and
 

905
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,590
over here and
let's just see what this looks like

906
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
let's just see what this looks like
 

907
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,909
let's just see what this looks like
here let's let's do this actually give

908
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:21,919
here let's let's do this actually give
 

909
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,669
here let's let's do this actually give
it a bit more variation

910
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:23,679
it a bit more variation
 

911
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,350
it a bit more variation
so if we're standing here out of our

912
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
so if we're standing here out of our
 

913
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,110
so if we're standing here out of our
peripheral peripheral

914
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
peripheral peripheral
 

915
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,110
peripheral peripheral
vision can't really see that but i guess

916
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
vision can't really see that but i guess
 

917
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,990
vision can't really see that but i guess
if you look this way you'll

918
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
if you look this way you'll
 

919
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,909
if you look this way you'll
see it you can't see the rail stuff when

920
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
see it you can't see the rail stuff when
 

921
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,110
see it you can't see the rail stuff when
you're looking forward here

922
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,120

 

923
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,430

oh well i i think it's fine still let's

924
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,440
oh well i i think it's fine still let's
 

925
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,230
oh well i i think it's fine still let's
go maybe

926
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
go maybe
 

927
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,470
go maybe
five blocks across here and then i want

928
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
five blocks across here and then i want
 

929
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,710
five blocks across here and then i want
to put in a window this will help me to

930
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
to put in a window this will help me to
 

931
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,070
to put in a window this will help me to
figure out how the building's going to

932
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
figure out how the building's going to
 

933
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,310
figure out how the building's going to
go because if i got nothing

934
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
go because if i got nothing
 

935
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,909
go because if i got nothing
in the walls i don't know what to do

936
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
in the walls i don't know what to do
 

937
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,750
in the walls i don't know what to do
usually so

938
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
usually so
 

939
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,110
usually so
we'll go up like four blocks or so

940
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120
we'll go up like four blocks or so
 

941
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,990
we'll go up like four blocks or so
and we're out of glass already oh man

942
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,000
and we're out of glass already oh man
 

943
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,789
and we're out of glass already oh man
okay let's let's carry this on here

944
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
okay let's let's carry this on here
 

945
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,830
okay let's let's carry this on here
build up the trim and then probably

946
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
build up the trim and then probably
 

947
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,230
build up the trim and then probably
have this go forward a block and come up

948
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
have this go forward a block and come up
 

949
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,270
have this go forward a block and come up
like this

950
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,280

 

951
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,669

all right one two three four one two

952
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
all right one two three four one two
 

953
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,470
all right one two three four one two
three four

954
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
three four
 

955
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,390
three four
and then i do have some stairs on me

956
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,400
and then i do have some stairs on me
 

957
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,190
and then i do have some stairs on me
we'll try to curve it

958
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
we'll try to curve it
 

959
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,870
we'll try to curve it
because i like my arches you guys know

960
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:22,880
because i like my arches you guys know
 

961
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,310
because i like my arches you guys know
that

962
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
that
 

963
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,950
that
and then it's gonna be oh it's an even

964
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
and then it's gonna be oh it's an even
 

965
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,630
and then it's gonna be oh it's an even
number here right

966
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
number here right
 

967
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,390
number here right
so let's just connect it like that

968
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400

 

969
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,270

yes something like that will work out i

970
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
yes something like that will work out i
 

971
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,070
yes something like that will work out i
hope

972
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
hope
 

973
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,230
hope
um let's fill in the floor a little bit

974
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
um let's fill in the floor a little bit
 

975
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,990
um let's fill in the floor a little bit
here with this clay

976
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,000
here with this clay
 

977
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,029
here with this clay
let's see what that looks like maybe

978
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
let's see what that looks like maybe
 

979
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,710
let's see what that looks like maybe
just run it solid here so we have a big

980
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
just run it solid here so we have a big
 

981
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,870
just run it solid here so we have a big
piece of it and not just the

982
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:46,880
piece of it and not just the
 

983
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,789
piece of it and not just the
like if we put another nether brick

984
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
like if we put another nether brick
 

985
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,310
like if we put another nether brick
border around this chest i think it's

986
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
border around this chest i think it's
 

987
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,110
border around this chest i think it's
going to look

988
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
going to look
 

989
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,390
going to look
uh too much nether brick you know oh if

990
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
uh too much nether brick you know oh if
 

991
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,070
uh too much nether brick you know oh if
we do this though we can't open this

992
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
we do this though we can't open this
 

993
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,430
we do this though we can't open this
chest ah man trouble

994
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
chest ah man trouble
 

995
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,710
chest ah man trouble
actually let's just test this out

996
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
actually let's just test this out
 

997
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,310
actually let's just test this out
because i think they fixed this right or

998
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
because i think they fixed this right or
 

999
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,909
because i think they fixed this right or
they changed it

1000
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:05,919
they changed it
 

1001
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,230
they changed it
so if you have chest over here

1002
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,240
so if you have chest over here
 

1003
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,310
so if you have chest over here
hopper over there and stuff in here

1004
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
hopper over there and stuff in here
 

1005
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,070
hopper over there and stuff in here
going into there

1006
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
going into there
 

1007
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,230
going into there
if you cover this up does that stop the

1008
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,240
if you cover this up does that stop the
 

1009
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,590
if you cover this up does that stop the
flow

1010
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
flow
 

1011
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,789
flow
with a solid block here

1012
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:20,799
with a solid block here
 

1013
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,190
with a solid block here
oh it still does darn ah

1014
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
oh it still does darn ah
 

1015
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,230
oh it still does darn ah
okay and then it starts again

1016
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
okay and then it starts again
 

1017
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,950
okay and then it starts again
okay so we have to put something above

1018
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
okay so we have to put something above
 

1019
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,830
okay so we have to put something above
that

1020
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840

 

1021
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,870

oh wait does it still flow into here

1022
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
oh wait does it still flow into here
 

1023
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,310
oh wait does it still flow into here
this is still going down yeah it still

1024
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
this is still going down yeah it still
 

1025
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,990
this is still going down yeah it still
flows into there it doesn't flow out but

1026
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
flows into there it doesn't flow out but
 

1027
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,870
flows into there it doesn't flow out but
it flows in

1028
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:46,880

 

1029
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,390

that's weird and now it's stopped again

1030
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400
that's weird and now it's stopped again
 

1031
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,110
that's weird and now it's stopped again
huh okay so what is what's it doing over

1032
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
huh okay so what is what's it doing over
 

1033
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,470
huh okay so what is what's it doing over
here it's flowing

1034
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
here it's flowing
 

1035
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,909
here it's flowing
in and then flowing out so

1036
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
in and then flowing out so
 

1037
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,710
in and then flowing out so
yeah we still need to put slabs above

1038
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
yeah we still need to put slabs above
 

1039
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,470
yeah we still need to put slabs above
actually i was just trying this out some

1040
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
actually i was just trying this out some
 

1041
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,149
actually i was just trying this out some
more and it might only be a problem if

1042
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
more and it might only be a problem if
 

1043
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,230
more and it might only be a problem if
you're using a double chest because this

1044
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
you're using a double chest because this
 

1045
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,149
you're using a double chest because this
single chest is covered up

1046
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
single chest is covered up
 

1047
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,909
single chest is covered up
but the items are still flowing out of

1048
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
but the items are still flowing out of
 

1049
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,110
but the items are still flowing out of
it they're flowing in and out of it

1050
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
it they're flowing in and out of it
 

1051
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,070
it they're flowing in and out of it
so if we turn this into a double chest

1052
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
so if we turn this into a double chest
 

1053
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,710
so if we turn this into a double chest
it might just

1054
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
it might just
 

1055
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,909
it might just
stop no it didn't stop

1056
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919

 

1057
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,029

recover that now i think it's stopped

1058
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:25,039
recover that now i think it's stopped
 

1059
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,950
recover that now i think it's stopped
yeah now it's stopped

1060
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960

 

1061
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,630

now it started again okay interesting

1062
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
now it started again okay interesting
 

1063
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,549
now it started again okay interesting
yeah so i just uh put some upside down

1064
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
yeah so i just uh put some upside down
 

1065
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,149
yeah so i just uh put some upside down
nether brick stairs here

1066
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
nether brick stairs here
 

1067
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,390
nether brick stairs here
so this should all work fine still and

1068
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
so this should all work fine still and
 

1069
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,630
so this should all work fine still and
hopefully it's not too much nether brick

1070
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:40,640
hopefully it's not too much nether brick
 

1071
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,270
hopefully it's not too much nether brick
um now i think what we'll do is work on

1072
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
um now i think what we'll do is work on
 

1073
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,789
um now i think what we'll do is work on
this middle part this is going to be

1074
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
this middle part this is going to be
 

1075
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,549
this middle part this is going to be
tricky because we got all this redstone

1076
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:46,559
tricky because we got all this redstone
 

1077
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,230
tricky because we got all this redstone
stuff here i don't know

1078
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
stuff here i don't know
 

1079
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,070
stuff here i don't know
how well we'll be able to cover this up

1080
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
how well we'll be able to cover this up
 

1081
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,029
how well we'll be able to cover this up
without breaking it you know

1082
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
without breaking it you know
 

1083
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,149
without breaking it you know
i think we'll put some stairs here this

1084
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:56,159
i think we'll put some stairs here this
 

1085
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,830
i think we'll put some stairs here this
will keep this in the middle yeah that's

1086
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
will keep this in the middle yeah that's
 

1087
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,870
will keep this in the middle yeah that's
good

1088
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:58,880
good
 

1089
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,110
good
and probably gonna have to throw a slab

1090
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
and probably gonna have to throw a slab
 

1091
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,750
and probably gonna have to throw a slab
in over here

1092
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
in over here
 

1093
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,590
in over here
and let's let's bring some more of this

1094
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,600
and let's let's bring some more of this
 

1095
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,110
and let's let's bring some more of this
uh this pink stuff

1096
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,120
uh this pink stuff
 

1097
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,310
uh this pink stuff
light gray forward here does this cover

1098
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320
light gray forward here does this cover
 

1099
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,270
light gray forward here does this cover
up any redstone i think we're still good

1100
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,280
up any redstone i think we're still good
 

1101
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,230
up any redstone i think we're still good
over here we'll be fine too good um

1102
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
over here we'll be fine too good um
 

1103
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,510
over here we'll be fine too good um
yeah i kind of want to get rid of this

1104
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520
yeah i kind of want to get rid of this
 

1105
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,510
yeah i kind of want to get rid of this
over here though

1106
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
over here though
 

1107
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,710
over here though
hmm well let's just do the best we can

1108
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:24,720
hmm well let's just do the best we can
 

1109
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,669
hmm well let's just do the best we can
for right now

1110
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679
for right now
 

1111
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,270
for right now
so what i wanted to do was use fire

1112
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
so what i wanted to do was use fire
 

1113
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,390
so what i wanted to do was use fire
as sort of a decorative thing here i

1114
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
as sort of a decorative thing here i
 

1115
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,230
as sort of a decorative thing here i
think we can get rid of these two pieces

1116
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,240
think we can get rid of these two pieces
 

1117
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,669
think we can get rid of these two pieces
put puts another rack there

1118
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:39,679
put puts another rack there
 

1119
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,590
put puts another rack there
do it like that and i want another piece

1120
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600
do it like that and i want another piece
 

1121
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,110
do it like that and i want another piece
over here

1122
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
over here
 

1123
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,470
over here
i'll probably just have to like redo

1124
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:44,480
i'll probably just have to like redo
 

1125
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,950
i'll probably just have to like redo
this this elevator a little bit

1126
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:46,960
this this elevator a little bit
 

1127
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,230
this this elevator a little bit
because all this stuff's in the way

1128
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
because all this stuff's in the way
 

1129
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,149
because all this stuff's in the way
yeah let's try it like that i think

1130
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:52,159
yeah let's try it like that i think
 

1131
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,830
yeah let's try it like that i think
that's the shape i wanted

1132
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
that's the shape i wanted
 

1133
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,430
that's the shape i wanted
so we'll light this and just get an idea

1134
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
so we'll light this and just get an idea
 

1135
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,310
so we'll light this and just get an idea
of how that feels

1136
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,320

 

1137
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,590

kind of that incrementing fire look

1138
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600

 

1139
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,070

i like it i like it a lot we'll put a

1140
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,080
i like it i like it a lot we'll put a
 

1141
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,590
i like it i like it a lot we'll put a
stair

1142
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
stair
 

1143
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,789
stair
above here

1144
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
above here
 

1145
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,510
above here
i wonder if we can get rid of that too

1146
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:15,520
i wonder if we can get rid of that too
 

1147
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,110
i wonder if we can get rid of that too
this uh this thing's not going to work

1148
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,120
this uh this thing's not going to work
 

1149
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,310
this uh this thing's not going to work
afterwards is it

1150
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,320

 

1151
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,390

even after like we we try to fix it it

1152
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,400
even after like we we try to fix it it
 

1153
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,909
even after like we we try to fix it it
might not be possible to do what we're

1154
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:23,919
might not be possible to do what we're
 

1155
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,190
might not be possible to do what we're
doing here

1156
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:25,200
doing here
 

1157
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,470
doing here
i'll have to mess around with it off

1158
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,480
i'll have to mess around with it off
 

1159
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,230
i'll have to mess around with it off
camera probably

1160
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,240
camera probably
 

1161
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,990
camera probably
okay can we put this here

1162
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
okay can we put this here
 

1163
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,470
okay can we put this here
probably not probably not let's just get

1164
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,480
probably not probably not let's just get
 

1165
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,669
probably not probably not let's just get
it the way i want it to look though and

1166
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:35,679
it the way i want it to look though and
 

1167
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:35,990
it the way i want it to look though and
then

1168
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
then
 

1169
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,230
then
i'll i'll try compromise later with it

1170
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,240
i'll i'll try compromise later with it
 

1171
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,350
i'll i'll try compromise later with it
okay that has to go

1172
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
okay that has to go
 

1173
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,029
okay that has to go
okay so i just did a couple more things

1174
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,039
okay so i just did a couple more things
 

1175
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,430
okay so i just did a couple more things
here got fire there and there now

1176
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
here got fire there and there now
 

1177
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,510
here got fire there and there now
i think that looks cool and we added in

1178
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,520
i think that looks cool and we added in
 

1179
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,830
i think that looks cool and we added in
a trim that goes around the fire

1180
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
a trim that goes around the fire
 

1181
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,510
a trim that goes around the fire
which is a little bit wonky i think

1182
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,520
which is a little bit wonky i think
 

1183
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,110
which is a little bit wonky i think
because there's corners

1184
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,120
because there's corners
 

1185
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,149
because there's corners
there and there but if we didn't have

1186
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:58,159
there and there but if we didn't have
 

1187
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,669
there and there but if we didn't have
those it would be a perfect triangle and

1188
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
those it would be a perfect triangle and
 

1189
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,950
those it would be a perfect triangle and
that might look a little weird too

1190
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,960
that might look a little weird too
 

1191
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,230
that might look a little weird too
i don't know maybe i should have rounded

1192
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,240
i don't know maybe i should have rounded
 

1193
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,990
i don't know maybe i should have rounded
this a bit more

1194
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,000
this a bit more
 

1195
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,590
this a bit more
but it's fine we'll live with it put

1196
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600
but it's fine we'll live with it put
 

1197
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,270
but it's fine we'll live with it put
some brick in over here just for

1198
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,280
some brick in over here just for
 

1199
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,710
some brick in over here just for
variation

1200
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,720
variation
 

1201
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,789
variation
and i want to put some torches at the

1202
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
and i want to put some torches at the
 

1203
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,590
and i want to put some torches at the
front here like some fire torches

1204
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:15,600
front here like some fire torches
 

1205
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,350
front here like some fire torches
maybe like right in the center

1206
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
maybe like right in the center
 

1207
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,110
maybe like right in the center
here we'll keep them fairly short too so

1208
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
here we'll keep them fairly short too so
 

1209
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,870
here we'll keep them fairly short too so
we'll light the fire here

1210
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
we'll light the fire here
 

1211
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,310
we'll light the fire here
and then let's try put some stairs

1212
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
and then let's try put some stairs
 

1213
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,390
and then let's try put some stairs
around that

1214
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
around that
 

1215
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,590
around that
like so and i think that'll be good

1216
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
like so and i think that'll be good
 

1217
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,110
like so and i think that'll be good
so i think it's far enough out of the

1218
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
so i think it's far enough out of the
 

1219
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,830
so i think it's far enough out of the
way here it's not going to block our

1220
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:34,840
way here it's not going to block our
 

1221
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,470
way here it's not going to block our
vision

1222
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
vision
 

1223
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,390
vision
yep i like these a lot actually these

1224
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400
yep i like these a lot actually these
 

1225
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,590
yep i like these a lot actually these
torches here so we're going to leave

1226
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600
torches here so we're going to leave
 

1227
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,549
torches here so we're going to leave
those in

1228
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
those in
 

1229
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,230
those in
and then the last part of this guys is

1230
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,240
and then the last part of this guys is
 

1231
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,669
and then the last part of this guys is
we just got to fill in the walls here

1232
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
we just got to fill in the walls here
 

1233
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,029
we just got to fill in the walls here
all these empty spaces

1234
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:45,039
all these empty spaces
 

1235
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,430
all these empty spaces
with this gray clay and hopefully that

1236
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
with this gray clay and hopefully that
 

1237
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,430
with this gray clay and hopefully that
looks okay

1238
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,440
looks okay
 

1239
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,590
looks okay
i'm gonna try curve it in kind of like

1240
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,600
i'm gonna try curve it in kind of like
 

1241
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,830
i'm gonna try curve it in kind of like
an igloo too i think

1242
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:53,840
an igloo too i think
 

1243
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,070
an igloo too i think
uh the outside of this building is going

1244
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,080
uh the outside of this building is going
 

1245
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,510
uh the outside of this building is going
to be another challenge though and i

1246
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
to be another challenge though and i
 

1247
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,230
to be another challenge though and i
think we'll save that for another day

1248
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240
think we'll save that for another day
 

1249
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,510
think we'll save that for another day
because i don't know what to do with it

1250
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
because i don't know what to do with it
 

1251
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,909
because i don't know what to do with it
at the moment but we'll curve this in

1252
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:03,919
at the moment but we'll curve this in
 

1253
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,110
at the moment but we'll curve this in
like an igloo

1254
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
like an igloo
 

1255
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,190
like an igloo
and then probably put in a glass roof

1256
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
and then probably put in a glass roof
 

1257
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,789
and then probably put in a glass roof
too so

1258
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:08,799
too so
 

1259
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,710
too so
i have trouble building roofs and that

1260
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,720
i have trouble building roofs and that
 

1261
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,070
i have trouble building roofs and that
would be a nice easy thing i'll let

1262
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,080
would be a nice easy thing i'll let
 

1263
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,990
would be a nice easy thing i'll let
light into the room too

1264
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
light into the room too
 

1265
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,710
light into the room too
so let's let's see how this looks after

1266
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720
so let's let's see how this looks after
 

1267
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,190
so let's let's see how this looks after
i finish shaping it here

1268
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
i finish shaping it here
 

1269
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,710
i finish shaping it here
it's always good to take a moment like

1270
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
it's always good to take a moment like
 

1271
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,549
it's always good to take a moment like
when you're building does this side

1272
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:22,559
when you're building does this side
 

1273
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,990
when you're building does this side
match the side

1274
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,000
match the side
 

1275
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,549
match the side
uh i think they're okay i think we can

1276
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
uh i think they're okay i think we can
 

1277
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:32,410
uh i think they're okay i think we can
continue here

1278
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:32,420
continue here
 

1279
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,430
continue here
[Music]

1280
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440

style than anything i've done before so
 

1289
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,669
style than anything i've done before so
it was

1290
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:45,679
it was
 

1291
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,230
it was
it was a good uh fun fun build for me

1292
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,240
it was a good uh fun fun build for me
 

1293
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,350
it was a good uh fun fun build for me
anyways

1294
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
anyways
 

1295
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,789
anyways
uh let's go ahead and sleep here real

1296
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:50,799
uh let's go ahead and sleep here real
 

1297
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,950
uh let's go ahead and sleep here real
quick so we got the skylight in the

1298
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
quick so we got the skylight in the
 

1299
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,710
quick so we got the skylight in the
roof by the way so it's gonna let light

1300
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
roof by the way so it's gonna let light
 

1301
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,549
roof by the way so it's gonna let light
in you don't have to put torches on the

1302
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
in you don't have to put torches on the
 

1303
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,470
in you don't have to put torches on the
ground or anything like that

1304
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,480
ground or anything like that
 

1305
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,470
ground or anything like that
the fire probably does light it up

1306
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
the fire probably does light it up
 

1307
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,710
the fire probably does light it up
fairly decently at night actually

1308
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720
fairly decently at night actually
 

1309
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,350
fairly decently at night actually
but there will be some dark spots i know

1310
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,360
but there will be some dark spots i know
 

1311
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,190
but there will be some dark spots i know
um so we got our window here to look

1312
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
um so we got our window here to look
 

1313
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,990
um so we got our window here to look
outside

1314
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
outside
 

1315
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,510
outside
this is gonna get filled in with grass

1316
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:09,520
this is gonna get filled in with grass
 

1317
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,510
this is gonna get filled in with grass
this hole here and then we'll be able to

1318
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
this hole here and then we'll be able to
 

1319
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,190
this hole here and then we'll be able to
look down at the minecart stuff over

1320
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,200
look down at the minecart stuff over
 

1321
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,430
look down at the minecart stuff over
here so it's like a

1322
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,440
here so it's like a
 

1323
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,310
here so it's like a
a window down below and a window outside

1324
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
a window down below and a window outside
 

1325
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,310
a window down below and a window outside
two windows in one

1326
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,320
two windows in one
 

1327
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,830
two windows in one
we should change out some of that stone

1328
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
we should change out some of that stone
 

1329
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,630
we should change out some of that stone
brick there or the stone with the

1330
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:24,640
brick there or the stone with the
 

1331
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,269
brick there or the stone with the
clay or something that looks a bit nicer
