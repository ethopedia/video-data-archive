let's see what do we gotta do and the
 

177
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,710
let's see what do we gotta do and the
idea with that is we were gonna use

178
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
idea with that is we were gonna use
 

179
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,110
idea with that is we were gonna use
these

180
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
these
 

181
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,270
these
three other variables to calculate how

182
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
three other variables to calculate how
 

183
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,230
three other variables to calculate how
much to add or subtract to that one

184
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
much to add or subtract to that one
 

185
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,510
much to add or subtract to that one
um and to do that

186
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
um and to do that
 

187
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,710
um and to do that
is going to be a little tough i'll be

188
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
is going to be a little tough i'll be
 

189
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,030
is going to be a little tough i'll be
honest

190
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
honest
 

191
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,430
honest
i thought i had some blocks maybe not

192
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
i thought i had some blocks maybe not
 

193
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,350
i thought i had some blocks maybe not
let's go over here first let's let's try

194
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
let's go over here first let's let's try
 

195
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,469
let's go over here first let's let's try
to work this out

196
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
to work this out
 

197
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,990
to work this out
i messed around with it a bit in

198
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
i messed around with it a bit in
 

199
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,790
i messed around with it a bit in
creative see how much i can

200
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
creative see how much i can
 

201
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,950
creative see how much i can
figure out based off of that um

202
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
figure out based off of that um
 

203
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,390
figure out based off of that um
gonna want this to go oh i wonder if

204
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
gonna want this to go oh i wonder if
 

205
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,110
gonna want this to go oh i wonder if
that's gonna power

206
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
that's gonna power
 

207
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,469
that's gonna power
that though oh no we will go like this

208
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
that though oh no we will go like this
 

209
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,670
that though oh no we will go like this
go over two three

210
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
go over two three
 

211
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,230
go over two three
four five uh we'll have to tear this out

212
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
four five uh we'll have to tear this out
 

213
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,590
four five uh we'll have to tear this out
i guess

214
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
i guess
 

215
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,070
i guess
we're gonna put the wire this way

216
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
we're gonna put the wire this way
 

217
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,430
we're gonna put the wire this way
all right and

218
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440

 

219
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,390

um maybe we'll hop into my creative

220
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
um maybe we'll hop into my creative
 

221
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,790
um maybe we'll hop into my creative
world

222
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
world
 

223
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,110
world
and just see what i built before give

224
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
and just see what i built before give
 

225
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,830
and just see what i built before give
you a better idea of what we're doing

226
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840

 

227
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,070

okay guys we have hopped over to a

228
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
okay guys we have hopped over to a
 

229
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,270
okay guys we have hopped over to a
creative world now

230
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
creative world now
 

231
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,469
creative world now
and i'm not gonna lie this is

232
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
and i'm not gonna lie this is
 

233
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,390
and i'm not gonna lie this is
i've i've strapped the recording over 10

234
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
i've i've strapped the recording over 10
 

235
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,710
i've i've strapped the recording over 10
times now i keep trying to explain this

236
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
times now i keep trying to explain this
 

237
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,870
times now i keep trying to explain this
and i keep failing over and over and

238
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
and i keep failing over and over and
 

239
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,270
and i keep failing over and over and
it's

240
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
it's
 

241
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,950
it's
frustrating this time though

242
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
frustrating this time though
 

243
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,629
frustrating this time though
we i've done something different this

244
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
we i've done something different this
 

245
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,390
we i've done something different this
time i actually completed this thing i

246
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
time i actually completed this thing i
 

247
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,830
time i actually completed this thing i
decided to just

248
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
decided to just
 

249
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,830
decided to just
finish it so i can actually show you it

250
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
finish it so i can actually show you it
 

251
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,670
finish it so i can actually show you it
working and maybe i'll be

252
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
working and maybe i'll be
 

253
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,710
working and maybe i'll be
able to explain it this time let's hope

254
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
able to explain it this time let's hope
 

255
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,550
able to explain it this time let's hope
uh we'll power through here um

256
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
uh we'll power through here um
 

257
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,629
uh we'll power through here um
basically what we got to do is figure

258
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
basically what we got to do is figure
 

259
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,189
basically what we got to do is figure
out the change to our health stat every

260
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
out the change to our health stat every
 

261
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,469
out the change to our health stat every
update right

262
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
update right
 

263
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,430
update right
and that's going to be our weight

264
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
and that's going to be our weight
 

265
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,749
and that's going to be our weight
variable plus our happiness variable

266
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
variable plus our happiness variable
 

267
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,710
variable plus our happiness variable
plus our hunger one equals the change to

268
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
plus our hunger one equals the change to
 

269
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,830
plus our hunger one equals the change to
our health one

270
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
our health one
 

271
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,390
our health one
and our health one is being represented

272
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
and our health one is being represented
 

273
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,309
and our health one is being represented
here by these two droppers

274
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
here by these two droppers
 

275
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,710
here by these two droppers
so either items are gonna flow from this

276
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
so either items are gonna flow from this
 

277
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,150
so either items are gonna flow from this
one into this one

278
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
one into this one
 

279
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,710
one into this one
if that is addition that would be

280
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
if that is addition that would be
 

281
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,749
if that is addition that would be
addition

282
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
addition
 

283
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,749
addition
uh items will flow from this one to this

284
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
uh items will flow from this one to this
 

285
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,110
uh items will flow from this one to this
one if it's subtraction so

286
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
one if it's subtraction so
 

287
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,309
one if it's subtraction so
if there's less items in this

288
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
if there's less items in this
 

289
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,830
if there's less items in this
fewer lights will be on like you can see

290
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
fewer lights will be on like you can see
 

291
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,430
fewer lights will be on like you can see
if i take these out

292
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
if i take these out
 

293
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,990
if i take these out
no lights are on anymore so

294
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
no lights are on anymore so
 

295
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,430
no lights are on anymore so
that's what we're doing here each of the

296
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
that's what we're doing here each of the
 

297
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,870
that's what we're doing here each of the
variables

298
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
variables
 

299
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,749
variables
has this possible change weights will be

300
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
has this possible change weights will be
 

301
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,629
has this possible change weights will be
either

302
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
either
 

303
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,070
either
minus two items uh in those

304
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
minus two items uh in those
 

305
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,350
minus two items uh in those
in those dropper combos or minus one or

306
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
in those dropper combos or minus one or
 

307
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,189
in those dropper combos or minus one or
zero happiness will be

308
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
zero happiness will be
 

309
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,270
zero happiness will be
will range from negative two negative

310
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
will range from negative two negative
 

311
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,230
will range from negative two negative
one zero

312
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
one zero
 

313
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,670
one zero
plus one plus two hunger the same

314
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
plus one plus two hunger the same
 

315
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,350
plus one plus two hunger the same
so the absolute minimum

316
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
so the absolute minimum
 

317
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,670
so the absolute minimum
or most you can subtract per update will

318
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
or most you can subtract per update will
 

319
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,029
or most you can subtract per update will
be

320
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
be
 

321
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,710
be
negative two negative two negative two

322
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
negative two negative two negative two
 

323
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,309
negative two negative two negative two
which is negative six

324
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
which is negative six
 

325
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,390
which is negative six
and the most you can add is zero plus

326
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
and the most you can add is zero plus
 

327
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,869
and the most you can add is zero plus
two plus two which would be

328
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
two plus two which would be
 

329
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,110
two plus two which would be
plus four so somewhere within that range

330
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
plus four so somewhere within that range
 

331
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,469
plus four so somewhere within that range
depending on the others

332
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:58,479
depending on the others
 

333
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,589
depending on the others
i'm failing i can feel it depending on

334
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
i'm failing i can feel it depending on
 

335
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,869
i'm failing i can feel it depending on
on the other variables it will determine

336
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
on the other variables it will determine
 

337
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,430
on the other variables it will determine
the change okay so we got to send out

338
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
the change okay so we got to send out
 

339
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,869
the change okay so we got to send out
different number of pulses to this

340
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
different number of pulses to this
 

341
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,309
different number of pulses to this
depending on

342
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
depending on
 

343
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,309
depending on
this the status of our other variables

344

this the status of our other variables
 

345
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,150
this the status of our other variables
and that's what this thing does here

346
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
and that's what this thing does here
 

347
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,749
and that's what this thing does here
this is

348
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
this is
 

349
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,790
this is
uh this i came up with this is what i

350
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
uh this i came up with this is what i
 

351
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,510
uh this i came up with this is what i
would call

352
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
would call
 

353
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,150
would call
a variable pulse extender depending on

354
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
a variable pulse extender depending on
 

355
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,629
a variable pulse extender depending on
how far this reaches like pretend this

356
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
how far this reaches like pretend this
 

357
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,189
how far this reaches like pretend this
is our hunger variable this thing here

358
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
is our hunger variable this thing here
 

359
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,350
is our hunger variable this thing here
depending on how far the power goes

360
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
depending on how far the power goes
 

361
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,709
depending on how far the power goes
it'll either go up to here

362
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
it'll either go up to here
 

363
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,230
it'll either go up to here
here here or here or here uh

364
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
here here or here or here uh
 

365
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,949
here here or here or here uh
every step further it goes the pulse on

366
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
every step further it goes the pulse on
 

367
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:39,670
every step further it goes the pulse on
this

368
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
this
 

369
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,990
this
wire here gets longer and longer because

370
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
wire here gets longer and longer because
 

371
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,589
wire here gets longer and longer because
these repeaters

372
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
these repeaters
 

373
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,030
these repeaters
there's more and more ticks to them

374
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
there's more and more ticks to them
 

375
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,350
there's more and more ticks to them
right and then that goes into

376
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
right and then that goes into
 

377
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,990
right and then that goes into
our comparator here we're using this

378
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
our comparator here we're using this
 

379
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,870
our comparator here we're using this
trick

380
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880

 

381
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,670

where it loops back to itself and it

382
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
where it loops back to itself and it
 

383
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,350
where it loops back to itself and it
does a quick pulse

384
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
does a quick pulse
 

385
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,670
does a quick pulse
the longer we power this the more pulses

386
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
the longer we power this the more pulses
 

387
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,990
the longer we power this the more pulses
we get out of it right

388
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
we get out of it right
 

389
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,710
we get out of it right
so the more power the longer this is

390
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
so the more power the longer this is
 

391
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,150
so the more power the longer this is
powered the more pulses we get out of

392
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
powered the more pulses we get out of
 

393
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,430
powered the more pulses we get out of
this and this goes to

394
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
this and this goes to
 

395
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,710
this and this goes to

one of the cool or useful tricks i got

400
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
one of the cool or useful tricks i got
 

401
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,509

402
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
from you guys
 

403
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,829
from you guys
is you told me i should just always

404
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839
is you told me i should just always
 

405
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,310
is you told me i should just always
subtract

406
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
subtract
 

407
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,269
subtract
um and then do the addition afterwards

408
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
um and then do the addition afterwards
 

409
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,269
um and then do the addition afterwards
so that's what i'm doing here

410
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
so that's what i'm doing here
 

411
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,710
so that's what i'm doing here
every update i will subtract

412
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
every update i will subtract
 

413
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,949
every update i will subtract
6 from it but since we're only dealing

414
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
6 from it but since we're only dealing
 

415
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,630
6 from it but since we're only dealing
with one variable here

416
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
with one variable here
 

417
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,949
with one variable here
i'm only subtracting two so if i press

418
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
i'm only subtracting two so if i press
 

419
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,010

addition so

426
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
addition so
 

427
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,990
addition so
we subtracted two and added two or in

428
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
we subtracted two and added two or in
 

429
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,230
we subtracted two and added two or in

00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
okay but depending on how far this

there's only 32 items in
 

441
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,990
there's only 32 items in
you can see it only made it up to the

442
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
you can see it only made it up to the
 

443
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,750
you can see it only made it up to the

445
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,150

so it's subtracted to an added none so

446
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
so it's subtracted to an added none so
 

447
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,829
so it's subtracted to an added none so
this is going down by two every time

uh we're about done here i think i think
you get the point

474
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
you get the point
 

475
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,230
you get the point
now it's at 50. so this is our how we're

476
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
now it's at 50. so this is our how we're
 

477
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,910
now it's at 50. so this is our how we're

adding and subtracting
 

479
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,269

to our health stats okay uh what was i

480
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
to our health stats okay uh what was i
 

481
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,710
to our health stats okay uh what was i
going to say so

482
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
going to say so
 

483
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,269

00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:57,829
at one light here there's no change at
this

486
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:57,839
this
 

487
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,870
this
at this level this one it adds one this

488
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
at this level this one it adds one this
 

489
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,389
at this level this one it adds one this
one adds two

490
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
one adds two
 

491
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,030
one adds two
so that's three this adds four and it's

492
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
so that's three this adds four and it's
 

493
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,310
so that's three this adds four and it's
guaranteed

minus two every update as well per stat
 

497
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,710
minus two every update as well per stat
okay i'm gonna do it okay

498
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
okay i'm gonna do it okay
 

499
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,069
okay i'm gonna do it okay
it's gonna be really boring to watch me

500
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
it's gonna be really boring to watch me
 

501
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,230
it's gonna be really boring to watch me
so i think i'll just do it off camera

502
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
so i think i'll just do it off camera
 

503
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:26,230
so i think i'll just do it off camera
and i'll be right back

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240

 

505
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,030

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
the whole build by far
 

515
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,710
the whole build by far
and now that we got this figured out

516
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
and now that we got this figured out
 

517
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,550
and now that we got this figured out
it's going to be smooth sailing because

518
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
it's going to be smooth sailing because
 

519
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,870
it's going to be smooth sailing because
i

520
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
i
 

521
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,190
i
i know how to do the rest of it so it's

522
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
i know how to do the rest of it so it's
 

523
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,069
i know how to do the rest of it so it's
good to get this out of the way

524
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
good to get this out of the way
 

525
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,829
good to get this out of the way
and we got one of these for each of the

526
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
and we got one of these for each of the
 

527
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,430
and we got one of these for each of the
variables this

528
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
variables this
 

529
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,389
variables this
this top one is for the happiness bottom

530
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
this top one is for the happiness bottom
 

531
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,470
this top one is for the happiness bottom
one is for the hunger

532
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
one is for the hunger
 

533
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,590
one is for the hunger
we got another one for weights

534
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
we got another one for weights
 

535
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,190
we got another one for weights
over here which we do a little

536
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
over here which we do a little
 

537
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,710
over here which we do a little
differently because i want a different

538
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
differently because i want a different
 

539
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,710
differently because i want a different
mechanic to it

540
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
mechanic to it
 

541
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,190
mechanic to it
um they're not fully done yet we still

542
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
um they're not fully done yet we still
 

543
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,910
um they're not fully done yet we still
have to

544
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
have to
 

545
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,069
have to
run some more wire we'll do it later

546
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
run some more wire we'll do it later
 

547
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,190
run some more wire we'll do it later
though

548
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
though
 

549
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,790
though
so

550
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800

 

551
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,949

our clock for this whole thing our our

552
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
our clock for this whole thing our our
 

553
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:15,910
our clock for this whole thing our our
update

554
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
update
 

555
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,670
update
will send a pulse to these pistons

556
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
will send a pulse to these pistons
 

557
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,190
will send a pulse to these pistons
we can't do them at the same time we'll

558
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200
we can't do them at the same time we'll
 

559
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,269
we can't do them at the same time we'll
have to have a delay between the two

560
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
have to have a delay between the two
 

561
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,150
have to have a delay between the two
but when they extend they will

562
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
but when they extend they will
 

563
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,550
but when they extend they will
make this stuff run goes to the pulsar

564
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
make this stuff run goes to the pulsar
 

565
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,870
make this stuff run goes to the pulsar
which both layers meet up here

566
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
which both layers meet up here
 

567
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,110
which both layers meet up here
then we got to run this to the addition

568
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
then we got to run this to the addition
 

569
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,030
then we got to run this to the addition
line on the health variable

570
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
line on the health variable
 

571
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,949
line on the health variable
over here

572
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959

 

573
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,509

just start to set it up here i think

574
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
just start to set it up here i think
 

575
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,310
just start to set it up here i think
this one

576
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
this one
 

577
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,790
this one
this one yeah and that will

578
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
this one yeah and that will
 

579
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,509
this one yeah and that will
that will make the items flow from one

580
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
that will make the items flow from one
 

581
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,470
that will make the items flow from one
to the other

582
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
to the other
 

583
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,470
to the other
actually i think i got these reversed

584
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
actually i think i got these reversed
 

585
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,110
actually i think i got these reversed
now i look at it

586
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
now i look at it
 

587
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,550
now i look at it
because yeah if items are going from

588
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
because yeah if items are going from
 

589
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,910
because yeah if items are going from
here to here

590
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920

 

591
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,790

this is getting shorter so yeah i did

592
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
this is getting shorter so yeah i did
 

593
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,990
this is getting shorter so yeah i did
that reversed we'll have to change

594
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
that reversed we'll have to change
 

595
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,509
that reversed we'll have to change
that yeah okay

596
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
that yeah okay
 

597
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,509
that yeah okay
um so we'll have to connect over to this

598
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
um so we'll have to connect over to this
 

599
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,470
um so we'll have to connect over to this
one

600
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
one
 

601
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,910
one
uh this was supposed to be the

602
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
uh this was supposed to be the
 

603
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,750
uh this was supposed to be the
subtraction thing but i'll have to

604
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
subtraction thing but i'll have to
 

605
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,269
subtraction thing but i'll have to
change this too if i got that wrong

606
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
change this too if i got that wrong
 

607
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,350
change this too if i got that wrong
this will make six items flow out

608
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,360
this will make six items flow out
 

609
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,269
this will make six items flow out
so if that's at 16

610
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279

 

611
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,269

it sends six pulses and it goes down to

612
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
it sends six pulses and it goes down to
 

613
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,750
it sends six pulses and it goes down to
ten and then we add in that other stuff

614
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
ten and then we add in that other stuff
 

615
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,069
ten and then we add in that other stuff
and it all figures itself out

616
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079

 

617
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,150

we got the mushroom farm up over this
 

649
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,230
we got the mushroom farm up over this
way which we haven't finished either

650
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
way which we haven't finished either
 

651
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,470
way which we haven't finished either
so many unfinished projects we'll get to

652
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
so many unfinished projects we'll get to
 

653
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,509
so many unfinished projects we'll get to
it

654
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
it
 

655
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,189
it
and we're i think i'm i want to add some

656
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
and we're i think i'm i want to add some
 

657
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,110
and we're i think i'm i want to add some
more stuff over here too

more stuff over here too
now that we got all these things going

660
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
now that we got all these things going
 

661
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,310
now that we got all these things going
on

662
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320
on
 

663
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,990
on
we should maybe finish up this area a

664
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
we should maybe finish up this area a
 

665
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,069
we should maybe finish up this area a
bit better

666
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,079
bit better
 

667
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,389
bit better
um this was actually going to be the

668
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
um this was actually going to be the
 

669
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,990
um this was actually going to be the
first place i was going to work on when

670
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
first place i was going to work on when
 

671
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,910
first place i was going to work on when
i started this world and i just

672
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
i started this world and i just
 

673
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,430
i started this world and i just
left it like this and started working

674
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
left it like this and started working
 

675
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,269
left it like this and started working
over here first instead

676
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
over here first instead
 

677
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,949
over here first instead
but the plan since i want to

678
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
but the plan since i want to
 

679
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,990
but the plan since i want to
shape or keep the shape of the original

680
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
shape or keep the shape of the original
 

681
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,150
shape or keep the shape of the original
cave as much as i can i always felt

682
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,160
cave as much as i can i always felt
 

683
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,230
cave as much as i can i always felt
i should have a pool of water here that

684
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
i should have a pool of water here that
 

685
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,230
i should have a pool of water here that
we can walk around like go

686
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
we can walk around like go
 

687
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,030
we can walk around like go
go around like this and then get to the

688
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
go around like this and then get to the
 

689
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,710
go around like this and then get to the
other side or

690
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
other side or
 

691
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,230
other side or
have other paths that go from that

692
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
have other paths that go from that
 

693
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,910
have other paths that go from that
this will be like an intersection

694
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
this will be like an intersection
 

695
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,069
this will be like an intersection
basically

696
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
basically
 

697
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,189
basically
um let's get some wood

698
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
um let's get some wood
 

699
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,030
um let's get some wood
and some fences and stuff i think i got

700
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,040
and some fences and stuff i think i got
 

701
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,550
and some fences and stuff i think i got
some around

702
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
some around
 

703
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,949
some around
and we'll just try lay it out a bit

704
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959

 

705
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,790

yeah we got some good fences

706
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800

 

707
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,110

okay get a snack

708
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
okay get a snack
 

709
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,150
okay get a snack
sounds like it's raining out there

710
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
sounds like it's raining out there
 

711
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,430
sounds like it's raining out there
this will probably help up too okay and

712
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
this will probably help up too okay and
 

713
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,110
this will probably help up too okay and
we'll just try lay out a shape

714
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
we'll just try lay out a shape
 

715
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,749
we'll just try lay out a shape
for our walk wave if we want to keep

716
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:43,759
for our walk wave if we want to keep
 

717
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,230
for our walk wave if we want to keep
this

718
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
this
 

719
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,990
this
design with the grass and the wood on

720
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
design with the grass and the wood on
 

721
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,230
design with the grass and the wood on
the sides um

722
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
the sides um
 

723
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,670
the sides um
i think that would be good

724
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680

 

725
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,670

come down

726
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
come down
 

727
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,030
come down
would be three blocks here so we could

728
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,040
would be three blocks here so we could
 

729
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,310
would be three blocks here so we could
start

730
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320
start
 

731
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,629
start
maybe putting it over here already

732
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639

 

733
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,189

let's try this out

734
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
let's try this out
 

735
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,310
let's try this out
and then we put fences on top of that

736
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,320

 

737
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,150

and then there'll be water down here

738
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
and then there'll be water down here
 

739
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,590
and then there'll be water down here
hopefully we'll do something fun with

740
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,600
hopefully we'll do something fun with
 

741
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,749
hopefully we'll do something fun with
that too not just a pool of water but

742
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
that too not just a pool of water but
 

743
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,110
that too not just a pool of water but
something cool

744
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
something cool
 

745
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,949
something cool
with it so if we come down the stairs

746
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:24,959
with it so if we come down the stairs
 

747
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,310
with it so if we come down the stairs
is that too sharp of a turn do you think

748
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
is that too sharp of a turn do you think
 

749
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:35,189
is that too sharp of a turn do you think
go left and then we'll walk around

750
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199

 

751
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,829

i think it'll be okay

752
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839

 

753
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,269

yeah that's that's quite a bit of space

754
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279
yeah that's that's quite a bit of space
 

755
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,189
yeah that's that's quite a bit of space
it's actually three and a half blocks

756
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
it's actually three and a half blocks
 

757
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,110
it's actually three and a half blocks
pretty much because of the fences

758
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120

 

759
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,870

then we'll go over here

760
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
then we'll go over here
 

761
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,949
then we'll go over here
it feels a little weird i'm not gonna

762
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
it feels a little weird i'm not gonna
 

763
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:53,910
it feels a little weird i'm not gonna
lie

764
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
lie
 

765
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,710
lie
to to change this area because it's been

766
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
to to change this area because it's been
 

767
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,189
to to change this area because it's been
this way ever since the beginning

768
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
this way ever since the beginning
 

769
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:06,069
this way ever since the beginning
and to change it almost feels wrong

770
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079

 

771
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,270

how's this look

772
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,280

 

773
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,990

but you know it needs to be done

774
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000

 

775
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,429

let me come up a little further first

776
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
let me come up a little further first
 

777
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,549
let me come up a little further first
i'm gonna go grab an axe

778
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559

 

779
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,590

there he goes those guys are so loud

780
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
there he goes those guys are so loud
 

781
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,710
there he goes those guys are so loud
like you can hear him

782
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:28,720
like you can hear him
 

783
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,310
like you can hear him
and he's so far away still can hear him

784
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,320
and he's so far away still can hear him
 

785
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,150
and he's so far away still can hear him
that's gotta be more than 16 blocks

786
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,160
that's gotta be more than 16 blocks
 

787
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,270
that's gotta be more than 16 blocks
come on uh

788
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
come on uh
 

789
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,750
come on uh
yeah we got got our axe here fix this up

790
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
yeah we got got our axe here fix this up
 

791
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,430
yeah we got got our axe here fix this up
um let's see

792
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
um let's see
 

793
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,630
um let's see
we might uh

794
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
we might uh
 

795
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,470
we might uh
i guess we should make it curve a little

796
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
i guess we should make it curve a little
 

797
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,549
i guess we should make it curve a little
more

798
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
more
 

799
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,150
more
i don't think we want it to come all the

800
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
i don't think we want it to come all the
 

801
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,669
i don't think we want it to come all the
way up to here it'll look

802
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:57,679
way up to here it'll look
 

803
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,150
way up to here it'll look
weird if it's really like narrow and

804
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
weird if it's really like narrow and
 

805
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,350
weird if it's really like narrow and
pointy because i

806
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
pointy because i
 

807
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,470
pointy because i
i feel it should connect

808
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,480
i feel it should connect
 

809
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,590
i feel it should connect
here like right here and that's yeah

810
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,600
here like right here and that's yeah
 

811
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,830
here like right here and that's yeah
it's the same height even

812
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
it's the same height even
 

813
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,789
it's the same height even
so like we'll mirror it on this side and

814
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799
so like we'll mirror it on this side and
 

815
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,230
so like we'll mirror it on this side and
the pool of water will be

816
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
the pool of water will be
 

817
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,470
the pool of water will be
in this in this section here

818
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480

 

819
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,950

so this would come up to

820
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:22,960

 

821
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,190

maybe what is that one more

822
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,200

 

823
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,750

come up to there and then it goes in

824
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:33,760

 

825
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,870

three blocks like that then

826
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
three blocks like that then
 

827
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:44,789
three blocks like that then
two we just got to make it meet up

828
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:44,799

 

829
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,029

how would that be that's a that's a

830
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
how would that be that's a that's a
 

831
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,190
how would that be that's a that's a
decent size of water i guess

832
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
decent size of water i guess
 

833
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,470
decent size of water i guess
if if we put it down there uh then this

834
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
if if we put it down there uh then this
 

835
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,029
if if we put it down there uh then this
will go

836
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
will go
 

837
00:18:53,039 --> 00:19:02,390
will go
to there and then probably like this

838
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400

 

839
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,230

these chests these have been here since

840
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
these chests these have been here since
 

841
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,230
these chests these have been here since
the beginning

842
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
the beginning
 

843
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,310
the beginning
and this is like my original items too

844
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
and this is like my original items too
 

845
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,669
and this is like my original items too
so it's gonna be

846
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
so it's gonna be
 

847
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,669
so it's gonna be
weird moving stuff but i think in the

848
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
weird moving stuff but i think in the
 

849
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,350
weird moving stuff but i think in the
long run i'm going to like it more

850
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
long run i'm going to like it more
 

851
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,549
long run i'm going to like it more
for sure just feeling

852
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
for sure just feeling
 

853
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,750
for sure just feeling
nostalgic about it i guess that's the

854

nostalgic about it i guess that's the
 

855
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,549
nostalgic about it i guess that's the
main reason

856
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559
main reason
 

857
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,150
main reason
i haven't touched this area because it's

858
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
i haven't touched this area because it's
 

859
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,990
i haven't touched this area because it's
been this way all all

860
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
been this way all all
 

861
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,350
been this way all all
along

862
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360

 

863
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,870

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
but these chests really need to be moved
 

865
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,430
but these chests really need to be moved

got a double chest plus i think
 

873
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,750
got a double chest plus i think
i think we got another one around here

874
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
i think we got another one around here
 

875
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,430
i think we got another one around here
or half of one yeah

876
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440

 

877
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,789

so much string this is my wooden slabs

878
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
so much string this is my wooden slabs
 

879
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,350
so much string this is my wooden slabs
these are the ones that don't burn

880
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
these are the ones that don't burn
 

881
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,070
these are the ones that don't burn
i made a bunch of them before the update

882
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
i made a bunch of them before the update
 

883
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,029
i made a bunch of them before the update
slime balls

884
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
slime balls
 

885
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,950
slime balls
oh man more wool

886
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
oh man more wool
 

887
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,630
oh man more wool
i wouldn't be surprised if i had another

888
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:02,640
i wouldn't be surprised if i had another
 

889
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,310
i wouldn't be surprised if i had another
stash somewhat too

890
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
stash somewhat too
 

891
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,549
stash somewhat too
also this is cobble and netherrack

892
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,559
also this is cobble and netherrack
 

893
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,149
also this is cobble and netherrack
though

894
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,159
though
 

895
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,149
though
gravel yeah so how would this be this

896
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,159
gravel yeah so how would this be this
 

897
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,270
gravel yeah so how would this be this
looks pretty good i would say

898
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280

 

899
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,110

so we'll keep this three wide we'll have

900
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,120
so we'll keep this three wide we'll have
 

901
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,110
so we'll keep this three wide we'll have
to move this a bit

902
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,120

 

903
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,110

then we'll make it go out this way for

904
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
then we'll make it go out this way for
 

905
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,230
then we'll make it go out this way for
sure

906
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,240
sure
 

907
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,350
sure
and probably

908
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,360

 

909
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,710

maybe another path going this way

910
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:34,720
maybe another path going this way
 

911
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,870
maybe another path going this way
um this is this is actually

912
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
um this is this is actually
 

913
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,070
um this is this is actually
a path i used to go down a lot down here

914
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
a path i used to go down a lot down here
 

915
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,190
a path i used to go down a lot down here
this goes to this one to my original

916
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,200
this goes to this one to my original
 

917
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,029
this goes to this one to my original
slime farm

918
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
slime farm
 

919
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,149
slime farm
over this way

920
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159

 

921
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:57,350

never come down here anymore whoa

922
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360

 

923
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,270

but yeah uh since we used to come down

924
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
but yeah uh since we used to come down
 

925
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,789
but yeah uh since we used to come down
here though i feel we should make a path

926
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:02,799
here though i feel we should make a path
 

927
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,110
here though i feel we should make a path
for it

928
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,120

 

929
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,549

that's the way the cave was originally

930
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
that's the way the cave was originally
 

931
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,590
that's the way the cave was originally
going

932
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600

 

933
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,549

where are we now up this way

934
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
where are we now up this way
 

935
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,149
where are we now up this way
no enderman that

936
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
no enderman that
 

937
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,110
no enderman that
this way right yeah

938
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120

 

939
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,590

so i think we'll have another path that

940
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
so i think we'll have another path that
 

941
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,070
so i think we'll have another path that
goes down here and it'll go underneath

942
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
goes down here and it'll go underneath
 

943
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,310
goes down here and it'll go underneath
the river i guess

944
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320

 

945
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,830

that'd be cool and that'll be our one of

946
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:35,840
that'd be cool and that'll be our one of
 

947
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,350
that'd be cool and that'll be our one of
our ways of getting down to that part of

948
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
our ways of getting down to that part of
 

949
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,470
our ways of getting down to that part of
the cave

950
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
the cave
 

951
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,390
the cave
and i want to have like a whirlpool

952
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:42,400
and i want to have like a whirlpool
 

953
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,950
and i want to have like a whirlpool
in in the water here that we can jump

954
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:44,960
in in the water here that we can jump
 

955
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,549
in in the water here that we can jump
down potentially

956
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
down potentially
 

957
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,750
down potentially
to get down quickly um

958
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
to get down quickly um
 

959
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,430
to get down quickly um
we'll have to have a way of getting out

960
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
we'll have to have a way of getting out
 

961
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,430
we'll have to have a way of getting out
of here then

962
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
of here then
 

963
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,950
of here then
i wonder if i could jump that

964
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
i wonder if i could jump that
 

965
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,909
i wonder if i could jump that
i could it wouldn't be easy though

966
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:03,919

 

967
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,470

anyway that's a start to something

968
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
anyway that's a start to something
 

969
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,070
anyway that's a start to something
this will have to go

970
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,080
this will have to go
 

971
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,149
this will have to go
all of the paths have to be at least

972
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:14,159
all of the paths have to be at least
 

973
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,110
all of the paths have to be at least
three blocks or more

974
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,120
three blocks or more
 

975
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,789
three blocks or more
take that out um

976
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
take that out um
 

977
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,149
take that out um
yeah so uh uhc is out guys and so far

978
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
yeah so uh uhc is out guys and so far
 

979
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,390
yeah so uh uhc is out guys and so far
the response seems to be very favorable

980
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
the response seems to be very favorable
 

981
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,390
the response seems to be very favorable
from everyone which is good to see

982
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,400

 

983
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,390

it's always hard deciding what format to

984
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
it's always hard deciding what format to
 

985
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,669
it's always hard deciding what format to
do but the

986
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
do but the
 

987
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,830
do but the
the the quest to kill the ender dragon

988
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
the the quest to kill the ender dragon
 

989
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,710
the the quest to kill the ender dragon
seems to be

990
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,720
seems to be
 

991
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,830
seems to be
okay with people usually we do like

992
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
okay with people usually we do like
 

993
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,750
okay with people usually we do like
a season where we try to kill everyone

994
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
a season where we try to kill everyone
 

995
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,510
a season where we try to kill everyone
right so

996
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,520
right so
 

997
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,470
right so
it's good to see enderdragon went well

998
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:48,480
it's good to see enderdragon went well
 

999
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,270
it's good to see enderdragon went well
that was what

1000
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280
that was what
 

1001
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,669
that was what
uhc was originally about the first two

1002
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
uhc was originally about the first two
 

1003
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,029
uhc was originally about the first two
seasons

1004
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
seasons
 

1005
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,310
seasons
and it's kind of cool to go go back to

1006
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,320
and it's kind of cool to go go back to
 

1007
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,789
and it's kind of cool to go go back to
that

1008
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:56,799
that
 

1009
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,149
that
and have another enderdragon one

1010
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
and have another enderdragon one
 

1011
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,990
and have another enderdragon one
and it gives us a reason to have teams

1012
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,000
and it gives us a reason to have teams
 

1013
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,830
and it gives us a reason to have teams
it's nice working together in teams

1014
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
it's nice working together in teams
 

1015
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,630
it's nice working together in teams
for that kind of thing i think we should

1016
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
for that kind of thing i think we should
 

1017
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,950
for that kind of thing i think we should
have some stairs or something that go

1018
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
have some stairs or something that go
 

1019
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,549
have some stairs or something that go
down

1020
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:12,559
down
 

1021
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,070
down
at this point wooden stairs

1022
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,080
at this point wooden stairs
 

1023
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,990
at this point wooden stairs
let's get this back

1024
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,000

 

1025
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,549
