when building stuff around here so i
 

179
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,749
when building stuff around here so i
always thought i was gonna put the

180
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
always thought i was gonna put the
 

181
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,790
always thought i was gonna put the
storage room

182
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
storage room
 

183
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,189
storage room
in here this is just a rough storage

184
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
in here this is just a rough storage
 

185
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,710
in here this is just a rough storage
room at the moment

186
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
room at the moment
 

187
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,749
room at the moment
which is actually where most of my stuff

188
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
which is actually where most of my stuff
 

189
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,550
which is actually where most of my stuff
is

190
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
is
 

191
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,189
is
in this world although i do have a few

192
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
in this world although i do have a few
 

193
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,469
in this world although i do have a few
stashes

194
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
stashes
 

195
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,749
stashes
uh like one in the nether

196
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
uh like one in the nether
 

197
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,790
uh like one in the nether
one in the stronghold one in the end

198
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
one in the stronghold one in the end
 

199
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,029
one in the stronghold one in the end
uh the branch mine there's a bunch of

200
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
uh the branch mine there's a bunch of
 

201
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,749
uh the branch mine there's a bunch of
stuff there too now

202
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
stuff there too now
 

203
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,110
stuff there too now
but yeah i want to

204
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
but yeah i want to
 

205
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,950
but yeah i want to
get rid of this stuff here and have a

206
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
get rid of this stuff here and have a
 

207
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,629
get rid of this stuff here and have a
proper storage room somewhere around

208
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
proper storage room somewhere around
 

209
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,670
proper storage room somewhere around
here

210
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
here
 

211
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,550
here
but not like uh where everything is

212
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
but not like uh where everything is
 

213
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,230
but not like uh where everything is
stored just

214
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
stored just
 

215
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,150
stored just
little bits of all this all the things i

216
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
little bits of all this all the things i
 

217
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,029
little bits of all this all the things i
need and i've worked it out on paper and

218
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
need and i've worked it out on paper and
 

219
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,070
need and i've worked it out on paper and
i figure

220
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
i figure
 

221
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,110
i figure
for the storage room i can organize all

222
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
for the storage room i can organize all
 

223
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,430
for the storage room i can organize all
the items in minecraft into about 18

224
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
the items in minecraft into about 18
 

225
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,270
the items in minecraft into about 18
chests 18 double chests very

226
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
chests 18 double chests very
 

227
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,629
chests 18 double chests very
comfortably i think have a decent supply

228
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
comfortably i think have a decent supply
 

229
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,189
comfortably i think have a decent supply
of all the materials without

230
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
of all the materials without
 

231
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,150
of all the materials without
having trouble organizing them so

232
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160

 

233
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,270

i'm thinking first of all

234
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280

 

235
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,390

we will work on this quarter circle type

236
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
we will work on this quarter circle type
 

237
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,950
we will work on this quarter circle type
thing i wanted over here

238
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
thing i wanted over here
 

239
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,230
thing i wanted over here
storage room i'm thinking will go

240
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
storage room i'm thinking will go
 

241
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,070
storage room i'm thinking will go
in this wall somewhere we'll have to dig

242
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
in this wall somewhere we'll have to dig
 

243
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,270
in this wall somewhere we'll have to dig
it out

244
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
it out
 

245
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,029
it out
and i also want to have a bridge from

246
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
and i also want to have a bridge from
 

247
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,950
and i also want to have a bridge from
from over here to over there

248
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
from over here to over there
 

249
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,150
from over here to over there
would be cool too

250
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160

 

251
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,629

so that's the general general plan for

252
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
so that's the general general plan for
 

253
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,189
so that's the general general plan for
today we'll see how much we can get done

254
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
today we'll see how much we can get done
 

255
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,390
today we'll see how much we can get done
so first of all let's uh

256
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
so first of all let's uh
 

257
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,350
so first of all let's uh
work on this a bit i think i want

258
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360

 

259
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,950

regular wood maybe and

260
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
regular wood maybe and
 

261
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,350
regular wood maybe and
three wide staircase

262
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
three wide staircase
 

263
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,150
three wide staircase
like that to get up and then this will

264
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
like that to get up and then this will
 

265
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,390
like that to get up and then this will
continue with the regular wood

266
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
continue with the regular wood
 

267
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,710
continue with the regular wood
and we'll have to shape it kind of into

268
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
and we'll have to shape it kind of into
 

269
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,510
and we'll have to shape it kind of into
a quarter circle

270
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
a quarter circle
 

271
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,189
a quarter circle
somehow let's see

272
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199

 

273
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,029

it would be cool if it kind of over hung

274
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
it would be cool if it kind of over hung
 

275
00:06:53,039 --> 00:07:00,070
it would be cool if it kind of over hung
a little bit too

276
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080

 

277
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,110

and we'll just try shape it

278
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
and we'll just try shape it
 

279
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,189
and we'll just try shape it
freehand here um

280
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199

 

281
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,110

do that that

282
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120

 

283
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,550

so it goes two then one then one then

284
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
so it goes two then one then one then
 

285
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,070
so it goes two then one then one then
two

286
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080

 

287
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,589

let's see how close that looks to a

288
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
let's see how close that looks to a
 

289
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,950
let's see how close that looks to a
circle

290
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960

 

291
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,990

i did that right right

292
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000

 

293
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,430

um yeah that's right

294
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
um yeah that's right
 

295
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,749
um yeah that's right
let's see how it looks from down here is

296
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
let's see how it looks from down here is
 

297
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,350
let's see how it looks from down here is
it overhanging too much

298
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
it overhanging too much
 

299
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,150
it overhanging too much
maybe of course we'll probably end up

300
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
maybe of course we'll probably end up
 

301
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:50,950
maybe of course we'll probably end up
shaping that too

302
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960

 

303
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,390

okay well let's just say that's the

304
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
okay well let's just say that's the
 

305
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,629
okay well let's just say that's the
shape for now

306
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
shape for now
 

307
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,189
shape for now
then this will come up to here we're

308
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
then this will come up to here we're
 

309
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,150
then this will come up to here we're
going to put fences

310
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
going to put fences
 

311
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,510
going to put fences
around there too

312
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520

 

313
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,350

see how that looks

314
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360

 

315
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,510

so the bridge will probably

316
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520

 

317
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,070

uh go out from here to there

318
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080

 

319
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,270

so yeah right here

320
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
so yeah right here
 

321
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,909
so yeah right here
and we'll probably make it three wide

322
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
and we'll probably make it three wide
 

323
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,390
and we'll probably make it three wide
would probably be good i'm saying

324
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
would probably be good i'm saying
 

325
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,430
would probably be good i'm saying
probably a lot aren't i

326
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
probably a lot aren't i
 

327
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,389
probably a lot aren't i
what's that doing there

328
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399

 

329
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,029

bridge will go out

330
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039

 

331
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,389

extend this out how's it slicking

332
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399

 

333
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,509

i don't know what i should do with the

334
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
i don't know what i should do with the
 

335
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,110
i don't know what i should do with the
floor here if i should make it out of

336
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
floor here if i should make it out of
 

337
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,829
floor here if i should make it out of
wood

338
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
wood
 

339
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,790
wood
or grass

340
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800

 

341
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,790

i almost think i shouldn't use grass for

342
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
i almost think i shouldn't use grass for
 

343
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,990
i almost think i shouldn't use grass for
it

344
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000

 

345
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,990

yeah that'll be good

346
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
yeah that'll be good
 

347
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,910
yeah that'll be good
you know what i could do is i could put

348
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:09,920
you know what i could do is i could put
 

349
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,150
you know what i could do is i could put
the half slabs underneath

350
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160

 

351
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:21,990

to kind of hide that wood texture

352
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
to kind of hide that wood texture
 

353
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,110
to kind of hide that wood texture
okay well we'll just leave that for now

354
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
okay well we'll just leave that for now
 

355
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,430
okay well we'll just leave that for now
um this will come up

356
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
um this will come up
 

357
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,949
um this will come up
should this be planks

358
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
should this be planks
 

359
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:43,030
should this be planks
i wonder probably right

360
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040

 

361
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,230

okay i will

362
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
okay i will
 

363
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,030
okay i will
put some wood over here

364
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
put some wood over here
 

365
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,310
put some wood over here
i'm probably gonna have to skip some of

366
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
i'm probably gonna have to skip some of
 

367
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,509
i'm probably gonna have to skip some of
this because i'm not talking very much

368
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
this because i'm not talking very much
 

369
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,350
this because i'm not talking very much
i'm in deep thought

370
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360

 

371
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,389

all right yeah i don't know

372
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
all right yeah i don't know
 

373
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,389
all right yeah i don't know
i was thinking maybe make it go up two

374
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
i was thinking maybe make it go up two
 

375
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,350
i was thinking maybe make it go up two
blocks like a two block high stairs

376
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
blocks like a two block high stairs
 

377
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,069
blocks like a two block high stairs
but uh i think one block might be better

378
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
but uh i think one block might be better
 

379
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,150
but uh i think one block might be better
after all

380
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
after all
 

381
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,470
after all
and then if you're up on this stairs uh

382
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
and then if you're up on this stairs uh
 

383
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,990
and then if you're up on this stairs uh
or on the stairs over here you have a

384
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
or on the stairs over here you have a
 

385
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,110
or on the stairs over here you have a
nice

386
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
nice
 

387
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,190
nice
overlook too

388
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200

 

389
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,069

okay so i'll mess with this floor i'll

390
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
okay so i'll mess with this floor i'll
 

391
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,990
okay so i'll mess with this floor i'll
try grass first i guess

392
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
try grass first i guess
 

393
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,269
try grass first i guess
and see how that looks

394
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279

 

395
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,509

okay so the grass has mostly grown here

396
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
okay so the grass has mostly grown here
 

397
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,509
okay so the grass has mostly grown here
and i'm actually liking it quite a bit

398
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
and i'm actually liking it quite a bit
 

399
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,150
and i'm actually liking it quite a bit
it's

400
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
it's
 

401
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,150
it's
it really brightens up the area when you

402
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
it really brightens up the area when you
 

403
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,190
it really brightens up the area when you
have grass on the ground

404
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,200
have grass on the ground
 

405
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,990
have grass on the ground
and it makes it a lot easier to do

406
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
and it makes it a lot easier to do
 

407
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,870
and it makes it a lot easier to do
things like

408
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
things like
 

409
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,230
things like
this i'm just experimenting to see if i

410
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
this i'm just experimenting to see if i
 

411
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,190
this i'm just experimenting to see if i
like it

412
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
like it
 

413
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,389
like it
this glowing tree here um

414
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
this glowing tree here um
 

415
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,750
this glowing tree here um
because we got to light up this place

416
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
because we got to light up this place
 

417
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,190
because we got to light up this place
and i don't want to use torches like

418
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
and i don't want to use torches like
 

419
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,910
and i don't want to use torches like
i've said before

420
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920
i've said before
 

421
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,430
i've said before
so that would be one way of lighting up

422
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
so that would be one way of lighting up
 

423
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,430
so that would be one way of lighting up
this corner

424
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
this corner
 

425
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,630
this corner
we'll see how it looks from below here

426
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:04,640
we'll see how it looks from below here
 

427
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:12,310
we'll see how it looks from below here
and over here

428
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320

 

429
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,430

that's not bad

430
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
that's not bad
 

431
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,110
that's not bad
okay so that's one possibility and then

432
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
okay so that's one possibility and then
 

433
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,430
okay so that's one possibility and then
i was thinking maybe having a line of

434
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
i was thinking maybe having a line of
 

435
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,990
i was thinking maybe having a line of
leaves against here so it's not so

436
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000

 

437
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,110

i don't know not so much

438
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
i don't know not so much
 

439
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,350
i don't know not so much
wood exposed and put pumpkins underneath

440
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
wood exposed and put pumpkins underneath
 

441
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,949
wood exposed and put pumpkins underneath
that will take care of lighting up this

442
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
that will take care of lighting up this
 

443
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,750
that will take care of lighting up this
side

444
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760

 

445
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:45,030

let's see we'll try it um

446
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040

 

447
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,030

i don't know if putting them one deep is

448
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
i don't know if putting them one deep is
 

449
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,470
i don't know if putting them one deep is
enough though

450
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
enough though
 

451
00:11:48,480 --> 00:12:01,590
enough though
might be a little bit too obvious

452
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600

 

453
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,110

although i might not want to go here

454
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
although i might not want to go here
 

455
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,829
although i might not want to go here
be cool if i left that so the lines

456
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839
be cool if i left that so the lines
 

457
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,790
be cool if i left that so the lines
together

458
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
together
 

459
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,150
together
you know what i mean so the wood the

460
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
you know what i mean so the wood the
 

461
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,990
you know what i mean so the wood the
wooden line doesn't get broken

462
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,000
wooden line doesn't get broken
 

463
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,910
wooden line doesn't get broken
if i have a leaf here because otherwise

464
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
if i have a leaf here because otherwise
 

465
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,030
if i have a leaf here because otherwise
it has to

466
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
it has to
 

467
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,710
it has to
go diagonally like that

468
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720

 

469
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,710

i will try to put these a one block

470
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
i will try to put these a one block
 

471
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:33,670
i will try to put these a one block
deeper and see how that looks

472
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680

 

473
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,829

i'm i'm starting to like using glowing

474
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
i'm i'm starting to like using glowing
 

475
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,350
i'm i'm starting to like using glowing
pumpkins a lot more than i used to

476
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
pumpkins a lot more than i used to
 

477
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,829
pumpkins a lot more than i used to
they're pretty handy and they're so so

478
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:41,839
they're pretty handy and they're so so
 

479
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,150
they're pretty handy and they're so so
cheap to produce too

480
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160

 

481
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,190

yeah we don't want that there oh

482
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
yeah we don't want that there oh
 

483
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,629
yeah we don't want that there oh
skelton right there

484
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
skelton right there
 

485
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,150
skelton right there
they keep finding their way down there

486
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
they keep finding their way down there
 

487
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,670
they keep finding their way down there
now that never used to be a problem

488
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680

 

489
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,190

oh actually we don't want to use our

490
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
oh actually we don't want to use our
 

491
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,790
oh actually we don't want to use our
good grass blocks

492
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
good grass blocks
 

493
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,629
good grass blocks
you get those with silk touch by the way

494
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
you get those with silk touch by the way
 

495
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,110
you get those with silk touch by the way
because i'll probably have people asking

496
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,120

 

497
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,190

get rid of those see how it looks

498
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,200

 

499
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,030

then over here maybe we'll put flowers

500
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
then over here maybe we'll put flowers
 

501
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,949
then over here maybe we'll put flowers
or something i don't know

502
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
or something i don't know
 

503
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,870
or something i don't know
it's not bad it is a little bit dark

504
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
it's not bad it is a little bit dark
 

505
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,310
it's not bad it is a little bit dark
over here in the middle

506
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
over here in the middle
 

507
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,430
over here in the middle
still

508
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440

 

509
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,389

um could maybe put glowstone

510
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399

 

511
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,990

that's weird it doesn't let you place it

512
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
that's weird it doesn't let you place it
 

513
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,230
that's weird it doesn't let you place it
on top of fence

514
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240

 

515
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,910

we'll use torches for now

516
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920

 

517
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,069

all right so if we do keep this tree

518
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
all right so if we do keep this tree
 

519
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,269
all right so if we do keep this tree
here

520
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
here
 

521
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,629
here
we might put the storage room in front

522
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:58,639
we might put the storage room in front
 

523
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,470
we might put the storage room in front
over here and

524
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,480
over here and
 

525
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,629
over here and
possibly extend it out to over here

526
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639

 

527
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,590

but the bridge should go should go right

528
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
but the bridge should go should go right
 

529
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,910
but the bridge should go should go right
here and we'll probably make it

530
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
here and we'll probably make it
 

531
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,069
here and we'll probably make it
a four wide bridge after all so

532
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
a four wide bridge after all so
 

533
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,350
a four wide bridge after all so
that would mean have a two wide gap here

534
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
that would mean have a two wide gap here
 

535
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,230
that would mean have a two wide gap here
that's that would be over here where it

536
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
that's that would be over here where it
 

537
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,110
that's that would be over here where it
would

538
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120

 

539
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,189

continue again

540
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
continue again
 

541
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,750
continue again
kind of thinking out loud here

542
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760

 

543
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,310

so let's just let's put a fake bridge

544
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
so let's just let's put a fake bridge
 

545
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,990
so let's just let's put a fake bridge
here just to see how it would go

546
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
here just to see how it would go
 

547
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,750
here just to see how it would go
first of all

548
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:45,760
first of all
 

549
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,910
first of all
it would extend out

550
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920

 

551
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,670

and then we would maybe

552
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
and then we would maybe
 

553
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,710
and then we would maybe
do fences all along like from here

554
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
do fences all along like from here
 

555
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,550
do fences all along like from here
for the two sides

556
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560

 

557
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,829

and possibly put half slabs underneath

558
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839
and possibly put half slabs underneath
 

559
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,509
and possibly put half slabs underneath
them

560
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
them
 

561
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,310
them
it'll have to go down what is it two two

562
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
it'll have to go down what is it two two
 

563
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,829
it'll have to go down what is it two two
blocks or one block here

564
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839

 

565
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,990

this won't be soil it'll probably be

566
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000

 

567
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,389

wood or something yeah i'll have to go

568
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:22,399
wood or something yeah i'll have to go
 

569
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,590
wood or something yeah i'll have to go
down two blocks

570
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
down two blocks
 

571
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:31,110
down two blocks
hmm might be tough to do

572
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,120

 

573
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,350

by the way the plan with this was to

574
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
by the way the plan with this was to
 

575
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,189
by the way the plan with this was to
make water go

576
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
make water go
 

577
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,550
make water go
from here to down here and go through

578
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560
from here to down here and go through
 

579
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:38,949
from here to down here and go through
this

580
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
this
 

581
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,550
this
tunnel and you could free

582
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,560
tunnel and you could free
 

583
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,670
tunnel and you could free
flow a boat through there and you could

584
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
flow a boat through there and you could
 

585
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,990
flow a boat through there and you could
possibly get off here

586
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
possibly get off here
 

587
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,629
possibly get off here
and i was thinking of maybe making it go

588
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
and i was thinking of maybe making it go
 

589
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,550
and i was thinking of maybe making it go
further

590
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
further
 

591
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,430
further
down over this way and come out by the

592
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
down over this way and come out by the
 

593
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,470
down over this way and come out by the
slime farm

594
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
slime farm
 

595
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,150
slime farm
area somewhere that was the

596
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
area somewhere that was the
 

597
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,509
area somewhere that was the
the plan from long ago it might need to

598
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519
the plan from long ago it might need to
 

599
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,189
the plan from long ago it might need to
rethink it a fair bit

600
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
rethink it a fair bit
 

601
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,030
rethink it a fair bit
but we should try get that going too

602
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
but we should try get that going too
 

603
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,189
but we should try get that going too
sometime

604
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199

 

605
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,310

okay so that might i think that would

606
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,320
okay so that might i think that would
 

607
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,629
okay so that might i think that would
look

608
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
look
 

609
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,069
look
pretty good but how are we gonna make it

610
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
pretty good but how are we gonna make it
 

611
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,629
pretty good but how are we gonna make it
go down two blocks is the next question

612
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639

 

613
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:32,389

or make that come up two blocks

614
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399

 

615
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,749

not sure oh

616
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:35,759
not sure oh
 

617
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,189
not sure oh
another thing i wanted to check out is

618
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
another thing i wanted to check out is
 

619
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,350
another thing i wanted to check out is
do vines grow on pumpkins because that

620
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
do vines grow on pumpkins because that
 

621
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,069
do vines grow on pumpkins because that
would be a

622
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
would be a
 

623
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:48,829
would be a
cool effect too oh they do

624
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:48,839

 

625
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,670

interesting

626
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
interesting
 

627
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,430
interesting
because usually i cover them with leaves

628
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
because usually i cover them with leaves
 

629
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,110
because usually i cover them with leaves
but you could also use vines that yes

630
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
but you could also use vines that yes
 

631
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,550
but you could also use vines that yes
to make them a little less harsh

632
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,560

 

633
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,069

okay well i'll mess around with this a

634
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
okay well i'll mess around with this a
 

635
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,909
okay well i'll mess around with this a
bit more off camera and we'll see how it

636
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
bit more off camera and we'll see how it
 

637
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,829
bit more off camera and we'll see how it
goes

638
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839

 

639
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,350

okay so i've been working on the bridge

640
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,360
okay so i've been working on the bridge
 

641
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,590
okay so i've been working on the bridge
a little bit and uh it

642
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
a little bit and uh it
 

643
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,429
a little bit and uh it
seems to be pretty good let me know what

644
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
seems to be pretty good let me know what
 

645
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,590
seems to be pretty good let me know what
you guys think of this

646
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:17,600
you guys think of this
 

647
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,829
you guys think of this
i have the logs on the left and the

648
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:19,839
i have the logs on the left and the
 

649
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,710
i have the logs on the left and the
right here and we're going to run

650
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
right here and we're going to run
 

651
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,230
right here and we're going to run
fences whoop

652
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
fences whoop
 

653
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,510
fences whoop
over top these like so

654
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:31,520

 

655
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,110

both sides i was thinking

656
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
both sides i was thinking
 

657
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,470
both sides i was thinking
of running fences like to the ceiling

658
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,480
of running fences like to the ceiling
 

659
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,390
of running fences like to the ceiling
every so often too

660
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,400
every so often too
 

661
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,470
every so often too
and make it look like it's suspended

662
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,480
and make it look like it's suspended
 

663
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,230
and make it look like it's suspended
from the ceiling this bridge

664
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
from the ceiling this bridge
 

665
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,310
from the ceiling this bridge
that might be cool and we'll be able to

666
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
that might be cool and we'll be able to
 

667
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,990
that might be cool and we'll be able to
hide some lighting that way too

668
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000
hide some lighting that way too
 

669
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,510
hide some lighting that way too
probably up higher

670
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
probably up higher
 

671
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,870
probably up higher
um yeah so that

672
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:54,880
um yeah so that
 

673
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,390
um yeah so that
that will do that and then we can make

674
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
that will do that and then we can make
 

675
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,789
that will do that and then we can make
this go down

676
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799
this go down
 

677
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,029
this go down
these are the upside down half slabs

678
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
these are the upside down half slabs
 

679
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,549
these are the upside down half slabs
over here so

680
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
over here so
 

681
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,510
over here so
it looks cool from below or at least i

682
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,520
it looks cool from below or at least i
 

683
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,669
it looks cool from below or at least i
think it does

684
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:07,679
think it does
 

685
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,830
think it does
because the logs stick out a little

686
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
because the logs stick out a little
 

687
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,990
because the logs stick out a little
further than the half slabs

688
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,000
further than the half slabs
 

689
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,350
further than the half slabs
which is cool uh on the side

690
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
which is cool uh on the side
 

691
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,390
which is cool uh on the side
it looks decent a little

692
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,400
it looks decent a little
 

693
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,590
it looks decent a little
a little bit flat but

694
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
a little bit flat but
 

695
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,390
a little bit flat but
it's pretty good i think let me know

696
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,400
it's pretty good i think let me know
 

697
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,830
it's pretty good i think let me know
what you think

698
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:26,840

 

699
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,070

um so that will come over to here

700
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,080
um so that will come over to here
 

701
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,110
um so that will come over to here
and then we'll

702
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120

 

703
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,510

just switch it so the half slabs maybe

704
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
just switch it so the half slabs maybe
 

705
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,590
just switch it so the half slabs maybe
go

706
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
go
 

707
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,870
go
like that then and then we have a nice

708
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
like that then and then we have a nice
 

709
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,789
like that then and then we have a nice
gradual

710
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
gradual
 

711
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,909
gradual
type thing

712
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919

 

713
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,950

whoa i'm just destroying everything

714
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
whoa i'm just destroying everything
 

715
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,549
whoa i'm just destroying everything
we'll switch these to planks not often i

716
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,559
we'll switch these to planks not often i
 

717
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,430
we'll switch these to planks not often i
do decorate

718

nice change
 

723
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,430
nice change
or at least i'm enjoying it

724
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440

 

725
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,789

yeah okay so this

726
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
yeah okay so this
 

727
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,870
yeah okay so this
actually won't come out that far

728
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:12,880

 

729
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,990

we will make this at least two wide

730
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
we will make this at least two wide
 

731
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,789
we will make this at least two wide
so that we can walk along here and we'll

732
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
so that we can walk along here and we'll
 

733
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,390
so that we can walk along here and we'll
probably

734
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
probably
 

735
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,549
probably
have a rail here too

736
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
have a rail here too
 

737
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,630
have a rail here too
uh and we'll make it merge with this

738
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
uh and we'll make it merge with this
 

739
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,110
uh and we'll make it merge with this
this wall over here

740
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,120
this wall over here
 

741
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,390
this wall over here
somehow

742
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400

 

743
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,549

yeah i'm gonna have to protect this

744
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
yeah i'm gonna have to protect this
 

745
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,310
yeah i'm gonna have to protect this
bridge hill because it caught fire

746
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
bridge hill because it caught fire
 

747
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,710
bridge hill because it caught fire
once already from from this lava so i

748
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
once already from from this lava so i
 

749
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,190
once already from from this lava so i
need to put something underneath it

750
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200

 

751
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,590

or otherwise it's going to catch fire

752
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600

 

753
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,390

like these logs here caught fire from

754
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:52,400
like these logs here caught fire from
 

755
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,590
like these logs here caught fire from
from that

756
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
from that
 

757
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,110
from that
but if i put soil underneath or

758
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
but if i put soil underneath or
 

759
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,630
but if i put soil underneath or
something

760
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
something
 

761
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,950
something
it should be fine

762
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:04,960

 

763
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,870

i'll just do that temporarily anyway

764
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:10,880

 

765
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,390

i don't know or half slabs or something

766
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:14,400
i don't know or half slabs or something
 

767
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,830
i don't know or half slabs or something
gotta have something otherwise it's

768
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:15,840
gotta have something otherwise it's
 

769
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,990
gotta have something otherwise it's
gonna go up in flames and probably burn

770
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,000
gonna go up in flames and probably burn
 

771
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,110
gonna go up in flames and probably burn
all that too

772
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,120

 

773
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,510

okay what else were we gonna do here

774
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:27,520
okay what else were we gonna do here
 

775
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,390
okay what else were we gonna do here
this will eventually be a staircase over

776
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
this will eventually be a staircase over
 

777
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,750
this will eventually be a staircase over
here

778
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:31,760
here
 

779
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,990
here
trust me i i'm getting really tired of

780
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
trust me i i'm getting really tired of
 

781
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,830
trust me i i'm getting really tired of
jumping up that

782
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
jumping up that
 

783
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,510
jumping up that
it is a quite the mess

784
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,520

 

785
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,190

these mushrooms won't be everywhere

786
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
these mushrooms won't be everywhere
 

787
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,950
these mushrooms won't be everywhere
either once this is all done but over

788
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
either once this is all done but over
 

789
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,270
either once this is all done but over
here

790
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,280
here
 

791
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,909
here
would be cool or i think it would be to

792
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:47,919
would be cool or i think it would be to
 

793
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,190
would be cool or i think it would be to
have flowers and

794
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
have flowers and
 

795
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,549
have flowers and
some tall grass maybe a few mushrooms

796
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:52,559
some tall grass maybe a few mushrooms
 

797
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,909
some tall grass maybe a few mushrooms
just so it's not a big plain green

798
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:55,919
just so it's not a big plain green
 

799
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,750
just so it's not a big plain green
grass area actually with this one i made

800
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:59,760
grass area actually with this one i made
 

801
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,830
grass area actually with this one i made
it so that the logs come out like that

802
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:01,840
it so that the logs come out like that
 

803
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,590
it so that the logs come out like that
so we should probably

804
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,600
so we should probably
 

805
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,070
so we should probably
change this one so it matches

806
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,080

 

807
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,070

yeah it looks better

808
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,080

 

809
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,270

and it might be worth checking out if it

810
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,280
and it might be worth checking out if it
 

811
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,230
and it might be worth checking out if it
looks

812
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,240
looks
 

813
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,870
looks
better if you put a fence there too oops

814
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880

 

815
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,149

yeah i almost like that more

816
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159
yeah i almost like that more
 

817
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,190
yeah i almost like that more
that's pretty good so we'll do the same

818
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,200
that's pretty good so we'll do the same
 

819
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,310
that's pretty good so we'll do the same
for this one too

820
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320

 

821
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,270

yeah so many decisions man

822
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,280
yeah so many decisions man
 

823
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,990
yeah so many decisions man
every little thing you gotta think of

824
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
every little thing you gotta think of
 

825
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,669
every little thing you gotta think of
three or four different things you could

826
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:43,679
three or four different things you could
 

827
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,350
three or four different things you could
do

828
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
do
 

829
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,870
do
and figure out which one you like the

830
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:46,880
and figure out which one you like the
 

831
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,750
and figure out which one you like the
most there's a lot to it

832
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:49,760
most there's a lot to it
 

833
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,070
most there's a lot to it
does this look good

834
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,080

 

835
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,510

i think i almost prefer it not joined

836
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520
i think i almost prefer it not joined
 

837
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,350
i think i almost prefer it not joined
yeah so over here i changed it a little

838
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360
yeah so over here i changed it a little
 

839
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,310
yeah so over here i changed it a little
bit

840
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,320
bit
 

841
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,510
bit
as it is too wide now there will be a

842
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520
as it is too wide now there will be a
 

843
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,669
as it is too wide now there will be a
rail of some sort over here

844
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:07,679
rail of some sort over here
 

845
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,110
rail of some sort over here
and don't know exactly how that's going

846
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
and don't know exactly how that's going
 

847
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,390
and don't know exactly how that's going
to work yet

848
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
to work yet
 

849
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,710
to work yet
or what's going to be over here or how

850
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
or what's going to be over here or how
 

851
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,470
or what's going to be over here or how
i'm changing this

852
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
i'm changing this
 

853
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,510
i'm changing this
elevator or a lot of other things got to

854
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,520
elevator or a lot of other things got to
 

855
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,789
elevator or a lot of other things got to
be figured out yet

856
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
be figured out yet
 

857
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,390
be figured out yet
but i do like where i'm going with this

858
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
but i do like where i'm going with this
 

859
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,230
but i do like where i'm going with this
it actually expanded the base quite a

860
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,240
it actually expanded the base quite a
 

861
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,390
it actually expanded the base quite a
bit too

862
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,400
bit too
 

863
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,310
bit too
it's a lot of extra walking space here

864
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
it's a lot of extra walking space here
 

865
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,950
it's a lot of extra walking space here
uh we'll have to get some more lighting

866
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960

 

867
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,270

and the storage room will be over here

868
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
and the storage room will be over here
 

869
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,110
and the storage room will be over here
not well i kind of know what i want to

870
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,120
not well i kind of know what i want to
 

871
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,029
not well i kind of know what i want to
