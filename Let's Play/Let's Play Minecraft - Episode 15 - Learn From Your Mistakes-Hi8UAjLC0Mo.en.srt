8
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:41,960

 

9
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,830

this thing here is a past mistake

10
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:48,840

 

11
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,260

it was good but it doesn't do exactly

12
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,270
it was good but it doesn't do exactly
 

13
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,249
it was good but it doesn't do exactly
what I wanted to do and so we are going

14
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:55,259
what I wanted to do and so we are going
 

15
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:13,990
what I wanted to do and so we are going
to move on the best way I know how to

16
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000

 

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,930

all right good riddance

18
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:19,940
all right good riddance
 

19
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,729
all right good riddance
so it wasn't a total waste I'm not going

20
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:22,739
so it wasn't a total waste I'm not going
 

21
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,460
so it wasn't a total waste I'm not going
to be using this anymore but I did teach

22
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:25,470
to be using this anymore but I did teach
 

23
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,589
to be using this anymore but I did teach
me a lot and we did get a lot of

24
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
me a lot and we did get a lot of
 

25
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,259
me a lot and we did get a lot of
resources building it but this is the

26
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:33,269
resources building it but this is the
 

27
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:51,770
resources building it but this is the
future this is our second mop system all

28
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:51,780
future this is our second mop system all
 

29
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,879
future this is our second mop system all
right I'm going to show you what this

30
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:52,889
right I'm going to show you what this
 

31
00:02:52,889 --> 00:03:03,770
right I'm going to show you what this
does get rid of all the guys so this

32
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:03,780
does get rid of all the guys so this
 

33
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:12,660
does get rid of all the guys so this
thing has four water tubes

34
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:12,670

 

35
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,070

this one is for the tall mobs oh wow we

36
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
this one is for the tall mobs oh wow we
 

37
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,789
this one is for the tall mobs oh wow we
are lucky today this one is for spiders

38
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:23,799
are lucky today this one is for spiders
 

39
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:36,399
are lucky today this one is for spiders
and spider jockeys so one thing we

40
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:36,409
and spider jockeys so one thing we
 

41
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:42,850
and spider jockeys so one thing we
learned from our last mob trap is mobs

42
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:42,860
learned from our last mob trap is mobs
 

43
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,369
learned from our last mob trap is mobs
do not collide with each other when they

44
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:45,379
do not collide with each other when they
 

45
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:50,380
do not collide with each other when they
are swinging up which means with our old

46
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:50,390
are swinging up which means with our old
 

47
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,190
are swinging up which means with our old
one I added up the mob elevator at 3x3

48
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,200
one I added up the mob elevator at 3x3
 

49
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,569
one I added up the mob elevator at 3x3
area because I thought they were going

50
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:55,579
area because I thought they were going
 

51
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:58,479
area because I thought they were going
to get in each other's way but

52
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:58,489
to get in each other's way but
 

53
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:01,899
to get in each other's way but
apparently they do not at all and you

54
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:01,909
apparently they do not at all and you
 

55
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,460
apparently they do not at all and you
can actually fit over 100 guys in a few

56
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:05,470
can actually fit over 100 guys in a few
 

57
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:13,660
can actually fit over 100 guys in a few
to block space so there's no point

58
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:13,670
to block space so there's no point
 

59
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:21,640
to block space so there's no point
making a 3x3 elevator at all so over

60
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:21,650
making a 3x3 elevator at all so over
 

61
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,850
making a 3x3 elevator at all so over
here is a one block elevator for the

62
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:24,860
here is a one block elevator for the
 

63
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,250
here is a one block elevator for the
pall mobs and over here is a 2x2

64
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,260
pall mobs and over here is a 2x2
 

65
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:41,830
pall mobs and over here is a 2x2
elevator for the spiders and what

66
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
elevator for the spiders and what
 

67
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,540
elevator for the spiders and what
happens is the water pushes in into this

68
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:43,550
happens is the water pushes in into this
 

69
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,330
happens is the water pushes in into this
area they swim up and then they drown

70
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:48,340
area they swim up and then they drown
 

71
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,160
area they swim up and then they drown
and there drops falling below a we visit

72
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,170
and there drops falling below a we visit
 

73
00:04:53,170 --> 00:05:12,020
and there drops falling below a we visit
the water school and this is actually a

74
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,030
the water school and this is actually a
 

75
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,400
the water school and this is actually a
mob Junction - so I said I was going to

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,410
mob Junction - so I said I was going to
 

77
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,900
mob Junction - so I said I was going to
be working on my storage room and I got

78
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:21,910
be working on my storage room and I got
 

79
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,550
be working on my storage room and I got
a little bit sidetracked this is going

80
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
a little bit sidetracked this is going
 

81
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,490
a little bit sidetracked this is going
to be the centerpiece of our story

82
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:31,500

 

83
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,370

there's many chests all around here what

84
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:38,380
there's many chests all around here what
 

85
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,890
there's many chests all around here what
these leaders knew was a control doors

86
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:42,900

 

87
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,830

in our vertical Junction really this

88
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
in our vertical Junction really this
 

89
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,740
in our vertical Junction really this
door is closed the mobs can't look

90
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:52,750
door is closed the mobs can't look
 

91
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,630
door is closed the mobs can't look
the mobs can't enter this area here and

92
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:57,640
the mobs can't enter this area here and
 

93
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:12,610
the mobs can't enter this area here and
so he just snuck up on darn it

94
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:12,620

 

95
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,010

that's all that broke okay

96
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,020
that's all that broke okay
 

97
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,170
that's all that broke okay
so when the store is closed the mobs are

98
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,180
so when the store is closed the mobs are
 

99
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,860
so when the store is closed the mobs are
forced to swim up and I'm going to have

100
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:21,870
forced to swim up and I'm going to have
 

101
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,439
forced to swim up and I'm going to have
a second story here and at the second

102
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:27,449
a second story here and at the second
 

103
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,379
a second story here and at the second
story I'm going to add a sorting

104
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:30,389
story I'm going to add a sorting
 

105
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,719
story I'm going to add a sorting
mechanism to sort the different types of

106
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:32,729
mechanism to sort the different types of
 

107
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:36,110
mechanism to sort the different types of
mobs and I'm also going to have a

108
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,120
mobs and I'm also going to have a
 

109
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,490
mobs and I'm also going to have a
mechanism to put them into mine carts if

110
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:40,500
mechanism to put them into mine carts if
 

111
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,710
mechanism to put them into mine carts if
I want and ship them off to other areas

112
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
I want and ship them off to other areas
 

113
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,589
I want and ship them off to other areas
but I won't start that until I finish

114
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:48,599
but I won't start that until I finish
 

115
00:06:48,599 --> 00:07:01,990
but I won't start that until I finish
the first story of our storage room here

116
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000

 

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,050

so to clarify this water tube here is a

118
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,060
so to clarify this water tube here is a
 

119
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,320
so to clarify this water tube here is a
elevator for the spiders if this door is

120
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,330
elevator for the spiders if this door is
 

121
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,730
elevator for the spiders if this door is
open they enter this left the tube here

122
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:16,740
open they enter this left the tube here
 

123
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,980
open they enter this left the tube here
this is the killing chamber for this

124
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:18,990
this is the killing chamber for this
 

125
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,740
this is the killing chamber for this
lasers this is elevator for the tall

126
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:24,750
lasers this is elevator for the tall
 

127
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,980
lasers this is elevator for the tall
mobs and if the door is open they will

128
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:27,990
mobs and if the door is open they will
 

129
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,700
mobs and if the door is open they will
enter the killing chamber for the tall

130
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:31,710
enter the killing chamber for the tall
 

131
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,110
enter the killing chamber for the tall
mobs

132
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,120

 

133
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,600

and elevators are going to go up to a

134
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:37,610
and elevators are going to go up to a
 

135
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:46,200
and elevators are going to go up to a
second-story and I'm going to show you

136
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,210
second-story and I'm going to show you
 

137
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,540
second-story and I'm going to show you
down below and we're doing this on

138
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:49,550
down below and we're doing this on
 

139
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,060
down below and we're doing this on
peaceful I'm making the exception

140
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,070
peaceful I'm making the exception
 

141
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,610
peaceful I'm making the exception
because otherwise I'm definitely going

142
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:54,620
because otherwise I'm definitely going
 

143
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,010
because otherwise I'm definitely going
to that that I'm definitely going to die

144
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:57,020
to that that I'm definitely going to die
 

145
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:06,940
to that that I'm definitely going to die
down here actually let's keep it on easy

146
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:06,950
down here actually let's keep it on easy
 

147
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:12,479
down here actually let's keep it on easy
just for now

148
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:12,489

 

149
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:16,899

this is the spawning grounds think I

150
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:16,909
this is the spawning grounds think I
 

151
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:25,809
this is the spawning grounds think I
have seven pads here now this is like a

152
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:25,819
have seven pads here now this is like a
 

153
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:32,920
have seven pads here now this is like a
little that lookout area actually I'll

154
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:32,930
little that lookout area actually I'll
 

155
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,480
little that lookout area actually I'll
explain this first go back to peaceful

156
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:36,490
explain this first go back to peaceful
 

157
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:46,199
explain this first go back to peaceful
and we'll get some lights on down here

158
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:46,209

 

159
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,280

with my old elevator

160
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,290
with my old elevator
 

161
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,499
with my old elevator
I had three streams joining together

162
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:52,509
I had three streams joining together
 

163
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:56,259
I had three streams joining together
like this one this one and this one and

164
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:56,269
like this one this one and this one and
 

165
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,660
like this one this one and this one and
then the elevator was up here and it

166
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:58,670
then the elevator was up here and it
 

167
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,259
then the elevator was up here and it
would go up to the surface that was kind

168
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:02,269
would go up to the surface that was kind
 

169
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:07,030
would go up to the surface that was kind
of a bad way of doing it so instead it

170
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
of a bad way of doing it so instead it
 

171
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,829
of a bad way of doing it so instead it
goes up into this little area here and

172
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:10,839
goes up into this little area here and
 

173
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:16,650
goes up into this little area here and
this is the tall mob spider separator

174
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:16,660
this is the tall mob spider separator
 

175
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,999
this is the tall mob spider separator
mechanism the way this works is all the

176
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:22,009
mechanism the way this works is all the
 

177
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:26,170
mechanism the way this works is all the
mobs get pushed into here this little

178
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:26,180
mobs get pushed into here this little
 

179
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,829
mobs get pushed into here this little
stream keeps mobs from being stuck in

180
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:29,839
stream keeps mobs from being stuck in
 

181
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,480
stream keeps mobs from being stuck in
this area here they're forced to go to

182
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:31,490
this area here they're forced to go to
 

183
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,990
this area here they're forced to go to
the left and this part here is too high

184
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:37,000
the left and this part here is too high
 

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,210
the left and this part here is too high
this part is too wide so spiders can fit

186
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:40,220
this part is too wide so spiders can fit
 

187
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:46,629
this part is too wide so spiders can fit
here all mobs can fit here they enter

188
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:46,639
here all mobs can fit here they enter
 

189
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:57,480
here all mobs can fit here they enter
the thing and what happens is

190
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:57,490

 

191
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,760

the tall mobs they they pass right

192
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:00,770
the tall mobs they they pass right
 

193
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,470
the tall mobs they they pass right
through here it's all the water is going

194
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:05,480
through here it's all the water is going
 

195
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,680
through here it's all the water is going
straight and this this block of water is

196
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:11,690
straight and this this block of water is
 

197
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,020
straight and this this block of water is
on top of it pressure plates and the

198
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,030
on top of it pressure plates and the
 

199
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,770
on top of it pressure plates and the
sign keeps it from back flowing so it

200
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:17,780
sign keeps it from back flowing so it
 

201
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,300
sign keeps it from back flowing so it
pushes a mob through and then the tall

202
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:22,310
pushes a mob through and then the tall
 

203
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,220
pushes a mob through and then the tall
mob goes up the elevator this is the

204
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:27,230
mob goes up the elevator this is the
 

205
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:33,400
mob goes up the elevator this is the
junction and these are all source blocks

206
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:33,410
junction and these are all source blocks
 

207
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,860
junction and these are all source blocks
so the mobs go up very fast and this is

208
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:38,870
so the mobs go up very fast and this is
 

209
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,930
so the mobs go up very fast and this is
kind of like the cork I have on until I

210
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:40,940
kind of like the cork I have on until I
 

211
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:47,770
kind of like the cork I have on until I
built the second storey and you'll

212
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:47,780
built the second storey and you'll
 

213
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,650
built the second storey and you'll
notice there's an angle water stream

214
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:50,660
notice there's an angle water stream
 

215
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:57,820
notice there's an angle water stream
here that is so that they don't get

216
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:57,830
here that is so that they don't get
 

217
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:03,010
here that is so that they don't get
stuck on this door hinge and there's a

218
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:03,020
stuck on this door hinge and there's a
 

219
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,230
stuck on this door hinge and there's a
step here because sometimes they we're

220
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:05,240
step here because sometimes they we're
 

221
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,720
step here because sometimes they we're
getting stuck in this door area and they

222
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:07,730
getting stuck in this door area and they
 

223
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,500
getting stuck in this door area and they
weren't moving so even if that happens

224
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:10,510
weren't moving so even if that happens
 

225
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,180
weren't moving so even if that happens
if another mob comes up it'll push them

226
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,190
if another mob comes up it'll push them
 

227
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,180
if another mob comes up it'll push them
onto this stair and then they'll get

228
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:16,190
onto this stair and then they'll get
 

229
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,990
onto this stair and then they'll get
going again up into the chilling chamber

230
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
going again up into the chilling chamber
 

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,460
going again up into the chilling chamber
here

232
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:26,470

 

233
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,980

there's some pretty fancy out water work

234
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:29,990
there's some pretty fancy out water work
 

235
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,560
there's some pretty fancy out water work
here I got it just the way I like it

236
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:34,570
here I got it just the way I like it
 

237
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:40,570
here I got it just the way I like it
took a lot of tweaking now I might make

238
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:40,580
took a lot of tweaking now I might make
 

239
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,150
took a lot of tweaking now I might make
a tutorial on how to do it later once I

240
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:43,160
a tutorial on how to do it later once I
 

241
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,120
a tutorial on how to do it later once I
get this all finished because it's

242
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,130
get this all finished because it's
 

243
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,510
get this all finished because it's
pretty hard to see exactly how it works

244
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:48,520
pretty hard to see exactly how it works
 

245
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:56,620
pretty hard to see exactly how it works
once it's all finished like this so this

246
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:56,630
once it's all finished like this so this
 

247
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,830
once it's all finished like this so this
these blocks here prevent the tall mobs

248
00:11:59,830 --> 00:11:59,840
these blocks here prevent the tall mobs
 

249
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,680
these blocks here prevent the tall mobs
from entering the spider a switching

250
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:02,690
from entering the spider a switching
 

251
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,620
from entering the spider a switching
area and what happens with the spiders

252
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:05,630
area and what happens with the spiders
 

253
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,110
area and what happens with the spiders
is they come in through here and then

254
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,120
is they come in through here and then
 

255
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:15,040
is they come in through here and then
they hit this app sorry guys I keep

256
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,050
they hit this app sorry guys I keep
 

257
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:26,150
they hit this app sorry guys I keep
being interrupted here so like I saying

258
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160

 

259
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,030

what was I saying

260
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040

 

261
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,640

so yes the spiders they going through

262
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:33,650
so yes the spiders they going through
 

263
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,360
so yes the spiders they going through
there

264
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,370

 

265
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,190

can probably see it better on this side

266
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200

 

267
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,330

going through here and then they hit

268
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:43,340
going through here and then they hit
 

269
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,610
going through here and then they hit
this wall here there's only a one block

270
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:48,620
this wall here there's only a one block
 

271
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,860
this wall here there's only a one block
wide gap there so only the tall mobs get

272
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:50,870
wide gap there so only the tall mobs get
 

273
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,270
wide gap there so only the tall mobs get
through but the spiders they hit this

274
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:55,280
through but the spiders they hit this
 

275
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,340
through but the spiders they hit this
wall and then there's a stream of water

276
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,350
wall and then there's a stream of water
 

277
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,270
wall and then there's a stream of water
that goes this way and then around the

278
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:01,280
that goes this way and then around the
 

279
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,290
that goes this way and then around the
bend into the elevator here so they're

280
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:05,300
bend into the elevator here so they're
 

281
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,240
bend into the elevator here so they're
forced to go this way the spiders and

282
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,250
forced to go this way the spiders and
 

283
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,190
forced to go this way the spiders and
they get separated that way and then

284
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:12,200
they get separated that way and then
 

285
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,320
they get separated that way and then
this elevator here I'm using signs for

286
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,330
this elevator here I'm using signs for
 

287
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,010
this elevator here I'm using signs for
it and what it is is it's a source block

288
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,020
it and what it is is it's a source block
 

289
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,360
it and what it is is it's a source block
here of water and diagonally there's

290
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,370
here of water and diagonally there's
 

291
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,090
here of water and diagonally there's
another source block and it keeps

292
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,100
another source block and it keeps
 

293
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,670
another source block and it keeps
alternating all the way up so that

294
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:30,680
alternating all the way up so that
 

295
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,430
alternating all the way up so that
there's air pockets and they don't drown

296
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
there's air pockets and they don't drown
 

297
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:42,280
there's air pockets and they don't drown
on their way up

298
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,290

 

299
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,920

and they like the other mobs they have a

300
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:45,930
and they like the other mobs they have a
 

301
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:54,170
and they like the other mobs they have a
door here who crazy water currents in

302
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:54,180
door here who crazy water currents in
 

303
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,960
door here who crazy water currents in
here going all different directions so

304
00:13:59,960 --> 00:13:59,970
here going all different directions so
 

305
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,809
here going all different directions so
there's a source block of water here I

306
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:04,819

 

307
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:09,829

think yeah here and it pushes the

308
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
think yeah here and it pushes the
 

309
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:21,050
think yeah here and it pushes the
spiders this into this area here oh yeah

310
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:21,060
spiders this into this area here oh yeah
 

311
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,930
spiders this into this area here oh yeah
this is what I did you can't really see

312
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:23,940
this is what I did you can't really see
 

313
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,180
this is what I did you can't really see
it here but there's a source block of

314
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,190
it here but there's a source block of
 

315
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,400
it here but there's a source block of
water here going diagonally and then the

316
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,410
water here going diagonally and then the
 

317
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,850
water here going diagonally and then the
stream comes this way and the other

318
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:34,860
stream comes this way and the other
 

319
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,660
stream comes this way and the other
stream goes that way and what that does

320
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:38,670
stream goes that way and what that does
 

321
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,650
stream goes that way and what that does
is it pushes spiders towards this corner

322
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:41,660
is it pushes spiders towards this corner
 

323
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,449
is it pushes spiders towards this corner
and so they don't run into this door in

324
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:46,459
and so they don't run into this door in
 

325
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:49,069
and so they don't run into this door in
the otherwise they'll get stuck and just

326
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:49,079
the otherwise they'll get stuck and just
 

327
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:54,639
the otherwise they'll get stuck and just
go up

328
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:54,649

 

329
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:57,290

and then this water stream pushes them

330
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:57,300
and then this water stream pushes them
 

331
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:04,569
and then this water stream pushes them
in and there's three source blocks here

332
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:04,579
in and there's three source blocks here
 

333
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:09,980
in and there's three source blocks here
with a hollow sign spot here so that

334
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:09,990
with a hollow sign spot here so that
 

335
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,960
with a hollow sign spot here so that
this screen doesn't merge into the still

336
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:11,970
this screen doesn't merge into the still
 

337
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:18,170
this screen doesn't merge into the still
water and above here there are two

338
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:18,180
water and above here there are two
 

339
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,389
water and above here there are two
source blocks only and this is where

340
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
source blocks only and this is where
 

341
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,160
source blocks only and this is where
they drown and the stream is going to my

342
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,170
they drown and the stream is going to my
 

343
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,000
they drown and the stream is going to my
left here and the reason for that is

344
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,010
left here and the reason for that is
 

345
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,000
left here and the reason for that is
because sometimes when the spiders were

346
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,010
because sometimes when the spiders were
 

347
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,769
because sometimes when the spiders were
dying their drops were landing on this

348
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:36,779
dying their drops were landing on this
 

349
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:41,079
dying their drops were landing on this
pad here and the stream of water going

350
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:41,089
pad here and the stream of water going
 

351
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,720
pad here and the stream of water going
this way ensures that the drops that

352
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:44,730
this way ensures that the drops that
 

353
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:50,110
this way ensures that the drops that
pushed this way and they don't land on

354
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,120
pushed this way and they don't land on
 

355
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,960
pushed this way and they don't land on
here and get lost forever and so with

356
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:56,970
here and get lost forever and so with
 

357
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,250
here and get lost forever and so with
our stream down here there's a source

358
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:58,260
our stream down here there's a source
 

359
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,880
our stream down here there's a source
block here which is a man and the drops

360
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:01,890
block here which is a man and the drops
 

361
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,139
block here which is a man and the drops
come go up there as far as I can tell

362
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:06,149
come go up there as far as I can tell
 

363
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:10,220
come go up there as far as I can tell
it's 100% efficient and so is the other

364
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,230
it's 100% efficient and so is the other
 

365
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:20,000
it's 100% efficient and so is the other
one and it's all also source water block

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,010
one and it's all also source water block
 

367
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,889
one and it's all also source water block
so they climb fast up the elevator then

368
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:24,899
so they climb fast up the elevator then
 

369
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,600
so they climb fast up the elevator then
in my little viewing area here I have

370
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:26,610
in my little viewing area here I have
 

371
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,560
in my little viewing area here I have
half blocks and I'm going to expand it

372
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:30,570
half blocks and I'm going to expand it
 

373
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,160
half blocks and I'm going to expand it
here half blocks or so that nothing

374
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,170
here half blocks or so that nothing
 

375
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:39,530
here half blocks or so that nothing
spawns in this safe area let's switch to

376
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:39,540
spawns in this safe area let's switch to
 

377
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,470
spawns in this safe area let's switch to
easy and hopefully we can see some guys

378
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
easy and hopefully we can see some guys
 

379
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:50,400
easy and hopefully we can see some guys
going through here

380
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:50,410

 

381
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:57,250

put some little lights so another issue

382
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:57,260
put some little lights so another issue
 

383
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,920
put some little lights so another issue
I had with my old mob trap here comes

384
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:02,930
I had with my old mob trap here comes
 

385
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:14,110
I had with my old mob trap here comes
some skeletons pushed over and push

386
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:14,120
some skeletons pushed over and push
 

387
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,400
some skeletons pushed over and push
through there there's no air spaces

388
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,410
through there there's no air spaces
 

389
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,020
through there there's no air spaces
there so they just keep going straight

390
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,030
there so they just keep going straight
 

391
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:25,170
there so they just keep going straight
odd time a guy will get stuck over here

392
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,180
odd time a guy will get stuck over here
 

393
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,760
odd time a guy will get stuck over here
not really a big issue because as soon

394
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:27,770
not really a big issue because as soon
 

395
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,260
not really a big issue because as soon
as someone else comes along he gets

396
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:29,270
as someone else comes along he gets
 

397
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:42,760
as someone else comes along he gets
pushed into this water

398
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:42,770

 

399
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,610

so it works pretty good I'm quite happy

400
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:45,620
so it works pretty good I'm quite happy
 

401
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,510
so it works pretty good I'm quite happy
with it it's a huge improvement over the

402
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
with it it's a huge improvement over the
 

403
00:17:49,520 --> 00:18:00,330
with it it's a huge improvement over the
last one

404
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:00,340

 

405
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,860

I'm hoping a spider will come through so

406
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:02,870
I'm hoping a spider will come through so
 

407
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:16,330
I'm hoping a spider will come through so
I can show you what happens Hey

408
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:16,340
I can show you what happens Hey
 

409
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,159
I can show you what happens Hey
keeper keeper okay there's some spiders

410
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:21,169
keeper keeper okay there's some spiders
 

411
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:31,500
keeper keeper okay there's some spiders
Hey

412
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:31,510

 

413
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:40,400

Hey nope

414
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,410
Hey nope
 

415
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:45,860
Hey nope
this is the only exception for peaceful

416
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:45,870
this is the only exception for peaceful
 

417
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:53,060
this is the only exception for peaceful
is when I'm working down here

418
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,070

 

419
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,900

I'm going to show you these spawning

420
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:57,910
I'm going to show you these spawning
 

421
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:03,260
I'm going to show you these spawning
sections

422
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,270

 

423
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:17,240

so again I'm using a 16 by 16 pattern

424
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,250

 

425
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,990

and it's uh each of these pads is 14 by

426
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,000
and it's uh each of these pads is 14 by
 

427
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,330
and it's uh each of these pads is 14 by
14 and then there's a water on the

428
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:29,340
14 and then there's a water on the
 

429
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:41,330
14 and then there's a water on the
outside get some light in here

430
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:41,340

 

431
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,940

okay another thing I was doing in my old

432
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:46,950
okay another thing I was doing in my old
 

433
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,920
okay another thing I was doing in my old
my old mob trap I had three wide streams

434
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:49,930
my old mob trap I had three wide streams
 

435
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,340
my old mob trap I had three wide streams
we're only using two now they seem to

436
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:53,350
we're only using two now they seem to
 

437
00:19:53,350 --> 00:20:00,180
we're only using two now they seem to
work just as well if not better and also

438
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,190
work just as well if not better and also
 

439
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:05,340
work just as well if not better and also
I've tried creating a steady stream with

440
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:05,350
I've tried creating a steady stream with
 

441
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,030
I've tried creating a steady stream with
no gaps and I found a doing that

442
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,040
no gaps and I found a doing that
 

443
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,630
no gaps and I found a doing that
actually makes it worse because what

444
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
actually makes it worse because what
 

445
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,800
actually makes it worse because what
happens is mobs go into this thing here

446
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:16,810
happens is mobs go into this thing here
 

447
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,500
happens is mobs go into this thing here
even though they keep going straight

448
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:18,510
even though they keep going straight
 

449
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,660
even though they keep going straight
they sometimes hop up onto these pads

450
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:23,670

 

451
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:29,160

kind of like this and then they get out

452
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,170
kind of like this and then they get out
 

453
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,870
kind of like this and then they get out
of the stream so these things weren't

454
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:30,880
of the stream so these things weren't
 

455
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,590
of the stream so these things weren't
working too well I even tried covering

456
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:34,600
working too well I even tried covering
 

457
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:43,080
working too well I even tried covering
them like that but then what happens is

458
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,090
them like that but then what happens is
 

459
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,750
them like that but then what happens is
they kind of get stuck getting into

460
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:45,760
they kind of get stuck getting into
 

461
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,990
they kind of get stuck getting into
these things and also decreases amount

462
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
these things and also decreases amount
 

463
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,580
these things and also decreases amount
of area where they can fall down into

464
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:53,590
of area where they can fall down into
 

465
00:20:53,590 --> 00:21:00,690
of area where they can fall down into
the streams so I got rid of doing it

466
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:00,700
the streams so I got rid of doing it
 

467
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,779
the streams so I got rid of doing it
this way

468
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:06,789

 

469
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:11,159

and there's about seven of these pads I

470
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:11,169
and there's about seven of these pads I
 

471
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,299
and there's about seven of these pads I
really hate the hanging these things out

472
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:13,309
really hate the hanging these things out
 

473
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:17,139
really hate the hanging these things out
so from now on I'm probably just going

474
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:17,149
so from now on I'm probably just going
 

475
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:31,090
so from now on I'm probably just going
to use T and T to expand this and T and

476
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,100
to use T and T to expand this and T and
 

477
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:38,229
to use T and T to expand this and T and
T mining is a lot of fun basically all

478
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:38,239
T mining is a lot of fun basically all
 

479
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:39,399
T mining is a lot of fun basically all
you got to do is put it in a hole like

480
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:39,409
you got to do is put it in a hole like
 

481
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:41,399
you got to do is put it in a hole like
this and it blows out a three by three

482
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:41,409
this and it blows out a three by three
 

483
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:46,450
this and it blows out a three by three
by three area and you just hit it and

484
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:46,460
by three area and you just hit it and
 

485
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:57,549
by three area and you just hit it and
run and it blows out a perfect three by

486
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:57,559
run and it blows out a perfect three by
 

487
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,599
run and it blows out a perfect three by
three by three area so to make one of

488
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:01,609
three by three area so to make one of
 

489
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:03,789
three by three area so to make one of
these pads you're going to need about 15

490

these pads you're going to need about 15
 

491
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:10,450
these pads you're going to need about 15
TNT and in total life I've got 15 on me

492
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:10,460
TNT and in total life I've got 15 on me
 

493
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,119
TNT and in total life I've got 15 on me
and probably another 20 in in the base

494
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:15,129
and probably another 20 in in the base
 

495
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:19,690
and probably another 20 in in the base
if you're worried about like it by a

glass blocks over here the TT blowing up

498
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
glass blocks over here the TT blowing up
 

499
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,080
glass blocks over here the TT blowing up
would probably blow up the glass box too

500
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,090
would probably blow up the glass box too
 

501
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,289
would probably blow up the glass box too
so one thing you can do is hit it and

502
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:29,299
so one thing you can do is hit it and
 

503
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:36,039
so one thing you can do is hit it and
cover it up and then less stuff will get

504
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:36,049
cover it up and then less stuff will get
 

505
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:38,950
cover it up and then less stuff will get
wrecked and your the TNT you'll notice

506
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
wrecked and your the TNT you'll notice
 

507
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,859
wrecked and your the TNT you'll notice
the torch didn't blow up and if that's

508
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:44,869
the torch didn't blow up and if that's
 

509
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,710
the torch didn't blow up and if that's
too challenging for you another thing

510
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:47,720
too challenging for you another thing
 

511
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,019
too challenging for you another thing
you can do I think I've never tried this

512
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:50,029
you can do I think I've never tried this
 

513
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:54,070
you can do I think I've never tried this
before cover it up if you got a button

514
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,080
before cover it up if you got a button
 

515
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,340
before cover it up if you got a button
with you

516
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:56,350
with you
 

517
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:00,870
with you
I think you can place the button and

518
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:00,880
I think you can place the button and
 

519
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:08,210
I think you can place the button and
when they then do is press a button here

520
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:08,220

 

521
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,560

yeah it doesn't destroy the button so

522
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:10,570
yeah it doesn't destroy the button so
 

523
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,960
yeah it doesn't destroy the button so
you just keep reusing the same button if

524
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:12,970
you just keep reusing the same button if
 

525
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:21,000
you just keep reusing the same button if
you want to do it a little safer so very

526
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,010
you want to do it a little safer so very
 

527
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:34,740
you want to do it a little safer so very
fun way to go mining very fastly and I

528
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:34,750
fun way to go mining very fastly and I
 

529
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,360
fun way to go mining very fastly and I
think that's all I wanted to show you

530
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,370
think that's all I wanted to show you
 

531
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,020
think that's all I wanted to show you
this episode maybe one more thing so I'm

532
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,030
this episode maybe one more thing so I'm
 

533
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,380
this episode maybe one more thing so I'm
going to keep expanding this and then

534
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:42,390
going to keep expanding this and then
 

535
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:48,060
going to keep expanding this and then
the mob trap will work faster oh yeah

536
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,070
the mob trap will work faster oh yeah
 

537
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,430
the mob trap will work faster oh yeah
you'll notice with my corners now before

538
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:50,440
you'll notice with my corners now before
 

539
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,650
you'll notice with my corners now before
I had pressure plates at every corner

540
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:54,660
I had pressure plates at every corner
 

541
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,500
I had pressure plates at every corner
with this one now all the streams that

542
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:58,510
with this one now all the streams that
 

543
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:03,240
with this one now all the streams that
keep going around the corners and then I

544
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,250
keep going around the corners and then I
 

545
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,090
keep going around the corners and then I
have the pressure plates two blocks away

546
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:06,100
have the pressure plates two blocks away
 

547
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:13,220
have the pressure plates two blocks away
from that edge one two pressure plates

548
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,230

 

549
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:21,380

and then this is eight long

550
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,390

 

551
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:25,970

and the same thing over here two blocks

552
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:25,980
and the same thing over here two blocks
 

553
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:33,789
and the same thing over here two blocks
from this edge one two pressure plates

554
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:33,799

 

555
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:37,789

and from this same thing and that seems

556
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:37,799
and from this same thing and that seems
 

557
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,910
and from this same thing and that seems
to work very good if you're using this

558
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:39,920
to work very good if you're using this
 

559
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:47,840
to work very good if you're using this
16 by 16 pattern and I ran into the eats

560
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:47,850
16 by 16 pattern and I ran into the eats
 

561
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,870

Road over there so like stop building

562
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:49,880
Road over there so like stop building
 

563
00:24:49,880 --> 00:25:01,850
Road over there so like stop building
over there so we're running out of time

564
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:01,860
over there so we're running out of time
 

565
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,409
over there so we're running out of time
there's this one last thing I wanted to

566
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:03,419
there's this one last thing I wanted to
 

567
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:09,830
there's this one last thing I wanted to
talk about this was an idea I had for

568
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:09,840
talk about this was an idea I had for
 

569
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,960
talk about this was an idea I had for
the storage room and I ripped it out

570
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:11,970
the storage room and I ripped it out
 

571
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,890
the storage room and I ripped it out
because I thought of better ways of

572
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:15,900
because I thought of better ways of
 

573
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:22,580
because I thought of better ways of
doing it is for the dispensers the other

574
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:22,590
doing it is for the dispensers the other
 

575
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,260
doing it is for the dispensers the other
thing I wanted to tell you about is I

plan on hooking up a wooden pressure

578
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,400
plan on hooking up a wooden pressure
 

579
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:34,490
plan on hooking up a wooden pressure
plate here and so when when items come

580
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:34,500
plate here and so when when items come
 

581
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,169
plate here and so when when items come
to the pressure plate it's going to

582
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:36,179
to the pressure plate it's going to
 

583
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:39,020
to the pressure plate it's going to
light up an indicator light to show that

584
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,030
light up an indicator light to show that
 

585
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,690
light up an indicator light to show that
there's items here and there's no items

586
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:41,700
there's items here and there's no items
 

587
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,350
there's items here and there's no items
here the light will be off and I also

588
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,360
here the light will be off and I also
 

589
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,380
here the light will be off and I also
want to hook up a timer to it so that

590
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,390
want to hook up a timer to it so that
 

591
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:51,830
want to hook up a timer to it so that
after about four and a half minutes to

592
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
after about four and a half minutes to
 

593
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,659
after about four and a half minutes to
five minutes the light is going to start

594
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:53,669
five minutes the light is going to start
 

595
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:56,330
five minutes the light is going to start
flashing on and off quickly to indicate

596
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:56,340
flashing on and off quickly to indicate
 

597
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,720
flashing on and off quickly to indicate
that the items are about to disappear

598
00:25:59,720 --> 00:25:59,730
that the items are about to disappear
 

599
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:04,909
that the items are about to disappear
and that I should pick them up so I'm

600
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:04,919
and that I should pick them up so I'm
 

601
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,299
and that I should pick them up so I'm
going to need to use a about a four and

602
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:08,309
going to need to use a about a four and
 

603
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:14,770
going to need to use a about a four and
a half minute timer to do that and

604
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:14,780

 

605
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,570

problem is most people use redstone to

606
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:17,580
problem is most people use redstone to
 

607
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,700
problem is most people use redstone to
do that type of thing and if I was to

608
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:19,710
do that type of thing and if I was to
 

609
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,600
do that type of thing and if I was to
use redstone it's going to be huge so

610
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:23,610
use redstone it's going to be huge so
 

611
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,760
use redstone it's going to be huge so
I'm going to have to invent another way

612
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:25,770
I'm going to have to invent another way
 

613
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,950
I'm going to have to invent another way
of doing it and I plan on using

614
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:28,960
of doing it and I plan on using
 

615
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,360
of doing it and I plan on using
boats water and so sand so next episode

616
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:34,370
boats water and so sand so next episode
 

617
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,590
boats water and so sand so next episode
I think we're going to go into the

618
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
I think we're going to go into the
 

619
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,520
I think we're going to go into the
nether to find some slow sand so until

620
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:39,530
nether to find some slow sand so until
 

621
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,040
nether to find some slow sand so until
then thanks for watching

622
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,050
then thanks for watching
 

623
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,070
then thanks for watching
and if you want me to make a tutorial of

624
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,080
and if you want me to make a tutorial of
 

625
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,060
and if you want me to make a tutorial of
this just keep the keep reminding me and

626
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,070
this just keep the keep reminding me and
 

627
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,330
this just keep the keep reminding me and
I'll probably eventually do it
