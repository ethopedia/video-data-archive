now
 

11
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,550
now
i just got back from caving around this

12
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,560
i just got back from caving around this
 

13
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,230
i just got back from caving around this
area i'm trying to make it go quicker

14
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
area i'm trying to make it go quicker
 

15
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,910
area i'm trying to make it go quicker
get better rates

16
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920
get better rates
 

17
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,509
get better rates
and had a good run got lots of stuff

18
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
and had a good run got lots of stuff
 

19
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,550
and had a good run got lots of stuff
but yeah it's still really

20
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
but yeah it's still really
 

21
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,069
but yeah it's still really
really slow so i gotta do a lot more

22
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
really slow so i gotta do a lot more
 

23
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,990
really slow so i gotta do a lot more
caving it seems

24
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
caving it seems
 

25
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,510
caving it seems
if we look up our entity it

26
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
if we look up our entity it
 

27
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,510
if we look up our entity it
like it's not even really going above 10

28
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
like it's not even really going above 10
 

29
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,110
like it's not even really going above 10
so

30
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
so
 

31
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,510
so
there's it's not like it's not like

32
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
there's it's not like it's not like
 

33
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,110
there's it's not like it's not like
they're stuck up there they're just not

34
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
they're stuck up there they're just not
 

35
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,310
they're stuck up there they're just not
spawning up there

36
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
spawning up there
 

37
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,110
spawning up there
and it's uh it's a bit frustrating

38
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
and it's uh it's a bit frustrating
 

39
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,069
and it's uh it's a bit frustrating
because i've

40
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
because i've
 

41
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,830
because i've
i've lit up so many caves around here

42
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
i've lit up so many caves around here
 

43
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,630
i've lit up so many caves around here
and it's still slow

44
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
and it's still slow
 

45
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,990
and it's still slow
um some of it might be because i have

46
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
um some of it might be because i have
 

47
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,029
um some of it might be because i have
slime spawning in this area but even

48
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
slime spawning in this area but even
 

49
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,389
slime spawning in this area but even
still it shouldn't make that big of a

50
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
still it shouldn't make that big of a
 

51
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,429
still it shouldn't make that big of a
difference

52
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439

 

53
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:11,750

um yeah i got a lot of stuff around here

54
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760

 

55
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,109

lots of stuff

56
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119

 

57
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,789

um actually i'm just gonna unload real

58
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
um actually i'm just gonna unload real
 

59
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,350
um actually i'm just gonna unload real
quick

60
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
quick
 

61
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,630
quick
uh let's go

62
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640

 

63
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,830

let's go check actually i might need

64
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
let's go check actually i might need
 

65
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,310
let's go check actually i might need
that

66
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
that
 

67
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,469
that
where'd it go over there let's go check

68
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
where'd it go over there let's go check
 

69
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,429
where'd it go over there let's go check
things out here

70
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
things out here
 

71
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,630
things out here
okay um

72
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
okay um
 

73
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,149
okay um
i haven't really worked in this area

74
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
i haven't really worked in this area
 

75
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,670
i haven't really worked in this area
much i am doing

76
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
much i am doing
 

77
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,630
much i am doing
something with the silverfish right now

78
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
something with the silverfish right now
 

79
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,510
something with the silverfish right now
which we might get to today

80
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
which we might get to today
 

81
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,310
which we might get to today
but that's it's work in progress

82
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320

 

83
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,950

this is how i get out of here right now

84
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
this is how i get out of here right now
 

85
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,149
this is how i get out of here right now
it's not

86
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
it's not
 

87
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,350
it's not
it's not ideal it's the only way out

88
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
it's not ideal it's the only way out
 

89
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,350
it's not ideal it's the only way out
i need to move the slider or something

90
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360

 

91
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,389

or i could go through the nether

92
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
or i could go through the nether
 

93
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,709
or i could go through the nether
but yeah let's go to an extreme machine

94
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
but yeah let's go to an extreme machine
 

95
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,429
but yeah let's go to an extreme machine
and just

96
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439

 

97
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,429

have a look around i'm still getting

98
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
have a look around i'm still getting
 

99
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,229
have a look around i'm still getting
used to that

100
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239

 

101
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,949

very strange to see the sideways logs

102
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959

 

103
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,110

uh but yeah like i got a lot of caves

104
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
uh but yeah like i got a lot of caves
 

105
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,710
uh but yeah like i got a lot of caves
lit up a lot of caves

106
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
lit up a lot of caves
 

107
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,910
lit up a lot of caves
there we go

108
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920

 

109
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,670

and yes i know you can use glowstone i

110
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
and yes i know you can use glowstone i
 

111
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,350
and yes i know you can use glowstone i
like using tnt

112
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
like using tnt
 

113
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,390
like using tnt
it's cooler um

114
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
it's cooler um
 

115
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,750
it's cooler um
there's one dark spot there

116
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
there's one dark spot there
 

117
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,949
there's one dark spot there
um there's a a pool of water there that

118
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
um there's a a pool of water there that
 

119
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,030
um there's a a pool of water there that
needs to be lit up

120
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040

 

121
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,550

but for the most part it like oh i guess

122
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
but for the most part it like oh i guess
 

123
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,790
but for the most part it like oh i guess
that too it's kind of dark that ravine

124
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
that too it's kind of dark that ravine
 

125
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,869
that too it's kind of dark that ravine
and there looks like a tave over there

126
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
and there looks like a tave over there
 

127
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,229
and there looks like a tave over there
so

128
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
so
 

129
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,509
so
oh and that there it's kind of dark

130
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
oh and that there it's kind of dark
 

131
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,190
oh and that there it's kind of dark
some stuff there but i think that's out

132
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
some stuff there but i think that's out
 

133
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,030
some stuff there but i think that's out
of range already

134
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
of range already
 

135
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,550
of range already
but yeah i got a lot lit up

136
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
but yeah i got a lot lit up
 

137
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,350
but yeah i got a lot lit up
um maybe let's check the other one i'll

138
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
um maybe let's check the other one i'll
 

139
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,949
um maybe let's check the other one i'll
stop recording for a sec while i walk

140
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
stop recording for a sec while i walk
 

141
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,630
stop recording for a sec while i walk
there

142
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
there
 

143
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,710
there
okay here's the other one so these are

144
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
okay here's the other one so these are
 

145
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,990
okay here's the other one so these are
100 blocks

146
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
100 blocks
 

147
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,790
100 blocks
away from that thing uh like 100 blocks

148
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
away from that thing uh like 100 blocks
 

149
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,270
away from that thing uh like 100 blocks
on the x coordinates and 100 on the zed

150
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
on the x coordinates and 100 on the zed
 

151
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,470
on the x coordinates and 100 on the zed
so it's actually further than 100.

152
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
so it's actually further than 100.
 

153
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,949
so it's actually further than 100.
it's uh what do you times it by 1.4 or

154
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
it's uh what do you times it by 1.4 or
 

155
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,550
it's uh what do you times it by 1.4 or
something i can't remember

156
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
something i can't remember
 

157
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,430
something i can't remember
oh now i gotta figure it out square root

158
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
oh now i gotta figure it out square root
 

159
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,390
oh now i gotta figure it out square root
of two

160
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
of two
 

161
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,750
of two
is

162
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760

 

163
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,710

got my calculator one point four one

164
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
got my calculator one point four one
 

165
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,589
got my calculator one point four one
point four so

166
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
point four so
 

167
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,030
point four so
times a hundred about 141

168
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
times a hundred about 141
 

169
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,309
times a hundred about 141
blocks away from the mob system so it's

170
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
blocks away from the mob system so it's
 

171
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,710
blocks away from the mob system so it's
this is like the border of where mobs

172
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
this is like the border of where mobs
 

173
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,910
this is like the border of where mobs
will spawn if i'm

174
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
will spawn if i'm
 

175
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,910
will spawn if i'm
at the mob system okay this one there's

176
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
at the mob system okay this one there's
 

177
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,110
at the mob system okay this one there's
a lot more darkness

178
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
a lot more darkness
 

179
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,070
a lot more darkness
look at all this but pretty sure that's

180
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
look at all this but pretty sure that's
 

181
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,070
look at all this but pretty sure that's
out of the range most of it but

182
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
out of the range most of it but
 

183
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,990
out of the range most of it but
this this over here is within range

184
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
this this over here is within range
 

185
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,990
this this over here is within range
i'm guessing this big pocket thing here

186
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
i'm guessing this big pocket thing here
 

187
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,550
i'm guessing this big pocket thing here
is blocking my view of a lot of it

188
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560

 

189
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,229

okay i'm gonna set up two more of these

190
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
okay i'm gonna set up two more of these
 

191
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,069
okay i'm gonna set up two more of these
one over that way

192
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
one over that way
 

193
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,670
one over that way
and another one uh opposite of here

194
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
and another one uh opposite of here
 

195
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,189
and another one uh opposite of here
and just take a look around too

196
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199

 

197
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,110

okay we're over here now you can just

198
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
okay we're over here now you can just
 

199
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,629
okay we're over here now you can just
see the top of the mob

200
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
see the top of the mob
 

201
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,870
see the top of the mob
system right there we are here

202
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
system right there we are here
 

203
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,590
system right there we are here
again 100 and 100 away

204
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
again 100 and 100 away
 

205
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,790
again 100 and 100 away
i wasn't expecting there to be any caves

206
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
i wasn't expecting there to be any caves
 

207
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,150
i wasn't expecting there to be any caves
in this quadrant but look at this

208
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
in this quadrant but look at this
 

209
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,390
in this quadrant but look at this
like like unexplored caves i mean

210
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
like like unexplored caves i mean
 

211
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,670
like like unexplored caves i mean

a bit of stuff there i think that's out
 

241
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,909
a bit of stuff there i think that's out
of range

242
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
of range
 

243
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,110
of range
uh that down there though is definitely

244
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
uh that down there though is definitely
 

245
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,070
uh that down there though is definitely
within range

246
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
within range
 

247
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,990
within range
i have to get to that that's a big

248
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
i have to get to that that's a big
 

249
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,189
i have to get to that that's a big
section

250
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
section
 

251
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,310
section
right below us

252
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320

 

253
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,350

there's something there oh some surface

254
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
there's something there oh some surface
 

255
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,350
there's something there oh some surface
stuff over there and i'm sure in these

256
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
stuff over there and i'm sure in these
 

257
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,990
stuff over there and i'm sure in these
mountains there's a lot of stuff too

258
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
mountains there's a lot of stuff too
 

259
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,909
mountains there's a lot of stuff too
uh-huh so we're just trying to get a

260
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
uh-huh so we're just trying to get a
 

261
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,150
uh-huh so we're just trying to get a
perspective of how many keys i have to

262
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
perspective of how many keys i have to
 

263
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,350
perspective of how many keys i have to
light up yet

264
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
light up yet
 

265
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,710
light up yet
something there too looks like oh

266
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
something there too looks like oh
 

267
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,230
something there too looks like oh
so yeah there's more here than i thought

268
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
so yeah there's more here than i thought
 

269
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,309
so yeah there's more here than i thought
there's going to be let's check out the

270
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
there's going to be let's check out the
 

271
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,590
there's going to be let's check out the
last quadrant

272
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
last quadrant
 

273
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,150
last quadrant
a hundred uh 200 blocks this way

274
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160

 

275
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,870

okay this is the last quadrant i haven't

276
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
okay this is the last quadrant i haven't
 

277
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,230
okay this is the last quadrant i haven't
checked it yet i don't know

278
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
checked it yet i don't know
 

279
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,270
checked it yet i don't know
what to expect really i'm i'm guessing

280
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280

what to expect really i'm i'm guessing
it might be

282
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
it might be
 

283
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,990
it might be
pretty unlit underground uh for a

284
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
pretty unlit underground uh for a
 

285
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,909
pretty unlit underground uh for a
perspective of where we are

286
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
perspective of where we are
 

287
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,590
perspective of where we are
uh the village where we got the

288
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
uh the village where we got the
 

289
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,670
uh the village where we got the
villagers is over there

290
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,680
villagers is over there
 

291

00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
and our base the man cave is that way
 

293
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,790
and our base the man cave is that way
the ice tray is over in there

294
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
the ice tray is over in there
 

295
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,950
the ice tray is over in there
and the sand pit is that way

296
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
and the sand pit is that way

510
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800

 

511
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,990

you know i don't know how to make a

512
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
you know i don't know how to make a

before
 

517
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,829
before
oh boy

518
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839

 

519
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,269

all right

520
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279

 

521
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,470

okay i thought that was gonna look

522
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
okay i thought that was gonna look
 

523
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,389
okay i thought that was gonna look
better it didn't though

524
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
better it didn't though
 

525
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,150
better it didn't though
i guess what i could try to do

526
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
i guess what i could try to do
 

527
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,269
i guess what i could try to do
align it

528
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279

 

529
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:07,670

see how it looks if it's any better

530
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680

 

531
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:19,350

to do yeah it's like

532
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360

 

533
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,550

it's almost like it's too wide or oh

534
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
it's almost like it's too wide or oh
 

535
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,069
it's almost like it's too wide or oh
that's probably what i gotta do maybe

536
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
that's probably what i gotta do maybe
 

537
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,710
that's probably what i gotta do maybe
have to make it a block higher

538
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720

 

539
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,910

okay let's see how this looks

540
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
okay let's see how this looks
 

541
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,310
okay let's see how this looks
again it's gonna be swamp watercolor

542
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
again it's gonna be swamp watercolor
 

543
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,910
again it's gonna be swamp watercolor
which doesn't look that bad it's not as

544
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
which doesn't look that bad it's not as
 

545
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,629
which doesn't look that bad it's not as
green as

546
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
green as
 

547
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:47,990
green as
it used to be i don't think

548
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000

 

549
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,829

well anyway we'll keep at that for now

550
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839

skylight right above the center
2x2 of this thing and then we're going

558
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
2x2 of this thing and then we're going
 

559
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,110
2x2 of this thing and then we're going
to try to put some doors underneath it

560
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120

 

561
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,389

567
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,110

actually i just want to try it with

568
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
actually i just want to try it with
 

569
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,750
actually i just want to try it with
cobble here so we could do this

570
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
cobble here so we could do this
 

571
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:23,269
cobble here so we could do this
or we could also extend it

572
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279

 

573
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,150

00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160

 

575
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,430

and there's one more thing i want to try

576
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
and there's one more thing i want to try
 

577
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,310
and there's one more thing i want to try
to just see what it looks like

578
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
to just see what it looks like
 

579
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,190

and see how that looks if it comes all
the way down from the ceiling

600
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480

 

601

reference sonic the hedgehog
in one of the gamecube

648
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:38,720
in one of the gamecube
 

649
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,389
in one of the gamecube
versions of the game there was a level

650
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
versions of the game there was a level
 

651
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,150
versions of the game there was a level
called emerald city

652
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
called emerald city
 

653
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,629
called emerald city
which is where i got the name from and

654
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
which is where i got the name from and
 

655
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,430
which is where i got the name from and
because we're using emeralds as our main

656
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
because we're using emeralds as our main
 

657
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,269
because we're using emeralds as our main
block type

658
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279

 

659
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,949

but yeah you know what i would really

660
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
but yeah you know what i would really
 

661
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,310
but yeah you know what i would really
like to do is have lava coming down

662
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
like to do is have lava coming down
 

663
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,670
like to do is have lava coming down
and maybe some iron bars and hmm

664
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
and maybe some iron bars and hmm
 

665
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,509
and maybe some iron bars and hmm
but if we do that the idea of them

666
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
but if we do that the idea of them
 

667
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,870
but if we do that the idea of them
swimming up through here is

668
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
swimming up through here is
 

669
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,790
swimming up through here is
totally out the window

670
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
totally out the window
 

671
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,629
totally out the window
okay so this is another idea of how we

672
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:10,639
okay so this is another idea of how we
 

673
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,910
okay so this is another idea of how we
could do

674
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
could do
 

675
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,790
could do
a water feature in the center uh this is

676
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
a water feature in the center uh this is
 

677
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,269
a water feature in the center uh this is
probably

678
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
probably
 

679
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,470
probably
my favorite if you guys have a favorite

680
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480

technical with
because the villagers they aren't able

726
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
because the villagers they aren't able
 

727
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,990
because the villagers they aren't able
to swim into these

728
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
to swim into these
 

729
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,110
to swim into these
sides if i have these stairs here and

730
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
sides if i have these stairs here and
 

731
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,189
sides if i have these stairs here and
it's just a two by two thing of water

732
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
it's just a two by two thing of water
 

733
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,829
it's just a two by two thing of water
even though it looks wider and i could

734
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
even though it looks wider and i could
 

735
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,710
even though it looks wider and i could
do solid

736
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
do solid
 

737
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,309
do solid
water source blocks all the way up so

738
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
water source blocks all the way up so
 

739
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,150
water source blocks all the way up so
they can swim up quicker

740
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
they can swim up quicker
 

741
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,390
they can swim up quicker
instead of getting sucked down

742
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:30,400

 

743
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,710

here i'm going to connect
 

763
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,950
here i'm going to connect
each direction we did here it's going to

764
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
each direction we did here it's going to
 

765
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,950
each direction we did here it's going to
connect to one of the houses

766
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960

 

767
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,110

all four ways

768

um there's gonna be some redstone
involved with this

772
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799

 

773
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,870

as well but what i plan on doing is

774

as long as we i think i'm rambling a bit
 

783
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,070
as long as we i think i'm rambling a bit
i think if if the sunlight passes

784
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
i think if if the sunlight passes
 

785
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,750
i think if if the sunlight passes
through the water it still counts as a

786
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
through the water it still counts as a
 

787
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,950
through the water it still counts as a
valid door

788
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:42,960
valid door
 

789
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,549
valid door
i think i think transparent blocks still

790
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
i think i think transparent blocks still
 

791
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,510
i think i think transparent blocks still
count if they don't this idea is not

792
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
count if they don't this idea is not
 

793
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,950
count if they don't this idea is not
going to work at all

794
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
going to work at all
 

795
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,549

there's going to be i think dispensers
 

819
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,390
there's going to be i think dispensers
here

820
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
here
 

821
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,669

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
like some trip wire here
 

825
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,110
like some trip wire here
that if they pass it's going to turn the

00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
that if they pass it's going to turn the
 

827
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,150
that if they pass it's going to turn the
water on push them to the middle

828
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
water on push them to the middle
 

829
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,630
water on push them to the middle
to a mob evader and they'll swim up and

830
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:36,640
to a mob evader and they'll swim up and
 

831
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,310
to a mob evader and they'll swim up and
that will tell

these lights will come
off and also we're gonna have to dig

842
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:55,039
off and also we're gonna have to dig
 

843
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,070
off and also we're gonna have to dig
like a hole down here with another set

844
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,080
like a hole down here with another set
 

845
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,750
like a hole down here with another set
of trip wire

846
00:19:59,750 --> 00:19:59,760
of trip wire
 

847
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,990
of trip wire
uh they should fall down a three block

848
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,000
uh they should fall down a three block
 

849
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,950
uh they should fall down a three block
drop like that and if we have tripwire

850
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:04,960
drop like that and if we have tripwire
 

851
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,270
drop like that and if we have tripwire
at this level

852
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,280

 

853
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,270

it'll turn the lights on when they fall

854
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
it'll turn the lights on when they fall
 

855
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,549
it'll turn the lights on when they fall
down there but they won't be able to

856
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:12,559
down there but they won't be able to
 

857
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,149
down there but they won't be able to
come out through these doors they'll be

858
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,159
come out through these doors they'll be
 

859
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,950
come out through these doors they'll be
underground

860
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960

 

861
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,990

and basically we're adding two

862
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
and basically we're adding two
 

863
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,510
and basically we're adding two
doors to this house that are underground

864
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,520
doors to this house that are underground
 

865
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,310
doors to this house that are underground
here still following me i hope you are

866
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
here still following me i hope you are
 

867
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,669
here still following me i hope you are
so when they go through here it's like

868
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
so when they go through here it's like
 

869
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,110
so when they go through here it's like
they're going outside

870
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
they're going outside
 

871
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,590
they're going outside
because the sunlight's over here as well

872
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600
because the sunlight's over here as well
 

873
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,230
because the sunlight's over here as well
and it's the only way out

874
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,240
and it's the only way out
 

875
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,830
and it's the only way out
so that's that's what i'm planning here

876
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:39,840
so that's that's what i'm planning here
 

877
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,390
so that's that's what i'm planning here
i'm gonna work at cleaning this up a bit

878
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
i'm gonna work at cleaning this up a bit
 

879
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,190
i'm gonna work at cleaning this up a bit
and we'll

880
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
and we'll
 

881
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,070
and we'll
see how it goes

882
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
see how it goes
 

883
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,909
see how it goes
okay so this is what we got so far um

884
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:51,919
okay so this is what we got so far um
 

885
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,750
okay so this is what we got so far um
let's pretend we're a villager it turns

886
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
let's pretend we're a villager it turns
 

887
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,470
let's pretend we're a villager it turns
night i'm scared i'm scared

888

run inside close the door

890
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,480
run inside close the door
 

891
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,190
run inside close the door
safe after a little while of derping

892
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,200
safe after a little while of derping
 

893
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,710
safe after a little while of derping
around in here they should fall down

894
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
around in here they should fall down
 

895
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,990
around in here they should fall down
this hole

896
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,000
this hole
 

897
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,870
this hole
i might have to make ways of uh making

898
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
i might have to make ways of uh making
 

899
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,590
i might have to make ways of uh making
that happen

900
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
that happen
 

901
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,029
that happen
sooner but they'll land on these

902
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:11,039
sooner but they'll land on these
 

903
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,830
sooner but they'll land on these
pressure plates which will trigger an rs

904
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
pressure plates which will trigger an rs
 

905
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,149
pressure plates which will trigger an rs
nor latch and when that triggers

906
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
nor latch and when that triggers
 

907
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,310
nor latch and when that triggers
the lights turn on over there and also

908
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
the lights turn on over there and also
 

909
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,909
the lights turn on over there and also
it will retract the water that's out

910
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919
it will retract the water that's out
 

911
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:24,870
it will retract the water that's out
here

912
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:24,880
here
 

913
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,390
here
okay but yeah they're derping around in

914
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
okay but yeah they're derping around in
 

915
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,950
okay but yeah they're derping around in
here

916
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:28,960
here
 

917
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,470
here
during the night they're safe from

918
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,480
during the night they're safe from
 

919
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,350
during the night they're safe from
zombies even if there's a zombie siege

920
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
zombies even if there's a zombie siege
 

921
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,110
zombies even if there's a zombie siege
they'll all be isolated in their own

922
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
they'll all be isolated in their own
 

923
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,190
they'll all be isolated in their own
chambers so they should be

924
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,200
chambers so they should be
 

925
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,710
chambers so they should be
okay i would think

926
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720

 

927
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,669

all right then it turns day oh and they

928
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:43,679
all right then it turns day oh and they
 

929
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,510
all right then it turns day oh and they
can see its day from

930
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
can see its day from
 

931
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,310
can see its day from
here because it's within five blocks and

932
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
here because it's within five blocks and
 

933
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,789
here because it's within five blocks and
they decide to go outside

934
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
they decide to go outside
 

935
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,110
they decide to go outside
and got dispensers with water

936
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,120
and got dispensers with water
 

937
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,950
and got dispensers with water
and these um

938
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
and these um
 

939
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,390
and these um
tripwires tripwires they'll go wander

940
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
tripwires tripwires they'll go wander
 

941
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,870
tripwires tripwires they'll go wander
across there and since these are ahead

942
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:04,880
across there and since these are ahead
 

943
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,149
across there and since these are ahead
of the

944
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:06,159
of the
 

945
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,110
of the
the water they won't be able to go back

946
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
the water they won't be able to go back
 

947
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,510
the water they won't be able to go back
but yeah it'll push them to the center

948
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,520
but yeah it'll push them to the center
 

949
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,110
but yeah it'll push them to the center
then at the center we're going to have

950
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,120
then at the center we're going to have
 

951
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,750
then at the center we're going to have
water sources

952
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:15,760
water sources
 

953
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,630
water sources
there and there and there so when they

954
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:18,640
there and there and there so when they
 

955
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,350
there and there and there so when they
hit those

956
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
hit those
 

957
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,070
hit those
they will start swimming upward up

958
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
they will start swimming upward up
 

959
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,390
they will start swimming upward up
through

960
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,400
through
 

961
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,990
through
here and then out

962
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,000
here and then out
 

963
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,830
here and then out
and the cycle will reset also when they

964
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840
and the cycle will reset also when they
 

965
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,630
and the cycle will reset also when they
go through this trip wire it'll turn the

966
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,640
go through this trip wire it'll turn the
 

967
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,190
go through this trip wire it'll turn the
lights

968
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,200
lights
 

969
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,270
lights
off right

970
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,280
off right
 

971
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,710
off right
i found out something new i didn't know

972
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,720
i found out something new i didn't know
 

973
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,669
i found out something new i didn't know
about tripwire as well you can't um

974
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679
about tripwire as well you can't um
 

975
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,750
about tripwire as well you can't um
you can't have a block underneath the

976
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
you can't have a block underneath the
 

977
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,590
you can't have a block underneath the
hooks like if that's a solid block

978
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:47,600
hooks like if that's a solid block
 

979
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,870
hooks like if that's a solid block
it doesn't work has to be

980
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
it doesn't work has to be
 

981
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,310
it doesn't work has to be
empty underneath apparently

982
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,320

 

983
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,909

but yeah that's where we're at right now

984
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:57,919
but yeah that's where we're at right now
 

985
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,149
but yeah that's where we're at right now
i'm just doing a solid stone brick

986
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
i'm just doing a solid stone brick
 

987
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,230
i'm just doing a solid stone brick
while i put this together and later we

988
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
while i put this together and later we
 

989
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,510
while i put this together and later we
will try to make it cooler

990
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520

 

991
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,630

so yeah do that for all four houses and

992
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:10,640
so yeah do that for all four houses and
 

993
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,789
so yeah do that for all four houses and
i hope it works

994
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
i hope it works
 

995
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,270
i hope it works

which makes me worried that the

998
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,320
which makes me worried that the
 

999
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,990
which makes me worried that the
this doesn't count as valid doors

1000
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,000
this doesn't count as valid doors
 

1001
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,070

1015
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,590
doesn't seem like if the sunlight passes
through the water it counts

1016
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,600
through the water it counts
 

1017
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,190
through the water it counts
which is really too bad

1018
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
which is really too bad
 

1019
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,789
which is really too bad
this worked though like he went through

1020
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
this worked though like he went through
 

1021
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,630
this worked though like he went through
the doors and

1022
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
the doors and
 

1023
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,110
the doors and
now he's stuck there so we can control

1024
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
now he's stuck there so we can control
 

1025
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,830
now he's stuck there so we can control
him with the water

1026
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
him with the water
 

1027
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,510
him with the water
um but yeah

1028
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:03,520
um but yeah
 

1029
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,390
um but yeah
it doesn't work through water uh we

1030
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
it doesn't work through water uh we
 

1031
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,590
it doesn't work through water uh we
could get it to work

1032
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600
could get it to work
 

1033
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,590
could get it to work
like if we

1034
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:11,600

 

1035
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,510

put a transparent block here like a

1036
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,520
put a transparent block here like a
 

1037
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,870
put a transparent block here like a
piston or something

1038
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:18,880
piston or something
 

1039
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,230
piston or something
um like if we did this

1040
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,240
um like if we did this
 

1041
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,510
um like if we did this
not that if we did this

1042
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,520
not that if we did this
 

1043
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,750
not that if we did this
and had sunlight pass through here it

1044
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
and had sunlight pass through here it
 

1045
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,110
and had sunlight pass through here it
would still register

1046
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,120
would still register
 

1047
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,390
would still register
properly oh

1048
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,400
properly oh
 

1049
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,950
properly oh
the guy doesn't know what's going on but

1050
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
the guy doesn't know what's going on but
 

1051
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,990
the guy doesn't know what's going on but
yeah he came here

1052
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000
yeah he came here
 

1053
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,909
yeah he came here
during the night he went through those

1054
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:37,919
during the night he went through those
 

1055
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,590
during the night he went through those
doors at night so he

1056
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:39,600
doors at night so he
 

1057
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,190
doors at night so he
he just sees them as any other door

1058
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
he just sees them as any other door
 

1059
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,590
he just sees them as any other door
they're not outside doors to him

1060
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600
they're not outside doors to him
 

1061
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,950
they're not outside doors to him
with the way this water is

1062
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:46,960
with the way this water is
 

1063
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,070
with the way this water is
but if we did this

1064
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,080

 

1065
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,029

and had sunlight above this then it

1066
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,039
and had sunlight above this then it
 

1067
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,269
and had sunlight above this then it
would work

1068
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:55,279
would work
 

1069
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,269
would work
but then it looks like that and we'd

1070
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:57,279
but then it looks like that and we'd
 

1071
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,789
but then it looks like that and we'd
have to punch more holes

1072
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
have to punch more holes
 

1073
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,350
have to punch more holes
into the ceiling so i don't know what do

1074
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,360
into the ceiling so i don't know what do
 

1075
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,029
into the ceiling so i don't know what do
