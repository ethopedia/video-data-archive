the nether I am so excited I decide to

36
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:53,430
the nether I am so excited I decide to
 

37
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,279
the nether I am so excited I decide to
install the snapshot usually I don't do

38
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:55,289
install the snapshot usually I don't do
 

39
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,369
install the snapshot usually I don't do
that you know there's always risk of

40
00:00:58,369 --> 00:00:58,379
that you know there's always risk of
 

41
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,410
that you know there's always risk of
technical problems and whatnot but I

42
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:00,420
technical problems and whatnot but I
 

43
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,850
technical problems and whatnot but I
think we're gonna be okay with it this

44
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:01,860
think we're gonna be okay with it this
 

45
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,360

all right everybody so here's the deal

48
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:04,800
all right everybody so here's the deal
 

49
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,400
all right everybody so here's the deal
with our world our nether hub is roughly

50
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:07,410
with our world our nether hub is roughly
 

51
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,420
with our world our nether hub is roughly
at 0-0 in the nether it's a little bit

52
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:11,430
at 0-0 in the nether it's a little bit
 

53
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,889
at 0-0 in the nether it's a little bit
off this is the center of our nether hub

54
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:12,899
off this is the center of our nether hub
 

55
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:14,660
off this is the center of our nether hub
like where I'm standing it's like minus

56
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:14,670
like where I'm standing it's like minus
 

57
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,960
like where I'm standing it's like minus
43 and 11 why I didn't just build it at

58
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:17,970
43 and 11 why I didn't just build it at
 

59
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,650
43 and 11 why I didn't just build it at
0-0 I will never know but it's pretty

60
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:21,660
0-0 I will never know but it's pretty
 

61
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,090
0-0 I will never know but it's pretty
close to zero zero that's what counts

62
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,100
close to zero zero that's what counts
 

63
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,530
close to zero zero that's what counts
right um we're gonna go off I think this

64
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:27,540
right um we're gonna go off I think this
 

65
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,140
right um we're gonna go off I think this
Way's our best shot at getting to the

66
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,150
Way's our best shot at getting to the
 

67
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,140
Way's our best shot at getting to the
new nether terrain here so we generated

68
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,150
new nether terrain here so we generated
 

69
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,719
new nether terrain here so we generated
this world during the pre-release that

70
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:38,729
this world during the pre-release that
 

71
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,330
this world during the pre-release that
introduced nether fortresses there

72
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:41,340
introduced nether fortresses there
 

73
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,039
introduced nether fortresses there
hasn't been many nother updates since

74
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:43,049
hasn't been many nother updates since
 

75
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,050
hasn't been many nother updates since
then but there was one that added nether

76
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,060
then but there was one that added nether
 

77
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,780
then but there was one that added nether
quartz and the lab of pockets before

78
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:47,790
quartz and the lab of pockets before
 

79
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,840
quartz and the lab of pockets before
that update came into effect I went

80
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:50,850
that update came into effect I went
 

81
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,700
that update came into effect I went
around my nether like that's that like a

82
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:52,710
around my nether like that's that like a
 

83
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,090
around my nether like that's that like a
2000 by 2000 area centered on the zero

84
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,100
2000 by 2000 area centered on the zero
 

85
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,270
2000 by 2000 area centered on the zero
zero so I know once I go you see we're

86
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
zero so I know once I go you see we're
 

87
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,770
zero so I know once I go you see we're
about to get to minus a thousand on the

88
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:00,780
about to get to minus a thousand on the
 

89
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,139
about to get to minus a thousand on the
Zed coordinate once we hit that point I

90
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:03,149
Zed coordinate once we hit that point I
 

91
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,929
Zed coordinate once we hit that point I
know that nether quartz is gonna start

92
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:05,939
know that nether quartz is gonna start
 

93
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,870
know that nether quartz is gonna start
showing up in lava pockets when I'm

94
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:08,880
showing up in lava pockets when I'm
 

95
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,729
showing up in lava pockets when I'm
within that area I'm safe to dig in the

96
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:10,739
within that area I'm safe to dig in the
 

97
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,110
within that area I'm safe to dig in the
nether and I'll never have to worry

98
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,120
nether and I'll never have to worry
 

99
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,330
nether and I'll never have to worry
about dying from lava appearing out of

100
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:14,340
about dying from lava appearing out of
 

101
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,970
about dying from lava appearing out of
nowhere all right I have gone outside of

102
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:16,980
nowhere all right I have gone outside of
 

103
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,580
nowhere all right I have gone outside of
this 2,000 by 2,000 border though to

104
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:19,590
this 2,000 by 2,000 border though to
 

105
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,440
this 2,000 by 2,000 border though to
hunt the nether quartz and unfortunately

106
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,450
hunt the nether quartz and unfortunately
 

107
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,030
hunt the nether quartz and unfortunately
I've done that in kind of an unorganized

108
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
I've done that in kind of an unorganized
 

109
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,479
I've done that in kind of an unorganized
way so with this new update that

110
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:26,489
way so with this new update that
 

111
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,530
way so with this new update that
introduces new terrain I'm kind of

112
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:30,540
introduces new terrain I'm kind of
 

113
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,020
introduces new terrain I'm kind of
curious how it's gonna happen if it's

114
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,030
curious how it's gonna happen if it's
 

115
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,000
curious how it's gonna happen if it's
gonna have like a bunch of chunk borders

116
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,010
gonna have like a bunch of chunk borders
 

117
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,620
gonna have like a bunch of chunk borders
and stuff we'll find out

118
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:36,630
and stuff we'll find out
 

119
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,630
and stuff we'll find out
but from what I've seen it it doesn't

120
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
but from what I've seen it it doesn't
 

121
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,880
but from what I've seen it it doesn't
actually change the nether generation it

122
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:40,890
actually change the nether generation it
 

123
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,310
actually change the nether generation it
just kind of spins it with the new

124
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:43,320
just kind of spins it with the new
 

125
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,210
just kind of spins it with the new
biomes so I think we'll be okay but we

126
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:47,220
biomes so I think we'll be okay but we
 

127
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,980
biomes so I think we'll be okay but we
should we should get to it like just

128
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:48,990
should we should get to it like just
 

129
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,040
should we should get to it like just
over this way and just go for a bit I

130
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,050
over this way and just go for a bit I
 

131
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:58,910
over this way and just go for a bit I
think nothing yet

132
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:58,920
think nothing yet
 

133
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,050
think nothing yet
maybe I've gone this way I can't

134
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,060
maybe I've gone this way I can't
 

135
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,010
maybe I've gone this way I can't
remember should show up pretty soon here

136
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,020
remember should show up pretty soon here
 

137
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,780
remember should show up pretty soon here
though I would think here we go Oh

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:07,790
though I would think here we go Oh
 

139
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,740
though I would think here we go Oh
hohoho oh yeah the biome switch this is

00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:12,750
hohoho oh yeah the biome switch this is
 

141
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,510
hohoho oh yeah the biome switch this is
the warps is it work does it say work

142
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:17,520
the warps is it work does it say work
 

143

the warps is it work does it say work
forest that's what's called okay this is

144
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:19,800
forest that's what's called okay this is
 

145
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,670
forest that's what's called okay this is
the work force the blue biome with the

the work force the blue biome with the
 

147
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,410
the work force the blue biome with the
warped nether warts right oh there's no

148
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:27,420
warped nether warts right oh there's no
 

149
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,730
warped nether warts right oh there's no
no tool for it dad I didn't expect I

150
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:31,740
no tool for it dad I didn't expect I
 

151
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,070
no tool for it dad I didn't expect I
thought there was a tool for it might be

152
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
thought there was a tool for it might be
 

153
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,710

getting added still this doesn't craft

154
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
getting added still this doesn't craft
 

155
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,440
getting added still this doesn't craft
anything so I know a fair bit about this

156
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:39,450
anything so I know a fair bit about this
 

157
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,060
anything so I know a fair bit about this

update but not everything and so I'm
 

159
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,100
update but not everything and so I'm
kind of kind of exploring it a bit today

160
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,110
kind of kind of exploring it a bit today
 

161
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,590
kind of kind of exploring it a bit today
okay so it turns out that was a very

162
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:45,600
okay so it turns out that was a very
 

163
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,360
okay so it turns out that was a very
tiny section of the new terrain so I

164
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,370
tiny section of the new terrain so I
 

165
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,890
tiny section of the new terrain so I
fool around for a bit I think now I

166
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:48,900
fool around for a bit I think now I
 

167
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,980
fool around for a bit I think now I
found where it actually really begins in

168
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:51,990
found where it actually really begins in
 

169
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,590
found where it actually really begins in
our world here so this is what the chunk

170
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:54,600
our world here so this is what the chunk
 

171
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,140
our world here so this is what the chunk
border looks like so you can see the

172
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,150
border looks like so you can see the
 

173
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,610
border looks like so you can see the
terrain matches like it's the same

174
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:58,620
terrain matches like it's the same
 

175
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,050
terrain matches like it's the same
height on this side on this side there's

176
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,060
height on this side on this side there's
 

177
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,900
height on this side on this side there's
no like big wall or anything so it's

178
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:02,910
no like big wall or anything so it's
 

179
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,000
no like big wall or anything so it's
like exactly the same nether terrain

180
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,010
like exactly the same nether terrain
 

181
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,390
like exactly the same nether terrain
it's just skin differently and yeah so

182
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
it's just skin differently and yeah so
 

183
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,880
it's just skin differently and yeah so
these are the new trees what are they

184
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:10,890
these are the new trees what are they
 

185
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,450
these are the new trees what are they
called

186
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:11,460
called
 

187
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,440
called
we got to get used to all these new

188
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:12,450
we got to get used to all these new
 

189
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:18,080
we got to get used to all these new
names now warp stem this is like like a

00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:19,650
would you enter into planks and stuff
 

193
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,700
would you enter into planks and stuff
which is cool I've heard it's fireproof

194
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:22,710
which is cool I've heard it's fireproof
 

195
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,760
which is cool I've heard it's fireproof
we'll test that out maybe later what's

196
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,770
we'll test that out maybe later what's
 

197
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,520
we'll test that out maybe later what's
this thing

198
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,530
this thing
 

199
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,660
this thing

stuff but I've never noticed the roots
 

209
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:44,000
stuff but I've never noticed the roots
and all the videos I've seen all right

210

yeah these are the two different shrooms
 

213
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,830
yeah these are the two different shrooms
so we got the Crimson fungi that grows

214
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:48,840
so we got the Crimson fungi that grows
 

215
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,240
so we got the Crimson fungi that grows
the red trees and the warp

216
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,250
the red trees and the warp
 

217
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,640

biomes that got introduced the crimson

680
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:42,380
biomes that got introduced the crimson
 

681
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,790
biomes that got introduced the crimson
forest is probably my favorite it's very

682
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:45,800
forest is probably my favorite it's very
 

683
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,010
forest is probably my favorite it's very
similar to the work

684
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,020
similar to the work
 

685

the overworld a lot too I think
 

699
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,490
the overworld a lot too I think
cuz they look really good they grow on

700
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:05,500
cuz they look really good they grow on
 

701
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,990
cuz they look really good they grow on
their own like if you just leave them

702
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,000
their own like if you just leave them
 

703
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,570
their own like if you just leave them
they grow I think up to 20 some blocks

704
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:11,580
they grow I think up to 20 some blocks
 

705
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,980
they grow I think up to 20 some blocks
can weibo me on the max let's check that

706
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:13,990
can weibo me on the max let's check that
 

707
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,140
can weibo me on the max let's check that
out I'm gonna have to investigate them a

708
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,150
out I'm gonna have to investigate them a
 

709
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,650
out I'm gonna have to investigate them a
little further but yeah these things I

710
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:19,660
little further but yeah these things I
 

711
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,830
little further but yeah these things I
can't bomyeo can't bone meal them really

712
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:22,840
can't bomyeo can't bone meal them really
 

713
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,320
can't bomyeo can't bone meal them really
I thought we would have been able to I

714
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,330
I thought we would have been able to I
 

715
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,560
I thought we would have been able to I
think when you harvest them only gets

716
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:28,570
think when you harvest them only gets
 

717
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,760
think when you harvest them only gets
one block but if you break the top one

718
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:29,770
one block but if you break the top one
 

719
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,040
one block but if you break the top one
it gets them all okay does it drop them

720
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,050
it gets them all okay does it drop them
 

721
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,890
it gets them all okay does it drop them
although that's let's check that out

722
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:33,900
although that's let's check that out
 

723
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,200
although that's let's check that out
so we got weeping vine sets they're

724
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,210
so we got weeping vine sets they're
 

725
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,840
so we got weeping vine sets they're
called so if we break this block there's

726
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:39,850
called so if we break this block there's
 

727
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,710
called so if we break this block there's
one two three below it so we should get

728
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:43,720
one two three below it so we should get
 

729
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,000
one two three below it so we should get
four right we got four okay so it does

730
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,010
four right we got four okay so it does
 

731
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,280
four right we got four okay so it does
collect all them if you harvest from the

732
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,290
collect all them if you harvest from the
 

733
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,610
collect all them if you harvest from the
top that's cool I wanted to show you

734
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:53,620
top that's cool I wanted to show you

like it can drip a long ways like it
 

745
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,310
like it can drip a long ways like it
goes all the way from there down and

746
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
goes all the way from there down and
 

747
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,890
goes all the way from there down and
when it hits the lava it actually

748
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:10,900
when it hits the lava it actually
 

749
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,780
when it hits the lava it actually
spreads out on the lava it doesn't like

750
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:12,790
spreads out on the lava it doesn't like
 

751
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,050
spreads out on the lava it doesn't like
just go like a single one by one pillar

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:16,060
just go like a single one by one pillar
 

753
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,310
just go like a single one by one pillar
down into it you know it actually

754
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,320
down into it you know it actually
 

755
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,340
down into it you know it actually
settles on the lava which is pretty neat

756
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:20,350
settles on the lava which is pretty neat
 

757

is same size as a big one there there's

792
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,020
is same size as a big one there there's
 

793
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,630
is same size as a big one there there's
a little there's a little good stuff you

794
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
a little there's a little good stuff you
 

795
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,030
a little there's a little good stuff you
hit them their feet fly like crazy right

796
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,040
hit them their feet fly like crazy right
 

797
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,430
hit them their feet fly like crazy right
now they don't fight back they don't

798
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
now they don't fight back they don't
 

799
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,840
now they don't fight back they don't
really do anything if you kill them

800
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:14,850
really do anything if you kill them
 

801
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,460
really do anything if you kill them
right now they're dropping zombie flesh

802
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:18,470
right now they're dropping zombie flesh
 

803
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,600
right now they're dropping zombie flesh
it would be cool if they got a unique

804
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:20,610
it would be cool if they got a unique
 

805
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,850
it would be cool if they got a unique
drop or something but spirit mallets

806
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:22,860
drop or something but spirit mallets
 

807
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,160
drop or something but spirit mallets
that's what it is

808
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,170
that's what it is
 

809
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,160
that's what it is
but yeah look at this place it's pretty

810
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,170
but yeah look at this place it's pretty
 

811
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,220
but yeah look at this place it's pretty
nice so we mostly have the red fungi in

812
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,230
nice so we mostly have the red fungi in
 

813
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,870
nice so we mostly have the red fungi in
the red forest but we do have some of

814
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
the red forest but we do have some of
 

815
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,940
the red forest but we do have some of
the blue ones scattered in kind of the

816
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:34,950
the blue ones scattered in kind of the
 

817
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,870
the blue ones scattered in kind of the
inverse of the work forest and you guys

818
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
inverse of the work forest and you guys
 

819
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,380
inverse of the work forest and you guys
might find this funny this like it's

820
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:42,390
might find this funny this like it's
 

821
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,110
might find this funny this like it's
kind of blew me away just now

822
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,120
kind of blew me away just now
 

823
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,880
kind of blew me away just now
I never go exploring in the nether right

824
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:46,890
I never go exploring in the nether right
 

825
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,460
I never go exploring in the nether right
because like I got it all pre generated

826
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,470
because like I got it all pre generated
 

827
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,490
because like I got it all pre generated
and stuff I haven't seen ravines before

828
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:52,500
and stuff I haven't seen ravines before
 

829
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,000
and stuff I haven't seen ravines before
it until today they got added in a while

830
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,010
it until today they got added in a while
 

831
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,600
it until today they got added in a while
ago though like in the 1.13 and I just

832
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,610
ago though like in the 1.13 and I just
 

833
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,310
ago though like in the 1.13 and I just
like I think I've seen tiny ones but

834
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:01,320
like I think I've seen tiny ones but
 

835
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,660
like I think I've seen tiny ones but
I've never seen anything like this like

836
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:02,670
I've never seen anything like this like
 

837
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,850
I've never seen anything like this like
a big giant or being cut out

838
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:04,860
a big giant or being cut out
 

839
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,850
a big giant or being cut out
he's new for me so I thought this was

840
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:07,860
he's new for me so I thought this was
 

841
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,770
he's new for me so I thought this was
kind of neat actually we got is that

842
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:12,780
kind of neat actually we got is that
 

843
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,470
kind of neat actually we got is that
them no that's a assault there is a new

844
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:15,480
them no that's a assault there is a new
 

845
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,570
them no that's a assault there is a new
or in the game as well the nether right

846
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:17,580
or in the game as well the nether right
 

847
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,450
or in the game as well the nether right
with new armor new tools better than

848
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:20,460
with new armor new tools better than
 

849
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,210
with new armor new tools better than
diamonds and I would like to try get a

850
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:23,220
diamonds and I would like to try get a
 

851
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,410
diamonds and I would like to try get a
set of that apparently it doesn't spawn

852
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:26,420
set of that apparently it doesn't spawn
 

853
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,570
set of that apparently it doesn't spawn
exposed to the air though so if you want

854
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:29,580
exposed to the air though so if you want
 

855
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,920
exposed to the air though so if you want
it you have to hunt it down and only

856
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:30,930
it you have to hunt it down and only
 

857
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:35,140
it you have to hunt it down and only
like four of them spawn per chunk like

858
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,150
like four of them spawn per chunk like
 

859
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,480
like four of them spawn per chunk like
from ground to the ceiling and a 16 by

860
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,490
from ground to the ceiling and a 16 by
 

861
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,520
from ground to the ceiling and a 16 by
16 area I think only four will spawn in

862
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:40,530
16 area I think only four will spawn in
 

863
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,090
16 area I think only four will spawn in
there so it's extremely rare and since

864
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:44,100
there so it's extremely rare and since
 

865
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,740
there so it's extremely rare and since
you can't see it you you're gonna have

866
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:45,750
you can't see it you you're gonna have
 

867
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,280
you can't see it you you're gonna have
hard time finding it I'm just looking on

868
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,290
hard time finding it I'm just looking on
 

869
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,230
hard time finding it I'm just looking on
the walls to see if the ravine would cut

870
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:51,240
the walls to see if the ravine would cut
 

871
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,210
the walls to see if the ravine would cut
it and make it exposed but I'm not

872
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:53,220
it and make it exposed but I'm not
 

873
00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:00,260
it and make it exposed but I'm not
seeing any yeah even if it did like

874
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,270
seeing any yeah even if it did like
 

875
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,610
seeing any yeah even if it did like
you'd have to still get pretty lucky

876
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:01,620
you'd have to still get pretty lucky
 

877
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,630
you'd have to still get pretty lucky
with that so I would like to try to get

878
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:05,640
with that so I would like to try to get
 

879
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,910
with that so I would like to try to get
some of that the cool thing about it is

880
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:07,920
some of that the cool thing about it is
 

881
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,100
some of that the cool thing about it is
it's blast-proof and I think Mojang did

882
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,110
it's blast-proof and I think Mojang did
 

883
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,409
it's blast-proof and I think Mojang did
that on purpose like I think they had a

884
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:12,419
that on purpose like I think they had a
 

885
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,440
that on purpose like I think they had a
they had something in mind

886
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:15,450
they had something in mind
 

887
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,200
they had something in mind
I honestly think like the best way of

888
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,210
I honestly think like the best way of
 

889
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,990
I honestly think like the best way of
getting it is gonna be with TNT um

890
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,000
getting it is gonna be with TNT um
 

891
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
getting it is gonna be with TNT um
you're gonna have to be careful of you

892
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,010
you're gonna have to be careful of you
 

893
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,490
you're gonna have to be careful of you
do it though cause like we got the

894
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:25,500
do it though cause like we got the
 

895
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,080
do it though cause like we got the
hidden lava pockets all over the place

896
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,090
hidden lava pockets all over the place
 

897
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,539
hidden lava pockets all over the place
you might be setting up your TNT and

898
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:29,549
you might be setting up your TNT and
 

899
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:33,710
you might be setting up your TNT and
then it suddenly catches fire but like

900
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:33,720
then it suddenly catches fire but like
 

901
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,570
then it suddenly catches fire but like
netherrack as a very little blast

902
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:35,580
netherrack as a very little blast
 

903
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,519
netherrack as a very little blast
resistance though TNT works pretty good

904
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:37,529
resistance though TNT works pretty good
 

905
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:41,450
resistance though TNT works pretty good
in the nether and we're gonna just blow

906
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:41,460
in the nether and we're gonna just blow
 

907
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,250
in the nether and we're gonna just blow
it a chunk here and see if we get lucky

908
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:43,260
it a chunk here and see if we get lucky
 

909
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,129
it a chunk here and see if we get lucky
I still think it's gonna be hard to find

910
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:46,139
I still think it's gonna be hard to find
 

911
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:48,860
I still think it's gonna be hard to find
even even with the TNT though this stuff

912
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:48,870
even even with the TNT though this stuff
 

913
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,480
even even with the TNT though this stuff
is so stinkin rare all right let's do

914
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:53,490
is so stinkin rare all right let's do
 

915
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,299
is so stinkin rare all right let's do
two stacks and just see what happens

916
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:55,309
two stacks and just see what happens
 

917
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:59,299
two stacks and just see what happens
they both run it run it down here yeah I

918
00:22:59,299 --> 00:22:59,309
they both run it run it down here yeah I
 

919
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:01,100
they both run it run it down here yeah I
like how it's blast resistant that's

920
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,110
like how it's blast resistant that's
 

921
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,649
like how it's blast resistant that's
that's a really cool feature and you can

922
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:03,659
that's a really cool feature and you can
 

923
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,899
that's a really cool feature and you can
move it with pistons so it's a blast

924
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:05,909
move it with pistons so it's a blast
 

925
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:09,740
move it with pistons so it's a blast
resistant block that can be moved which

926
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:09,750
resistant block that can be moved which
 

927
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,149
resistant block that can be moved which
is brand new that's gonna be big in the

928
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
is brand new that's gonna be big in the
 

929
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,700
is brand new that's gonna be big in the
game I think okay let's let's do it here

930
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:16,710
game I think okay let's let's do it here
 

931
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,980
game I think okay let's let's do it here
let's get our flint and steel

932
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:18,990
let's get our flint and steel
 

933
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,990
let's get our flint and steel
let's get another night vision going I

934
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,000
let's get another night vision going I
 

935
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,799
let's get another night vision going I
actually like that a lot here last one I

936
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:24,809
actually like that a lot here last one I
 

937
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:28,820
actually like that a lot here last one I
brought flint and steel I have been

938
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:28,830
brought flint and steel I have been
 

939
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,200
brought flint and steel I have been
trying to share some stuff too and it's

940
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,210
trying to share some stuff too and it's
 

941
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:34,370
trying to share some stuff too and it's
not really doing anything special

942
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:34,380

 

943
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:45,560

I'm scared okay we're gonna live who

944
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:45,570
I'm scared okay we're gonna live who
 

945
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,680
I'm scared okay we're gonna live who
guess another courts only problem is the

946
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:49,690
guess another courts only problem is the
 

947
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,660
guess another courts only problem is the
