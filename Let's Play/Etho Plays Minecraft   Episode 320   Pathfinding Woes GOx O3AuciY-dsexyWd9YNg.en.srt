look at where we are i i have found
podzol

16
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
podzol
 

17
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,349
podzol
i finally found some puzzle i was

18
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
i finally found some puzzle i was
 

19
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,230
i finally found some puzzle i was
exploring those

20
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
exploring those
 

21
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,390
exploring those
those ice planes we found the other day

22
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,400
those ice planes we found the other day
 

23
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,310
those ice planes we found the other day
uh out by our nether fortress

24
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
uh out by our nether fortress
 

25
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,870
uh out by our nether fortress
portal thing i was hoping to find the

26
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
portal thing i was hoping to find the
 

27
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,429
portal thing i was hoping to find the
spiked

28
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
spiked
 

29
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,270
spiked
ice planes i think that's what they're

30
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
ice planes i think that's what they're
 

31
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,470
ice planes i think that's what they're
called

32
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
called
 

33
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,190
called
i've never seen those before and i was

34
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
i've never seen those before and i was
 

35
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,950
i've never seen those before and i was
really hoping to find some

36
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
really hoping to find some
 

37
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,389
really hoping to find some
and i still haven't didn't find it but i

38
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
and i still haven't didn't find it but i
 

39
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,350
and i still haven't didn't find it but i
did find

40
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
did find
 

41
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,350
did find
a mega tiger way out here it's at 3 100

42
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
a mega tiger way out here it's at 3 100
 

43
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,790
a mega tiger way out here it's at 3 100
6100 so that is pretty cool

44
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
6100 so that is pretty cool
 

45
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,150
6100 so that is pretty cool
i was wondering what this was going to

46
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
i was wondering what this was going to
 

47
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,990
i was wondering what this was going to
look like and it's actually a lot

48
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
look like and it's actually a lot
 

49
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,270
look like and it's actually a lot
different than i expected

50
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:56,280
different than i expected
 

51
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,270
different than i expected
because uh the tiger

52
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
because uh the tiger
 

53
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,349
because uh the tiger
the mega tiger biomes considered like a

54
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
the mega tiger biomes considered like a
 

55
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,310
the mega tiger biomes considered like a
colder

56
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
colder
 

57
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,789
colder
uh biome when you see it normally though

58
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:04,799
uh biome when you see it normally though
 

59
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,870
uh biome when you see it normally though
you see podzol everywhere

60
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
you see podzol everywhere
 

61
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,230
you see podzol everywhere
but since it's an amplified terrain uh

62
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
but since it's an amplified terrain uh
 

63
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,149
but since it's an amplified terrain uh
and very mountainous uh there's a lot of

64
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
and very mountainous uh there's a lot of
 

65
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:14,630
and very mountainous uh there's a lot of
snow

66
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
snow
 

67
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,950
snow
everywhere because uh it's considered a

68
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:16,960
everywhere because uh it's considered a
 

69
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,149
everywhere because uh it's considered a
cold climate

70
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
cold climate
 

71
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,390
cold climate
and so a lot of the podzol like if you

72
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
and so a lot of the podzol like if you
 

73
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,749
and so a lot of the podzol like if you
look out over at that cliff

74
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
look out over at that cliff
 

75
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,870
look out over at that cliff
most of that is possible probably it's

76
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
most of that is possible probably it's
 

77
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,270
most of that is possible probably it's
just

78
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
just
 

79
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,510
just
uh it's covered in snow there's no

80
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
uh it's covered in snow there's no
 

81
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,789
uh it's covered in snow there's no
layers everywhere and the

82
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
layers everywhere and the
 

83
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,030
layers everywhere and the
and it has the snow grass like if you

84
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
and it has the snow grass like if you
 

85
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,510
and it has the snow grass like if you
look at the side here

86
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
look at the side here
 

87
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,510
look at the side here
if we break this it turns into bodily so

88
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
if we break this it turns into bodily so
 

89
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,030
if we break this it turns into bodily so
it's kind of hidden

90
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
it's kind of hidden
 

91
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,710
it's kind of hidden
very interesting um

92
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
very interesting um
 

93
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,789
very interesting um
was not expecting to find this so i'm

94
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
was not expecting to find this so i'm
 

95
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,630
was not expecting to find this so i'm
not really prepared to take something

96
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
not really prepared to take something
 

97
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,069
not really prepared to take something
back i nope

98
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
back i nope
 

99
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,710
back i nope
no shovels no silk touch shovels this

100
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
no shovels no silk touch shovels this
 

101
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,149
no shovels no silk touch shovels this
isn't so touch i don't think you can

102
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
isn't so touch i don't think you can
 

103
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,190
isn't so touch i don't think you can
pick it up normally

104
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
pick it up normally
 

105
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,789
pick it up normally
no it just breaks the dirt darn

106
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
no it just breaks the dirt darn
 

107
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,550
no it just breaks the dirt darn
finally found it and i can't get any of

108
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
finally found it and i can't get any of
 

109
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,030
finally found it and i can't get any of
it oh that stinks

110
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
it oh that stinks
 

111
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,350
it oh that stinks
um but i got the coordinates this place

112
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
um but i got the coordinates this place
 

113
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,149
um but i got the coordinates this place
we should be able to set up a portal

114
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
we should be able to set up a portal
 

115
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,190
we should be able to set up a portal
but no luck with the ice or

116
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
but no luck with the ice or
 

117
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,830
but no luck with the ice or
what are they called spiked ice planes i

118
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
what are they called spiked ice planes i
 

119
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,589
what are they called spiked ice planes i
think that's what they're called yeah

120
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
think that's what they're called yeah
 

121
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,589
think that's what they're called yeah
didn't find that and i'm pretty sure i

122
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
didn't find that and i'm pretty sure i
 

123
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,630
didn't find that and i'm pretty sure i
looked through

124
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
looked through
 

125
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,309
looked through
through most of that ice plane area so

126
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
through most of that ice plane area so
 

127
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,630
through most of that ice plane area so
i'll have to look another another area i

128
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
i'll have to look another another area i
 

129
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,070
i'll have to look another another area i
guess but this is a

130
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
guess but this is a
 

131
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,589
guess but this is a
good find i really want to find some

132
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
good find i really want to find some
 

133
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,990
good find i really want to find some
ponzil so

134
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
ponzil so
 

135
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,869
ponzil so
i think i will you know what i'm

136
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
i think i will you know what i'm
 

137
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,309
i think i will you know what i'm
probably just going to kill myself to

138
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
probably just going to kill myself to
 

139
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,949
probably just going to kill myself to
get back

140
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
get back
 

141
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,470
get back
because yeah it's a long walk

142
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480

 

143
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,309

yeah so i don't usually do this but it's

144
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
yeah so i don't usually do this but it's
 

145
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,750
yeah so i don't usually do this but it's
like a 20 to 30 minute walk back i

146
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
like a 20 to 30 minute walk back i
 

147
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,350
like a 20 to 30 minute walk back i
i would say so we're we're just gonna

148
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
i would say so we're we're just gonna
 

149
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,550
i would say so we're we're just gonna
put uh

150
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
put uh
 

151
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,229
put uh
our stuff in an ender chest here and

152
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
our stuff in an ender chest here and
 

153
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,390
our stuff in an ender chest here and
jump off a cliff i just

154
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
jump off a cliff i just
 

155
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,710
jump off a cliff i just
uh it's really hard deciding though what

156
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
uh it's really hard deciding though what
 

157
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,190
uh it's really hard deciding though what
to what to keep and what not to keep

158
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
to what to keep and what not to keep
 

159
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,390
to what to keep and what not to keep
i think i think this is good i would

160
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
i think i think this is good i would
 

161
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,390
i think i think this is good i would
really like to save this wood somehow

162
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
really like to save this wood somehow
 

163
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,430
really like to save this wood somehow
though

164
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
though
 

165
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,430
though
i did find acacia saplings too while

166
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
i did find acacia saplings too while
 

167
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,390
i did find acacia saplings too while
exploring so i got those again

168
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
exploring so i got those again
 

169
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,750
exploring so i got those again

it's not really any junk items here is a

172
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
it's not really any junk items here is a
 

173
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,990
it's not really any junk items here is a
problem

174
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
problem
 

175
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,070
problem
guess we could get rid of the diamonds

176
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080

 

177
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,789

all right so let's

178
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799

 

179
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,630

here we go

180

stage to this thing
today but i've been here for about an

210
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
today but i've been here for about an
 

211
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,069
today but i've been here for about an
hour now

212
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
hour now
 

213
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,430
hour now
trying to work out some of the problems

214
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
trying to work out some of the problems
 

215
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,430
trying to work out some of the problems
we were having with it and

216
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
we were having with it and
 

217
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,790
we were having with it and
they've gotten a little better but uh

218
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
they've gotten a little better but uh
 

219
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,310
they've gotten a little better but uh
we're still having a lot of problems

220
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
we're still having a lot of problems
 

221
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,070
we're still having a lot of problems
the main issue is mobs are getting

222
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
the main issue is mobs are getting
 

223
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,310
the main issue is mobs are getting
backed up in the system they're getting

224
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
backed up in the system they're getting
 

225
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,550
backed up in the system they're getting
backed up in the water streams and stuck

226
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
backed up in the water streams and stuck
 

227
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,629
backed up in the water streams and stuck
and

228
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
and
 

229
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,310
and
and yeah i've tried putting a bunch of

230
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
and yeah i've tried putting a bunch of
 

231
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,710
and yeah i've tried putting a bunch of
regulators up there

232
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
regulators up there
 

233
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,909
regulators up there
to sort of deal with the problems

234
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
to sort of deal with the problems
 

235
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,830
to sort of deal with the problems
but ah it's just

236
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
but ah it's just
 

237
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,150
but ah it's just
just a mess let's go over here

238
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160

 

239
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,749

um wait what's what's her oops not skin

240
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
um wait what's what's her oops not skin
 

241
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,110
um wait what's what's her oops not skin
i always click on skin now because

242
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
i always click on skin now because
 

243
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,629
i always click on skin now because
that's where the music used to be

244
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
that's where the music used to be
 

245
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,670
that's where the music used to be
let's turn this down a bit

246
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
let's turn this down a bit
 

247
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,590
let's turn this down a bit
all right so this is the mob sorter over

248
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
all right so this is the mob sorter over
 

249
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,390
all right so this is the mob sorter over
there

250
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400

 

251
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,909

i think a big thing we gotta change with

252
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
i think a big thing we gotta change with
 

253
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,749
i think a big thing we gotta change with
that is get rid of the trap door and use

254
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
that is get rid of the trap door and use
 

255
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,469
that is get rid of the trap door and use
a piston

256
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
a piston
 

257
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,150
a piston
instead that will retract a block

258
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
instead that will retract a block
 

259
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,189
instead that will retract a block
to make the skeletons fall because i

260
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
to make the skeletons fall because i
 

261
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,710
to make the skeletons fall because i
think they're having trouble jumping up

262
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
think they're having trouble jumping up
 

263
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,110
think they're having trouble jumping up
that

264
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
that
 

265
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,150
that
that block there that skeleton is not

266
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
that block there that skeleton is not
 

267
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,110
that block there that skeleton is not
supposed to be

268
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
supposed to be
 

269
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,100
supposed to be
so that's one problem um

270
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,110
so that's one problem um
 

271
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,790
so that's one problem um
[Music]

272
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
[Music]
 

273
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,029
[Music]
over here especially once there's a lot

274
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
over here especially once there's a lot
 

275
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,070
over here especially once there's a lot
of mobs in the stream

276
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
of mobs in the stream
 

277
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,790
of mobs in the stream
that's when when we have problems it

278
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
that's when when we have problems it
 

279
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,990
that's when when we have problems it
starts sending two or three

280
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
starts sending two or three
 

281
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,350
starts sending two or three
mobs through at once uh

282
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
mobs through at once uh
 

283
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,510
mobs through at once uh
because you see how many are over there

284
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
because you see how many are over there
 

285
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,430
because you see how many are over there
it'll like try to let a few it through

286
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
it'll like try to let a few it through
 

287
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,590
it'll like try to let a few it through
but then like 10 or 20 to shoot through

288
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
but then like 10 or 20 to shoot through
 

289
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,390
but then like 10 or 20 to shoot through
instantly once this piston retracts here

290
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
instantly once this piston retracts here
 

291
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,510
instantly once this piston retracts here
um yeah so

292
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
um yeah so
 

293
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,909
um yeah so
the plan the plan guys we're gonna get

294
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
the plan the plan guys we're gonna get
 

295
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,150
the plan the plan guys we're gonna get
rid of all these water streams

296
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
rid of all these water streams
 

297
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,990
rid of all these water streams
and we're gonna use mine carts instead

298
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
and we're gonna use mine carts instead
 

299
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,270
and we're gonna use mine carts instead
it's gonna be

300
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
it's gonna be
 

301
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,710
it's gonna be
really cool mechanical system

302
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
really cool mechanical system
 

303
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,550
really cool mechanical system
i think but i'll have to

304
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
i think but i'll have to
 

305
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,469
i think but i'll have to
have to tear all this down and start

306
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
have to tear all this down and start
 

307
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,710
have to tear all this down and start
fresh so

308
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
fresh so
 

309
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,590
fresh so
give me a moment to do that i think i

310
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
give me a moment to do that i think i
 

311
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,110
give me a moment to do that i think i
know

312
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
know
 

313
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,629
know
how we're gonna build it

314
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639

 

315
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,189

so it should be okay i hate i hate

316
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
so it should be okay i hate i hate
 

317
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,469
so it should be okay i hate i hate
tearing this thing down i've made a

318
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
tearing this thing down i've made a
 

319
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,670
tearing this thing down i've made a
backup just in case

320
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
backup just in case
 

321
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,430
backup just in case
it was a huge mistake but

322
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440

 

323
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,029

there's just too many problems to work

324
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
there's just too many problems to work
 

325
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,710
there's just too many problems to work
through it i think it needs to be done

326
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
through it i think it needs to be done
 

327
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,909
through it i think it needs to be done
properly

328
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
properly
 

329
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,510
properly
so i will see you guys in a second

330
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520

 

331
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,430

okay so some of this it looks like we'll

332
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
okay so some of this it looks like we'll
 

333
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,070
okay so some of this it looks like we'll
save uh from the beginning mobs they

334
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
save uh from the beginning mobs they
 

335
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,870
save uh from the beginning mobs they
fall down

336
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
fall down
 

337
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,270
fall down
that hole most of the time i have them

338
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
that hole most of the time i have them
 

339
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,110
that hole most of the time i have them
falling down this tube all the way onto

340
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
falling down this tube all the way onto
 

341
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,309
falling down this tube all the way onto
that hopper

342
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
that hopper
 

343
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,830
that hopper
they die and i collect the loot from

344
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
they die and i collect the loot from
 

345
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,469
they die and i collect the loot from
that so i think we can keep all that

346
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
that so i think we can keep all that
 

347
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,909
that so i think we can keep all that
then i have this water control system

348
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
then i have this water control system
 

349
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,469
then i have this water control system
here

350
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
here
 

351
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,909
here
if we flip the lever determines if they

352
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
if we flip the lever determines if they
 

353
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,469
if we flip the lever determines if they
fall down there or if they go to the

354
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
fall down there or if they go to the
 

355
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,749
fall down there or if they go to the
left

356
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
left
 

357
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,870
left
and i think we can keep this as well

358
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
and i think we can keep this as well
 

359
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,270
and i think we can keep this as well
this will be the only water stream in

360
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
this will be the only water stream in
 

361
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,830
this will be the only water stream in
the whole thing the rest will be

362
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840
the whole thing the rest will be
 

363
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,990
the whole thing the rest will be
minecarts

364
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
minecarts
 

365
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,830
minecarts
uh so this is

366
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840

 

367
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,749

this piston that one and that one

368
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
this piston that one and that one
 

369
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,550
this piston that one and that one
i think we all keep don't need this or

370
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
i think we all keep don't need this or
 

371
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,830
i think we all keep don't need this or
that

372
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
that
 

373
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,029
that
so let's start demolition

374
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
so let's start demolition
 

375
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,950

393
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,150

taking on a life of his own

394
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160

 

395
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,670

i hate destroying it because i put so

396
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
i hate destroying it because i put so
 

397
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,350
i hate destroying it because i put so
much time into this already

398
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
much time into this already
 

399
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,790
much time into this already
but i think the new thing is going to be

400
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
but i think the new thing is going to be
 

401
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,629
but i think the new thing is going to be
a lot better

402
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
a lot better
 

403
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,230
a lot better
and i would rather it works properly

404
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
and i would rather it works properly
 

405
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,670
and i would rather it works properly
then

406
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
then
 

407
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,189
then
then try to or just keeping this piece

408
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
then try to or just keeping this piece
 

409
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,110
then try to or just keeping this piece
of junk around you know

410
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
of junk around you know
 

411
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,070
of junk around you know
not that it was terrible but yeah it's

412
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
not that it was terrible but yeah it's
 

413
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,189
not that it was terrible but yeah it's
it just had too many problems

00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
it just had too many problems
 

415
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,550
it just had too many problems
all right so this this trap door there

416
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
all right so this this trap door there
 

417
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,110
all right so this this trap door there
by the way is what we were using before

418
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
by the way is what we were using before
 

419
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,950
by the way is what we were using before
to try to just let one mob through at a

420
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
to try to just let one mob through at a
 

421
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,150
to try to just let one mob through at a
time

422
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
time
 

423
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,230
time
uh with the new method we're gonna be

424
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
uh with the new method we're gonna be
 

425
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,750
uh with the new method we're gonna be
using minecarts and that's gonna be

426
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
using minecarts and that's gonna be
 

427
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,949
using minecarts and that's gonna be
so much better because sometimes more

428
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
so much better because sometimes more
 

429
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:37,670
so much better because sometimes more
than one mob

430
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
than one mob
 

431
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,550
than one mob

working up high here
without any real scaffolding so the very

460
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
without any real scaffolding so the very
 

461
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,430
without any real scaffolding so the very
first thing i think we need to add

462

first thing i think we need to add
 

463
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,829
first thing i think we need to add
is like a reservoir for the mobs to

464
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
is like a reservoir for the mobs to
 

465
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,790
is like a reservoir for the mobs to
collect into

466
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
collect into
 

467
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,150
collect into
like a one by one tube so water stream

468
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
like a one by one tube so water stream
 

469
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,750
like a one by one tube so water stream
is going to come

470
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
is going to come
 

471
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,710
is going to come
at this block height let's get a tube

472
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
at this block height let's get a tube
 

473
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,070
at this block height let's get a tube
going on around

474
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
going on around
 

475
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,990
going on around
this dirt block so over here here and

476
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
this dirt block so over here here and
 

477
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,310
this dirt block so over here here and
here and we will put a sign there to

478
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
here and we will put a sign there to
 

479
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,710
here and we will put a sign there to
hold the water back

480
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
hold the water back
 

481
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,470
hold the water back
so it doesn't fall down this is where

482
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
so it doesn't fall down this is where
 

483
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,070
so it doesn't fall down this is where
the water ends over here

484
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
the water ends over here
 

485
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,430
the water ends over here

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
i brought special glass this time and we
 

509
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,590
i brought special glass this time and we
were going to use cyan

510
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600

 

511
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,110

oh i wonder if it's too late to change

512
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
oh i wonder if it's too late to change
 

513
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,710
oh i wonder if it's too late to change
it

514
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
it
 

515
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,910
it
yeah let's let's go ahead and change it

516
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
yeah let's let's go ahead and change it
 

517
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,110
yeah let's let's go ahead and change it
and do wait

518
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
and do wait
 

519
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,829
and do wait
oh i'm messing this up just wasting

520
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
oh i'm messing this up just wasting
 

521
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,470
oh i'm messing this up just wasting
glass

522
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
glass
 

523
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,829
glass
left and right here wonderful

524
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
left and right here wonderful
 

525
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,630
left and right here wonderful
all right i find this this color of the

526
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
all right i find this this color of the
 

527
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,790
all right i find this this color of the
glass is the most transparent like that

528
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
glass is the most transparent like that
 

529
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,389
glass is the most transparent like that
i can see through the easiest

530
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
i can see through the easiest
 

531
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,670
i can see through the easiest
out of all the the colors especially

532
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
out of all the the colors especially
 

533
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,310
out of all the the colors especially
over

534
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
over
 

535
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,949
over
clear because clear has all the white in

536
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
clear because clear has all the white in
 

537
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,710
clear because clear has all the white in
it which is really annoying

538
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
it which is really annoying
 

539
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,350
it which is really annoying
okay we got the sign back very good

540
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
okay we got the sign back very good
 

541
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,630
okay we got the sign back very good
let's get that over

542
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
let's get that over
 

543
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,150
let's get that over
here okay change that piece

544
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
here okay change that piece
 

545
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,590
here okay change that piece
i'll probably change this to about two

546
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
i'll probably change this to about two
 

547
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,150
i'll probably change this to about two
later uh we gotta make them

548
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
later uh we gotta make them
 

549
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,150
later uh we gotta make them
fall see

550
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
fall see
 

551
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,269
fall see
they're at that height i think they

552
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
they're at that height i think they
 

553
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,190
they're at that height i think they
gotta go down at least two blocks

554
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200

 

555
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,990

it's a little confusing trying to figure

556
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
it's a little confusing trying to figure
 

557
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,590
it's a little confusing trying to figure
out what is what

558
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
out what is what
 

559
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,670
out what is what
uh like with all the glass around it's

560
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
uh like with all the glass around it's
 

561
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,630
uh like with all the glass around it's
kind of

562
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
kind of
 

563
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,190
kind of
kind of hard to see where the blocks are

564
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
kind of hard to see where the blocks are
 

565
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,110
kind of hard to see where the blocks are
all right two

566
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
all right two
 

567
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,509
all right two
yeah so the ground i think we'll be

568
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
yeah so the ground i think we'll be
 

569
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,030
yeah so the ground i think we'll be
there this gives us a little bit of

570
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,040
there this gives us a little bit of
 

571
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,310
there this gives us a little bit of
working room too because we can't go

572
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
working room too because we can't go
 

573
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,910
working room too because we can't go
above the snow layer there

574
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
above the snow layer there
 

575
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,630
above the snow layer there
so if bringing it down is kind of nice

576
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
so if bringing it down is kind of nice
 

577
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,910
so if bringing it down is kind of nice
and let's get like a

578
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
and let's get like a
 

579
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,710
and let's get like a
platform going here i suppose

580
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720

 

581
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,870

okay so the mobs will fall down they'll

582
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
okay so the mobs will fall down they'll
 

583
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,389
okay so the mobs will fall down they'll
all gather up in this

584
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
all gather up in this
 

585
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,630
all gather up in this
in this one by one tube over here

586
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
in this one by one tube over here
 

587
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,829
in this one by one tube over here
should work out okay and then

588
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
should work out okay and then
 

589
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,710
should work out okay and then
we are going to get some rails going

590
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
we are going to get some rails going
 

591
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,550
we are going to get some rails going
they'll go right into the tube there

592
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560

 

593
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,069

and so a mine cart will

594
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
and so a mine cart will
 

595
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,710
and so a mine cart will
will pick up the mobs one by one for

596
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
will pick up the mobs one by one for
 

597
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,509
will pick up the mobs one by one for
sure

598
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
sure
 

599
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,910
sure
like we'll send a minecart in it'll grab

600
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
like we'll send a minecart in it'll grab
 

601
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,430
like we'll send a minecart in it'll grab
a mob pull it out

602
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
a mob pull it out
 

603
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,629
a mob pull it out
and that way i will definitely

604
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:06,639
and that way i will definitely
 

605
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,670
and that way i will definitely
definitely not have any more trouble

606
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
definitely not have any more trouble
 

607
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,150
definitely not have any more trouble
with mobs bunching up where i don't want

608
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
with mobs bunching up where i don't want
 

609
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,470
with mobs bunching up where i don't want
them to

610
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
them to
 

611
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,870
them to
i think we're gonna do like a minecarts

612
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
i think we're gonna do like a minecarts
 

613
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:24,230
i think we're gonna do like a minecarts
uh system here that kinda goes like yeah

614
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
uh system here that kinda goes like yeah
 

615
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,030
uh system here that kinda goes like yeah
i think like

616
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
i think like
 

617
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,110
i think like
that so then we bring up the power rails

618
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
that so then we bring up the power rails
 

619
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,389
that so then we bring up the power rails
like that and then we gotta get

620
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
like that and then we gotta get
 

621
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,350
like that and then we gotta get
let's make this go over a little more

622
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360

 

623
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,350

okay we're gonna get some sand down and

624
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
okay we're gonna get some sand down and
 

625
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,030
okay we're gonna get some sand down and
a cactus so the mine cart is gonna go

626
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
a cactus so the mine cart is gonna go
 

627
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,110
a cactus so the mine cart is gonna go
right into the cactus

628
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
right into the cactus
 

629
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,350
right into the cactus
and break above a hopper the hopper will

630
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360
and break above a hopper the hopper will
 

631
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,230
and break above a hopper the hopper will
pull it in

632
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
pull it in
 

633
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,629
pull it in
and it will take it to this dispenser

634
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
and it will take it to this dispenser
 

635
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,150
and it will take it to this dispenser
and then we can send a mine cart out

636
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,160
and then we can send a mine cart out
 

637
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,990
and then we can send a mine cart out
here and it'll roll this way

638
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
here and it'll roll this way
 

639
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,030
here and it'll roll this way
when this is all powered that's pretty

640
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
when this is all powered that's pretty
 

641
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,670
when this is all powered that's pretty
good

642
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
good
 

643
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,790
good
let's get that going here

644
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
let's get that going here
 

645
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,670
let's get that going here
and hmm what should we do next

646
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
and hmm what should we do next
 

647
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,590
and hmm what should we do next
i think

648
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
i think
 

649
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,910
i think
i think we need to push them as well the

650
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
i think we need to push them as well the
 

651
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,350
i think we need to push them as well the
mob so we should get a

652
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
mob so we should get a
 

653
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,030
mob so we should get a
piston let's get

654
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
piston let's get
 

655
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,190
piston let's get
let's use a sticky piston for this

656
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200

 

657
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,430

all right when they arrive here minecart

658
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
all right when they arrive here minecart
 

659
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,550
all right when they arrive here minecart
breaks they get ejected from the

660
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
breaks they get ejected from the
 

661
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,389
breaks they get ejected from the
minecart the mobs will be standing right

662
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
minecart the mobs will be standing right
 

663
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,750
minecart the mobs will be standing right
here

664
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
here
 

665
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,069
here
and then i'm gonna use a solid block for

666
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
and then i'm gonna use a solid block for
 

667
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,870
and then i'm gonna use a solid block for
this

668
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
this
 

669
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,269
this
this piston will push them over one

670
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
this piston will push them over one
 

671
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,949
this piston will push them over one
block and they'll fall down another one

672
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
block and they'll fall down another one
 

673
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:33,350
block and they'll fall down another one
by

674
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
by
 

675
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,310
by
one tube over here that's the way we'll

676
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
one tube over here that's the way we'll
 

677
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,790
one tube over here that's the way we'll
do it

678
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800

 

679
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,750

okay now let me let me encase this all

680
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
okay now let me let me encase this all
 

681
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,870
okay now let me let me encase this all
with glass and

682
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
with glass and
 

683
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,870
with glass and
get this powered and that kind of stuff

684
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:48,880
get this powered and that kind of stuff
 

685
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,389
get this powered and that kind of stuff
okay we got a little bit more glass

686
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
okay we got a little bit more glass
 

687
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,910
okay we got a little bit more glass
going on here but i realized something

688
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
going on here but i realized something
 

689
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,910
going on here but i realized something
important we should do so i wanted to

690
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
important we should do so i wanted to
 

691
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,030
important we should do so i wanted to
show you uh one thing

692
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
show you uh one thing
 

693
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,069
show you uh one thing
for sure i overlooked this but if you

694
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
for sure i overlooked this but if you
 

695
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,389
for sure i overlooked this but if you
put a minecart there

696
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
put a minecart there
 

697
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,389
put a minecart there
it doesn't move because we got a glass

698
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
it doesn't move because we got a glass
 

699
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,509
it doesn't move because we got a glass
block behind there so let's

700
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:05,519
block behind there so let's
 

701
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,629
block behind there so let's
change that out with the solid block

702
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
change that out with the solid block
 

703
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,829
change that out with the solid block
so now

704
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839

 

705
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,550

there it is oops here let's try this out

706
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
there it is oops here let's try this out
 

707
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:16,949
there it is oops here let's try this out
again

708
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
again
 

709
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,750
again
just to make sure from what i understand

710
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
just to make sure from what i understand
 

711
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,189
just to make sure from what i understand
with this setup

712
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
with this setup
 

713
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,110
with this setup
it'll never get destroyed in the cactus

714
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
it'll never get destroyed in the cactus
 

715
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,870
it'll never get destroyed in the cactus
the hopper always grabs it

716
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880

 

717
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,590

very good okay and also we need to

718
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
very good okay and also we need to
 

719
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:29,990
very good okay and also we need to
detect

720
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
detect
 

721
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,509
detect
if there's a mob in the tube so i

722
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
if there's a mob in the tube so i
 

723
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,710
if there's a mob in the tube so i
think we need to get a tripwire going

724
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:36,720
think we need to get a tripwire going
 

725
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,790
think we need to get a tripwire going
here

726
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
here
 

727
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,230
here
do it like this and if there's a mob in

728
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
do it like this and if there's a mob in
 

729
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,230
do it like this and if there's a mob in
the tube then send

730
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
the tube then send
 

731
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,550
the tube then send
minecarts to go pick them up kind of

732
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
minecarts to go pick them up kind of
 

733
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,750
minecarts to go pick them up kind of
thing

734
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
thing
 

735
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,750
thing
so we will do tripwire there and there

736
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
so we will do tripwire there and there
 

737
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,389
so we will do tripwire there and there
and i guess let's get some more glass

738
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:54,399
and i guess let's get some more glass
 

739
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,910
and i guess let's get some more glass
going

740
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
going
 

741
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,550
going
zom the baby zombies might pose a bit of

742
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
zom the baby zombies might pose a bit of
 

743
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,189
zom the baby zombies might pose a bit of
a

744
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
a
 

745
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,829
a
ch challenge or trouble to us but we

746
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
ch challenge or trouble to us but we
 

747
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,150
ch challenge or trouble to us but we
will see

748
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160
will see
 

749
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,509
will see
because they will be able to run out of

750
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
because they will be able to run out of
 

751
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,430
because they will be able to run out of
here anytime they want

752
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
here anytime they want
 

753
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,670
here anytime they want
i have to leave it or i think i need to

754
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:09,680
i have to leave it or i think i need to
 

755
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,189
i have to leave it or i think i need to
leave it open like this with

756
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,199
leave it open like this with
 

757
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,629
leave it open like this with
with the one block so the mine turret

758
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
with the one block so the mine turret
 

759
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,310
with the one block so the mine turret
can get in there

760
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,320
can get in there
 

761
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,670
can get in there
hopefully they don't cause too much

762
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
hopefully they don't cause too much
 

763
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,910
hopefully they don't cause too much
trouble i think if there's a lot of mobs

764
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:17,920
trouble i think if there's a lot of mobs
 

765
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,269
trouble i think if there's a lot of mobs
in there actually they won't be able to

766
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
in there actually they won't be able to
 

767
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,509
in there actually they won't be able to
run out i think the other mobs will hold

768
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
run out i think the other mobs will hold
 

769
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,550
run out i think the other mobs will hold
the babies in place keep them keep them

770
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
the babies in place keep them keep them
 

771
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,110
the babies in place keep them keep them
in line and i've also added something

772
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
in line and i've also added something
 

773
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,629
in line and i've also added something
down here this is really important this

774
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
down here this is really important this
 

775
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,310
down here this is really important this
block here

776
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
block here
 

777
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,310
block here
is gonna act like the trap door on the

778
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
is gonna act like the trap door on the
 

779
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,150
is gonna act like the trap door on the
sorting system we had before so there's

780
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
sorting system we had before so there's
 

781
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,670
sorting system we had before so there's
gonna we're gonna hook a piston up to it

782
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
gonna we're gonna hook a piston up to it
 

783
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,230
gonna we're gonna hook a piston up to it
that's gonna

784
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
that's gonna
 

785
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,829
that's gonna
pull it back and and drop skeletons down

786
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:39,839
pull it back and and drop skeletons down
 

787
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,310
pull it back and and drop skeletons down
and

788
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
and
 

789
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,990
and
if uh yeah let's go down

790
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
if uh yeah let's go down
 

791
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,310
if uh yeah let's go down
okay so piston will come and push the

792
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
okay so piston will come and push the
 

793
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,870
okay so piston will come and push the
mobs over to here they'll fall down

794
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
mobs over to here they'll fall down
 

795
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,870
mobs over to here they'll fall down
and then if we get rid of this yeah we

796
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
and then if we get rid of this yeah we
 

797
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,150
and then if we get rid of this yeah we
can

798
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
can
 

799
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,870
can
skeletons will fall down here if this

800
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880
skeletons will fall down here if this
 

801
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,430
skeletons will fall down here if this
block gets pulled back by the piston

802
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
block gets pulled back by the piston
 

803
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,509
block gets pulled back by the piston
zombies and creepers will go either to

804
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
zombies and creepers will go either to
 

805
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,110
zombies and creepers will go either to
the left here

806
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
the left here
 

807
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,949
the left here
or to here

808
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
or to here
 

809
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,310
or to here
maybe we should get the zombies going

810
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
maybe we should get the zombies going
 

811
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,590
maybe we should get the zombies going
this way because we got the villager

812
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
this way because we got the villager
 

813
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,389
this way because we got the villager
there already that's pretty convenient

814
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399

 

815
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,150

all right everyone so i just went ahead

816
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
all right everyone so i just went ahead
 

817
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,790
all right everyone so i just went ahead
and did a little bit of redstone here

818
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
and did a little bit of redstone here
 

819
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,230
and did a little bit of redstone here
i don't know if it's going to work or

820
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
i don't know if it's going to work or
 

821
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,910
i don't know if it's going to work or
what settings we need or anything like

822
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
what settings we need or anything like
 

823
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,389
what settings we need or anything like
that

824
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
that
 

825
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,990
that
we'll hopefully figure it out but it

826
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
we'll hopefully figure it out but it
 

827
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,670
we'll hopefully figure it out but it
goes to

828
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
goes to
 

829
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,670
goes to
minecart dispenser to this piston up

830
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
minecart dispenser to this piston up
 

831
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,069
minecart dispenser to this piston up
here and that special block

832
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,079
here and that special block
 

833
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,790
here and that special block
down there i also have it all connected

834
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
down there i also have it all connected
 

835
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,509
down there i also have it all connected
to

836
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
to
 

837
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,710
to
so basically if there is a mob in in the

838
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
so basically if there is a mob in in the
 

839
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,590
so basically if there is a mob in in the
tube

840
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
tube
 

841
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,150
tube
they'll activate the tripwire that will

842
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
they'll activate the tripwire that will
 

843
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,430
they'll activate the tripwire that will
turn this torch off

844
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
turn this torch off
 

845
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,350
turn this torch off
if this torch is off it allows this

846
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
if this torch is off it allows this
 

847
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,430
if this torch is off it allows this
clock to run

848
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,440
clock to run
 

849
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,350
clock to run
which goes from here around and back

850
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
which goes from here around and back
 

851
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,430
which goes from here around and back
and every time it does a cycle it goes

852
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
and every time it does a cycle it goes
 

853
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,749
and every time it does a cycle it goes
to the dispenser let's one mine cart out

854
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
to the dispenser let's one mine cart out
 

855
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,310
to the dispenser let's one mine cart out
which goes picks up a mob goes over to

856
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
which goes picks up a mob goes over to
 

857
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,670
which goes picks up a mob goes over to
the cactus

858
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
the cactus
 

859
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,110
the cactus
and then ideally we want it set up so

860
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
and then ideally we want it set up so
 

861
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,029
and then ideally we want it set up so
that when a mob arrives there this

862
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
that when a mob arrives there this
 

863
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,750
that when a mob arrives there this
piston extends and pushes them off

864
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
piston extends and pushes them off
 

865
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,710
piston extends and pushes them off
so then i have another branch off here

866
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
so then i have another branch off here
 

867
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,590
so then i have another branch off here
going to that piston

868
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
going to that piston
 

869
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,390
going to that piston
and this is a monostable you can see i

870
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
and this is a monostable you can see i
 

871
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,549
and this is a monostable you can see i
got a sticky piston there

872
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
got a sticky piston there
 

873
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,150
got a sticky piston there
um okay

874
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
um okay
 

875
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,590
um okay
and then i also have the piston

876
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
and then i also have the piston
 

877
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,990
and then i also have the piston
underneath going

878
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
underneath going
 

879
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,830
underneath going
uh which will control if a skeleton

880
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
uh which will control if a skeleton
 

881
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,150
uh which will control if a skeleton
should fall and give enough time for a

882
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
should fall and give enough time for a
 

883
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,029
should fall and give enough time for a
creeper

884
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
creeper
 

885
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,789
creeper
and a zombie to figure out their path

886
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:34,799
and a zombie to figure out their path
 

887
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,070
and a zombie to figure out their path
finding hopefully so that's going to

888
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,080
finding hopefully so that's going to
 

889
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,029
finding hopefully so that's going to
take a while to

890
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
take a while to
 

891
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,510
take a while to
tweak i believe it's kind of a tricky

892
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
tweak i believe it's kind of a tricky
 

893
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,110
tweak i believe it's kind of a tricky
thing to work out

894
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
thing to work out
 

895
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,549
thing to work out
but this i think we can run it

896
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:44,559
but this i think we can run it
 

897
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,070
but this i think we can run it
i put a lever up here just to see

898
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080

 

899
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,310

all right so that's i think that's too

900
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
all right so that's i think that's too
 

901
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,110
all right so that's i think that's too
fast

902
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120

 

903
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,110

yeah way too fast okay so we're gonna

904
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
yeah way too fast okay so we're gonna
 

905
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,710
yeah way too fast okay so we're gonna
add to the clock

906
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720

 

907
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,150

uh-huh that's probably still too quick

908
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
uh-huh that's probably still too quick
 

909
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,870
uh-huh that's probably still too quick
we'll add a little bit more

910
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:10,880

 

911
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,870

okay you see when that goes and comes

912
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:12,880
okay you see when that goes and comes
 

913
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,710
okay you see when that goes and comes
back

914
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
back
 

915
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,549
back
this piston pushes before the minecart

916
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
this piston pushes before the minecart
 

917
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,070
this piston pushes before the minecart
arrives so we need to add some delay

918
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
arrives so we need to add some delay
 

919
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:26,630
arrives so we need to add some delay
here

920
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640

 

921
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,950

that's pretty close maybe we'll just do

922
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:28,960
that's pretty close maybe we'll just do
 

923
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,990
that's pretty close maybe we'll just do
this full

924
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
this full
 

925
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,230
this full
for now

926
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240

 

927
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,549

okay we won't really know if it works

928
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
okay we won't really know if it works
 

929
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,990
okay we won't really know if it works
until we get some mobs in here

930
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
until we get some mobs in here
 

931
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,789
until we get some mobs in here
unfortunately seems kind of loud too

932
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:40,799
unfortunately seems kind of loud too
 

933
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,549
unfortunately seems kind of loud too
doesn't it

934
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
doesn't it
 

935
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,390
doesn't it
um what's this thing doing down here

936
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
um what's this thing doing down here
 

937
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,870
um what's this thing doing down here
okay so after they get pushed down

938
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880

 

939
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,150

we want okay after this

940
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
we want okay after this
 

941
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:01,110
we want okay after this
this piston goes we want that extended

942
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120

 

943
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,390

it's kind of hard to see both at the

944
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
it's kind of hard to see both at the
 

945
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,270
it's kind of hard to see both at the
same time

946
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280

 

947
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,830

okay so that one pushes and this is

948
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:08,840
okay so that one pushes and this is
 

949
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,789
okay so that one pushes and this is
extended

950
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:10,799
extended
 

951
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,789
extended
i think we need a little bit of delay on

952
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
i think we need a little bit of delay on
 

953
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,710
i think we need a little bit of delay on
that one down there too

954
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,720

 

955
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,350

and it's gonna take a lot of tweaking i

956
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,360
and it's gonna take a lot of tweaking i
 

957
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,669
and it's gonna take a lot of tweaking i
think

958
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:21,679

 

959
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,590

i put a bunch of repeaters down here

960
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,600
i put a bunch of repeaters down here
 

961
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,190
i put a bunch of repeaters down here
here maybe we'll just do all that at

962
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,200
here maybe we'll just do all that at
 

963
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,750
here maybe we'll just do all that at
full and see what it does

964
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:31,760

 

965
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,230

okay pretty crazy

966
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
okay pretty crazy
 

967
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,150
okay pretty crazy
let's let's turn this off for now none

968
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
let's let's turn this off for now none
 

969
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,669
let's let's turn this off for now none
of the minecarts are getting destroyed

970
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:39,679
of the minecarts are getting destroyed
 

971
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,510
of the minecarts are getting destroyed
that's good we still have two in there

972
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,520
that's good we still have two in there
 

973
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,549
that's good we still have two in there
so the cactus isn't killing them

974
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
so the cactus isn't killing them
 

975
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,230
so the cactus isn't killing them
can we go down yes we can awesome

976
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
can we go down yes we can awesome
 

977
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,909
can we go down yes we can awesome
all right uh just for now i'm gonna put

978
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919
all right uh just for now i'm gonna put
 

979
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,230
all right uh just for now i'm gonna put
this here so

980
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
this here so
 

981
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,510
this here so
zombies we will make go this way so

982
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,520
zombies we will make go this way so
 

983
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,750
zombies we will make go this way so
we'll have two blocks for trap doors

984
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
we'll have two blocks for trap doors
 

985
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,510
we'll have two blocks for trap doors
and then another block and i guess the

986
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520
and then another block and i guess the
 

987
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,110
and then another block and i guess the
villager will go kinda around there

988
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,120
villager will go kinda around there
 

989
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,390
villager will go kinda around there
we'll have to move them a little bit it

990
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400
we'll have to move them a little bit it
 

991
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,149
we'll have to move them a little bit it
looks like

992
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
looks like
 

993
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,350
looks like
ah no trapdoors start it

994
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360

 

995
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,470

there we go did i i think i have some

996
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:14,480
there we go did i i think i have some
 

997
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,909
there we go did i i think i have some
more around here too we'll probably need

998
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919
more around here too we'll probably need
 

999
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,070
more around here too we'll probably need
a few

1000
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,080
a few
 

1001
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,669
a few
so we'll need two for the creepers as

1002
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
so we'll need two for the creepers as
 

1003
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,190
so we'll need two for the creepers as
well

1004
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
well
 

1005
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,390
well
oh do you think i can make this throw

1006
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
oh do you think i can make this throw
 

1007
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,789
oh do you think i can make this throw
i don't even know what to aim at let's

1008
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:26,799
i don't even know what to aim at let's
 

1009
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,830
i don't even know what to aim at let's
try over here

1010
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
try over here
 

1011
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,190
try over here
nope nope

1012
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
nope nope
 

1013
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,630
nope nope
that was pretty bad

1014
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:34,640
that was pretty bad
 

1015
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,990
that was pretty bad
oh no oh

1016
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,000

 

1017
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,510

you guys don't know this but a lot of

1018
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,520
you guys don't know this but a lot of
 

1019
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,110
you guys don't know this but a lot of
times when i'm working here i'll ender

1020
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,120
times when i'm working here i'll ender
 

1021
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,230
times when i'm working here i'll ender
pearl up like that

1022
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
pearl up like that
 

1023
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,029
pearl up like that
and i'll i'll go through the snow layer

1024
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:45,039
and i'll i'll go through the snow layer
 

1025
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,870
and i'll i'll go through the snow layer
into the mob system where all the mobs

1026
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:46,880
into the mob system where all the mobs
 

1027
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,310
into the mob system where all the mobs
are and i've had it blow

1028
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
are and i've had it blow
 

1029
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,110
are and i've had it blow
up on me a few times actually and when

1030
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
up on me a few times actually and when
 

1031
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,710
up on me a few times actually and when
that happens

1032
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
that happens
 

1033
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,990
that happens
when this snow breaks just a whole pool

1034
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
when this snow breaks just a whole pool
 

1035
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,549
when this snow breaks just a whole pool
of water and mobs flows down destroys

1036
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:58,559
of water and mobs flows down destroys
 

1037
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,630
of water and mobs flows down destroys
all the redstone below

1038
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
all the redstone below
 

1039
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,070
all the redstone below
it is bad news bad news i have to be

1040
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
it is bad news bad news i have to be
 

1041
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,630
it is bad news bad news i have to be
very careful about that

1042
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
very careful about that
 

1043
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,470
very careful about that
uh all right that

1044
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:10,480
uh all right that
 

1045
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,710
uh all right that
so mobs they see these trapdoors as full

1046
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
so mobs they see these trapdoors as full
 

1047
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,230
so mobs they see these trapdoors as full
blocks they'll actually try to walk on

1048
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
blocks they'll actually try to walk on
 

1049
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,549
blocks they'll actually try to walk on
them and they'll run off of this

1050
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
them and they'll run off of this
 

1051
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,190
them and they'll run off of this
which is pretty cool good way to exploit

1052
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,200
which is pretty cool good way to exploit
 

1053
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,669
which is pretty cool good way to exploit
their

1054
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
their
 

1055
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,149
their
their ai we'll do that again

1056
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
their ai we'll do that again
 

1057
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,350
their ai we'll do that again
a solid block here okay

1058
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,360
a solid block here okay
 

1059
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,710
a solid block here okay
this will be for the creepers

1060
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
this will be for the creepers
 

1061
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,430
this will be for the creepers
uh we'll probably need a platform over

1062
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:33,440
uh we'll probably need a platform over
 

1063
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:33,750
uh we'll probably need a platform over
here

1064
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
here
 

1065
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,750
here
otherwise the creepers won't want a path

1066
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
otherwise the creepers won't want a path
 

1067
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,390
otherwise the creepers won't want a path
find over this direction

1068
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,400
find over this direction
 

1069
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,990
find over this direction
don't know how big to make it either

1070
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
don't know how big to make it either
 

1071
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,149
don't know how big to make it either
we'll do that for now okay get that out

1072
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:46,159
we'll do that for now okay get that out
 

1073
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,110
we'll do that for now okay get that out
and i guess we can start hooking up some

1074
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
and i guess we can start hooking up some
 

1075
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,510
and i guess we can start hooking up some
tubes

1076
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520
tubes
 

1077
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,789
tubes
it's actually not that tough now that i

1078
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
it's actually not that tough now that i
 

1079
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,870
it's actually not that tough now that i
now that i'm doing it it's going pretty

1080
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:56,880
now that i'm doing it it's going pretty
 

1081
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,870
now that i'm doing it it's going pretty
good

1082
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:58,880
good
 

1083
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,230
good
should have done this a long time ago oh

1084
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
should have done this a long time ago oh
 

1085
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,710
should have done this a long time ago oh
i missed all right let's go back up

1086
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720

 

1087
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,070

let's go over there so i think with

1088
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,080
let's go over there so i think with
 

1089
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,830
let's go over there so i think with
these i want to try to get the mobs into

1090
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:09,840
these i want to try to get the mobs into
 

1091
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,230
these i want to try to get the mobs into
a one by one tube again so i think

1092
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,240

 

1093
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,830

see they're gonna be running this way

1094
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
see they're gonna be running this way
 

1095
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,909
see they're gonna be running this way
so we'll make the one one by one tube

1096
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
so we'll make the one one by one tube
 

1097
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,830
so we'll make the one one by one tube
over here

1098
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840

 

1099
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,990

hopefully

1100
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,000
hopefully
 

1101
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,630
hopefully
might need to get rid of a block there

1102
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
might need to get rid of a block there
 

1103
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,590
might need to get rid of a block there
yeah

1104
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
yeah
 

1105
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,270
yeah
so they'll still fall down two blocks i

1106
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,280
so they'll still fall down two blocks i
 

1107
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,669
so they'll still fall down two blocks i
think that'll work

1108
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
think that'll work
 

1109
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,350
think that'll work
yeah you gotta believe

1110
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:37,360
yeah you gotta believe
 

1111
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,630
yeah you gotta believe
believe in yourself and okay

1112
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
believe in yourself and okay
 

1113
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,390
believe in yourself and okay
i'm going to do the exact same with the

1114
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,400
i'm going to do the exact same with the
 

1115
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,029
i'm going to do the exact same with the
zombies

1116
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:47,039

 

1117
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,470

let's get there

1118
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,480
let's get there
 

1119
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,830
let's get there
i'm running out of glass first stack

1120
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
i'm running out of glass first stack
 

1121
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,510
i'm running out of glass first stack
all right so let's just put like a

1122
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,520
all right so let's just put like a
 

1123
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,950
all right so let's just put like a
block at the bottom here for now we'll

1124
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
block at the bottom here for now we'll
 

1125
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,870
block at the bottom here for now we'll
see see if we can get them to sort

1126
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
see see if we can get them to sort
 

1127
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,909
see see if we can get them to sort
properly

1128
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:03,919
properly
 

1129
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,950
properly
and then if this works then we will set

1130
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960
and then if this works then we will set
 

1131
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,909
and then if this works then we will set
up some kind of reserve for holding them

1132
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:09,919
up some kind of reserve for holding them
 

1133
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,669
up some kind of reserve for holding them
i guess this is kind of a reserve for

1134
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:11,679
i guess this is kind of a reserve for
 

1135
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,149
i guess this is kind of a reserve for
them um

1136
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
them um
 

1137
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,669
them um
we got to set up some other minecart

1138
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
we got to set up some other minecart
 

1139
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,510
we got to set up some other minecart
thing down here though to move them

1140
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
thing down here though to move them
 

1141
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,630
thing down here though to move them
further into the system later

1142
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,640
further into the system later
 

1143
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,190
further into the system later
okay and the skeletons they will fall

1144
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200
okay and the skeletons they will fall
 

1145
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,669
okay and the skeletons they will fall
where this block is supposed to be up

1146
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:29,679
where this block is supposed to be up
 

1147
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,270
where this block is supposed to be up
over here

1148
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,280
over here
 

1149
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,310
over here
uh like right there is where the piston

1150
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
uh like right there is where the piston
 

1151
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,510
uh like right there is where the piston
extends it to so we will bring this

1152
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
extends it to so we will bring this
 

1153
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,110
extends it to so we will bring this
actually let's put that back

1154
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120

 

1155
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,669

okay and they will fall down here i have

1156
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
okay and they will fall down here i have
 

1157
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,190
okay and they will fall down here i have
a hard time

1158
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,200
a hard time
 

1159
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,870
a hard time
this is getting really hard to see the

1160
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
this is getting really hard to see the
 

1161
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,750
this is getting really hard to see the
blocks all this all this transparency is

1162
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,760
blocks all this all this transparency is
 

1163
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,230
blocks all this all this transparency is
getting

1164
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
getting
 

1165
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,750
getting
uh a little confusing

1166
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,760
uh a little confusing
 

1167
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,789
uh a little confusing
all right

1168
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799

 

1169
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,310

cool okay i'm gonna do a little bit of

1170
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,320
cool okay i'm gonna do a little bit of
 

1171
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,549
cool okay i'm gonna do a little bit of
refinement here then i think we're ready

1172
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:00,559
refinement here then i think we're ready
 

1173
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,190
refinement here then i think we're ready
to do an

1174
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,200
to do an
 

1175
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,430
to do an
actual test with real mobs real live

1176
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,440
actual test with real mobs real live
 

1177
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,430
actual test with real mobs real live

and skeletons they should sit around on
that block

1344
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:32,960
that block
 

1345
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,389
that block
and after a certain amount of time

1346
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:34,399
and after a certain amount of time
 

1347
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,510
and after a certain amount of time
they'll just fall down so

1348
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,520
they'll just fall down so
 

1349
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,789
they'll just fall down so
yep that's our sorting system

1350
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:40,799
yep that's our sorting system
 

1351
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,750
yep that's our sorting system
now it's not going to be 100 i don't

1352
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:43,760
now it's not going to be 100 i don't
 

1353
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,230
now it's not going to be 100 i don't
think there are

1354
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:46,240
think there are
 

1355
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,389
think there are
well there might be but from what i've

1356
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:48,399
well there might be but from what i've
 

1357
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,470
well there might be but from what i've
seen most sorting systems aren't 100

1358
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:50,480
seen most sorting systems aren't 100
 

1359
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,510
seen most sorting systems aren't 100
percent

1360
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,520
percent
 

1361
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,110
percent
there's some some

1362
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,120
there's some some
 

1363
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,710
there's some some
there's always some chance a skeleton's

1364
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:56,720
there's always some chance a skeleton's
 

1365
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,549
there's always some chance a skeleton's
gonna go where you don't want them to go

1366
00:27:58,549 --> 00:27:58,559
gonna go where you don't want them to go
 

1367
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,190
gonna go where you don't want them to go
is the problem all right so

1368
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,200
is the problem all right so
 

1369
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,549
is the problem all right so
we can hop on over here

1370
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:06,559
we can hop on over here
 

1371
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,669
we can hop on over here
and figure out how bad a mistake we've

1372
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
and figure out how bad a mistake we've
 

1373
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,070
and figure out how bad a mistake we've
made

1374
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,080

 

1375
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,669

okay so the water stream we turned the

1376
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:13,679
okay so the water stream we turned the
 

1377
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,909
okay so the water stream we turned the
water stream on it's going over there

1378
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:15,919
water stream on it's going over there
 

1379
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,149
water stream on it's going over there
did not want to see which first

1380
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:18,159
did not want to see which first
 

1381
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,990
did not want to see which first
because which is uh oh

1382
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,000

 

1383
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,590

okay well that's not so

1384
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:29,600

 

1385
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:37,110

it's good stuck

1386
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,120

 

1387
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,950

oh okay so it sends out another minecart

1388
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:38,960
oh okay so it sends out another minecart
 

1389
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,630
oh okay so it sends out another minecart
at least

1390
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:40,640
at least
 

1391
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,830
at least
yeah witches should go where the

1392
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:41,840
yeah witches should go where the
 

1393
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,750
yeah witches should go where the
skeletons go

1394
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
skeletons go
 

1395
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,510
skeletons go
oh creeper fell down the skeleton one

1396
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520
oh creeper fell down the skeleton one
 

1397
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,870
oh creeper fell down the skeleton one
that's not good

1398
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:48,880
that's not good
 

1399
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,950
that's not good
we need more mobs i think it might be

1400
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:50,960
we need more mobs i think it might be
 

1401
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,470
we need more mobs i think it might be
night time

1402
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:54,480

 

1403
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,510

oh here comes a skeleton

1404
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:57,520
oh here comes a skeleton
 

1405
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,190
oh here comes a skeleton
yeah so if there's no mobs i think if

1406
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,200
yeah so if there's no mobs i think if
 

1407
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,789
yeah so if there's no mobs i think if
there's a lot of mobs in that reserve

1408
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:00,799
there's a lot of mobs in that reserve
 

1409
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:08,149
there's a lot of mobs in that reserve
they'll bounce around to the mine cart

1410
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159

 

1411
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,789

that's weird um

1412
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:12,799
that's weird um
 

1413
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,110
that's weird um
you should be moving why isn't that

1414
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,120
you should be moving why isn't that
 

1415
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,710
you should be moving why isn't that
minecart moving

1416
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:20,720

 

1417
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,510

interesting

1418
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:25,520

 

1419
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,630

oh man this is weird i think we have

1420
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:28,640
oh man this is weird i think we have
 

1421
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,269
oh man this is weird i think we have
some time issues

1422
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
some time issues
 

1423
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,710
some time issues
oh this is open yikes okay creepers can

1424
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:34,720
oh this is open yikes okay creepers can
 

1425
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,310
oh this is open yikes okay creepers can
uh creepers have a nice passage there

1426
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
uh creepers have a nice passage there
 

1427
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,830
uh creepers have a nice passage there
let's go look at the the sorting thing

1428
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:43,840
let's go look at the the sorting thing
 

1429
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:56,149
let's go look at the the sorting thing
see what's going on

1430
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,159

 

1431
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:02,230

um not looking so good to be honest

1432
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,240

 

1433
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,310

right okay

1434
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,320

 

1435
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,590

so i have some tweaking to make maybe

1436
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:09,600
so i have some tweaking to make maybe
 

1437
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,590
so i have some tweaking to make maybe
oops oh i thought that guy fell down

1438
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:13,600
oops oh i thought that guy fell down
 

1439
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,269
oops oh i thought that guy fell down
um yeah i'm going to tweak some timings

1440
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
um yeah i'm going to tweak some timings
 

1441
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,710
um yeah i'm going to tweak some timings
there and see if i can get it working

1442
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:18,720
there and see if i can get it working
 

1443
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,269
there and see if i can get it working
better and

1444
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:19,279
better and
 

1445
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,750
better and
we'll see it one more time at least i'm

1446
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:21,760
we'll see it one more time at least i'm
 

1447
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,110
we'll see it one more time at least i'm
gonna have to call the episode an end

1448
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,120
gonna have to call the episode an end
 

1449
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,549
gonna have to call the episode an end
very soon though because

1450
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:24,559
very soon though because
 

1451
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,580
very soon though because
it is getting that time

1452
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:28,590

know what it is
 

1467
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,710
know what it is
look you see how the zombie he's looking

1468
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:54,720
look you see how the zombie he's looking
 

1469
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,549
look you see how the zombie he's looking
off over here

1470
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:56,559
off over here
 

1471
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,590
off over here
he's not looking at the villager

1472
00:30:59,590 --> 00:30:59,600
he's not looking at the villager
 

1473
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,830

he's looking over like that way for some
 

1475
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,350
he's looking over like that way for some
reason and what that's doing

1476
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,360

 

1477
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,029

instead of the minecart going into the

1478
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:09,039
instead of the minecart going into the
 

1479
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,509
instead of the minecart going into the
cactus like it's supposed to

1480
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:11,519
cactus like it's supposed to
 

1481
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,950
cactus like it's supposed to
see see how the creeper is looking this

see see how the creeper is looking this
 

1483
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,230
see see how the creeper is looking this
way the creeper is telling the minecart

1484
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,240
way the creeper is telling the minecart
 

1485
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,389
way the creeper is telling the minecart
not to go up this hill he's he's making

1491
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:33,029

see it's so weird

1492
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:33,039
see it's so weird
 

1493
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,269
see it's so weird
let's see just let's just watch it for a

1494
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:35,279
let's see just let's just watch it for a
 

1495
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,789
let's see just let's just watch it for a
sec see if we can spot it happening

1496
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:36,799
sec see if we can spot it happening
 

1497
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,990
sec see if we can spot it happening
again

1498
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,000
again
 

1499
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,149
again
like that was weird why isn't the

1500
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:40,159
like that was weird why isn't the
 

1501
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,149
like that was weird why isn't the
minecart breaking

1502
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:42,159
minecart breaking
 

1503
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,590
minecart breaking
it's hitting a cactus

1504
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:45,600

 

1505
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,029

1509
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,230

and instead of running into the cactus

1510
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,240
and instead of running into the cactus
 

1511
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,990
and instead of running into the cactus
he's telling the minecart to go down

1512
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,000
he's telling the minecart to go down
 

1513
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,430
he's telling the minecart to go down
once once he gets to the top of the

1514
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,440
once once he gets to the top of the
 

1515
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,350
once once he gets to the top of the
slope there

1516
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,360
slope there
 

1517
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,909
slope there
so this is a problem i think i've dealt

1518
00:31:59,909 --> 00:31:59,919
so this is a problem i think i've dealt
 

1519
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,029
so this is a problem i think i've dealt
with before

1520
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
with before
 

1521
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,430
with before
i made a mistake here where i only

1522
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:03,440
i made a mistake here where i only
 

1523
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,110
i made a mistake here where i only
dropped them two blocks from the water

1524
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,120
dropped them two blocks from the water
 

1525
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,230
dropped them two blocks from the water
stream

1526
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:06,240
stream
 

1527
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,710
stream
i think you gotta drop them either three

1528
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,720
i think you gotta drop them either three
 

1529
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,029
i think you gotta drop them either three
or four otherwise

1530
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,039
or four otherwise
 

1531
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,789
or four otherwise
it messes up their pathfinding it's like

1532
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:12,799
it messes up their pathfinding it's like
 

1533
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,070
it messes up their pathfinding it's like
they want to go

1534
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,080
they want to go
 

1535
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,549
they want to go
this way towards the water stream again

1536
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:20,559

 

1537
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,110

that's why they're all looking this way

1538
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,120
that's why they're all looking this way
 

1539
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,149
that's why they're all looking this way
and why they're avoiding the cactus

1540
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:26,159
and why they're avoiding the cactus
 

1541
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,549
and why they're avoiding the cactus
and doing strange things i believe i

1542
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:28,559
and doing strange things i believe i
 

1543
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,590
and doing strange things i believe i
hope

1544
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:29,600
hope
 

1545
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,110
hope
so that means i have to build all of

1546
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,120
so that means i have to build all of
 

1547
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,669
so that means i have to build all of
this one block lower maybe two

1548
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:33,679
this one block lower maybe two
 

1549
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,950
this one block lower maybe two
oh that's not good minecart fell out

1550
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:36,960
oh that's not good minecart fell out
 

1551
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,470
oh that's not good minecart fell out
somehow

1552
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:38,480
somehow
 

1553
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,990
somehow
see the creeper he's looking this way

1554
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,000
see the creeper he's looking this way
 

1555
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,590
see the creeper he's looking this way
that's why the car the cart isn't

1556
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:41,600
that's why the car the cart isn't
 

1557
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,710
that's why the car the cart isn't
bouncing

1558
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:42,720
bouncing
 

1559
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,909
bouncing
too

1560
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:49,919

 

1561
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,230

anyway i'll look into it more later i

1562
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,240
anyway i'll look into it more later i
 

1563
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,590
anyway i'll look into it more later i
i'm pretty sure i have to build this all

1564
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:53,600
i'm pretty sure i have to build this all
 

1565
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,509
i'm pretty sure i have to build this all
one or two blocks lower though

1566
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:55,519
one or two blocks lower though
 

1567
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,750
one or two blocks lower though
which is pretty annoying

1568
00:32:59,750 --> 00:32:59,760

 

1569
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,789

did you steal my minecart

1570
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:02,799
did you steal my minecart
 

1571
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,630
did you steal my minecart
he's got my minecart

1572
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:06,640

 

1573
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,669

yeah and so they're i think like all

1574
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:09,679
yeah and so they're i think like all
 

1575
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,190
yeah and so they're i think like all
their pathfinding is messed up

1576
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,200
their pathfinding is messed up
 

1577
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,789
their pathfinding is messed up
because they have that one target in

1578
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:12,799
because they have that one target in
 

1579
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,230
because they have that one target in
mind so they're

1580
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,240
mind so they're
 

1581
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,070
mind so they're
like almost ignoring the villager and

1582
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
like almost ignoring the villager and
 

1583
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,630
like almost ignoring the villager and
the cat here

1584
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:18,640
the cat here
 

1585
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,110
the cat here
it's very very weird anyway

1586
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,120
it's very very weird anyway
 

1587
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,190
it's very very weird anyway
it's a start but it needs tweaking too

1588
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:25,200
it's a start but it needs tweaking too
 

1589
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,149
it's a start but it needs tweaking too
it looks like

1590
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:26,159
it looks like
 

1591
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,950
it looks like
um i actually tried building this in

1592
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:28,960
um i actually tried building this in
 

1593
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,789
um i actually tried building this in
creative just now and

1594
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:30,799
creative just now and
 

1595
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,830
creative just now and
it worked up in the sky

1596
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:33,840
it worked up in the sky
 

1597
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,870
it worked up in the sky
uh so it's it's something to do with in

1598
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:36,880
uh so it's it's something to do with in
 

1599
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,470
uh so it's it's something to do with in
my world here it's not a problem with

1600
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:38,480
my world here it's not a problem with
 

1601
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:38,870
my world here it's not a problem with
the

1602
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880
the
 

1603
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,029
the
setup really

1604
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:43,039

 

1605
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,470

well it kind of is i guess i don't know

1606
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:46,480
well it kind of is i guess i don't know
 

1607
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,070
well it kind of is i guess i don't know
anyway project for another day i guess

1608
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,080
anyway project for another day i guess
 

1609
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,190
anyway project for another day i guess
oh no he's gonna eat me i better

1610
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:55,200
oh no he's gonna eat me i better
 

1611
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,590
oh no he's gonna eat me i better
i better back up very slowly and get him

1612
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:57,600
i better back up very slowly and get him
 

1613
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,230
i better back up very slowly and get him
stuck on the fence and

1614
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,240
stuck on the fence and
 

1615
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,909
stuck on the fence and
and run away anyway so i'm gonna move

1616
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:03,919
and run away anyway so i'm gonna move
 

1617
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,669
and run away anyway so i'm gonna move
all that stuff down a block or two i

1618
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:05,679
all that stuff down a block or two i
 

1619
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,190
all that stuff down a block or two i
think that will fix it the the issue is

1620
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,200
think that will fix it the the issue is
 

1621
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,069
think that will fix it the the issue is
in a nutshell they are pathfinding to

1622
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:12,079
in a nutshell they are pathfinding to
 

1623
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,829
in a nutshell they are pathfinding to
something they're not supposed to which

1624
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:13,839
something they're not supposed to which
 

1625
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,510
something they're not supposed to which
is messing everything up because the

1626
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:15,520
is messing everything up because the
 

1627
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,909
is messing everything up because the
whole system is based on

1628
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:17,919
whole system is based on
 

1629
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,909
whole system is based on
uh their pathfinding working so

1630
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:21,919
uh their pathfinding working so
 

1631
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,750
uh their pathfinding working so
once i can get rid of whatever they're

1632
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:23,760
once i can get rid of whatever they're
 

1633
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,270
once i can get rid of whatever they're
looking at

1634
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,280
looking at
 

1635
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,510
looking at
they should do what i want them to do

1636
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:27,520
they should do what i want them to do
 

1637
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,349
they should do what i want them to do
i'm pretty sure

1638
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:29,359
i'm pretty sure
 

1639
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,829
i'm pretty sure
but another day i'll work on it later i

1640
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:31,839
but another day i'll work on it later i
 

1641
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,430
but another day i'll work on it later i
guess

1642
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:33,440
guess
 

1643
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,909
guess
but let's read our comments for the day

1644
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:35,919
but let's read our comments for the day
 

1645
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:37,589
but let's read our comments for the day
i just picked up one really quick one

1646
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:37,599
i just picked up one really quick one
 

1647
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,190
i just picked up one really quick one
here it says etho

1648
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,200
here it says etho
 

1649
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,030
here it says etho
can you solve a rubik's cube

1650
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,040
can you solve a rubik's cube
 

1651
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,149
can you solve a rubik's cube
oh you know i used to be able to

1652
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:46,159
oh you know i used to be able to
 

1653
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,750
oh you know i used to be able to
uh it's pretty quick at it too i could

1654
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:47,760
uh it's pretty quick at it too i could
 

1655
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,829
uh it's pretty quick at it too i could
do it like in a minute or two

1656
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:49,839
do it like in a minute or two
 

1657
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,190
do it like in a minute or two
which is decent i would say uh

1658
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,200

 

1659
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,550

don't remember how to anymore

1660
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:58,560
don't remember how to anymore
 

1661
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,550
don't remember how to anymore
you know on tv and movies if you guys

1662
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:00,560
you know on tv and movies if you guys
 

1663
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,990
you know on tv and movies if you guys
don't know how to solve a rubik's

1664
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,000
don't know how to solve a rubik's
 

1665
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,150
don't know how to solve a rubik's
cube they always like associate it with

1666
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,160
cube they always like associate it with
 

1667
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,310
cube they always like associate it with
these really smart people that can

1668
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:06,320
these really smart people that can
 

1669
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,710
these really smart people that can
then solve it and then they do it in

1670
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:08,720
then solve it and then they do it in
 

1671
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,589
then solve it and then they do it in
like a second and everybody's amazed

1672
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:11,599
like a second and everybody's amazed
 

1673
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,870
like a second and everybody's amazed
it's not really about intelligence

1674
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:14,880
it's not really about intelligence
 

1675
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,630
it's not really about intelligence
solving a rubik's cube it's about

1676
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:16,640
solving a rubik's cube it's about
 

1677
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,750
solving a rubik's cube it's about
following patterns algorithms

1678
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:19,760
following patterns algorithms
 

1679
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,710
following patterns algorithms
if you rotate it a certain way

1680
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,720

 

1681
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,310

and follow a bunch of steps there's like

1682
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,320
and follow a bunch of steps there's like
 

1683
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,910
and follow a bunch of steps there's like
eight different steps to it

1684
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:27,920
eight different steps to it
 

1685
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,550
eight different steps to it
eventually everything lines up and you

1686
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:30,560
eventually everything lines up and you
 

1687
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,990
eventually everything lines up and you
don't even really have to think about it

1688
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,000
don't even really have to think about it
 

1689
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,910
don't even really have to think about it
you just have to do it

1690
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:33,920
you just have to do it
 

1691
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,230
you just have to do it
and if depending on how it's mixed up

1692
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,240
and if depending on how it's mixed up
 

1693
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,870
and if depending on how it's mixed up
you might be able to skip steps and

1694
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:38,880
you might be able to skip steps and
 

1695
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,190
you might be able to skip steps and
sometimes the steps line up quicker than

1696
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,200
sometimes the steps line up quicker than
 

1697
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,910
sometimes the steps line up quicker than
other times

1698
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:41,920
other times
 

1699
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,030
other times
depending on how it's mixed up so

1700
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,040
depending on how it's mixed up so
 

1701
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,750
depending on how it's mixed up so
yeah that's how you solve a rubik's cube

1702
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:47,760
yeah that's how you solve a rubik's cube
 

1703
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,109
yeah that's how you solve a rubik's cube
you can look it up it's actually kind of

1704
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:49,119
you can look it up it's actually kind of
 

1705
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,190
you can look it up it's actually kind of
fun once you know how to do it

1706
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,200
fun once you know how to do it
 

1707
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,670
fun once you know how to do it
to do it but i can't remember how

1708
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:55,680

 

1709
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,589

anyway so that's going to bring our

1710
