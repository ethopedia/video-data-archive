00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,830

hey everybody how you doing today I

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:09,840
hey everybody how you doing today I
 

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,410
hey everybody how you doing today I
believe last time we left off in the

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:12,420
believe last time we left off in the
 

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,609
believe last time we left off in the
nether as exploring this fortress thing

6
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:15,619
nether as exploring this fortress thing
 

7
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,230
nether as exploring this fortress thing
I've gone through it all now I'm pretty

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
I've gone through it all now I'm pretty
 

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,710
I've gone through it all now I'm pretty
sure and I found to blaze spawners in

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:21,720
sure and I found to blaze spawners in
 

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,779
sure and I found to blaze spawners in
total I was hoping to find two together

12
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:23,789
total I was hoping to find two together
 

13
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,730
total I was hoping to find two together
but then never happened

14
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:25,740
but then never happened
 

15
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,160
but then never happened
I don't know how rare that is but

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,170
I don't know how rare that is but
 

17
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,009
I don't know how rare that is but
probably probably fairly rare the other

18
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:31,019
probably probably fairly rare the other
 

19
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,440
probably probably fairly rare the other
one I found is over here and it's in a

20
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:33,450
one I found is over here and it's in a
 

21
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,619
one I found is over here and it's in a
pretty cool area surrounded by glowstone

22
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:38,629
pretty cool area surrounded by glowstone
 

23
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:42,200
pretty cool area surrounded by glowstone
so I think I'm just going to leave that

24
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,210
so I think I'm just going to leave that
 

25
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,400
so I think I'm just going to leave that
be for now and there's some more

26
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,410
be for now and there's some more
 

27
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,950
be for now and there's some more
glowstone here I'm surprised they never

28
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:51,960
glowstone here I'm surprised they never
 

29
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,869
glowstone here I'm surprised they never
put any chests or anything in these

30
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:53,879
put any chests or anything in these
 

31
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,450
put any chests or anything in these
fortress things to make them you know a

32
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:56,460
fortress things to make them you know a
 

33
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,660
fortress things to make them you know a
little bit more interesting basically

34
00:00:59,660 --> 00:00:59,670
little bit more interesting basically
 

35
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,020
little bit more interesting basically
they all just dead end it's not really

36
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,030
they all just dead end it's not really
 

37
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,880
they all just dead end it's not really
overly exciting to explore once you've

38
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:07,890
overly exciting to explore once you've
 

39
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,399
overly exciting to explore once you've
seen a few of them but yeah the other

40
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:13,409
seen a few of them but yeah the other
 

41
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,100
seen a few of them but yeah the other
one we found was over here and this is

42
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,110
one we found was over here and this is
 

43
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,810
one we found was over here and this is
the one we're going to make a blaze

44
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:17,820
the one we're going to make a blaze
 

45
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,249
the one we're going to make a blaze
spawner with today I'm hoping right over

46
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:22,259
spawner with today I'm hoping right over
 

47
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,560
spawner with today I'm hoping right over
there it's still not disabled I cannot

48
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:24,570
there it's still not disabled I cannot
 

49
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,289
there it's still not disabled I cannot
disable it using torches alone because

50
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:29,299
disable it using torches alone because
 

51
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:32,330
disable it using torches alone because
there's still spotting in midair in the

52
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:32,340
there's still spotting in midair in the
 

53
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,319
there's still spotting in midair in the
area so the best way I can think of of

54
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:36,329
area so the best way I can think of of
 

55
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,969
area so the best way I can think of of
disabling this thing is just to put

56
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:37,979
disabling this thing is just to put
 

57
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,899
disabling this thing is just to put
blocks around its so that no more I will

58
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:41,909
blocks around its so that no more I will
 

59
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,569
blocks around its so that no more I will
be able to spawn in the area so that's

60
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:44,579
be able to spawn in the area so that's
 

61
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:52,630
be able to spawn in the area so that's
what I'm going to do now

62
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640

 

63
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:08,440

boom no not a freaking gas so nice shot

64
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:08,450

73
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:23,700

pretty much invulnerable with us

74
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:23,710

 

75
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,410

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:51,220

alright so I have no arrows left do it

82
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,230
alright so I have no arrows left do it
 

83
00:04:51,230 --> 00:05:06,030
alright so I have no arrows left do it
the hard way absolutely no arrows

84
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,040

 

85
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:18,240

disable a spawning

86
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,250

 

87
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,160

what happens if you use a fishing rod on

88
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,170
what happens if you use a fishing rod on
 

89
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:29,260
what happens if you use a fishing rod on
a blaze

90
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,270

 

91
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:34,540

yeah I am I need arrows so bad

92
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:34,550
yeah I am I need arrows so bad
 

93
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:47,110
yeah I am I need arrows so bad
this is silly ah alright so I did get my

94
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
this is silly ah alright so I did get my
 

95
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,260
this is silly ah alright so I did get my
stuff back but dying there has made me

96
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,270
stuff back but dying there has made me
 

97
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,200
stuff back but dying there has made me
kind of accept them not really in any

98
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,210
kind of accept them not really in any
 

99
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,990
kind of accept them not really in any
position to deal with the nether like I

100
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,000
position to deal with the nether like I
 

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,850
position to deal with the nether like I
am here I can't I can't handle the gas

102
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:02,860
am here I can't I can't handle the gas
 

103
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,379
am here I can't I can't handle the gas
without any arrows this is too difficult

104
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:05,389
without any arrows this is too difficult
 

105
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:10,839
without any arrows this is too difficult
so like my original plan was to build a

106
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:10,849
so like my original plan was to build a
 

107
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:14,999
so like my original plan was to build a
base around this blaze spawner here I

108
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:15,009
base around this blaze spawner here I
 

109
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,140
base around this blaze spawner here I
think I'm going to have to do it around

110
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,150
think I'm going to have to do it around
 

111
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,180
think I'm going to have to do it around
the one back there because it's enclosed

112
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,190
the one back there because it's enclosed
 

113
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,890
the one back there because it's enclosed
it'll be a lot easier to set up I just I

114
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:23,900
it'll be a lot easier to set up I just I
 

115
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,439
it'll be a lot easier to set up I just I
just can't deal with the open area until

116
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:26,449
just can't deal with the open area until
 

117
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:31,390
just can't deal with the open area until
I build a real mob system so we will we

118
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:31,400
I build a real mob system so we will we
 

119
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,490
I build a real mob system so we will we
will set up a blaze farm at the other

120
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:33,500
will set up a blaze farm at the other
 

121
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,409
will set up a blaze farm at the other
one yeah so it's been a whole lot easier

122
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:38,419
one yeah so it's been a whole lot easier
 

123
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:40,779
one yeah so it's been a whole lot easier
working in this little room here because

124
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:40,789
working in this little room here because
 

125
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:43,930
working in this little room here because
there's no guests shooting me so much

126
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:43,940
there's no guests shooting me so much
 

127
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,290
there's no guests shooting me so much
more peaceful I mean take out the

128
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:47,300
more peaceful I mean take out the
 

129
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,649
more peaceful I mean take out the
glowstone now I got my fortune three pic

130
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:50,659
glowstone now I got my fortune three pic
 

131
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:55,209
glowstone now I got my fortune three pic
and apparently using fortune 3 on

132
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:55,219
and apparently using fortune 3 on
 

133
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:57,879
and apparently using fortune 3 on
glowstone makes it more likely that

134
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:57,889
glowstone makes it more likely that
 

135
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,800
glowstone makes it more likely that
you'll get for dust when you break it

136
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:01,810
you'll get for dust when you break it
 

137
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,930
you'll get for dust when you break it
normally it's two to four so let's check

138
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:04,940
normally it's two to four so let's check
 

139
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:14,469
normally it's two to four so let's check
it out got four four four yeah it seems

140
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
it out got four four four yeah it seems
 

141
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,129
it out got four four four yeah it seems
to seems to do it oh is it I think

142
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:18,139
to seems to do it oh is it I think
 

143
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,580
to seems to do it oh is it I think
that's three yep

144
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:20,590
that's three yep
 

145
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,140
that's three yep
you don't always get four but most the

146
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,150
you don't always get four but most the
 

147
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:29,940
you don't always get four but most the
time you will three and

148
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:29,950
time you will three and
 

149
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,340
time you will three and
yeah so I'm going to fish in casing this

150
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:33,350
yeah so I'm going to fish in casing this
 

151
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,760
yeah so I'm going to fish in casing this
area with cobblestone I'm making an 8 by

152
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:36,770
area with cobblestone I'm making an 8 by
 

153
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:43,990
area with cobblestone I'm making an 8 by
8 by 3 hi rectangle square 2 whatever

154
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
8 by 3 hi rectangle square 2 whatever
 

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,760
8 by 3 hi rectangle square 2 whatever
whatever it's called area where the

156
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:48,770
whatever it's called area where the
 

157
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,440
whatever it's called area where the
blades can spawn and once I fill that

158
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:50,450
blades can spawn and once I fill that
 

159
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,900
blades can spawn and once I fill that
all in they won't be able to spawn at

160
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:52,910
all in they won't be able to spawn at
 

161
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,310
all in they won't be able to spawn at
all and I'll be able to just build

162
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:54,320
all and I'll be able to just build
 

163
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,260
all and I'll be able to just build
around the big concrete slab or whatever

164
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:58,270
around the big concrete slab or whatever
 

165
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:04,270
around the big concrete slab or whatever
so I'll see you once I finish that okay

166
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,280
so I'll see you once I finish that okay
 

167
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,880
so I'll see you once I finish that okay
so I got it all filled in here they are

168
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:06,890
so I got it all filled in here they are
 

169
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,700
so I got it all filled in here they are
not able to spawn anymore regardless of

170
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:09,710
not able to spawn anymore regardless of
 

171
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,790
not able to spawn anymore regardless of
the lighting condition so lighting

172
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
the lighting condition so lighting
 

173
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,040
the lighting condition so lighting
condition does really slow down spawning

174
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,050
condition does really slow down spawning
 

175
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,130
condition does really slow down spawning
but the thing is it's very difficult to

176
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:18,140
but the thing is it's very difficult to
 

177
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,440
but the thing is it's very difficult to
work around if you're constantly

178
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:20,450
work around if you're constantly
 

179
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:25,150
work around if you're constantly
breaking torches or moving lava so I

180
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:25,160
breaking torches or moving lava so I
 

181
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,640
breaking torches or moving lava so I
would recommend you you do this encasing

182
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:27,650
would recommend you you do this encasing
 

183
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,629
would recommend you you do this encasing
thing if you're building a blaze farm

184
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
thing if you're building a blaze farm
 

185
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,000
thing if you're building a blaze farm
okay we probably won't get into building

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,010
okay we probably won't get into building
 

187
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,329
okay we probably won't get into building
it today just because it'll take a long

188
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:37,339
it today just because it'll take a long
 

189
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:40,779
it today just because it'll take a long
time to do probably or at least all all

190
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:40,789
time to do probably or at least all all
 

191
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,270
time to do probably or at least all all
I want to show probably 20 or 30 minutes

192
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:43,280
I want to show probably 20 or 30 minutes
 

193
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,990
I want to show probably 20 or 30 minutes
of LP time and I have something very

194
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,000
of LP time and I have something very
 

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,240
of LP time and I have something very
important I wanted to do today so we're

196
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,250
important I wanted to do today so we're
 

197
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,300
important I wanted to do today so we're
going to stop construction here today on

198
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,310
going to stop construction here today on
 

199
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,510
going to stop construction here today on
this but I will go over a few important

200
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:58,520
this but I will go over a few important
 

201
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,090
this but I will go over a few important
things so this is the area where the mob

202
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:04,100
things so this is the area where the mob
 

203
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,240
things so this is the area where the mob
spawning occurs from a spawner it's area

204
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,250
spawning occurs from a spawner it's area
 

205
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,829
spawning occurs from a spawner it's area
that's checked blaze though are 2 blocks

206
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
that's checked blaze though are 2 blocks
 

207
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,829
that's checked blaze though are 2 blocks
high so this isn't all necessary this

208
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:14,839
high so this isn't all necessary this
 

209
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,260
high so this isn't all necessary this
bottom bottom layer is not required ok

210
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,270
bottom bottom layer is not required ok
 

211
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,500
bottom bottom layer is not required ok
so so for example let's say the game

212
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:22,510
so so for example let's say the game
 

213
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,840
so so for example let's say the game
checks this spot here to see if a blaze

214
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:25,850
checks this spot here to see if a blaze
 

215
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,310
checks this spot here to see if a blaze
is to spawn that's where their feet

216
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
is to spawn that's where their feet
 

217
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,140
is to spawn that's where their feet
would be and then their head would be

218
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,150
would be and then their head would be
 

219
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,750
would be and then their head would be
one block up in in this cobblestone here

220
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:34,760
one block up in in this cobblestone here
 

221
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,960
one block up in in this cobblestone here
so they won't be able to spawn

222
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:37,970
so they won't be able to spawn
 

223
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,239
so they won't be able to spawn
with this one just one air block below

224
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:40,249
with this one just one air block below
 

225
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:43,539
with this one just one air block below
the blaze spawner but if I remove one of

226
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:43,549
the blaze spawner but if I remove one of
 

227
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:54,099
the blaze spawner but if I remove one of
these ha oops yeah so that's one deal

228
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:54,109
these ha oops yeah so that's one deal
 

229
00:09:54,109 --> 00:09:57,059
these ha oops yeah so that's one deal
there and on top

230
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:57,069
there and on top
 

231
00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:01,479
there and on top
much the same thing I fish to fill that

232
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:01,489
much the same thing I fish to fill that
 

233
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:03,909
much the same thing I fish to fill that
in so the blaze spawner is right below

234
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:03,919
in so the blaze spawner is right below
 

235
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:09,369
in so the blaze spawner is right below
here they're not able to spawn one block

236
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:09,379
here they're not able to spawn one block
 

237
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:13,479
here they're not able to spawn one block
up but if you go one block down they'll

238
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:13,489
up but if you go one block down they'll
 

239
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:16,479
up but if you go one block down they'll
be able to spawn in that area like you

240
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:16,489
be able to spawn in that area like you
 

241
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:23,559
be able to spawn in that area like you
just saw so to get the absolute highest

242
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:23,569
just saw so to get the absolute highest
 

243
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:26,829
just saw so to get the absolute highest
spawn rates possible from this one blaze

244
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:26,839
spawn rates possible from this one blaze
 

245
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,389
spawn rates possible from this one blaze
spawner here so absolute highest XP

246
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
spawner here so absolute highest XP
 

247
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,239
spawner here so absolute highest XP
output from it I'm going to have to make

248
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:34,249
output from it I'm going to have to make
 

249
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:37,960
output from it I'm going to have to make
sure all this cobble area is err blocks

250
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:37,970
sure all this cobble area is err blocks
 

251
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,549
sure all this cobble area is err blocks
when I'm done my farm so that's the 8x8

252
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:42,559
when I'm done my farm so that's the 8x8
 

253
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,659
when I'm done my farm so that's the 8x8
for this layer this layer this layer and

254
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:46,669
for this layer this layer this layer and
 

255
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:51,699
for this layer this layer this layer and
also one layer above because if a blaze

256
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:51,709
also one layer above because if a blaze
 

257
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:55,509
also one layer above because if a blaze
was to spawn at this block here that's

258
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
was to spawn at this block here that's
 

259
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,879
was to spawn at this block here that's
where his feet would be and his head

260
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:57,889
where his feet would be and his head
 

261
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:00,149
where his feet would be and his head
would be one block higher so he needs

262
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:00,159
would be one block higher so he needs
 

263
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,279
would be one block higher so he needs
one air space as well so in total I need

264
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:03,289
one air space as well so in total I need
 

265
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:11,759
one air space as well so in total I need
an 8 by 8 by 4 high area of airspace

266
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:11,769

 

267
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:15,489

also when my blaze farm is all done here

268
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:15,499
also when my blaze farm is all done here
 

269
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:16,899
also when my blaze farm is all done here
I'm going to have to make sure I have no

270
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:16,909
I'm going to have to make sure I have no
 

271
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,189
I'm going to have to make sure I have no
torches or lava glowstone or anything

272
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:20,199
torches or lava glowstone or anything
 

273
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:25,449
torches or lava glowstone or anything
lighting the 8 by 8 by 4 area I want

274
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:25,459
lighting the 8 by 8 by 4 area I want
 

275
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,279
lighting the 8 by 8 by 4 area I want
that space as dark as possible because

276
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:27,289
that space as dark as possible because
 

277
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,889
that space as dark as possible because
that will increase the rate that the

278
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:29,899
that will increase the rate that the
 

279
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:35,289
that will increase the rate that the
blaze will spawn ok and I'll tell you

280
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:35,299
blaze will spawn ok and I'll tell you
 

281
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:37,659
blaze will spawn ok and I'll tell you
how I figure out that how to position 8

282
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:37,669
how I figure out that how to position 8
 

283
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:40,539
how I figure out that how to position 8
by 8 I've covered this before when I was

284
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:40,549
by 8 I've covered this before when I was
 

285
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:42,969
by 8 I've covered this before when I was
doing the cave spiders but I'll go over

286
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:42,979
doing the cave spiders but I'll go over
 

287
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:47,109
doing the cave spiders but I'll go over
it again if you count this way from the

288
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:47,119
it again if you count this way from the
 

289
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:49,750
it again if you count this way from the
spawner it goes 1 2

290
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
spawner it goes 1 2
 

291
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,040
spawner it goes 1 2
three blocks but this way it goes one

292
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,050
three blocks but this way it goes one
 

293
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:59,200
three blocks but this way it goes one
two three four blocks so how do you know

294
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,210
two three four blocks so how do you know
 

295
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,420
two three four blocks so how do you know
which one to make four blocks and which

296
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:01,430
which one to make four blocks and which
 

297
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,900
which one to make four blocks and which
one to go three blocks well I use the

298
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:04,910
one to go three blocks well I use the
 

299
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,850
one to go three blocks well I use the
coordinates here if you look at X and

300
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:06,860
coordinates here if you look at X and
 

301
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,300
coordinates here if you look at X and
Zed

302
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:07,310
Zed
 

303
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,300
Zed
when I'm walking this way they both get

304
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:10,310
when I'm walking this way they both get
 

305
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,580
when I'm walking this way they both get
smaller so I know that's OOP that's the

306
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:14,590
smaller so I know that's OOP that's the
 

307
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,090
smaller so I know that's OOP that's the
one that I need to go four blocks on and

308
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,100
one that I need to go four blocks on and
 

309
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,310
one that I need to go four blocks on and
if I'm going this way they get larger so

310
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:21,320
if I'm going this way they get larger so
 

311
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,460
if I'm going this way they get larger so
that's that's the three blocks I'd and

312
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:24,470
that's that's the three blocks I'd and
 

313
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,230
that's that's the three blocks I'd and
if you count one two three four five six

314
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:29,240
if you count one two three four five six
 

315
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,360
if you count one two three four five six
seven eight one two three four five six

316
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:34,370
seven eight one two three four five six
 

317
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,220
seven eight one two three four five six
seven eight so it is eight by eight

318
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,230
seven eight so it is eight by eight
 

319
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:44,590
seven eight so it is eight by eight
it's just lopsided a little bit okay now

320
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:44,600
it's just lopsided a little bit okay now
 

321
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,160
it's just lopsided a little bit okay now
the other thing ah this probably won't

322
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,170
the other thing ah this probably won't
 

323
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,190
the other thing ah this probably won't
be quite as effective as my team spider

324
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
be quite as effective as my team spider
 

325
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,310
be quite as effective as my team spider
system just because I have to cave

326
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
system just because I have to cave
 

327
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,540
system just because I have to cave
spider spawners together these guys they

328
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:58,550
spider spawners together these guys they
 

329
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,020
spider spawners together these guys they
give 10 X B each and cave spiders give 5

330
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,030
give 10 X B each and cave spiders give 5
 

331
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,070
give 10 X B each and cave spiders give 5
X B each so 2 times 5 is 10 it's the

332
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:06,080
X B each so 2 times 5 is 10 it's the
 

333
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,640
X B each so 2 times 5 is 10 it's the
same but I believe cave spiders have a

334
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:09,650
same but I believe cave spiders have a
 

335
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,790
same but I believe cave spiders have a
higher chance of more spawning at a time

336
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
higher chance of more spawning at a time
 

337
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,700
higher chance of more spawning at a time
then these Blais do because the blaze

338
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:15,710
then these Blais do because the blaze
 

339
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,610
then these Blais do because the blaze
are occupied two blocks of space when

340
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:18,620
are occupied two blocks of space when
 

341
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,880
are occupied two blocks of space when
they spawn and cave spiders only occupy

342
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:21,890
they spawn and cave spiders only occupy
 

343
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,180
they spawn and cave spiders only occupy
one block of space so I'm pretty sure

344
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,190
one block of space so I'm pretty sure
 

345
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,130
one block of space so I'm pretty sure
it's more likely you'll get more cave

346
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:27,140
it's more likely you'll get more cave
 

347
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,050
it's more likely you'll get more cave
spiders

348
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,060
spiders
 

349
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,330
spiders
it's a little bit complicated the other

350
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:31,340
it's a little bit complicated the other
 

351
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,790
it's a little bit complicated the other
thing is these Blaise they have a lot of

352
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:33,800
thing is these Blaise they have a lot of
 

353
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,060
thing is these Blaise they have a lot of
particle effects and animations to them

354
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,070
particle effects and animations to them
 

355
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,860
particle effects and animations to them
so I'm pretty sure they're going to like

356
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:38,870
so I'm pretty sure they're going to like
 

357
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,420
so I'm pretty sure they're going to like
my game a lot more so I can't just let

358
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:42,430
my game a lot more so I can't just let
 

359
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,720
my game a lot more so I can't just let
300 collect like I can with cheap cave

360
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:46,730
300 collect like I can with cheap cave
 

361
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,350
300 collect like I can with cheap cave
spiders without experiencing technical

362
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:50,360
spiders without experiencing technical
 

363
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,220
spiders without experiencing technical
issues probably so another thing to keep

364
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,230
issues probably so another thing to keep
 

365
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:00,100
issues probably so another thing to keep
in mind yeah so the plan is to have this

366
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,110
in mind yeah so the plan is to have this
 

367
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,800
in mind yeah so the plan is to have this
thing the blaze farm as the center of my

368
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:02,810
thing the blaze farm as the center of my
 

369
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,540
thing the blaze farm as the center of my
nether base so I can have it running be

370
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:07,550
nether base so I can have it running be
 

371
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,490
nether base so I can have it running be
active when I'm when I'm doing stuff

372
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:09,500
active when I'm when I'm doing stuff
 

373
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,800
active when I'm when I'm doing stuff
around the nether here because I need to

374
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:11,810
around the nether here because I need to
 

375
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,700
around the nether here because I need to
be 16 blocks within the spawner 4 to be

376
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:15,710
be 16 blocks within the spawner 4 to be
 

377
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,120
be 16 blocks within the spawner 4 to be
working and I don't know how big the

378
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,130
working and I don't know how big the
 

379
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,800
working and I don't know how big the
nether base is going to be or everything

380
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:20,810
nether base is going to be or everything
 

381
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,790
nether base is going to be or everything
I'm going to do in it

382
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm going to do in it
 

383
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,980
I'm going to do in it
but I know I need another work farm

384
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:23,990
but I know I need another work farm
 

385
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,180
but I know I need another work farm
because it only grows in the nether when

386
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:28,190
because it only grows in the nether when
 

387
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:32,260
because it only grows in the nether when
you're in the nether as far as I know so

388
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,270
you're in the nether as far as I know so
 

389
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,230
you're in the nether as far as I know so
that's one thing we also will probably

390
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:35,240
that's one thing we also will probably
 

391
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,480
that's one thing we also will probably
set up some transportation systems and

392
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:37,490
set up some transportation systems and
 

393
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,910
set up some transportation systems and
another some time just because it's a

394
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
another some time just because it's a
 

395
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,580
another some time just because it's a
lot faster traveling in the nether other

396
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:45,590
lot faster traveling in the nether other
 

397
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,010
lot faster traveling in the nether other
step to my plan is to make it nice to

398
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,020
step to my plan is to make it nice to
 

399
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,520
step to my plan is to make it nice to
set up like grass and trees and and

400
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:50,530
set up like grass and trees and and
 

401
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,520
set up like grass and trees and and
everything like that I want to I want to

402
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:54,530
everything like that I want to I want to
 

403
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:58,540
everything like that I want to I want to
kick butt nether here but anyway we will

404
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:58,550
kick butt nether here but anyway we will
 

405
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:05,590
kick butt nether here but anyway we will
move on oh yeah so since well this will

406
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
move on oh yeah so since well this will
 

407
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,170
move on oh yeah so since well this will
probably be very similar in

408
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:07,180
probably be very similar in
 

409
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,390
probably be very similar in
effectiveness to the spider XP farm I

410
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:10,400
effectiveness to the spider XP farm I
 

411
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,640
effectiveness to the spider XP farm I
have right now but the main reason I'm

412
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:12,650
have right now but the main reason I'm
 

413
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,830
have right now but the main reason I'm
doing this is so I'll have something the

414
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:14,840
doing this is so I'll have something the
 

415
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,070
doing this is so I'll have something the
nether to get XP and also so I can get

416
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:18,080
nether to get XP and also so I can get
 

417
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,210
nether to get XP and also so I can get
blaze rods I can use blaze powder for

418
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:22,220
blaze rods I can use blaze powder for
 

419
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,280
blaze rods I can use blaze powder for
potions for ender eyes also blaze rods

420
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,290
potions for ender eyes also blaze rods
 

421
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,930
potions for ender eyes also blaze rods
can be used in furnaces and stuff so

422
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:30,940
can be used in furnaces and stuff so
 

423
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,550
can be used in furnaces and stuff so
overall they're pretty effective are

424
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:33,560
overall they're pretty effective are
 

425
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,710
overall they're pretty effective are
pretty useful item to have so let's lie

426
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:35,720
pretty useful item to have so let's lie
 

427
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,270
pretty useful item to have so let's lie
on a farm here but yeah let's go with

428
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:41,280
on a farm here but yeah let's go with
 

429
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,750
on a farm here but yeah let's go with
don't do what we're gonna do in the main

430
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:44,760
don't do what we're gonna do in the main
 

431

home here and I am ready to show you the
the project it's a big project it took

436
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:56,220
the project it's a big project it took
 

437
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,090
the project it's a big project it took
me many many hours it's still not

438
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,100
me many many hours it's still not
 

439
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,010

finished I got to do the walls and

440
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:01,020
finished I got to do the walls and
 

441
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,710
finished I got to do the walls and
ceiling few other things to make it nice

442
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:03,720
ceiling few other things to make it nice
 

443
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,490
ceiling few other things to make it nice
but the most time-consuming part and the

444
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:07,500
but the most time-consuming part and the
 

445
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,420
but the most time-consuming part and the
most important part is done now so here

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:11,430
most important part is done now so here
 

447
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,290
most important part is done now so here
we go

449
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,860

the tree farm I've given everybody

450
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:18,870
the tree farm I've given everybody
 

451
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,990
the tree farm I've given everybody
that's donated to my channel a tree of

462
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:35,700
you have no idea I had to collect all
 

463
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,310
you have no idea I had to collect all
the sand glowstone every every tree has

464
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
the sand glowstone every every tree has
 

465
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,930
the sand glowstone every every tree has
a glow stone I want to get rid of these

466
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:41,940
a glow stone I want to get rid of these
 

467
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,400
a glow stone I want to get rid of these
pumpkins too and replace them with

468
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,410
pumpkins too and replace them with
 

469
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,600
pumpkins too and replace them with
glowstone so there's a bit to go yet but

470
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:47,610
glowstone so there's a bit to go yet but
 

471
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,630
glowstone so there's a bit to go yet but
I think it's pretty cool and it's very

472
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:50,640
I think it's pretty cool and it's very
 

473
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,110
I think it's pretty cool and it's very
useful I've been collecting a lot of

474
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,120
useful I've been collecting a lot of
 

475
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,590
useful I've been collecting a lot of
your wood please refrain from

476

518
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:07,149
everyone so I think the processing
 

519
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:09,690
everyone so I think the processing
charge is at least 30 cents so some

520
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:09,700
charge is at least 30 cents so some

00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:26,540
and that are going to continue releasing
 

597
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,870
and that are going to continue releasing
patches for the game which is nice as

598
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
patches for the game which is nice as
 

599
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,460
patches for the game which is nice as

601
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,830

it sounds like they're going to continue

602
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:34,840
it sounds like they're going to continue
 

603
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,900
it sounds like they're going to continue
even if they were to stop I think the

604
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:37,910
even if they were to stop I think the
 

605
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,820
even if they were to stop I think the
community would kind of take over the

606
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:39,830
community would kind of take over the
 

607
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,550
community would kind of take over the
game and they'd probably become a

608
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:42,560
game and they'd probably become a
 

609
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,480
game and they'd probably become a
central mod group that kind of finished

610
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:46,490
central mod group that kind of finished
 

611
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,850
central mod group that kind of finished
the game on their own which wouldn't be

612
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:48,860
the game on their own which wouldn't be
 

613
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,880
the game on their own which wouldn't be
a bad thing either so I think my

614
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:51,890
a bad thing either so I think my
 

615
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,250
a bad thing either so I think my
