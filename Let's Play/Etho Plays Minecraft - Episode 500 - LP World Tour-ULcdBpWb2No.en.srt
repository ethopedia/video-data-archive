the base when we first started was to
 

121
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:33,179

favorite thing I've built in this game

134
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:45,069
favorite thing I've built in this game
 

135
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:48,720
favorite thing I've built in this game
to this date and it was pretty unique at

136
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:48,730
to this date and it was pretty unique at
 

137
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,369
to this date and it was pretty unique at
the time because like there wasn't silk

138
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:50,379
the time because like there wasn't silk
 

139
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,899
the time because like there wasn't silk
touching the game so to get grass down

140
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:51,909
touching the game so to get grass down
 

141
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:53,250
touching the game so to get grass down
here we actually had to like grow it

142
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:53,260
here we actually had to like grow it
 

143
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,349
here we actually had to like grow it
from the surface all the way down it is

144
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:55,359
from the surface all the way down it is
 

145
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,059
from the surface all the way down it is
not something people usually did in the

146
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:57,069
not something people usually did in the
 

147
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:00,149
not something people usually did in the
game and I also took inspiration from

148
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
game and I also took inspiration from
 

149
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,170
game and I also took inspiration from
the old 404 challenge which was a map

150
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:03,180
the old 404 challenge which was a map
 

151
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,789
the old 404 challenge which was a map
where you didn't use torches you had to

152
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:05,799
where you didn't use torches you had to
 

153
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,830
where you didn't use torches you had to
light up the cave as you went along

154
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
light up the cave as you went along
 

155
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,459
light up the cave as you went along
using lava so when I built this I had

156
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:11,469
using lava so when I built this I had
 

157
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:12,750
using lava so when I built this I had
the idea of using hidden lighting

158
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:12,760
the idea of using hidden lighting
 

159
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,039
the idea of using hidden lighting
throughout the whole thing so we got

160
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,049
throughout the whole thing so we got
 

161

the wait torches look in this game when

168
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:25,239
the wait torches look in this game when
 

169
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,839
the wait torches look in this game when
it's just like on the ground and stuff

170
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:26,849
it's just like on the ground and stuff
 

171
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:29,729

00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:35,979
man cave we have some decoration and
 

179
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:39,780
man cave we have some decoration and
stuff try to like have lots of splitting

180
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:39,790
stuff try to like have lots of splitting

way this is where you load them in so

190
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:53,560
way this is where you load them in so
 

191
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,830

we're free to destroy stuff and like

192
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
we're free to destroy stuff and like
 

193
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,449
we're free to destroy stuff and like
check out how it actually works on the

194
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:57,459
check out how it actually works on the
 

195
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:00,719
check out how it actually works on the
inside if we want this little little

196
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:00,729
inside if we want this little little
 

197
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:04,920
inside if we want this little little
thing here then over here is our pop-up

198
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:04,930
thing here then over here is our pop-up
 

199
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,879
thing here then over here is our pop-up
sheep farm which should be working I

200
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:08,889
sheep farm which should be working I
 

201
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:11,429
sheep farm which should be working I
think what we do is go over here when we

202
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
think what we do is go over here when we
 

203
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,979
think what we do is go over here when we
want shears or we can hit this to get

204
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:13,989
want shears or we can hit this to get
 

205
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,209
want shears or we can hit this to get
them and basically you run through you

206
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:18,219
them and basically you run through you
 

207
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:22,050
them and basically you run through you
shear the sheep and then you have the

208
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:22,060
shear the sheep and then you have the
 

209
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,580
shear the sheep and then you have the
option of manually

210
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:24,590
option of manually
 

211
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,350
option of manually
putting them down with these buttons I'm

212
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
putting them down with these buttons I'm
 

213
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,640
putting them down with these buttons I'm
like trying to think how this works as

214
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:28,650
like trying to think how this works as
 

215
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,309
like trying to think how this works as
we go and then there's these like open

216
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:31,319
we go and then there's these like open
 

217
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,110
we go and then there's these like open
open areas here with pressure plates

218
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
open areas here with pressure plates
 

219
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,809
open areas here with pressure plates
when the wolf falls down it it'll

220
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:35,819
when the wolf falls down it it'll
 

221
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:37,610
when the wolf falls down it it'll
automatically trigger the Sheep to go

222
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:37,620
automatically trigger the Sheep to go
 

223
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,089
automatically trigger the Sheep to go
down if there's wool here so if we press

224
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:41,099
down if there's wool here so if we press
 

225
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:45,050
down if there's wool here so if we press
the button let's see if this works still

226
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,060
the button let's see if this works still
 

227
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,480
the button let's see if this works still
a little bit broken but it's fine you

228
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,490
a little bit broken but it's fine you
 

229
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,520
a little bit broken but it's fine you
see the water pushes the wool down and

230
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:49,530
see the water pushes the wool down and
 

231
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,899
see the water pushes the wool down and
when it hit triggers at pressure plates

232
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:50,909
when it hit triggers at pressure plates
 

233
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:53,629
when it hit triggers at pressure plates
then that sheep Goes Down and then

234
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:53,639
then that sheep Goes Down and then
 

235
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,219
then that sheep Goes Down and then
there's bud switches detecting when it

236
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:55,229
there's bud switches detecting when it
 

237
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,200
there's bud switches detecting when it
eats the grass and when the wool is

238
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,210
eats the grass and when the wool is
 

239
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,240
eats the grass and when the wool is
fully regrown it pops back up so it's

240
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,250
fully regrown it pops back up so it's
 

241
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,779
fully regrown it pops back up so it's
it's kind of a cool little thing and

242
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:01,789
it's kind of a cool little thing and
 

243
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:04,520
it's kind of a cool little thing and
actually let's go ahead we don't usually

244
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:04,530
actually let's go ahead we don't usually
 

245
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,990
actually let's go ahead we don't usually
do this in the world tours but I think

246
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
do this in the world tours but I think
 

247
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,459
do this in the world tours but I think
we'll go into spectator mode a little

248
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:07,469
we'll go into spectator mode a little
 

249
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:10,670
we'll go into spectator mode a little
bit today too that way we can see how it

250
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:10,680
bit today too that way we can see how it
 

251
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,339
bit today too that way we can see how it
works there is a path yeah so although

252
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:16,349
works there is a path yeah so although
 

253
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:20,230
works there is a path yeah so although
all the wool goes down the stream here

254
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
all the wool goes down the stream here
 

255
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,709
all the wool goes down the stream here
let's follow it

256
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:21,719
let's follow it
 

257
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:23,659
let's follow it
up to here then there's like an elevator

258
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:23,669
up to here then there's like an elevator
 

259
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:27,950
up to here then there's like an elevator
system to bring it up over to here pops

260
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:27,960
system to bring it up over to here pops
 

261
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,080
system to bring it up over to here pops
up into this chest let's go back to

262
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,090
up into this chest let's go back to
 

263
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,550
up into this chest let's go back to
normal and ends up in here and then I

264
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
normal and ends up in here and then I
 

265
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,320
normal and ends up in here and then I
just take it out and put it into into

266
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,330
just take it out and put it into into
 

267
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,300
just take it out and put it into into
here and there's also a button here for

268
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:38,310
here and there's also a button here for
 

269
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,680
here and there's also a button here for
manually putting all the sheep down

270
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:39,690
manually putting all the sheep down
 

271
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,740

under the water there this was our first

284
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
under the water there this was our first
 

285
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,689
under the water there this was our first
main storage room and it's it's still

286
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:02,699
main storage room and it's it's still
 

287
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,240
main storage room and it's it's still
the one I use a lot because it has like

288
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,250
the one I use a lot because it has like
 

289
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,709

a little bit of everything in the chest

290
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:06,719
a little bit of everything in the chest
 

291
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:09,170
a little bit of everything in the chest
which is nice and very convenient to

292
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:09,180
which is nice and very convenient to
 

293
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,579
which is nice and very convenient to
find stuff organized by category here

294
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:12,589
find stuff organized by category here
 

295
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:15,589
find stuff organized by category here
which works out pretty good then over

296
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:15,599
which works out pretty good then over
 

297
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:20,209
which works out pretty good then over
here is our furnace smelting room let's

298
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:20,219
here is our furnace smelting room let's
 

299
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:21,559
here is our furnace smelting room let's
see do we have anything ice melt to try

300
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:21,569
see do we have anything ice melt to try
 

301
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:24,950
see do we have anything ice melt to try
this anything at all netherrack there we

302
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
this anything at all netherrack there we
 

303
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,439
this anything at all netherrack there we
go okay here we go here we go guys so we

304
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:27,449
go okay here we go here we go guys so we
 

305
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,499
go okay here we go here we go guys so we
throw it in the furnace here light comes

306
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:30,509
throw it in the furnace here light comes
 

307
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:33,889
throw it in the furnace here light comes
on it makes a little bean bong sound -

308
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:33,899
on it makes a little bean bong sound -
 

309
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,629
on it makes a little bean bong sound -
each one is tuned a little bit

310
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:35,639
each one is tuned a little bit
 

311
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,960
each one is tuned a little bit
differently

312
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:36,970
differently
 

313
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,560
differently
and there's also some master lights here

314
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:40,570
and there's also some master lights here
 

315
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,960
and there's also some master lights here
so if any of the furnaces are on this

316
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:42,970
so if any of the furnaces are on this
 

317
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,540
so if any of the furnaces are on this
light turns on if they're all often then

318
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:45,550
light turns on if they're all often then
 

319
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,470
light turns on if they're all often then

all up here and as you can probably

792
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:04,829
all up here and as you can probably
 

793
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,740
all up here and as you can probably
guess this wall here isn't finished we

794

water above and it would funnel them all
 

1025
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,570
water above and it would funnel them all
to this area here and you would stand

automatically didn't really work out and
 

1117
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,380
automatically didn't really work out and
you guys really hated the build style so

1118
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:50,390
you guys really hated the build style so
 

1119
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,930
you guys really hated the build style so
I ended up scrapping this project after

1120
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:52,940
I ended up scrapping this project after
 

1121
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,200
I ended up scrapping this project after
spending a long time digging out this

1122
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,210
spending a long time digging out this
 

1123
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,320
spending a long time digging out this
area but it was probably for the best we

1124
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,330
area but it was probably for the best we
 

1125
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,120
area but it was probably for the best we
made a new village later that turned out

1126
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,130
made a new village later that turned out
 

1127
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,120
made a new village later that turned out
a lot better in my opinion although it's

1128
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,130
a lot better in my opinion although it's
 

1129
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,560
a lot better in my opinion although it's
still quite didn't do what I wanted it

1130
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:05,570
still quite didn't do what I wanted it
 

1131

oh yeah and to get them in here and you
dropped them down this chute here if we

1136
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:10,850
dropped them down this chute here if we
 

1137
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,440
dropped them down this chute here if we
go above there was a door system it

1138
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,450
go above there was a door system it
 

1139
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,400
go above there was a door system it
looks like it's glitched out for for

let's go game-mode 0 to get into this

1184
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:18,560
let's go game-mode 0 to get into this
 

1185
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,720
let's go game-mode 0 to get into this
room you there's a hopper minecart

room you there's a hopper minecart
 

1187
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,890
room you there's a hopper minecart
underneath here it detects when you

1188
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:23,900
underneath here it detects when you
 

1189
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,280
underneath here it detects when you
throw an item in opens up the door and

throw an item in opens up the door and
 

1191
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,720
throw an item in opens up the door and
that leads into here which stores all

1192
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:28,730
that leads into here which stores all
 

1193
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,780
that leads into here which stores all
the ingredients for the potions and when

falls on you here and all the brewing
 

1217
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,800
falls on you here and all the brewing
stands are just within your reach so you

1218
00:25:59,800 --> 00:25:59,810
stands are just within your reach so you
 

1219
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,000
stands are just within your reach so you
don't have to move you just go around

1220

don't have to move you just go around
 

1221
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,910
don't have to move you just go around
and that was like as automatic and cool

1222
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:03,920
and that was like as automatic and cool
 

1223
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,680
and that was like as automatic and cool
as you can make a potion system back in

1224
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:05,690
as you can make a potion system back in
 

1225
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,540
as you can make a potion system back in
the day then there's a storage for it

1226
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:07,550
the day then there's a storage for it
 

1227
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:12,160
the day then there's a storage for it
here but then later let's go check out

1228
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,170
here but then later let's go check out
 

1229
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,260
here but then later let's go check out
the new potion system I think we're done

1230
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,270
the new potion system I think we're done
 

1231
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,480
the new potion system I think we're done
in this area this is the one I'm really

1232
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:16,490
in this area this is the one I'm really
 

1233
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,220
in this area this is the one I'm really
proud of ethos lab is what we called it

1234
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,230
proud of ethos lab is what we called it
 

1235
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:25,240
proud of ethos lab is what we called it
off over this way it's basically a giant

1236
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:25,250
off over this way it's basically a giant
 

1237
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,720
off over this way it's basically a giant
brewing system with like 20 or more

1238
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:28,730
brewing system with like 20 or more
 

1239
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,120

how it looks it was an a unique idea
 

1243
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,980
how it looks it was an a unique idea
basically we chained the brewing stands

1244
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:35,990
basically we chained the brewing stands
 

1245
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,780
basically we chained the brewing stands
together so it adds one ingredient each

1246
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:37,790
together so it adds one ingredient each
 

1247
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,450
together so it adds one ingredient each
phase here and at each phase you can

1248
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:40,460
phase here and at each phase you can
 

1249
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,250
phase here and at each phase you can
access the chests so it starts out

1250
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:42,260
access the chests so it starts out
 

1251
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,420
access the chests so it starts out

farm built into this works pretty good
 

1277
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,890
farm built into this works pretty good
but it also helps to make the build look

1278
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:23,900
but it also helps to make the build look
 

1279
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,810
but it also helps to make the build look
cool I think and this is the main switch

1280
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:28,820
cool I think and this is the main switch
 

1281
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,090
cool I think and this is the main switch
yeah that turns it all on let's go

1282
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:31,100
yeah that turns it all on let's go

bulk storage and there's a lot of wiring
 

1295
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,040
bulk storage and there's a lot of wiring
a lot of wiring it took me a long time

1296
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,050
a lot of wiring it took me a long time
 

1297
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,250
a lot of wiring it took me a long time

alright so moving on here we have
 

1301
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,160
alright so moving on here we have
another 3x3 door here you can open it

1302
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,170
another 3x3 door here you can open it
 

1303
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,680
another 3x3 door here you can open it
with the button but we also experimented

1304
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:00,690
with the button but we also experimented
 

1305
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,710
with the button but we also experimented
with a bunny powered door which few

1306
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:03,720
with a bunny powered door which few
 

1307
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,690
with a bunny powered door which few
select golden carats that opens and

1308
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:05,700
select golden carats that opens and
 

1309
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,460
select golden carats that opens and
closes automatically or it should yeah

1310
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:10,470
closes automatically or it should yeah
 

1311
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,900
closes automatically or it should yeah
it doesn't work as good as it used to

1312
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:11,910
it doesn't work as good as it used to
 

1313
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,930
it doesn't work as good as it used to
though to be honest something changed

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:35,340
decoration this intersection I took
 

1331
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,940

1337
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,110
did like stone brick and and lava and I
wanted a more natural look to it so we

1338
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,120
wanted a more natural look to it so we
 

1339
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
wanted a more natural look to it so we
got leaves in here we got regular brick

1340
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,130
got leaves in here we got regular brick
 

1341
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,630
got leaves in here we got regular brick
water some random flowers and garbage

1342
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:50,640
water some random flowers and garbage
 

1343
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,320
water some random flowers and garbage
all around this is our mob system here

1344
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,330
all around this is our mob system here
 

1345
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,870
all around this is our mob system here
just regular mobs they drop down into

1346
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:56,880
just regular mobs they drop down into
 

1347
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,170
just regular mobs they drop down into
the hoppers end up in these chests so it

1348
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:00,180
the hoppers end up in these chests so it
 

1349
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,620
the hoppers end up in these chests so it
looks full again we recently fixed this

1350
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:03,630
looks full again we recently fixed this
 

1351
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,950
looks full again we recently fixed this
again so it's working pretty good yeah

1352
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:06,960
again so it's working pretty good yeah
 

1353
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,210
again so it's working pretty good yeah
it's totally filled up if we fly up here

1354
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:10,220
it's totally filled up if we fly up here
 

1355
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,530
it's totally filled up if we fly up here
basically the mobs are attracted to

1356
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:14,540
basically the mobs are attracted to
 

1357
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,150
basically the mobs are attracted to
villagers the zombies are while the

1358
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:17,160
villagers the zombies are while the
 

1359
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,730
villagers the zombies are while the
skeletons run away from wolves and the

1360
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:19,740
skeletons run away from wolves and the
 

1361
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,390
skeletons run away from wolves and the
creepers won't run away from the kitties

1362
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:23,400
creepers won't run away from the kitties
 

1363
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,300
creepers won't run away from the kitties
here we got slabs or carpet here to stop

1364
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:26,310
here we got slabs or carpet here to stop
 

1365
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,150
here we got slabs or carpet here to stop
spiders from spawning okay so opposite

1366
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:29,160
spiders from spawning okay so opposite
 

1367
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,920
spiders from spawning okay so opposite
of the mob farm here we have another one

1368
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:30,930
of the mob farm here we have another one
 

1369
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,770
of the mob farm here we have another one
of my more recent builds also probably

1370
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:33,780
of my more recent builds also probably
 

1371
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,120
of my more recent builds also probably
one of the more complicated things I've

1372
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,130
one of the more complicated things I've
 

1373
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,510
one of the more complicated things I've
ever made this is a shelter box storage

1374
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:38,520
ever made this is a shelter box storage
 

1375
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,170
ever made this is a shelter box storage
system that has a search function which

1376
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:42,180
system that has a search function which
 

1377
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,210
system that has a search function which
was a weird idea I wanted to play around

1378
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:44,220
was a weird idea I wanted to play around
 

1379
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,360
was a weird idea I wanted to play around
with and it also has a menu system so

1380
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,370
with and it also has a menu system so
 

1381
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,800
with and it also has a menu system so
you can select what items you want so

1382
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:48,810
you can select what items you want so
 

1383
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,600
you can select what items you want so
basically you put your chakra boxes in

1384
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:50,610
basically you put your chakra boxes in
 

1385
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,610
basically you put your chakra boxes in
here with your various different items

1386
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:52,620
here with your various different items
 

1387
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,970
here with your various different items
and then if you want to like find the

1388
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:55,980
and then if you want to like find the
 

1389
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,530
and then if you want to like find the
night a certain item without ever like

1390
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:57,540
night a certain item without ever like
 

1391
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,850
night a certain item without ever like
looking through all the boxes there

1392
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:58,860
looking through all the boxes there
 

1393
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,880
looking through all the boxes there
let's say we want some sands select it

1394
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:01,890
let's say we want some sands select it
 

1395
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,990
let's say we want some sands select it
from the menu there you throw it

1396
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
from the menu there you throw it
 

1397
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,710
from the menu there you throw it
and then it'll check all those shelter

1398
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:07,720
and then it'll check all those shelter
 

1399
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,770
and then it'll check all those shelter
boxes for any that have sand in and they

1400
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:10,780
boxes for any that have sand in and they
 

1401
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,500
boxes for any that have sand in and they
should end up here so that has sand in

1402
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:13,510
should end up here so that has sand in
 

1403
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,810
should end up here so that has sand in
and then if you want to cycle to the

1404
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:15,820
and then if you want to cycle to the
 

1405
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,900
and then if you want to cycle to the
next box you step on the pressure plates

1406
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:17,910
next box you step on the pressure plates
 

1407
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:22,350
next box you step on the pressure plates
this one also has sand in another one

1408
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:22,360
this one also has sand in another one
 

1409
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,570
this one also has sand in another one
with sand we got a lot of sand

1410
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:24,580
with sand we got a lot of sand
 

1411
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,570
with sand we got a lot of sand
apparently and then they end up back in

1412
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:27,580
apparently and then they end up back in
 

1413
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,730
apparently and then they end up back in
here also the menu item backs ends up

1414
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:29,740
here also the menu item backs ends up
 

1415
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,340
here also the menu item backs ends up
back in here this does some complex

1416
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:32,350
back in here this does some complex
 

1417
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,600
back in here this does some complex
stuff like I had to for example there's

1418
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:36,610
stuff like I had to for example there's
 

1419
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,670
stuff like I had to for example there's
hoppers that have branching paths in the

1420
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:38,680
hoppers that have branching paths in the
 

1421
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,390
hoppers that have branching paths in the
system and of course the search engine

1422
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:42,400
system and of course the search engine
 

1423
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,430
system and of course the search engine
idea is pretty unique with it so if you

1424
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:44,440
idea is pretty unique with it so if you

00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:16,700
color you gotta remember the sequence
 

1741
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,000
color you gotta remember the sequence
which is still a work in progress so

1742
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,010
which is still a work in progress so
 

1743
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,560
which is still a work in progress so
let's not

and then the random wall changing thing

1746
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:25,390
and then the random wall changing thing
 

1747
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:28,690
and then the random wall changing thing
yeah guys are just demanding my

1748

yeah guys are just demanding my
attention here get out of here okay so I

1750
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:30,440
attention here get out of here okay so I
 

1751
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,110
attention here get out of here okay so I
have to make a button here to turn this

1752
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:32,120
have to make a button here to turn this
 

1753
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,140
have to make a button here to turn this

concrete powder this is a random idea I

1760
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:43,910
concrete powder this is a random idea I
 

1761
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,310
concrete powder this is a random idea I
wanted to play around with I saw a lot

1762
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:45,320
wanted to play around with I saw a lot
 

1763

wanted to play around with I saw a lot
of people did stuff with this like like

1764
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:47,300
of people did stuff with this like like
 

1765
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,480
of people did stuff with this like like
on Reddit and that so that's that's kind

of the goal of this series by the way I

1768
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:50,690
of the goal of this series by the way I
 

1769
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,240
of the goal of this series by the way I
just like to introduce ideas and then

1770
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,250
just like to introduce ideas and then
 

1771
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,740
just like to introduce ideas and then
see what other people do with them too

1772
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:53,750
see what other people do with them too
 

1773
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,170
see what other people do with them too
so some people have done some cool

1774

so some people have done some cool
things with this for me though this is

1776
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:58,910
things with this for me though this is
 

1777
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,870
things with this for me though this is
still under construction like a lot of

1778
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:01,880
still under construction like a lot of
 

1779
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,720
still under construction like a lot of
things right I think we're done with the

1780
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:04,730
things right I think we're done with the
 

1781
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:07,150
things right I think we're done with the
mancave now one thing I did want to do

1782
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,160
mancave now one thing I did want to do
 

1783
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,099
mancave now one thing I did want to do
just to show you guys a lot of times

1784
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:09,109
just to show you guys a lot of times
 

1785
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:10,359
just to show you guys a lot of times
when I'm building something I talk about

1786
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:10,369
when I'm building something I talk about
 

1787
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:12,520
when I'm building something I talk about
space like there's not enough space over

1788
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:12,530
space like there's not enough space over
 

1789
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,770
space like there's not enough space over
there or over there you should see how

1790
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:14,780
there or over there you should see how
 

1791
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,990
there or over there you should see how
close together all this stuff is to each

1792
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,000
close together all this stuff is to each
 

1793
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,230
close together all this stuff is to each
other it's crazy like we only see the

1794
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:23,240
other it's crazy like we only see the
 

1795
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,970
other it's crazy like we only see the
facade part of it but when you look at

1796
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:24,980
facade part of it but when you look at
 

1797
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,589
facade part of it but when you look at
the wire and stuff it's like all right

1798
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:26,599
the wire and stuff it's like all right
 

1799
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,570
the wire and stuff it's like all right
next to each other and inter inter wines

1800
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:28,580
next to each other and inter inter wines
 

1801
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:32,170
next to each other and inter inter wines
and just barely enough space to get a

1802
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:32,180
and just barely enough space to get a
 

1803
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,599
and just barely enough space to get a
lot of this to work even oh yeah there's

1804
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:34,609
lot of this to work even oh yeah there's
 

1805
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:36,040
lot of this to work even oh yeah there's
storage here for the speed potions I

1806
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,050
storage here for the speed potions I
 

1807
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:36,670
storage here for the speed potions I
forgot about that

1808
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:36,680
forgot about that
 

1809
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:42,700
forgot about that
hit in the way huh like this river is

1810
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:42,710
hit in the way huh like this river is
 

1811
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,030

anything so it's like fun to figure out

1816
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:50,950
anything so it's like fun to figure out
 

1817
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,200
anything so it's like fun to figure out
how to make it all work together when

1818
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,210
how to make it all work together when
 

1819
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,440
how to make it all work together when
you're building it all right very good

1820
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:56,450
you're building it all right very good
 

1821
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,150
you're building it all right very good
very good I believe we have finished up

1822
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,160
very good I believe we have finished up
 

1823
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,980
very good I believe we have finished up
with the man cave now so we can continue

1824
00:39:59,980 --> 00:39:59,990
with the man cave now so we can continue
 

1825
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,740

things are good so after building the

1846
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:31,940
things are good so after building the
 

1847
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,390
things are good so after building the
man tube for a long time eventually I

1848
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
man tube for a long time eventually I
 

1849
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,790
man tube for a long time eventually I
started craving other projects here this

1850
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:36,800
started craving other projects here this
 

1851
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,410
started craving other projects here this
was one of the very first ones we did

1852
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:38,420
was one of the very first ones we did
 

1853
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,829
was one of the very first ones we did
besides the man cave this was our our

1854
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:40,839
besides the man cave this was our our
 

1855
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:44,079
besides the man cave this was our our
mineshaft area later I decided to try

1856
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:44,089
mineshaft area later I decided to try
 

1857
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:45,970
mineshaft area later I decided to try
put an ice road from the man cave to

1858
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:45,980
put an ice road from the man cave to
 

1859
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,970
put an ice road from the man cave to
here but it broke shortly after so we'll

1860
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:48,980
here but it broke shortly after so we'll
 

1861
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,109
here but it broke shortly after so we'll
probably just cover that up and never

1862
00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:50,119
probably just cover that up and never
 

1863
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:53,050
probably just cover that up and never
speak of it again there's a snow golem

1864
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:53,060
speak of it again there's a snow golem
 

1865
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,579
speak of it again there's a snow golem
that walks around in the ceiling in here

1866
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:54,589
that walks around in the ceiling in here
 

1867
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:56,260
that walks around in the ceiling in here
and it makes the lights blink on and off

1868
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:56,270
and it makes the lights blink on and off
 

1869
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,720
and it makes the lights blink on and off
every so often it's it's kind of rare

1870
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:58,730
every so often it's it's kind of rare
 

1871
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,160
every so often it's it's kind of rare
but it adds a little bit of atmosphere

1872
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,170
but it adds a little bit of atmosphere
 

1873
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:03,099
but it adds a little bit of atmosphere
to the builds and the main point of this

1874
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:03,109
to the builds and the main point of this
 

1875
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:05,470
to the builds and the main point of this
build is just to collect resources we

1876
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:05,480
build is just to collect resources we
 

1877
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,180

did a lot of branch mining back in the

1878
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,190
did a lot of branch mining back in the
 

1879
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,630
did a lot of branch mining back in the
day but

1880
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:07,640
day but
 

1881
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,920
day but
or speed mining so I spent a lot of time

1882
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:11,930
or speed mining so I spent a lot of time
 

1883
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,380
or speed mining so I spent a lot of time
digging here and the tree farm was

1884
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:14,390
digging here and the tree farm was
 

1885
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,840
digging here and the tree farm was
getting so big like every donator got

1886
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:16,850
getting so big like every donator got
 

1887
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,290
getting so big like every donator got
got their own tree I decided I got to do

1888
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:20,300
got their own tree I decided I got to do
 

1889
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,520
got their own tree I decided I got to do
something else that's getting out of

1890
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:21,530
something else that's getting out of
 

1891
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,230
something else that's getting out of
hand

1892
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,240
hand
 

1893
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,680
hand
so I decided to dedicate each of the

1894
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:26,690
so I decided to dedicate each of the
 

1895
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,930
so I decided to dedicate each of the
branches to to somebody here so that's

1896
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:28,940
branches to to somebody here so that's
 

1897
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,100
branches to to somebody here so that's
what these signs are abouts

1898
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,110
what these signs are abouts
 

1899
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,590
what these signs are abouts
oh yeah and by the way every so often my

1900
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:32,600
oh yeah and by the way every so often my
 

1901
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,300
oh yeah and by the way every so often my
world here you might see some blocks

1902
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:34,310
world here you might see some blocks
 

1903
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:37,210
world here you might see some blocks
like this in a chest or or just randomly

1904
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:37,220
like this in a chest or or just randomly
 

1905
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,010
like this in a chest or or just randomly
uh I like to tease them in the video

1906
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:39,020
uh I like to tease them in the video
 

1907
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,600
uh I like to tease them in the video
because people are like he throws a

1908
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:40,610
because people are like he throws a
 

1909
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,930
because people are like he throws a
cheater he's using cheap blocks or

1910
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:43,940
cheater he's using cheap blocks or
 

1911
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,330
cheater he's using cheap blocks or
something when they see these what do

1912
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:46,340
something when they see these what do
 

1913
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,430
something when they see these what do
what it was back in the day

1914
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:48,440
what it was back in the day
 

1915
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,740
what it was back in the day
I tried building this mineshaft out of

1916
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:50,750
I tried building this mineshaft out of
 

1917
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,210
I tried building this mineshaft out of
planks and in some places are still

1918
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:52,220
planks and in some places are still
 

1919
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,970
planks and in some places are still
playing and it kept burning down on me

1920
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:54,980
playing and it kept burning down on me
 

1921
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,650
playing and it kept burning down on me
so I switched it over to wooden slabs

1922
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:56,660
so I switched it over to wooden slabs
 

1923
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,100
so I switched it over to wooden slabs
which used to not burn but they changed

1924
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,110
which used to not burn but they changed
 

1925
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,850
which used to not burn but they changed
it so that they do now but any any old

1926
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:03,860
it so that they do now but any any old
 

1927
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,560
it so that they do now but any any old
structures that use the ones that don't

1928
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:05,570
structures that use the ones that don't
 

1929
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,220
structures that use the ones that don't
burn they have their own special wooden

1930
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:09,230
burn they have their own special wooden
 

1931
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,830
burn they have their own special wooden
slab that doesn't burn still okay so

1932
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:11,840
slab that doesn't burn still okay so
 

1933
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,230
slab that doesn't burn still okay so
also in the swamp biome here we have the

1934
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,240
also in the swamp biome here we have the
 

1935
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,410
also in the swamp biome here we have the
snowflake and iron golem farm combo here

1936
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:17,420
snowflake and iron golem farm combo here
 

1937
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,570
snowflake and iron golem farm combo here
originally we just had the snowflake for

1938
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:19,580
originally we just had the snowflake for
 

1939
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,090
originally we just had the snowflake for
the longest time back before beacons

1940
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:22,100
the longest time back before beacons
 

1941
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,030
the longest time back before beacons
were in the game this served as a beacon

1942
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,040
were in the game this served as a beacon
 

1943
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,100
were in the game this served as a beacon
for me because I would get lost often in

1944
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,110
for me because I would get lost often in
 

1945
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,260
for me because I would get lost often in
the swamp here or in the mountains and I

1946
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:29,270
the swamp here or in the mountains and I
 

1947
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,670
the swamp here or in the mountains and I
could look for the snowflake and and

1948
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:30,680
could look for the snowflake and and
 

1949
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,770
could look for the snowflake and and
know that was the direction of home

1950
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:32,780
know that was the direction of home
 

1951
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,250
know that was the direction of home
right I resisted building the iron golem

1952
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:36,260
right I resisted building the iron golem
 

1953
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,380
right I resisted building the iron golem
farm for the longest time but eventually

1954
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:38,390
farm for the longest time but eventually
 

1955
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,510
farm for the longest time but eventually
we needed to build it for the Nexus

1956
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:40,520
we needed to build it for the Nexus
 

1957
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,240
we needed to build it for the Nexus
because it would have taken way too long

1958
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,250
because it would have taken way too long
 

1959
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:47,440
because it would have taken way too long
to firm all that iron way too long so I

1960
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:47,450
to firm all that iron way too long so I
 

1961
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,210
to firm all that iron way too long so I
broke down and built it's and as a

1962
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:49,220
broke down and built it's and as a
 

1963
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,330
broke down and built it's and as a
result I never go caving now yeah that's

1964
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:52,340
result I never go caving now yeah that's
 

1965
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,890
result I never go caving now yeah that's
that's the reason I didn't want to build

1966
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:53,900
that's the reason I didn't want to build
 

1967
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,970
that's the reason I didn't want to build
on I'm weak I can't do it now it's too

1968
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:57,980
on I'm weak I can't do it now it's too
 

1969
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,390
on I'm weak I can't do it now it's too
easy just to collect the iron from there

1970
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:00,400
easy just to collect the iron from there
 

1971
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,390
easy just to collect the iron from there
also over here we have the spaceship

1972
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:04,400
also over here we have the spaceship
 

1973
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,190
also over here we have the spaceship
sort of build that doesn't look like

1974
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,200
sort of build that doesn't look like
 

1975
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,760
sort of build that doesn't look like
anything else this is part of one of our

1976
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:09,770
anything else this is part of one of our
 

1977
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,410
anything else this is part of one of our
gold farms we have three gold firms in

1978
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:11,420
gold farms we have three gold firms in
 

1979
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,180
gold farms we have three gold firms in
the world this is part of the first one

1980
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:13,190
the world this is part of the first one
 

1981
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,490
the world this is part of the first one
and I actually really liked how this

1982
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:15,500
and I actually really liked how this
 

1983
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,900
and I actually really liked how this
thing looks I think this is a cool build

1984
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:16,910
thing looks I think this is a cool build
 

1985
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,750
thing looks I think this is a cool build
actually maybe let's not switch the way

1986
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:19,760
actually maybe let's not switch the way
 

1987
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,649
actually maybe let's not switch the way
it works is we would send

1988
00:43:21,649 --> 00:43:21,659
it works is we would send
 

1989
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:23,989
it works is we would send
zombie pigmen from the nether to the

1990
00:43:23,989 --> 00:43:23,999
zombie pigmen from the nether to the
 

1991
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:26,179
zombie pigmen from the nether to the
overworld here there's two sets of

1992
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:26,189
overworld here there's two sets of
 

1993
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:28,099
overworld here there's two sets of
portals we go through the one at the top

1994
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:28,109
portals we go through the one at the top
 

1995
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:31,549
portals we go through the one at the top
here and the zombie pigmen comes through

1996
00:43:31,549 --> 00:43:31,559
here and the zombie pigmen comes through
 

1997
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:34,999
here and the zombie pigmen comes through
the one at the bottom and now we can go

1998
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:35,009
the one at the bottom and now we can go
 

1999
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:37,579
the one at the bottom and now we can go
team mode one and there was a crushing

2000
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:37,589
team mode one and there was a crushing
 

2001
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:40,999
team mode one and there was a crushing
system in this then you throw like a

2002
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:41,009
system in this then you throw like a
 

2003
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:44,059
system in this then you throw like a
damage potion at them and the drops go

2004
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:44,069
damage potion at them and the drops go
 

2005
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:46,399
damage potion at them and the drops go
in the hopper down there then if we go

2006
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:46,409
in the hopper down there then if we go
 

2007
00:43:46,409 --> 00:43:48,649
in the hopper down there then if we go
back all the drops funnel through the

2008
00:43:48,649 --> 00:43:48,659
back all the drops funnel through the
 

2009
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,809
back all the drops funnel through the
hoppers here up an elevator into a

2010
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:50,819
hoppers here up an elevator into a
 

2011
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:54,829
hoppers here up an elevator into a
sorting system somewhere here over here

2012
00:43:54,829 --> 00:43:54,839
sorting system somewhere here over here
 

2013
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:57,949
sorting system somewhere here over here
yeah and end up in these chests then we

2014
00:43:57,949 --> 00:43:57,959
yeah and end up in these chests then we
 

2015
00:43:57,959 --> 00:43:59,719
yeah and end up in these chests then we
got like a little trading villager here

2016
00:43:59,719 --> 00:43:59,729
got like a little trading villager here
 

2017
00:43:59,729 --> 00:44:01,729
got like a little trading villager here
I said little again I got to stop I got

2018
00:44:01,729 --> 00:44:01,739
I said little again I got to stop I got
 

2019
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:04,429
I said little again I got to stop I got
to stop it uh-huh and there's an

2020
00:44:04,429 --> 00:44:04,439
to stop it uh-huh and there's an
 

2021
00:44:04,439 --> 00:44:06,019
to stop it uh-huh and there's an
elevator which I'm guessing if the horse

2022
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:06,029
elevator which I'm guessing if the horse
 

2023
00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:08,659
elevator which I'm guessing if the horse
elevator doesn't oops doesn't work this

2024
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:08,669
elevator doesn't oops doesn't work this
 

2025
00:44:08,669 --> 00:44:15,609
elevator doesn't oops doesn't work this
one might not either okay good to know

2026
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:15,619
one might not either okay good to know
 

2027
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:22,189
one might not either okay good to know
and this turns it on and off right all

2028
00:44:22,189 --> 00:44:22,199
and this turns it on and off right all
 

2029
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:23,629
and this turns it on and off right all
right let's get out of here

2030
00:44:23,629 --> 00:44:23,639
right let's get out of here
 

2031
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:25,489
right let's get out of here
I built this bridge thing a long time

2032
00:44:25,489 --> 00:44:25,499
I built this bridge thing a long time
 

2033
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:27,289
I built this bridge thing a long time
ago I've been thinking about maybe

2034
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:27,299
ago I've been thinking about maybe
 

2035
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:29,989
ago I've been thinking about maybe
tearing it out but the idea was to send

2036
00:44:29,989 --> 00:44:29,999
tearing it out but the idea was to send
 

2037
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:32,899
tearing it out but the idea was to send
the enchanted book sweet enchant at the

2038
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:32,909
the enchanted book sweet enchant at the
 

2039
00:44:32,909 --> 00:44:35,269
the enchanted book sweet enchant at the
gold from there to the library this

2040
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:35,279
gold from there to the library this
 

2041
00:44:35,279 --> 00:44:38,059
gold from there to the library this
build over here the purpose of the

2042
00:44:38,059 --> 00:44:38,069
build over here the purpose of the
 

2043
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:40,039
build over here the purpose of the
library is to store our enchanted books

2044
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:40,049
library is to store our enchanted books
 

2045
00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:42,979
library is to store our enchanted books
as well as our villagers do enchanting

2046
00:44:42,979 --> 00:44:42,989
as well as our villagers do enchanting
 

2047
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:47,139
as well as our villagers do enchanting
and just to hopefully look good as well

2048
00:44:47,139 --> 00:44:47,149
and just to hopefully look good as well
 

2049
00:44:47,149 --> 00:44:49,579
and just to hopefully look good as well
yeah so this thing with all the the

2050
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:49,589
yeah so this thing with all the the
 

2051
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:51,679
yeah so this thing with all the the
chest is what we called the book matrix

2052
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:51,689
chest is what we called the book matrix
 

2053
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,089
chest is what we called the book matrix
this is what actually stores the

2054
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:53,099
this is what actually stores the
 

2055
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:55,039
this is what actually stores the
enchanted books you see they're all

2056
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:55,049
enchanted books you see they're all
 

2057
00:44:55,049 --> 00:44:57,019
enchanted books you see they're all
labeled you can't actually sorts

2058
00:44:57,019 --> 00:44:57,029
labeled you can't actually sorts
 

2059
00:44:57,029 --> 00:44:58,969
labeled you can't actually sorts
enchanted books that I know of there's

2060
00:44:58,969 --> 00:44:58,979
enchanted books that I know of there's
 

2061
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:01,789
enchanted books that I know of there's
no way to so we put them in manually up

2062
00:45:01,789 --> 00:45:01,799
no way to so we put them in manually up
 

2063
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,889
no way to so we put them in manually up
there for long-term storage and then

2064
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:03,899
there for long-term storage and then
 

2065
00:45:03,899 --> 00:45:05,329
there for long-term storage and then
when we want to do in chanting we come

2066
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:05,339
when we want to do in chanting we come
 

2067
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:07,699
when we want to do in chanting we come
down here and we can choose whatever

2068

buttons here so we just selected
 

2073
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:14,419
buttons here so we just selected
efficiency and if we click that will get

2074
00:45:14,419 --> 00:45:14,429
efficiency and if we click that will get
 

2075
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:17,839

they come up through the ground here so
 

2079
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:22,489
they come up through the ground here so
that's our efficiency book and that's

2080
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:22,499
that's our efficiency book and that's
 

2081
00:45:22,499 --> 00:45:24,559
that's our efficiency book and that's
our smite book

2082

it you can see the library up on the

2096
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:41,150
it you can see the library up on the
 

2097
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,849
it you can see the library up on the
mountain there we actually built a road

2098
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:42,859
mountain there we actually built a road
 

2099
00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:45,069
mountain there we actually built a road
that we're supposed to ride horses down

2100
00:45:45,069 --> 00:45:45,079
that we're supposed to ride horses down
 

2101
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:46,930
that we're supposed to ride horses down
to get to the library it kind of winds

2102
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:46,940
to get to the library it kind of winds
 

2103
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,430
to get to the library it kind of winds
through the mountains and stuff up to

2104
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:48,440
through the mountains and stuff up to
 

2105
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,450
through the mountains and stuff up to
the library

2106
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:49,460
the library
 

2107
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,490
the library
each of these lights on the road has a

2108
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:51,500
each of these lights on the road has a
 

2109
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,470
each of these lights on the road has a
daylight sensor so that turns on during

2110
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:53,480
daylight sensor so that turns on during
 

2111
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,290
daylight sensor so that turns on during
the night time and I thought this looked

2112
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:56,300
the night time and I thought this looked
 

2113
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,670
the night time and I thought this looked
really good when I first built it now I

2114
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:57,680
really good when I first built it now I
 

2115
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,880
really good when I first built it now I
am like why did I build this and also

2116
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:00,890
am like why did I build this and also
 

2117
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:02,500
am like why did I build this and also
we're never gonna ride horses again

2118

00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:08,540
right this area even though we don't
 

2125
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,089
right this area even though we don't
have anything built here it's a very

2126
00:46:10,089 --> 00:46:10,099
have anything built here it's a very
 

2127
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:12,130
have anything built here it's a very
special part of the world to me probably

2128
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:12,140
special part of the world to me probably
 

2129
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,470
special part of the world to me probably
to some of you as well we did a lot of

to some of you as well we did a lot of
 

2131
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,250
to some of you as well we did a lot of
our redstone testing in this area here

2132
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:17,260
our redstone testing in this area here
 

2133
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,020

anything fancy with it yet one day I
 

2149
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,440
anything fancy with it yet one day I
decided let's build a cactus farm this

2150
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:44,450
decided let's build a cactus farm this
 

2151

00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:56,540
I built this farm and I for nostalgia I
 

2161
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,349

check this out one day while working on

2172
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:17,420
check this out one day while working on
 

2173
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,790
check this out one day while working on
the man cave I think I was doing the the

2174
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
the man cave I think I was doing the the
 

2175
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,400
the man cave I think I was doing the the
map wall and I got a little bit

2176
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:21,410
map wall and I got a little bit
 

2177
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:23,319
map wall and I got a little bit
depressed to be honest it's like I was

2178
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:23,329
depressed to be honest it's like I was
 

2179
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:24,490
depressed to be honest it's like I was
looking at the maps it's like there's

2180
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:24,500
looking at the maps it's like there's
 

2181
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,770
looking at the maps it's like there's
nothing on these maps it's I've built

2182
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:26,780
nothing on these maps it's I've built
 

2183
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,140
nothing on these maps it's I've built
nothing above ground everything was in

2184
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,150
nothing above ground everything was in
 

2185
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:31,630
nothing above ground everything was in
the man cave right so I got the idea to

2186
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:31,640
the man cave right so I got the idea to
 

2187
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,760
the man cave right so I got the idea to
start this biome enhancement project

2188
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:33,770
start this biome enhancement project
 

2189
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,370
start this biome enhancement project
where basically this was an empty desert

2190
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:36,380
where basically this was an empty desert
 

2191
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,609
where basically this was an empty desert
it was very boring nothing nothing

2192
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:39,619
it was very boring nothing nothing
 

2193
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:41,319
it was very boring nothing nothing
special about so I was like why don't I

2194
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:41,329
special about so I was like why don't I
 

2195
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:42,670
special about so I was like why don't I
just build a city they're right out of

2196
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:42,680
just build a city they're right out of
 

2197
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,559
just build a city they're right out of
sandstone earth and try and make it look

2198
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:44,569
sandstone earth and try and make it look
 

2199
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:47,050
sandstone earth and try and make it look
good so that's that's kind of how this

2200
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:47,060
good so that's that's kind of how this
 

2201
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:47,810
good so that's that's kind of how this
all started

2202
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:47,820
all started
 

2203
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,210
all started
and we've done several biome enhancement

2204
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:50,220
and we've done several biome enhancement
 

2205
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,310
and we've done several biome enhancement

different that we haven't done before so
 

2537
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,620
different that we haven't done before so
that was a bit of a fail I know the

2538
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:03,630
that was a bit of a fail I know the
 

2539
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,750
that was a bit of a fail I know the
colors are a bit crazy but I should

2540
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:05,760
colors are a bit crazy but I should
 

2541
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,010
colors are a bit crazy but I should
maybe change it after all let's go take

2542
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:10,020
maybe change it after all let's go take
 

2543
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,250
maybe change it after all let's go take
a look at the windmill I think that's

2544
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:13,260
a look at the windmill I think that's
 

2545
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,070
a look at the windmill I think that's
one of my more favorite builds I've done

2546
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:16,080
one of my more favorite builds I've done
 

2547
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,040
one of my more favorite builds I've done
I've designed it myself and it looks

2548
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:19,050
I've designed it myself and it looks
 

2549
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,600
I've designed it myself and it looks
pretty cool a lot of you said it's

2550
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:20,610
pretty cool a lot of you said it's
 

2551
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,090
pretty cool a lot of you said it's
chunky though it's like really fat and

2552
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:23,100
chunky though it's like really fat and
 

2553
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,060
chunky though it's like really fat and
short but I think it's interesting

2554
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:26,070
short but I think it's interesting
 

2555
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:30,290
short but I think it's interesting

action going on there oh yeah and I
 

2559
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,950
action going on there oh yeah and I
really like this path over here this

2560
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:33,960
really like this path over here this
 

2561
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,540
really like this path over here this
one's pretty cool too oh I got I got hit

2562
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:38,550
one's pretty cool too oh I got I got hit
 

2563
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,910
one's pretty cool too oh I got I got hit
by the guy there's a we moved a guy from

by the guy there's a we moved a guy from
 

2565
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,810
by the guy there's a we moved a guy from
one of the oceans to on top the windmill

2566
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:43,820
one of the oceans to on top the windmill
 

2567
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:47,600
one of the oceans to on top the windmill
aha I like this path a lot here this

2568
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:47,610
aha I like this path a lot here this
 

2569
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,670
aha I like this path a lot here this
goes along side that village this is our

2570
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,680
goes along side that village this is our
 

2571
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,540
goes along side that village this is our
original village to the left here back

2572
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:53,550
original village to the left here back
 

2573
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,790
original village to the left here back
before is villagers even had trades and

2574
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:55,800
before is villagers even had trades and
 

2575
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,040
before is villagers even had trades and
stuff they were basically useless just

2576
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:58,050
stuff they were basically useless just
 

2577
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,740
stuff they were basically useless just
wandering around and somehow I kept them

2578
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:00,750
wandering around and somehow I kept them
 

2579
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:04,490
wandering around and somehow I kept them
all alive though and there's still a few

2580
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:04,500
all alive though and there's still a few
 

2581
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,460
all alive though and there's still a few
of the originals in there and over here

2582
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:07,470
of the originals in there and over here
 

2583
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:10,880
of the originals in there and over here
this leads to our chorus farm which is

2584
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:10,890
this leads to our chorus farm which is
 

2585
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:13,160
this leads to our chorus farm which is
pretty cool you go on top of the the

2586
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:13,170
pretty cool you go on top of the the
 

2587
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:14,780
pretty cool you go on top of the the
wood there you chop down all the seeds

2588
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:14,790
wood there you chop down all the seeds
 

2589
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,510
wood there you chop down all the seeds
once you finish that you hit the button

2590
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:17,520
once you finish that you hit the button
 

2591
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,870
once you finish that you hit the button
and it releases some water in the back

2592
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:20,880
and it releases some water in the back
 

2593
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,030
and it releases some water in the back
there it's time still exactly enough

2594
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:23,040
there it's time still exactly enough
 

2595
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,400
there it's time still exactly enough
time will pass for all the drops wash

2596
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:25,410
time will pass for all the drops wash
 

2597
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:29,690
time will pass for all the drops wash
into this water here and then it

2598
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:29,700
into this water here and then it
 

2599
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,670
into this water here and then it
retracts there's a sorting system for

2600
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
retracts there's a sorting system for
 

2601
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,370
retracts there's a sorting system for
all the drops which I think we can get

2602
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:34,380
all the drops which I think we can get
 

2603
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:39,570
all the drops which I think we can get
to over here right yeah

2604
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:39,580
to over here right yeah
 

2605
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:45,700
to over here right yeah
and the the drops end up at that you see

2606
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:45,710
and the the drops end up at that you see
 

2607
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,410
and the the drops end up at that you see
it goes down the path here

2608
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:47,420
it goes down the path here
 

2609
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,450
it goes down the path here
the drops end up at that house we just

2610
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:49,460
the drops end up at that house we just
 

2611
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,660
the drops end up at that house we just
saw getting quite a bit of leg from the

2612
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:52,670
saw getting quite a bit of leg from the
 

2613
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:56,350
saw getting quite a bit of leg from the
water there over here the forest root

2614
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:56,360
water there over here the forest root
 

2615
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,350
water there over here the forest root
ends up here to our blacksmith building

2616
00:56:59,350 --> 00:56:59,360
ends up here to our blacksmith building
 

2617
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:03,640
ends up here to our blacksmith building
and underneath it automatically goes

2618
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:03,650
and underneath it automatically goes
 

2619
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,420
and underneath it automatically goes
into these furnaces and gets melted and

2620
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:06,430
into these furnaces and gets melted and
 

2621
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,530
into these furnaces and gets melted and
dumped in their chests here and that's

2622
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:08,540
dumped in their chests here and that's
 

2623
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,030
dumped in their chests here and that's
where all our purpur in the world comes

2624
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:10,040
where all our purpur in the world comes
 

2625
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:16,150
where all our purpur in the world comes
from so at the end of the path here we

2626
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:16,160
from so at the end of the path here we
 

2627
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,310
from so at the end of the path here we
come across two really important

2628
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:18,320
come across two really important
 

2629
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,080
come across two really important
buildings to our world we have the super

2630
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,090
buildings to our world we have the super
 

2631
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:22,030
buildings to our world we have the super
smelter made out another brick there and

2632
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:22,040
smelter made out another brick there and
 

2633
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,420
smelter made out another brick there and
we have the Nexus the giant storage room

2634
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:25,430
we have the Nexus the giant storage room
 

2635
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,490
we have the Nexus the giant storage room
that's taken over three years to build

2636
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:27,500
that's taken over three years to build
 

2637
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,800
that's taken over three years to build
and it's not finished yet and that I

2638
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:29,810
and it's not finished yet and that I
 

2639
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,600
and it's not finished yet and that I
could build so much better now if I try

2640
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:31,610
could build so much better now if I try
 

2641
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:34,990
could build so much better now if I try
it again yeah let's check out the super

2642
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:35,000
it again yeah let's check out the super
 

2643
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,610
it again yeah let's check out the super
smelter first so this is one of them I

2644
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:36,620
smelter first so this is one of them I
 

2645
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,450
smelter first so this is one of them I
think this is one of your guys's

2646
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:37,460
think this is one of your guys's
 

2647
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,790
think this is one of your guys's
favorite projects I've ever done to be

2648
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:39,800
favorite projects I've ever done to be
 

2649
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,220
favorite projects I've ever done to be
honest the idea was to make a smelting

2650
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:42,230
honest the idea was to make a smelting
 

2651
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,980
honest the idea was to make a smelting
system and see how quickly we could get

2652
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:44,990
system and see how quickly we could get
 

2653
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:46,900
system and see how quickly we could get
it to work like how fast and we actually

2654
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:46,910
it to work like how fast and we actually
 

2655
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:48,670
it to work like how fast and we actually
smelt something in Minecraft that's

2656
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:48,680
smelt something in Minecraft that's
 

2657
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:53,050
smelt something in Minecraft that's
somewhat reasonable right is it 64 or

2658
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:53,060
somewhat reasonable right is it 64 or
 

2659
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,660
somewhat reasonable right is it 64 or
128 furnaces or 256 I don't remember

2660
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:55,670
128 furnaces or 256 I don't remember
 

2661
00:57:55,670 --> 00:58:01,600
128 furnaces or 256 I don't remember
it's a lot of furnaces though and like

2662
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:01,610
it's a lot of furnaces though and like
 

2663
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:05,740
it's a lot of furnaces though and like
that's how quick it smells make a lot of

2664
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:05,750
that's how quick it smells make a lot of
 

2665
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:12,000
that's how quick it smells make a lot of
noise it's killing my ears right now

2666
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,010

 

2667
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:14,740

another thing anyways it's pretty cool I

2668
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:14,750
another thing anyways it's pretty cool I
 

2669
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:17,350
another thing anyways it's pretty cool I
use it a lot actually whenever I'm doing

2670
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:17,360
use it a lot actually whenever I'm doing
 

2671
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,540
use it a lot actually whenever I'm doing
a big building project it's really nice

2672
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:19,550
a big building project it's really nice
 

2673
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:22,360
a big building project it's really nice
to be able to smell things quickly the

2674
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:22,370
to be able to smell things quickly the
 

2675
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:24,250
to be able to smell things quickly the
Nexus the whole idea with the Nexus is

2676
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:24,260
Nexus the whole idea with the Nexus is
 

2677
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,600
Nexus the whole idea with the Nexus is
to make a storage room that you can

2678
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:25,610
to make a storage room that you can
 

2679
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:30,310
to make a storage room that you can
automatically sort items so I think

2680
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:30,320
automatically sort items so I think
 

2681
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,130
automatically sort items so I think
there's there's 256 different items that

2682
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:33,140
there's there's 256 different items that
 

2683
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,320
there's there's 256 different items that
can store let in the chests there and

2684
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:35,330
can store let in the chests there and
 

2685
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:37,480
can store let in the chests there and
then it also has a retrieval system

2686
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:37,490
then it also has a retrieval system
 

2687
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:40,060
then it also has a retrieval system
which is what makes this unique here is

2688
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:40,070
which is what makes this unique here is
 

2689
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:43,300
which is what makes this unique here is
our hexadecimal encoder where we have 16

our hexadecimal encoder where we have 16
 

2691
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:47,310
our hexadecimal encoder where we have 16
buttons and each of the buttons has a

buttons and each of the buttons has a
 

2693
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:51,090
buttons and each of the buttons has a
numerical value between 0 and 16

2694

that made sense somehow and let's say

2698
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:56,420
that made sense somehow and let's say
 

2699
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,050
that made sense somehow and let's say
for example we want some cyan clay here

2700
00:58:59,050 --> 00:58:59,060
for example we want some cyan clay here
 

2701
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:01,390

number 35 this is our menu system I

2702
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:01,400
number 35 this is our menu system I
 

2703
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,370
number 35 this is our menu system I
named all of these items why is that one

2704
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:03,380
named all of these items why is that one
 

2705
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:07,600
named all of these items why is that one
blue for a Oh cuz it's an apple golden

so what you do is hit three five on our

2710
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:13,340
so what you do is hit three five on our
 

2711
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,150
so what you do is hit three five on our
thing here hopefully I do it in the

2712
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:16,160
thing here hopefully I do it in the
 

2713
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,310
thing here hopefully I do it in the
right order here and that changes the

2714
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:18,320
right order here and that changes the
 

2715
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,890
right order here and that changes the
code up there and then you pull the

2716
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:20,900
code up there and then you pull the
 

2717
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,810
code up there and then you pull the
lever it'll request the item hopefully

2718
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:22,820
lever it'll request the item hopefully
 

2719
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,940
lever it'll request the item hopefully
or another option instead of pulling the

this one will give you sixteen items

2724
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:27,830

2725
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:31,030
this one will give you sixteen items
this one thirty-two sixty-four or two

2726

this one thirty-two sixty-four or two
 

2727
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,060
this one thirty-two sixty-four or two
stacks I think with that one there we go

2728
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:34,070
stacks I think with that one there we go
 

2729
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,370
stacks I think with that one there we go
finally that's one of the big problems

2730
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:36,380
finally that's one of the big problems
 

2731
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,650
finally that's one of the big problems
of the system if I was to redesign it

2732
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:38,660
of the system if I was to redesign it
 

2733
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:39,160
of the system if I was to redesign it
again

2734
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:39,170
again
 

2735
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:41,980
again
I would try to make it even faster at

2736
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:41,990
I would try to make it even faster at
 

2737
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:43,930
I would try to make it even faster at
delivering the items and also I would

2738
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:43,940
delivering the items and also I would
 

2739
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,310
delivering the items and also I would
like to be able to see how many items

2740
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:45,320
like to be able to see how many items
 

2741
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,100
like to be able to see how many items
are in this system so I'm kind of like

2742
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:48,110
are in this system so I'm kind of like
 

2743
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:51,340
are in this system so I'm kind of like
blindly requesting them with that this

2744
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:51,350
blindly requesting them with that this
 

2745
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:53,820
blindly requesting them with that this
is where the items actually gets stored

2746
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:53,830
is where the items actually gets stored
 

2747
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:56,950
is where the items actually gets stored
kind of a cool little area here at

2748
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:56,960
kind of a cool little area here at
 

2749
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,020

thing a lot a lot of wiring and yeah the
 

2755
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:11,590
thing a lot a lot of wiring and yeah the
hexadecimal encoding part of it is crazy

2756
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:11,600
hexadecimal encoding part of it is crazy
 

2757
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,310
hexadecimal encoding part of it is crazy
like to get all those buttons to meet up

2758
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:15,320
like to get all those buttons to meet up

with the chess it gets a little crazy

2760
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:17,540
with the chess it gets a little crazy
 

2761
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,450
with the chess it gets a little crazy
with all the branching of the wiring and

2762
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:19,460
with all the branching of the wiring and
 

2763
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,370
with all the branching of the wiring and
stuff but is it pretty cool a little

2764
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:21,380
stuff but is it pretty cool a little
 

2765
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,160

huge okay let's continue on here further
this way one of our again more recent

2770
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:31,070
this way one of our again more recent
 

2771
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:34,000
this way one of our again more recent
builds is a giant brown mushroom firm we

2772
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,010
builds is a giant brown mushroom firm we
 

2773
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:37,870
builds is a giant brown mushroom firm we
also have an auto pumpkin farm here that

2774
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:37,880
also have an auto pumpkin farm here that
 

2775
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:43,900
also have an auto pumpkin farm here that
uses daylight sensors where light passes

2776
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:43,910
uses daylight sensors where light passes
 

2777
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:45,340
uses daylight sensors where light passes
through the Pistons here if a pumpkin

2778
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:45,350
through the Pistons here if a pumpkin
 

2779
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,980
through the Pistons here if a pumpkin
grows in front it triggers the daylight

2780
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:47,990
grows in front it triggers the daylight
 

2781
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,930
grows in front it triggers the daylight
sensor and it causes it to break goes

2782
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:49,940
sensor and it causes it to break goes
 

2783
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,510
sensor and it causes it to break goes
into the water ends up in these chests

2784
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:52,520
into the water ends up in these chests
 

2785
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,330
into the water ends up in these chests
here and we have some villagers here for

2786
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:55,340
here and we have some villagers here for
 

2787
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:56,920
here and we have some villagers here for
pumpkin trading we got a perfect eight

2788
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:56,930
pumpkin trading we got a perfect eight
 

2789
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:59,470
pumpkin trading we got a perfect eight
guy that's the best trader you can get

2790
01:00:59,470 --> 01:00:59,480
guy that's the best trader you can get
 

2791
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,220
guy that's the best trader you can get
with them

2792
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:02,230

 

2793
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:04,359

there wasn't too many mushrooms there I

2794
01:01:04,359 --> 01:01:04,369
there wasn't too many mushrooms there I
 

2795
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,940
there wasn't too many mushrooms there I
don't think yeah I kind of messed up the

2796
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:06,950
don't think yeah I kind of messed up the
 

2797
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,609
don't think yeah I kind of messed up the
mushroom farm here the idea is you got a

2798
01:01:09,609 --> 01:01:09,619
mushroom farm here the idea is you got a
 

2799
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:11,230
mushroom farm here the idea is you got a
spot here for the brown mushrooms to

2800
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:11,240
spot here for the brown mushrooms to
 

2801
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,490
spot here for the brown mushrooms to
grow there's one in each of these

2802
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:12,500
grow there's one in each of these
 

2803
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,710
grow there's one in each of these
corners underneath the the dirt here so

2804
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:14,720
corners underneath the the dirt here so
 

2805
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,210
corners underneath the the dirt here so
it'll spread to the podzol here

2806
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:16,220
it'll spread to the podzol here
 

2807
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,130
it'll spread to the podzol here
eventually

2808
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:17,140
eventually
 

2809
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,870
eventually
or you can just plant them manually then

2810
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:19,880
or you can just plant them manually then
 

2811
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,790
or you can just plant them manually then
there's a dispenser with bonemeal it'll

2812
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:21,800
there's a dispenser with bonemeal it'll
 

2813
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,460
there's a dispenser with bonemeal it'll
force it to grow like we just saw you

2814
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:24,470
force it to grow like we just saw you
 

2815
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:26,650
force it to grow like we just saw you
chop down you you run along the side

2816
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:26,660
chop down you you run along the side
 

2817
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:29,220
chop down you you run along the side
here you chop down all the mushrooms

2818
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:29,230
here you chop down all the mushrooms
 

2819
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:31,510
here you chop down all the mushrooms
there's supposed to be a beacon with

2820
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:31,520
there's supposed to be a beacon with
 

2821
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,339
there's supposed to be a beacon with
speed mining but it's not active for

2822
01:01:33,339 --> 01:01:33,349
speed mining but it's not active for
 

2823
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:35,740
speed mining but it's not active for
some reason I think I moved it somewhere

2824
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:35,750
some reason I think I moved it somewhere
 

2825
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:39,190
some reason I think I moved it somewhere
else maybe no I would just wasn't in

2826
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:39,200
else maybe no I would just wasn't in
 

2827
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,380
else maybe no I would just wasn't in
range I guess where is this axe to

2828
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:41,390

on here ah chop that all the mushrooms
 

2833
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:51,730
on here ah chop that all the mushrooms
then there's some dispensers on top then

2834
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:51,740
then there's some dispensers on top then
 

2835
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,190

mushrooms to the super smelter they're
 

2845
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:06,549
mushrooms to the super smelter they're
as fuel so moving on here you can see

2846
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:06,559
as fuel so moving on here you can see
 

2847
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,799
as fuel so moving on here you can see
the super smelter and Nexus way in the

the super smelter and Nexus way in the
 

2849
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:10,569
the super smelter and Nexus way in the
background there if you come over here

2850
01:02:10,569 --> 01:02:10,579
background there if you come over here
 

2851
01:02:10,579 --> 01:02:14,170
background there if you come over here
we have the Guardian farm and this is a

2852
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:14,180
we have the Guardian farm and this is a
 

2853
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,539
we have the Guardian farm and this is a
little bit of a special case for us

2854
01:02:16,539 --> 01:02:16,549
little bit of a special case for us
 

2855
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:19,660
little bit of a special case for us
because the world is so old the biomes

2856
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:19,670
because the world is so old the biomes
 

2857
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:21,660
because the world is so old the biomes
actually changed in one of the updates

2858
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:21,670
actually changed in one of the updates
 

2859
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:24,000
actually changed in one of the updates
so even though this was like Plains

2860
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,010
so even though this was like Plains
 

2861
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:28,329
so even though this was like Plains
biome it got switched over to ocean like

2862
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:28,339
biome it got switched over to ocean like
 

2863
01:02:28,339 --> 01:02:30,190
biome it got switched over to ocean like
an if you made this world today using

2864
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:30,200
an if you made this world today using
 

2865
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,280
an if you made this world today using
the same seed this would be ocean and

2866
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:32,290
the same seed this would be ocean and
 

2867
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:36,130
the same seed this would be ocean and
there's there's a Guardian firm here or

2868
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:36,140
there's there's a Guardian firm here or
 

2869
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:39,039
there's there's a Guardian firm here or
Guardian temple I mean so I dug out the

2870
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:39,049
Guardian temple I mean so I dug out the
 

2871
01:02:39,049 --> 01:02:42,520
Guardian temple I mean so I dug out the
land I set up a glass thing here full of

2872
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:42,530
land I set up a glass thing here full of
 

2873
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:45,309
land I set up a glass thing here full of
water for the guardians and this is a my

2874
01:02:45,309 --> 01:02:45,319
water for the guardians and this is a my
 

2875
01:02:45,319 --> 01:02:47,770
water for the guardians and this is a my
own special design for a farm you could

2876
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:47,780
own special design for a farm you could
 

2877
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,539
own special design for a farm you could
do this in the ocean pretty easy instead

2878
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:49,549
do this in the ocean pretty easy instead
 

2879
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:51,339
do this in the ocean pretty easy instead
of like emptying out all the water like

2880
01:02:51,339 --> 01:02:51,349
of like emptying out all the water like
 

2881
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:54,819
of like emptying out all the water like
you normally do you set up these columns

2882
01:02:54,819 --> 01:02:54,829
you normally do you set up these columns
 

2883
01:02:54,829 --> 01:02:57,069
you normally do you set up these columns
of sugarcane or some other blocks that

2884
01:02:57,069 --> 01:02:57,079
of sugarcane or some other blocks that
 

2885
01:02:57,079 --> 01:02:58,660
of sugarcane or some other blocks that
can fall through like fence gates and

2886
01:02:58,660 --> 01:02:58,670
can fall through like fence gates and
 

2887
01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:01,270
can fall through like fence gates and
they'll eventually swim into it and fall

2888
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:01,280
they'll eventually swim into it and fall
 

2889
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,480
they'll eventually swim into it and fall
down it won't be super efficient but

2890
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:03,490
down it won't be super efficient but
 

2891
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:06,579
down it won't be super efficient but
it'll work in my case here it's pretty

2892
01:03:06,579 --> 01:03:06,589
it'll work in my case here it's pretty
 

2893
01:03:06,589 --> 01:03:07,809
it'll work in my case here it's pretty
good because there's no other water

2894
01:03:07,809 --> 01:03:07,819
good because there's no other water
 

2895
01:03:07,819 --> 01:03:12,400
good because there's no other water
nearby anyways they fall through some

2896
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:12,410
nearby anyways they fall through some
 

2897
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,910
nearby anyways they fall through some
lava here

2898
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:13,920
lava here
 

2899
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,420
lava here
they all collect together fall down the

2900
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:17,430
they all collect together fall down the
 

2901
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:20,270
they all collect together fall down the
pipe here they die above some hoppers

2902
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:20,280
pipe here they die above some hoppers
 

2903
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,250
pipe here they die above some hoppers
and then they go into a sorting system

2904
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:22,260
and then they go into a sorting system
 

2905
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:25,250
and then they go into a sorting system
and elevator go into the chests here and

2906
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:25,260
and elevator go into the chests here and
 

2907
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,700
and elevator go into the chests here and
this is just a little room we made to to

2908
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:28,710
this is just a little room we made to to
 

2909
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:32,450
this is just a little room we made to to
access the drops and stuff from from the

2910
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:32,460
access the drops and stuff from from the
 

2911
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,599
access the drops and stuff from from the
farm oh me oh my we are over one hour

2912
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:35,609
farm oh me oh my we are over one hour
 

2913
01:03:35,609 --> 01:03:37,970

into the video now guys but thankfully

2914
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:37,980
into the video now guys but thankfully
 

2915
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,000
into the video now guys but thankfully
we only got one one thing left to see in

2916
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:41,010
we only got one one thing left to see in
 

2917
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:42,530
we only got one one thing left to see in
our local area then we're gonna go check

2918
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:42,540
our local area then we're gonna go check
 

2919
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:45,289
our local area then we're gonna go check
out some other stuff here starting off

2920
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:45,299
out some other stuff here starting off
 

2921
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:48,289
out some other stuff here starting off
this is I think the first mob system we

2922
01:03:48,289 --> 01:03:48,299
this is I think the first mob system we
 

2923
01:03:48,299 --> 01:03:50,120
this is I think the first mob system we
built in the world here using my old

2924
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:50,130
built in the world here using my old
 

2925
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:53,210
built in the world here using my old
design which still kind of works but

2926
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:53,220
design which still kind of works but
 

2927
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,890
design which still kind of works but
it's not it's probably not the best one

2928
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:54,900
it's not it's probably not the best one
 

2929
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,190
it's not it's probably not the best one
you could use nowadays and this is our

2930
01:03:58,190 --> 01:03:58,200
you could use nowadays and this is our
 

2931
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,049
you could use nowadays and this is our
stronghold base so this is where our end

2932
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:00,059
stronghold base so this is where our end
 

2933
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:05,240
stronghold base so this is where our end
portal is I decided I figured out a long

2934
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:05,250
portal is I decided I figured out a long
 

2935
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,030
portal is I decided I figured out a long
time ago a way of making a silver fish

2936
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:08,040
time ago a way of making a silver fish
 

2937
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,829
time ago a way of making a silver fish
farm or basically it spawns a silver

2938
01:04:09,829 --> 01:04:09,839
farm or basically it spawns a silver
 

2939
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:14,839
farm or basically it spawns a silver
fish in and we use a bud bud switch to

2940
01:04:14,839 --> 01:04:14,849
fish in and we use a bud bud switch to
 

2941
01:04:14,849 --> 01:04:16,670
fish in and we use a bud bud switch to
detect when they enter or stone blocks

2942
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:16,680
detect when they enter or stone blocks
 

2943
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,660
detect when they enter or stone blocks
which get automatically generated at a

2944
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:19,670
which get automatically generated at a
 

2945
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:24,020
which get automatically generated at a
farm and a farm at a you know a stone

2946
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:24,030
farm and a farm at a you know a stone
 

2947
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,240
farm and a farm at a you know a stone
farm like lava and water you know what I

2948
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:26,250
farm like lava and water you know what I
 

2949
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:29,510
farm like lava and water you know what I
talked about and then they get piled

2950
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:29,520
talked about and then they get piled
 

2951
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,430
talked about and then they get piled
together in a giant tube here so these

2952
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:31,440
together in a giant tube here so these
 

2953
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,890
together in a giant tube here so these
are all silver fish blocks being stored

2954
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:33,900
are all silver fish blocks being stored
 

2955
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,690
are all silver fish blocks being stored
originally I was doing it so we'd have

2956
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:35,700
originally I was doing it so we'd have
 

2957
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,120
originally I was doing it so we'd have
like long-term storage for XP back when

2958
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:38,130
like long-term storage for XP back when
 

2959
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:41,270
like long-term storage for XP back when
it took 50 levels to enchant and I

2960
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:41,280
it took 50 levels to enchant and I
 

2961
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,460
it took 50 levels to enchant and I
wanted to build a base here so while we

2962
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:43,470
wanted to build a base here so while we
 

2963
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:44,990
wanted to build a base here so while we
were standing on the base it would be

2964
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:45,000
were standing on the base it would be
 

2965
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,359
were standing on the base it would be
constantly making silver fish but we

2966
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:47,369
constantly making silver fish but we
 

2967
01:04:47,369 --> 01:04:49,339
constantly making silver fish but we
never ended up building a base here we

2968
01:04:49,339 --> 01:04:49,349
never ended up building a base here we
 

2969
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:51,530
never ended up building a base here we
just did some random projects such as

2970
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:51,540
just did some random projects such as
 

2971
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,609
just did some random projects such as
our bomb factory thing here where we get

2972
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:55,619
our bomb factory thing here where we get
 

2973
01:04:55,619 --> 01:04:57,620
our bomb factory thing here where we get
skeletons to shoot creepers and then

2974
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:57,630
skeletons to shoot creepers and then
 

2975
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:00,380
skeletons to shoot creepers and then
they will blow them up wherever we

2976
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:00,390
they will blow them up wherever we
 

2977
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:04,930
they will blow them up wherever we
choose something we did recently and

2978
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:04,940
choose something we did recently and
 

2979
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:07,640
choose something we did recently and
what else that's about it maybe let's go

2980
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:07,650
what else that's about it maybe let's go
 

2981
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:10,010
what else that's about it maybe let's go
to the end since we're here and we'll

2982
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:10,020
to the end since we're here and we'll
 

2983
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:11,299
to the end since we're here and we'll
start checking out some of our other

2984
01:05:11,299 --> 01:05:11,309
start checking out some of our other

down this way we have an eats road which

2992
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:20,920
down this way we have an eats road which
 

2993
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,520
down this way we have an eats road which
doesn't worked anymore

comment I asked people what we should

3006
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:38,050
comment I asked people what we should
 

3007
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:40,110
comment I asked people what we should
call this thing and somebody suggested

3008
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:40,120
call this thing and somebody suggested
 

3009
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,820
call this thing and somebody suggested
the name ender ender so that's what I

3010
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:41,830
the name ender ender so that's what I
 

3011
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:44,310
the name ender ender so that's what I
called it and then other people followed

3012
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:44,320
called it and then other people followed
 

3013
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,840
called it and then other people followed
suit they called their Enderman farms

3014

suit they called their Enderman farms
 

3015
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:49,280
suit they called their Enderman farms
and her Enders and the rest is history

3016
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:49,290
and her Enders and the rest is history
 

3017
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:52,350
and her Enders and the rest is history
this is the first design though back in

3018
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:52,360
this is the first design though back in
 

3019
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,300
this is the first design though back in

to them I decided to try to do a piston

3036
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:10,540
to them I decided to try to do a piston
 

3037
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:13,380
to them I decided to try to do a piston
system where we drop them and it gets

3038

system where we drop them and it gets
 

3039
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:16,080
system where we drop them and it gets
him down to one hit points and then you

3040
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:16,090
him down to one hit points and then you
 

3041
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:18,330
him down to one hit points and then you
look at them attract them and kill them

3042
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:18,340
look at them attract them and kill them
 

3043
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,670
look at them attract them and kill them
quickly I did it just for ender pearls

3044
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:20,680
quickly I did it just for ender pearls
 

3045
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,280
quickly I did it just for ender pearls
originally but it was so effective at

farm to later the zip crowd figured out

3050
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:29,620
farm to later the zip crowd figured out
 

3051
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:32,940
farm to later the zip crowd figured out
a way of using vines so that you could

3052
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:32,950
a way of using vines so that you could
 

3053
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:35,310
a way of using vines so that you could
stack the different layers and that

3054
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:35,320
stack the different layers and that
 

3055
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,410
stack the different layers and that
became the standard for Enderman farms

3056
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:37,420
became the standard for Enderman farms
 

3057
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,900
became the standard for Enderman farms
and I kind of copied a lot of that in

3058
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:39,910
and I kind of copied a lot of that in
 

3059
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:43,350
and I kind of copied a lot of that in
our second farm here when I did the

3060
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:43,360
our second farm here when I did the
 

3061
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,660
our second farm here when I did the
ender ender 2.0 here though I did try to

3062
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:45,670
ender ender 2.0 here though I did try to
 

3063
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:47,970
ender ender 2.0 here though I did try to
do a couple unique things with its to

3064
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:47,980
do a couple unique things with its to
 

3065
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:49,080
do a couple unique things with its to
make it make it my own

3066
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,090
make it make it my own
 

3067
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:52,470
make it make it my own
for example the piston arms they work on

3068
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:52,480
for example the piston arms they work on
 

3069
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,390
for example the piston arms they work on
a clock system instead of like if an

01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:56,380
Enderman activates the tripwire push the
 

3073
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:59,130
Enderman activates the tripwire push the
Pistons this will continually push the

3074
01:06:59,130 --> 01:06:59,140
Pistons this will continually push the
 

3075
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,450
Pistons this will continually push the
Enderman until they fall down because

3076
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:00,460
Enderman until they fall down because
 

3077
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:01,740
Enderman until they fall down because
sometimes they would get stuck in the

3078
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:01,750
sometimes they would get stuck in the
 

3079
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,290
sometimes they would get stuck in the
piston arms and if you tried several

3080
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:04,300
piston arms and if you tried several
 

3081
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,210
piston arms and if you tried several
times it would eventually push them but

3082
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:06,220
times it would eventually push them but
 

3083
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:08,280
times it would eventually push them but
the big thing about this farm is there

3084
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:08,290
the big thing about this farm is there
 

3085
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:10,760
the big thing about this farm is there
was a change in the game that wasn't

3086
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:10,770
was a change in the game that wasn't
 

3087
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:18,980
was a change in the game that wasn't
really well known where what game game I

3088
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:18,990
really well known where what game game I
 

3089
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:22,670
really well known where what game game I
see what I did there very funny

3090
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:22,680
see what I did there very funny
 

3091
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,020
see what I did there very funny
there was a change where TNT would

3092
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:25,030
there was a change where TNT would
 

3093
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:30,180
there was a change where TNT would
actually count as a player kill so

3094
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:30,190

 

3095
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:32,770

when you kill the Enderman with TNT you

3096
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:32,780
when you kill the Enderman with TNT you
 

3097
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,240
when you kill the Enderman with TNT you
would actually get XP and ender pearls

3098
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:34,250
would actually get XP and ender pearls
 

3099
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,640
would actually get XP and ender pearls
and stuff before that wasn't a thing so

3100
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:36,650
and stuff before that wasn't a thing so
 

3101
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:38,260
and stuff before that wasn't a thing so
I designed the farm where they would be

3102
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:38,270
I designed the farm where they would be
 

3103
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:41,800
I designed the farm where they would be
just in the perfect position to collect

3104
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:41,810
just in the perfect position to collect
 

3105
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:45,040
just in the perfect position to collect
all the XP when you stand here and it

3106
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:45,050
all the XP when you stand here and it
 

3107
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:46,540
all the XP when you stand here and it
worked pretty good I use this thing

3108
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:46,550
worked pretty good I use this thing
 

3109
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:48,310
worked pretty good I use this thing
quite a bit let's go check out the third

3110
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:48,320
quite a bit let's go check out the third
 

3111
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,460
quite a bit let's go check out the third
one though and finally guys that brings

3112
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:51,470
one though and finally guys that brings
 

3113
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:54,070
one though and finally guys that brings
us to the end our ender 3.0 this is our

3114
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:54,080
us to the end our ender 3.0 this is our
 

3115
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:57,250
us to the end our ender 3.0 this is our
current mob farm and it still works very

3116
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:57,260
current mob farm and it still works very
 

3117
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:00,580
current mob farm and it still works very
very good I like it a lot I get so much

3118
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:00,590
very good I like it a lot I get so much
 

3119
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:02,500
very good I like it a lot I get so much
XP from this thing although I do

3120
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:02,510
XP from this thing although I do
 

3121
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:05,350
XP from this thing although I do
generally prefer using the our gold farm

3122
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:05,360
generally prefer using the our gold farm
 

3123
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,290
generally prefer using the our gold farm
for XP because it's automatic this one's

3124
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:08,300
for XP because it's automatic this one's
 

3125
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:11,020

not but the idea is you spawn the

3126
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:11,030
not but the idea is you spawn the
 

3127
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:12,820

Enderman over a large space they run

3128
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:12,830
Enderman over a large space they run
 

3129
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:14,440
Enderman over a large space they run
pretty quickly now that was a change

3130
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:14,450
pretty quickly now that was a change
 

3131
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:16,540
pretty quickly now that was a change
made in the game and they are attracted

3132
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:16,550
made in the game and they are attracted
 

3133
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:19,260
made in the game and they are attracted
to an endermite in a minecart here I

3134
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:19,270
to an endermite in a minecart here I
 

3135
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:21,579
to an endermite in a minecart here I
tried really hard with this design to

3136
01:08:21,579 --> 01:08:21,589
tried really hard with this design to
 

3137
01:08:21,589 --> 01:08:23,620
tried really hard with this design to
get them to fit in a 1x1 area a lot of

3138
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:23,630
get them to fit in a 1x1 area a lot of
 

3139
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:27,250
get them to fit in a 1x1 area a lot of
them didn't do that I think people are

3140
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:27,260
them didn't do that I think people are
 

3141

they get ejected down into these

3298
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:08,750
they get ejected down into these
 

3299
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:13,150
they get ejected down into these
chambers where they get stored and then

3300
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:13,160
chambers where they get stored and then
 

3301
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:16,300
chambers where they get stored and then
this is a shocker box filling station so

3302
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:16,310
this is a shocker box filling station so
 

3303
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:19,630
this is a shocker box filling station so
basically it fills up the chakra box

3304
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:19,640
basically it fills up the chakra box
 

3305
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,790
basically it fills up the chakra box
once it's full it breaks it and puts in

3306
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:21,800
once it's full it breaks it and puts in
 

3307
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,060
once it's full it breaks it and puts in
the chest down below here so these are

01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:25,070
the chest down below here so these are
 

3309
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:27,520
the chest down below here so these are
all full of rotten flesh for example ok

back at the hub here if we go down one

3312
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:30,380
back at the hub here if we go down one
 

3313
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,780

of these branches every single one of
 

3315
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:33,340
of these branches every single one of
the branches has one of these selector

the indecisiveness a lot of projects I

3326
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:45,560
the indecisiveness a lot of projects I
 

3327
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,870
the indecisiveness a lot of projects I
have ideas for and then I never actually

horses to go down the tracks try to
 

3333
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:56,700
horses to go down the tracks try to
breed very fast horses so we put in a oh

3334
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:56,710
breed very fast horses so we put in a oh
 

3335
01:12:56,710 --> 01:13:01,030

01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:05,450
now apparently unfortunately so you can
 

3341
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:07,690
now apparently unfortunately so you can
switch between the two and then take out

and one in a quick course another so if
you wanted to carry items you would use

the mule if you wanted to travel down
 

3351
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:17,370
the mule if you wanted to travel down
the path quickly you would use a horse

3352
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:17,380
the path quickly you would use a horse
 

3353
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:20,920
the path quickly you would use a horse
later we turned it over to an ice tunnel

3354
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:20,930
later we turned it over to an ice tunnel
 

3355

later we turned it over to an ice tunnel
which is like the quickest form of

alright let's go check out the which

3364
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:33,740
alright let's go check out the which

alright let's go check out the which
firm I guess I think it's over here yeah

previously we used arrows but it was too

3374
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:47,450
previously we used arrows but it was too
 

3375
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:50,170
previously we used arrows but it was too
too difficult to maintain and then they

3376
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:50,180
too difficult to maintain and then they
 

3377
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,700
too difficult to maintain and then they
fall down the chamber here onto some

3378
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:51,710
fall down the chamber here onto some
 

3379

3381
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:56,470

anything back here just the timing

3382
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:56,480
anything back here just the timing

anything back here just the timing
system that's it's still gotta light up

3384
01:13:58,359 --> 01:13:58,369

01:14:01,839 --> 01:14:01,849
working quickly and also clear out some

more lands one of the branches in the

3390
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:04,730
more lands one of the branches in the
 

3391
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:06,250
more lands one of the branches in the
nether hub here is actually different

3392
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:06,260
nether hub here is actually different
 

3393
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:08,260
nether hub here is actually different
than the others it it's not an ice road

3394
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:08,270
than the others it it's not an ice road
 

3395
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:10,930
than the others it it's not an ice road
it's a custom tunnel we built this took

3396
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:10,940
it's a custom tunnel we built this took
 

3397
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:14,560
it's a custom tunnel we built this took
forever to build never again keep your

3398
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:14,570
forever to build never again keep your
 

3399
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:16,689
forever to build never again keep your
tunnels simple don't go complex because

3400
01:14:16,689 --> 01:14:16,699
tunnels simple don't go complex because
 

3401
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:18,490
tunnels simple don't go complex because
it just gets amplified the longer they

3402
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:18,500
it just gets amplified the longer they
 

3403
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,950
it just gets amplified the longer they
are but I do like how this thing looks

3404
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:20,960
are but I do like how this thing looks
 

3405
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,350
are but I do like how this thing looks
it's pretty cool we have an obsidian

3406
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:23,360
it's pretty cool we have an obsidian
 

3407
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,830
it's pretty cool we have an obsidian
farm here kind of scared to go check

3408
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:26,840
farm here kind of scared to go check
 

3409
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:33,790
farm here kind of scared to go check
outs we get back yeah the idea is you go

3410
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:33,800
outs we get back yeah the idea is you go
 

3411
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:38,080
outs we get back yeah the idea is you go
through you break the portal and then

3412
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:38,090
through you break the portal and then
 

3413
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:41,160
through you break the portal and then
you run to this portal over here and

3414
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:41,170
you run to this portal over here and
 

3415
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:43,660
you run to this portal over here and
it's on the timing system this is when I

3416
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:43,670
it's on the timing system this is when I
 

3417
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:45,339
it's on the timing system this is when I
first figured out that timing thing that

3418
01:14:45,339 --> 01:14:45,349
first figured out that timing thing that
 

3419
01:14:45,349 --> 01:14:48,549
first figured out that timing thing that
if you break the portal in 4.1 seconds

3420
01:14:48,549 --> 01:14:48,559
if you break the portal in 4.1 seconds
 

3421
01:14:48,559 --> 01:14:52,750
if you break the portal in 4.1 seconds
after you create it it will break behind

3422
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:52,760
after you create it it will break behind
 

3423
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,390
after you create it it will break behind
you but still let you through

3424
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:54,400
you but still let you through
 

3425
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,799
you but still let you through
you hear that piston go just broke the

3426
01:14:56,799 --> 01:14:56,809
you hear that piston go just broke the
 

3427
01:14:56,809 --> 01:14:59,109
you hear that piston go just broke the
portal brought us back here so if we go

3428
01:14:59,109 --> 01:14:59,119
portal brought us back here so if we go
 

3429
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:00,310
portal brought us back here so if we go
through again they'll generate another

3430
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:00,320
through again they'll generate another
 

3431
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:06,790
through again they'll generate another
portal and more obsidian off this way is

3432
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:06,800
portal and more obsidian off this way is
 

3433
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,830
portal and more obsidian off this way is
just the sand mining outpost we check it

3434
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:08,840
just the sand mining outpost we check it
 

3435
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,490
just the sand mining outpost we check it
out real quick

3436
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:09,500
out real quick
 

3437
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,589
out real quick
there's not really a lot to see here we

3438
01:15:11,589 --> 01:15:11,599
there's not really a lot to see here we
 

3439
01:15:11,599 --> 01:15:13,120
there's not really a lot to see here we
just have some storage chests for

3440
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:13,130
just have some storage chests for
 

3441
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:15,879
just have some storage chests for
filling up of sand and a minecart system

3442
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:15,889
filling up of sand and a minecart system
 

3443
01:15:15,889 --> 01:15:17,740
filling up of sand and a minecart system
you fill up the storage minecarts with

3444
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:17,750
you fill up the storage minecarts with
 

3445
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,569
you fill up the storage minecarts with
sand then you send it off through the

3446
01:15:19,569 --> 01:15:19,579
sand then you send it off through the
 

3447
01:15:19,579 --> 01:15:22,510
sand then you send it off through the
nether down that's minecart track we

3448
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:22,520
nether down that's minecart track we
 

3449
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,819
nether down that's minecart track we
have and I put in like a water stream

3450
01:15:24,819 --> 01:15:24,829
have and I put in like a water stream
 

3451
01:15:24,829 --> 01:15:26,529
have and I put in like a water stream
here so if we're doing mining in this

3452
01:15:26,529 --> 01:15:26,539
here so if we're doing mining in this
 

3453

would start crushing them and collecting
 

3581
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,520
would start crushing them and collecting
the next batch and then you would kill

anyways you would like hold right click

3748
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:58,340
anyways you would like hold right click
 

3749
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:59,890
anyways you would like hold right click
down it would plant the trees it would

3750
01:21:59,890 --> 01:21:59,900
down it would plant the trees it would
 

3751
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:02,380
down it would plant the trees it would
push all the wood together here into a

3752
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:02,390
push all the wood together here into a
 

3753
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:05,350
push all the wood together here into a
strip the ghast would shoot the the wood

3754
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:05,360
strip the ghast would shoot the the wood
 

3755
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,320
strip the ghast would shoot the the wood
and the water would direct the gas ball

3756
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:08,330
and the water would direct the gas ball
 

3757
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:10,030
and the water would direct the gas ball
downward so it would hit the wood and

3758
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:10,040
downward so it would hit the wood and
 

3759
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,010
downward so it would hit the wood and
because it was right above the hoppers

3760
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:12,020
because it was right above the hoppers
 

3761
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:13,960
because it was right above the hoppers
the explosion wouldn't cause any

3762
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:13,970
the explosion wouldn't cause any
 

3763
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:16,150
the explosion wouldn't cause any
destruction to the wood and it would all

3764
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:16,160
destruction to the wood and it would all
 

3765
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:19,030
destruction to the wood and it would all
collect together in here ah this farm is

3766
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:19,040
collect together in here ah this farm is
 

3767
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:22,840
collect together in here ah this farm is
a little bit broken I think one of the

3768
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:22,850
a little bit broken I think one of the
 

3769
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,880
a little bit broken I think one of the
leaves destroyed some redstone I am Not

3770
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:24,890
leaves destroyed some redstone I am Not
 

3771
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:27,340
leaves destroyed some redstone I am Not
sure I have to look into it

3772
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:27,350
sure I have to look into it
 

3773
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:29,320
sure I have to look into it
haven't used it much to be honest

3774
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:29,330
haven't used it much to be honest
 

3775
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:31,660
haven't used it much to be honest
alright so we're checking out the final

3776
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:31,670
alright so we're checking out the final
 

3777
01:22:31,670 --> 01:22:33,040
alright so we're checking out the final
branch of the nether hub I think there's

3778
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:33,050
branch of the nether hub I think there's
 

3779
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:34,540
branch of the nether hub I think there's
only two more builds we need to look at

3780
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:34,550
only two more builds we need to look at
 

3781
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:37,750
only two more builds we need to look at
before we're done the episode here first

3782
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:37,760
before we're done the episode here first
 

3783
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,070
before we're done the episode here first
off we're gonna check out the clay

3784
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:39,080
off we're gonna check out the clay
 

3785
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:42,310
off we're gonna check out the clay
mining outpost this is something I set

3786
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:42,320
mining outpost this is something I set
 

3787
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,760
mining outpost this is something I set
up to mine clay easier there's a system

3788
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:45,770
up to mine clay easier there's a system
 

3789
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:47,830
up to mine clay easier there's a system
for automatically sorting the different

3790
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:47,840
for automatically sorting the different
 

3791
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,720
for automatically sorting the different
colors into the chests here and also for

3792
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:51,730
colors into the chests here and also for
 

3793
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:53,920
colors into the chests here and also for
like if you want a storage minecart you

3794
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:53,930
like if you want a storage minecart you
 

3795
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:55,840
like if you want a storage minecart you
hit that sends it down to where you do

3796
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:55,850
hit that sends it down to where you do
 

3797
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:58,060
hit that sends it down to where you do
your mining and then when you return it

3798
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:58,070
your mining and then when you return it
 

3799
01:22:58,070 --> 01:23:01,960
your mining and then when you return it
it goes up into the sorting system so

3800
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:01,970
it goes up into the sorting system so
 

3801
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:03,100
it goes up into the sorting system so
you and mine clay and you don't even

3802
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:03,110
you and mine clay and you don't even
 

3803
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:05,650
you and mine clay and you don't even
have to come back to drop it off and I

3804
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:05,660
have to come back to drop it off and I
 

3805
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:09,160
have to come back to drop it off and I
have done a lot of digging here later we

3806
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:09,170
have done a lot of digging here later we
 

3807
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:12,850
have done a lot of digging here later we
had the idea of making like a rude is it

3808
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:12,860
had the idea of making like a rude is it
 

3809
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:14,440
had the idea of making like a rude is it
rude or rube I think it's rude right

3810
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:14,450
rude or rube I think it's rude right
 

3811
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:18,550

Rube Goldberg machine hmm you know what

3812
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:18,560
Rube Goldberg machine hmm you know what
 

3813
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,290
Rube Goldberg machine hmm you know what
I am going to cheat a little bit this

3814
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:20,300
I am going to cheat a little bit this

villager here yeah and then basically it
 

3821
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,230
villager here yeah and then basically it
releases the water we got some stuff

3822

but it could be added to quite a bit but

3826
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:37,460
but it could be added to quite a bit but
 

3827
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:41,110

first step of it is the waterfall which
 

3829
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,080

initial step there's supposed to be a
 

3867
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:29,620
initial step there's supposed to be a
whole bunch of other stuff and

whole bunch of other stuff and
 

3869
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:31,870
whole bunch of other stuff and
eventually they'll end up at this parts

eventually they'll end up at this parts
 

3871

the mining outpost here and hidden was

3892
01:25:05,229 --> 01:25:05,239
the mining outpost here and hidden was
 

3893
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:06,550
the mining outpost here and hidden was
throughout the whole place here we got

3894
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:06,560
throughout the whole place here we got
 

3895
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,609
throughout the whole place here we got
some TNT under like the logs and stuff

3896
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:09,619
some TNT under like the logs and stuff
 

3897
01:25:09,619 --> 01:25:11,709
some TNT under like the logs and stuff
so as it burns slowly more and more of

I just wanted to build a flamethrower

3908
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:21,170
I just wanted to build a flamethrower
 

3909
01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:24,209
I just wanted to build a flamethrower
basically and have something to destroy

3910
01:25:24,209 --> 01:25:24,219
basically and have something to destroy
 

3911
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:26,740
basically and have something to destroy
that's that's the whole essence of this

3912
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:26,750
that's that's the whole essence of this
 

3913
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:32,560
that's that's the whole essence of this
build now he's starting to blow up and I

3914
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:32,570
build now he's starting to blow up and I
 

3915
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:34,149
build now he's starting to blow up and I
built it like entirely out of wood so it

3916
01:25:34,149 --> 01:25:34,159
built it like entirely out of wood so it
 

3917
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:39,220
built it like entirely out of wood so it
would actually burn but then there's the

3918
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:39,230
would actually burn but then there's the
 

3919
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:44,439
would actually burn but then there's the
finale and hopefully maybe I think

3920
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:44,449
finale and hopefully maybe I think
 

3921
01:25:44,449 --> 01:25:46,060
finale and hopefully maybe I think

because I don't know where it is I can't
 

3941
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:18,400
because I don't know where it is I can't
find it so this is the amplified bass

3942
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:18,410
find it so this is the amplified bass
 

3943
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:20,440
find it so this is the amplified bass
part way through the LP series here I

3944
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:20,450
part way through the LP series here I
 

3945
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:22,360
part way through the LP series here I
decided to switch over the world to

3946
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:22,370
decided to switch over the world to
 

3947
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:25,720
decided to switch over the world to
amplified it's just MBT Ted you have to

01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:25,730
amplified it's just MBT Ted you have to
 

3949
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:28,960

change in your level that file I believe

3950
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:28,970
change in your level that file I believe
 

3951
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:31,900
change in your level that file I believe
and so we got this amplified terrain

3952
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:31,910
and so we got this amplified terrain
 

3953
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:33,970
and so we got this amplified terrain
which looks awesome I really love how it

3954
01:26:33,970 --> 01:26:33,980
which looks awesome I really love how it
 

3955
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:37,000

they first came out and I later realized
that the slime blocks aren't as cool as

3964
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:46,220
that the slime blocks aren't as cool as
 

3965
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:48,490
that the slime blocks aren't as cool as
I thought they have a lot more
