doing where we're trying to auto sort
 

21
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,370
doing where we're trying to auto sort
items and then auto retrieve them from a

let's make sure it works so because I

44
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:02,609
let's make sure it works so because I
 

45
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,270
let's make sure it works so because I
never actually tried it out so maybe

46
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
never actually tried it out so maybe
 

47
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,649
never actually tried it out so maybe
this is what we'll do we'll put one item

48
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:08,659
this is what we'll do we'll put one item
 

49
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:11,390
this is what we'll do we'll put one item
in each of these all the way down not

50
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:11,400
in each of these all the way down not
 

51
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,980
in each of these all the way down not
every single one just to try it we'll

52
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:12,990
every single one just to try it we'll
 

53
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,580
every single one just to try it we'll
put one there maybe one here let's do it

54
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:16,590
put one there maybe one here let's do it
 

55
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,700
put one there maybe one here let's do it
every every one of these things will

56
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:19,710
every every one of these things will
 

57
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,550
every every one of these things will
skip to the next dropper oh let's not

58
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
skip to the next dropper oh let's not
 

59
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,039
skip to the next dropper oh let's not
use the same item either okay and then

60
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,049
use the same item either okay and then
 

61
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,270
use the same item either okay and then
we're going to try retrieve them and

62
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,280
we're going to try retrieve them and
 

63
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,679
we're going to try retrieve them and
make sure it's all working properly

64
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:27,689
make sure it's all working properly
 

65
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,440
make sure it's all working properly
before I copy this all over and then

66
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:30,450
before I copy this all over and then
 

67
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,520
before I copy this all over and then
realize it oh no I I majorly messed up

68
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:34,530
realize it oh no I I majorly messed up
 

69
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,800
realize it oh no I I majorly messed up
I'm an idiot type of thing which I do

70
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:36,810
I'm an idiot type of thing which I do
 

71
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,810
I'm an idiot type of thing which I do
often

72
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:37,820
often
 

73
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,100
often
all right put cobble in there we got

74
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,110
all right put cobble in there we got
 

75
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,819
all right put cobble in there we got
wool let's put that in this one hey why

76
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:43,829
wool let's put that in this one hey why
 

77
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,980
wool let's put that in this one hey why
is that in there alright we'll put that

78
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:45,990
is that in there alright we'll put that
 

79
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,639
is that in there alright we'll put that
in the next one

80
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:46,649
in the next one
 

81
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,630
in the next one
that that made a lot of sense okay so I

82
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
that that made a lot of sense okay so I
 

83
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,940
that that made a lot of sense okay so I
tried to figure this out on Tamra it

84
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:52,950
tried to figure this out on Tamra it
 

85
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,609
tried to figure this out on Tamra it
took way too long so I wrote down my

86
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:55,619
took way too long so I wrote down my
 

87
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,010
took way too long so I wrote down my
predictions here on paper this and I

88
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:58,020
predictions here on paper this and I
 

89
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,719
predictions here on paper this and I
have like a little cheat sheet on the

90
00:01:59,719 --> 00:01:59,729
have like a little cheat sheet on the
 

91
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,600
have like a little cheat sheet on the
combination I need for these five levers

92
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:02,610
combination I need for these five levers
 

93
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,069
combination I need for these five levers
so this is the first one second one

94
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
so this is the first one second one
 

95
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,249
so this is the first one second one
third one fourth one fifth one that that

96
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:07,259
third one fourth one fifth one that that
 

97
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,070
third one fourth one fifth one that that
controls five bits which is all that's

98
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
controls five bits which is all that's
 

99
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,770
controls five bits which is all that's
needed to make 32 different combinations

100
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:12,780
needed to make 32 different combinations
 

101
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,820
needed to make 32 different combinations
which is how many

102
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:13,830
which is how many
 

103
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,150
which is how many
droppers we have on this side uh-huh

104
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,160
droppers we have on this side uh-huh
 

105
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,970
droppers we have on this side uh-huh
so let's try this thing out I figured to

106
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:19,980
so let's try this thing out I figured to
 

107
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,480
so let's try this thing out I figured to
get that first item we put in we need to

108
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:23,490
get that first item we put in we need to
 

109
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,770
get that first item we put in we need to
have zero or or off on all of these this

110
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:27,780
have zero or or off on all of these this
 

111
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,330
have zero or or off on all of these this
is where we would send the pulse and

112
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:29,340
is where we would send the pulse and
 

113
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,820
is where we would send the pulse and
then it makes its way down the different

114
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:31,830
then it makes its way down the different
 

115
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,430
then it makes its way down the different
branches it's going to make it yeah we

116
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,440
branches it's going to make it yeah we
 

117
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,100
branches it's going to make it yeah we
got it cool all right the second one I

118
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,110
got it cool all right the second one I
 

119
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,440
got it cool all right the second one I
have this on and this on let's try it

120
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:42,450
have this on and this on let's try it
 

121
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,350
have this on and this on let's try it
out so the idea is we will hook up rapid

122
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
out so the idea is we will hook up rapid
 

123
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,320
out so the idea is we will hook up rapid
pulsing clocks to this line here and

124
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,330
pulsing clocks to this line here and
 

125
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,750
pulsing clocks to this line here and
we'll be able to request like different

126
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:50,760
we'll be able to request like different
 

127
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,570
we'll be able to request like different
combinations of you know if you want one

128
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:53,580
combinations of you know if you want one
 

129
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,780
combinations of you know if you want one
item or four items or 16 or 32 or a

130
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:56,790
item or four items or 16 or 32 or a
 

131
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,450
item or four items or 16 or 32 or a
whole stack that'll send it that many

132
00:02:59,450 --> 00:02:59,460
whole stack that'll send it that many
 

133
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,260
whole stack that'll send it that many
pulses and should be pretty quick next

134
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,270
pulses and should be pretty quick next
 

135
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:08,900
pulses and should be pretty quick next
one is that and then we go switch over

136
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:08,910
one is that and then we go switch over
 

137
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,930
one is that and then we go switch over
here seems to be working maybe we'll

138
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:11,940
here seems to be working maybe we'll
 

139
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,160
here seems to be working maybe we'll
just do a couple more and then I'll test

140
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,170
just do a couple more and then I'll test
 

141
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,810
just do a couple more and then I'll test
it off camera because this could take a

142
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:14,820
it off camera because this could take a
 

143
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,810
it off camera because this could take a
while just want to show you it working

144
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:17,820
while just want to show you it working
 

145
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,640
while just want to show you it working
how and how it's actually able to select

146
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:19,650
how and how it's actually able to select
 

147
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,729
how and how it's actually able to select
between the different droppers

148
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:21,739
between the different droppers
 

149
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:24,020
between the different droppers
everything seems to work according to

150
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,030
everything seems to work according to
 

151
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,080
everything seems to work according to
plan let's do one more let's this one

152
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,090
plan let's do one more let's this one
 

153
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:33,470
plan let's do one more let's this one
zero one one good all right this was the

154
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:33,480
zero one one good all right this was the
 

155
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,340
zero one one good all right this was the
slime ball if I remember right Ariel and

156
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:37,350
slime ball if I remember right Ariel and
 

157
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,500
slime ball if I remember right Ariel and
that's about how long it takes items to

158
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:39,510
that's about how long it takes items to
 

159
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,960
that's about how long it takes items to
get your - it's not too bad a couple

160

okay so we gotta tuned up here according
 

291
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,600
okay so we gotta tuned up here according
to a pentatonic scale there must be

292
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:39,610
to a pentatonic scale there must be
 

293
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,370
to a pentatonic scale there must be
several different ones where people have

294

now because I was looking at the
 

299
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,420
now because I was looking at the
comments and someone told me to tune it

way and they they both called it the
pentatonic so let's hope this is right I

306
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,010
pentatonic so let's hope this is right I
 

307
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:01,760
pentatonic so let's hope this is right I
so it sounds like uh-huh

322
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:23,760

 

323
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,750

is here how do we connect here to the
 

485
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:52,800
is here how do we connect here to the
man cave I did lots Oh easy

486
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:52,810
man cave I did lots Oh easy
 

487
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,650
man cave I did lots Oh easy
oh I should know my way actually this

oh I should know my way actually this
this is a familiar area it is this it

490
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:03,100
this is a familiar area it is this it
 

491
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,270
this is a familiar area it is this it
I hear the note blocks going yeah this

00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:06,280
I hear the note blocks going yeah this
 

493
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,490
I hear the note blocks going yeah this
is it right

494
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:08,500
is it right
 

495
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,160
is it right
goes up yeah okay here we are here we

496
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,170
goes up yeah okay here we are here we
 

497
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,590
goes up yeah okay here we are here we
are and this is the start of the man

498
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
are and this is the start of the man
 

499
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,070
are and this is the start of the man
cave

500
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,080
cave
 

501
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,950
cave
the lowest point on it so we might try

502
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:16,960
the lowest point on it so we might try
 

503
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,060
the lowest point on it so we might try
to make a nice road here and then then

504
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,070
to make a nice road here and then then
 

505
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,800
to make a nice road here and then then
we'll start expanding downward with the

506
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:22,810
we'll start expanding downward with the
 

507
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:32,370
we'll start expanding downward with the
man cave which would be cool okay so we

508
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:32,380
man cave which would be cool okay so we
 

509
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,470
man cave which would be cool okay so we
are going to try a little bit of a

510
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
are going to try a little bit of a
 

511
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,370
are going to try a little bit of a
darker color combo here usually I would

512
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:38,380
darker color combo here usually I would
 

513
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,400
darker color combo here usually I would
like to build in this style but oops it

514
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,410
like to build in this style but oops it
 

515
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,060
like to build in this style but oops it
is down at lava level and what is going

516
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,070
is down at lava level and what is going
 

517
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,410
is down at lava level and what is going
to burn there so we have to try

518
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:46,420
to burn there so we have to try
 

519
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,190
to burn there so we have to try
something else

520
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:47,200
something else
 

521
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,920
something else
I'm planning on putting the get on get

522
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:49,930
I'm planning on putting the get on get
 

523
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,880
I'm planning on putting the get on get
off departure arrival stage station over

524
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:53,890
off departure arrival stage station over
 

525
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,520
off departure arrival stage station over
here for it it's going to go like to the

526
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:56,530
here for it it's going to go like to the
 

527
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,010
here for it it's going to go like to the
right and then have to be an elevator to

528
00:14:59,010 --> 00:14:59,020
right and then have to be an elevator to
 

529
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,350
right and then have to be an elevator to
go down a little bit and then I think it

530
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
go down a little bit and then I think it
 

531
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,480
go down a little bit and then I think it
goes this way all the way to the

532
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:03,490
goes this way all the way to the
 

533
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,600
goes this way all the way to the
mineshaft and be kind of out of the way

534
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:06,610
mineshaft and be kind of out of the way
 

535
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,770
mineshaft and be kind of out of the way
that way too but anyway let's let's just

536
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:10,780
that way too but anyway let's let's just
 

537
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,049
that way too but anyway let's let's just
try so I went the wrong way

538
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:13,059
try so I went the wrong way
 

539
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:18,549
try so I went the wrong way
here we go here we go oh man I am so bad

540
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:18,559
here we go here we go oh man I am so bad
 

541
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,519
here we go here we go oh man I am so bad
with mazes and that's like what the

542
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:21,529
with mazes and that's like what the
 

543
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:25,840
with mazes and that's like what the
whole tunnel system is here all right

544
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:25,850
whole tunnel system is here all right
 

545
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,279
whole tunnel system is here all right
yeah good because we got these sections

546
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:30,289
yeah good because we got these sections
 

547
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:31,929
yeah good because we got these sections
here with big lava pools I don't really

548
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:31,939
here with big lava pools I don't really
 

549
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:34,059
here with big lava pools I don't really
want to get rid of those I kind of want

550
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:34,069
want to get rid of those I kind of want
 

551
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,309
want to get rid of those I kind of want
to highlight them so I'm planning on

552
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:36,319
to highlight them so I'm planning on
 

553
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:40,449
to highlight them so I'm planning on
putting glass black glass over those see

554
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:40,459
putting glass black glass over those see
 

555
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:44,889
putting glass black glass over those see
how that works out fortunately we are

556
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:44,899
how that works out fortunately we are
 

557
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:49,679
how that works out fortunately we are
very low on building materials right now

558
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:49,689
very low on building materials right now
 

559
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:52,090
very low on building materials right now
so we'll have to deal with that like

560
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:52,100
so we'll have to deal with that like
 

561
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,849
so we'll have to deal with that like
we're out of glass we're out of clay

562
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:53,859
we're out of glass we're out of clay
 

563
00:15:53,859 --> 00:16:01,779
we're out of glass we're out of clay
pretty much all right how does that look

564
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:01,789
pretty much all right how does that look
 

565
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:05,369
pretty much all right how does that look
I think black glass is pretty good

566
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:05,379
I think black glass is pretty good
 

567
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:08,799
I think black glass is pretty good
then in areas where there is no lava I

568
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:08,809
then in areas where there is no lava I
 

569
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:12,549
then in areas where there is no lava I
was going to put possibly this black

570
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:12,559
was going to put possibly this black
 

571
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:18,970
was going to put possibly this black
stained clay stuff oh but you know what

572
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:18,980
stained clay stuff oh but you know what
 

573
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,379
stained clay stuff oh but you know what
I think I wanted to put the glass over

574
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:20,389
I think I wanted to put the glass over
 

575
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:23,369
I think I wanted to put the glass over
top that still so this go down one more

576
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:23,379
top that still so this go down one more
 

577
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:25,960
top that still so this go down one more
like here then the glass would go over

578
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:25,970
like here then the glass would go over
 

579
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:32,710
like here then the glass would go over
top yeah I think that's right and then

580
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,720
top yeah I think that's right and then
 

581
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,999
top yeah I think that's right and then
on the sides I was considering using oh

582
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:36,009
on the sides I was considering using oh
 

583
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:40,479
on the sides I was considering using oh
don't mind if I do I wanted to try

584
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:40,489
don't mind if I do I wanted to try
 

585
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:43,659
don't mind if I do I wanted to try
nether break we got lots of nether brick

586
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:43,669
nether break we got lots of nether brick
 

587
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,189
nether break we got lots of nether brick
just laying around kind of want to get

588
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
just laying around kind of want to get
 

589
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,019
just laying around kind of want to get
rid of it because taking up space and we

590
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:50,029
rid of it because taking up space and we
 

591
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:51,849
rid of it because taking up space and we
don't have a lot of storage space right

592
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:51,859
don't have a lot of storage space right
 

593
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:55,840
don't have a lot of storage space right
now until the Nexus is done all right so

594
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:55,850
now until the Nexus is done all right so
 

595
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:03,069
now until the Nexus is done all right so
do that and then have like just a sec

596
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:03,079
do that and then have like just a sec
 

597
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,869

unfortunately I'm running really low on
 

599
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:06,579
unfortunately I'm running really low on
time I wasted too much time on that

600
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:06,589
time I wasted too much time on that
 

601
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,639
time I wasted too much time on that
thing I did earlier so we're not going

602
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:09,649
thing I did earlier so we're not going
 

603
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:13,199

then like this something like that that
 

611
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,340
then like this something like that that
way it makes it feel a little bit more

612
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:29,350
way it makes it feel a little bit more
 

613
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,100
way it makes it feel a little bit more
