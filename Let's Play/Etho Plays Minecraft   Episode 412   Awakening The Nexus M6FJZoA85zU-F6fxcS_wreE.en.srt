i'm gonna try so hard to finish this
 

51
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,070
i'm gonna try so hard to finish this
thing

52
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
thing
 

53
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,270
thing
okay so what where are we at with it

54
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
okay so what where are we at with it
 

55
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,789
okay so what where are we at with it
um first thing we got to do is move this

56
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
um first thing we got to do is move this
 

57
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,429
um first thing we got to do is move this
control panel over because it's in the

58
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
control panel over because it's in the
 

59
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,789
control panel over because it's in the
way of the wiring we

60
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
way of the wiring we
 

61
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,910
way of the wiring we
we need to do here so uh what i like to

62
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920
we need to do here so uh what i like to
 

63
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,910
we need to do here so uh what i like to
do in minecraft if i ever have to

64
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
do in minecraft if i ever have to
 

65
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,109
do in minecraft if i ever have to
copy something especially in cases like

66
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
copy something especially in cases like
 

67
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,190
copy something especially in cases like
this where i'm destroying the original

68
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
this where i'm destroying the original
 

69
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,550
this where i'm destroying the original
because i gotta rebuild this somewhere

70
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
because i gotta rebuild this somewhere
 

71
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,789
because i gotta rebuild this somewhere
else and we gotta break it

72
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
else and we gotta break it
 

73
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,149
else and we gotta break it
right so since i don't know where the

74
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
right so since i don't know where the
 

75
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,310
right so since i don't know where the
future version is going until i actually

76
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
future version is going until i actually
 

77
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,789
future version is going until i actually
build

78
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
build
 

79
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,670
build
some other stuff here i'm going to look

80
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
some other stuff here i'm going to look
 

81
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,789
some other stuff here i'm going to look
it over

82
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
it over
 

83
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,950
it over
on video here and then i can reference

84
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
on video here and then i can reference
 

85
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,990
on video here and then i can reference
the video

86
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
the video
 

87
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,910
the video
if i need to see how i did the wiring

88
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
if i need to see how i did the wiring
 

89
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,190
if i need to see how i did the wiring
later because it's actually really

90
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
later because it's actually really
 

91
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,630
later because it's actually really
complicated

92
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
complicated
 

93
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,230
complicated
and i want to look all around it here

94
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
well we gotta build in its place when we
 

129
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,030

press these buttons

130
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
press these buttons
 

131
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,150
press these buttons
on the nexus every time we press it it

132
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
on the nexus every time we press it it
 

133
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,630
on the nexus every time we press it it
makes

134
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
makes
 

135
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,470
makes
four wires light up and before we were

136
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
four wires light up and before we were
 

137
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,830
four wires light up and before we were
using eight levers

138
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
using eight levers
 

139
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,790
using eight levers
to control what item we get from that so

140
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
to control what item we get from that so
 

141
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,390
to control what item we get from that so
the first time we press it it's gonna

142
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
the first time we press it it's gonna
 

143
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,630
the first time we press it it's gonna
light up four wires the second time we

144
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
light up four wires the second time we
 

145
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,509
light up four wires the second time we
press it

146
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
press it
 

147
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,350
press it
it's going to light up four other wires

148
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
it's going to light up four other wires
 

149
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,710
it's going to light up four other wires
and we have to save

150
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
and we have to save
 

151
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,390
and we have to save
that into memory using something like

152
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
that into memory using something like
 

153
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,229
that into memory using something like
this i was just trying to

154
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
this i was just trying to
 

155
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,949
this i was just trying to
figure out how i want to do it here so

156
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
figure out how i want to do it here so
 

157
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,670
figure out how i want to do it here so
let's say we press a button over there

158
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
let's say we press a button over there
 

159
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,750
let's say we press a button over there
and it makes these two wires light up

160
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
and it makes these two wires light up
 

161
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,790
and it makes these two wires light up
right

162
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
right
 

163
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,110
right
in order to save it into memory what i'm

164
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
in order to save it into memory what i'm
 

165
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,710
in order to save it into memory what i'm
going to do is just have locking

166
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
going to do is just have locking
 

167
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,550
going to do is just have locking
repeaters

168
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
repeaters
 

169
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,830
repeaters
and press the button the repeaters get

170
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
and press the button the repeaters get
 

171
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,190
and press the button the repeaters get
unlocked and then locked again

172
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
unlocked and then locked again
 

173
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,589
unlocked and then locked again
and then the buttons gonna unpress and

174
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
and then the buttons gonna unpress and
 

175
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,630
and then the buttons gonna unpress and
these will

176
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
these will
 

177
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,830
these will
get unpowered but it'll still save uh

178
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
get unpowered but it'll still save uh
 

179
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,750
get unpowered but it'll still save uh
what button or what signal we got from

180
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
what button or what signal we got from
 

181
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,270
what button or what signal we got from
that button press

182
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
that button press
 

183
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,990
that button press
using the locking repeaters right okay

184
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
using the locking repeaters right okay
 

185
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,789
using the locking repeaters right okay
perfect

186
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799

 

187
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,430

so as you can imagine some time has

188
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
so as you can imagine some time has
 

189
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,550
so as you can imagine some time has
passed here

190
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
passed here
 

191
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,110
passed here

head of the nexus got it all hooked up

196
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
head of the nexus got it all hooked up
 

197
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,149
head of the nexus got it all hooked up
to our control panel

198
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
to our control panel
 

199
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,350
to our control panel
and i'm about to test it out but let's

200
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
and i'm about to test it out but let's
 

201
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,630
and i'm about to test it out but let's
just take a moment

202
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
just take a moment
 

203
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,149
just take a moment
let's let's look at this look how

204
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
let's let's look at this look how
 

205
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,910
let's let's look at this look how
beautiful it is you know

206
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
beautiful it is you know
 

207
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,270
beautiful it is you know
on that day when you marry your wife

208
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
on that day when you marry your wife
 

209
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,750
on that day when you marry your wife
in the future and you're reflecting on

210
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
in the future and you're reflecting on
 

211
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,789
in the future and you're reflecting on
how beautiful

212
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
how beautiful
 

213
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,509
how beautiful
she is you're gonna think to yourself

214
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
she is you're gonna think to yourself
 

215
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,070
she is you're gonna think to yourself
she is

216
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
she is
 

217
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,550
she is
nothing compared to how beautiful the

218
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
nothing compared to how beautiful the
 

219
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,270
nothing compared to how beautiful the
wiring was

220
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
wiring was
 

221
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,429
wiring was
on this great day we are experiencing

222
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
on this great day we are experiencing
 

223
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,589
on this great day we are experiencing
here together

224
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
here together
 

225
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,870
here together
yes okay well

226
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
yes okay well
 

227
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,469
yes okay well
the memory unit is up there and let's go

228
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
the memory unit is up there and let's go
 

229
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,110
the memory unit is up there and let's go
check that out first

230
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
check that out first
 

231
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,909
check that out first
okay gotta pillar up getting very good

232
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
okay gotta pillar up getting very good
 

233
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,390
okay gotta pillar up getting very good
at redstone parkour here

234
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
at redstone parkour here
 

235
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,749
at redstone parkour here
you wouldn't believe it so uh

236
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
you wouldn't believe it so uh
 

237
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,430
you wouldn't believe it so uh
let me let me just make a button maybe

238
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
let me let me just make a button maybe
 

239
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,670
let me let me just make a button maybe
we'll put it on this thing

240
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
we'll put it on this thing
 

241
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,870
we'll put it on this thing
so we have four locking repeaters down

242
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
so we have four locking repeaters down
 

243
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,830
so we have four locking repeaters down
there and four

244
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
there and four
 

245
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,150
there and four
up here and there's a piston here which

246
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
up here and there's a piston here which
 

247
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,150
up here and there's a piston here which
switches between the top and the bottom

248
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
switches between the top and the bottom
 

249
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,430
switches between the top and the bottom
memory

250
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
memory
 

251
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,270
memory
um so when we press wait actually

252
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
um so when we press wait actually
 

253
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,870
um so when we press wait actually
just a second there's a piston under

254
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
just a second there's a piston under
 

255
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,430
just a second there's a piston under
there that doesn't work

256
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
there that doesn't work
 

257
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,230
there that doesn't work
let's put the button over here so i send

258
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
let's put the button over here so i send
 

259
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,870
let's put the button over here so i send
a one tick pulse to this piston

260
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
a one tick pulse to this piston
 

261
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,150
a one tick pulse to this piston
and

262
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160

 

263
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,830

because it's a one tick pulse it leaves

264
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
because it's a one tick pulse it leaves
 

265
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,230
because it's a one tick pulse it leaves
the block behind when it retracts

266
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
the block behind when it retracts
 

267
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,270
the block behind when it retracts
and when we do this

268
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
and when we do this
 

269
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,870
and when we do this
that happens more than i would like to

270
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
that happens more than i would like to
 

271
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,310
that happens more than i would like to
admit

272
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
admit
 

273
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,590
admit
that was not so smooth i am getting

274
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
that was not so smooth i am getting
 

275
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,629
that was not so smooth i am getting
oh i did it again what

276
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
oh i did it again what
 

277
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,230
oh i did it again what
what okay now i've

278
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
what okay now i've
 

279
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,230
what okay now i've
i feel bad i have to go back to redstone

280
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
i feel bad i have to go back to redstone
 

281
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,310
i feel bad i have to go back to redstone
parkour class

282
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
parkour class
 

283
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,230
parkour class
okay so these have a slight delay from

284
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
okay so these have a slight delay from
 

285
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,909
okay so these have a slight delay from
when this piston moves

286
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
when this piston moves
 

287
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,430
when this piston moves
and if we watch

288
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440

 

289
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,990

just a second this is a mess let me let

290
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
just a second this is a mess let me let
 

291
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,350
just a second this is a mess let me let
me put this on the other side so we can

292
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
me put this on the other side so we can
 

293
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,430
me put this on the other side so we can
see a little bit better

294
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
see a little bit better
 

295
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,270
see a little bit better
all right so if you if you watch these

296
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
all right so if you if you watch these
 

297
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,550
all right so if you if you watch these
locking repeaters you

298
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
locking repeaters you
 

299
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,390
locking repeaters you
see how they're all locked right now if

300
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
see how they're all locked right now if
 

301
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,950
see how they're all locked right now if
we press this

302
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
we press this
 

303
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,550
we press this
that bottom row unpowered for a second

304
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
that bottom row unpowered for a second
 

305
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,270
that bottom row unpowered for a second
and now now it didn't but the top one

306
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
and now now it didn't but the top one
 

307
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,110
and now now it didn't but the top one
did so it alternates between the top and

308
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
did so it alternates between the top and
 

309
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,350
did so it alternates between the top and
the bottom

310
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
the bottom
 

311
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,510
the bottom
and when it releases that lock it allows

312
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
and when it releases that lock it allows
 

313
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,029
and when it releases that lock it allows
it to accept the new signal and it

314
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
it to accept the new signal and it
 

315
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,909
it to accept the new signal and it
clears the previous

316
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919

 

317
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,749

memory it had for those four wires on

318
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
memory it had for those four wires on
 

319
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,350
memory it had for those four wires on
each row

320
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
each row
 

321
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,469
each row
okay makes sense yes so we have eight

322
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
okay makes sense yes so we have eight
 

323
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,749
okay makes sense yes so we have eight
wires in total

324
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
wires in total
 

325
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,670
wires in total
and they run down to all these these

326
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
and they run down to all these these
 

327
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,430
and they run down to all these these
bits we have down here

328
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
bits we have down here
 

329
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,830
bits we have down here
which control where the signal goes

330
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
which control where the signal goes
 

331
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,590
which control where the signal goes
which dropper we activate

332
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
which dropper we activate
 

333
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,550
which dropper we activate
to request an item out of our nexus

334
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
to request an item out of our nexus
 

335
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,510
to request an item out of our nexus
storage room

336
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520

 

337
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,790

and yes there's a lot of wiring

338
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
and yes there's a lot of wiring
 

339
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,909
and yes there's a lot of wiring
i want to maybe today we'll load up our

340
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
i want to maybe today we'll load up our
 

341
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,909
i want to maybe today we'll load up our
world here in mcedit i just want to see

342
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
world here in mcedit i just want to see
 

343
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,070
world here in mcedit i just want to see
how much like redstone i've placed

344
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
how much like redstone i've placed
 

345
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,390
how much like redstone i've placed
in this project how much stone brick and

346
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
in this project how much stone brick and
 

347
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,670
in this project how much stone brick and
all that stuff i'm curious on the

348
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
all that stuff i'm curious on the
 

349
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,430
all that stuff i'm curious on the
statistics because it is such a big

350
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
statistics because it is such a big
 

351
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,950
statistics because it is such a big
build

352
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
build
 

353
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,390
build
all done in survival here um

354
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
all done in survival here um
 

355
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,270
all done in survival here um
okay so what i got to do now next step

356
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
okay so what i got to do now next step
 

357
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,790
okay so what i got to do now next step
of this we got to do some testing just

358
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
of this we got to do some testing just
 

359
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,230
of this we got to do some testing just
to make sure i didn't make any mistakes

360
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
to make sure i didn't make any mistakes
 

361
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,110
to make sure i didn't make any mistakes
with this because

362
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
with this because
 

363
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,469
with this because
one little tiny let me sleep please

364
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
one little tiny let me sleep please
 

365
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,589
one little tiny let me sleep please
one little tiny slip up can wreck the

366
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
one little tiny slip up can wreck the
 

367
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,870
one little tiny slip up can wreck the
whole thing so we gotta

368
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
whole thing so we gotta
 

369
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,430
whole thing so we gotta
maybe test each unit one by one here

370
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
maybe test each unit one by one here
 

371
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,790
maybe test each unit one by one here
here i thought i'd show you guys this

372
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
here i thought i'd show you guys this
 

373
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,309
here i thought i'd show you guys this
too before we do this just to help you

374
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
too before we do this just to help you
 

375
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,550
too before we do this just to help you
visualize what what we're checking

376
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
visualize what what we're checking
 

377
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,990
visualize what what we're checking
uh so when we press the zero button

378
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
uh so when we press the zero button
 

379
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,510
uh so when we press the zero button
like out of the 16 buttons you see how

380
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
like out of the 16 buttons you see how
 

381
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,830
like out of the 16 buttons you see how
we got the numbers here for the buttons

382
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
we got the numbers here for the buttons
 

383
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,270
we got the numbers here for the buttons
uh when we press zero it should be off

384
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
uh when we press zero it should be off
 

385
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,670
uh when we press zero it should be off
off off off when we press one it should

386
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
off off off when we press one it should
 

387
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,670
off off off when we press one it should
be on off off off

388
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
be on off off off
 

389
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,870
be on off off off
two off on off off

390
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880
two off on off off
 

391
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,909
two off on off off
three on on off off and i just gotta

392
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
three on on off off and i just gotta
 

393
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,189
three on on off off and i just gotta
double check that those

394
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
double check that those
 

395
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,189
double check that those
buttons correspond to that pattern that

396
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
buttons correspond to that pattern that
 

397
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,790
buttons correspond to that pattern that
we got set out here

398
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
we got set out here
 

399
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,749
we got set out here
if it doesn't we have a problem and it's

400
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
if it doesn't we have a problem and it's
 

401
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,029
if it doesn't we have a problem and it's
better we catch it

402
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
better we catch it
 

403
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,350
better we catch it
catch it now before we like cover

404
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
catch it now before we like cover
 

405
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,869
catch it now before we like cover
everything up and

406
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
everything up and
 

407
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,230
everything up and
find out later some things aren't

408
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
find out later some things aren't
 

409
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,070
find out later some things aren't
working and we don't know why

410
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
working and we don't know why
 

411
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,909
working and we don't know why
we want to test things out individually

412
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
we want to test things out individually
 

413
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,869
we want to test things out individually
here so it's easier to spot the problems

414
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
here so it's easier to spot the problems
 

415
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,510
here so it's easier to spot the problems
so we're just making sure these buttons

416
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
so we're just making sure these buttons
 

417
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,029
so we're just making sure these buttons
work correctly

418
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
work correctly
 

419
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,629
work correctly
and the reason by the way we're doing

420
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
and the reason by the way we're doing
 

421
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,070
and the reason by the way we're doing
this memory thing is because if we

422
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
this memory thing is because if we
 

423
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,270
this memory thing is because if we
didn't do that

424
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
didn't do that
 

425
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,790
didn't do that
we have 16 buttons here and if you go

426
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
we have 16 buttons here and if you go
 

427
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,469
we have 16 buttons here and if you go
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 you get 16

428
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 you get 16
 

429
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,350
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 you get 16
but we need 256 possibilities so you

430
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
but we need 256 possibilities so you
 

431
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,070
but we need 256 possibilities so you
actually need

432
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
actually need
 

433
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,070
actually need
another set of buttons another 16

434
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
another set of buttons another 16
 

435
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,869
another set of buttons another 16
buttons besides this one

436
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
buttons besides this one
 

437
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,029
buttons besides this one
and rather than doing that we just save

438
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
and rather than doing that we just save
 

439
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,350
and rather than doing that we just save
one of the button presses into memory

440
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
one of the button presses into memory
 

441
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,110
one of the button presses into memory
and then the second one so we only need

442
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
and then the second one so we only need
 

443
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,430
and then the second one so we only need
16 instead of 32 buttons

444
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440

 

445
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,070

yes okay i'm making this more

446
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
yes okay i'm making this more
 

447
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,670
yes okay i'm making this more
complicated than i probably should

448
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
complicated than i probably should
 

449
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,430
complicated than i probably should
but anyways that's what this episode's

450
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
but anyways that's what this episode's
 

451
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,029
but anyways that's what this episode's
all about though right

452
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
all about though right
 

453
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,949
all about though right
getting the nexus going here so if we

454
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
getting the nexus going here so if we
 

455
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,030
getting the nexus going here so if we
look at these locking repeaters when we

456
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
look at these locking repeaters when we
 

457
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,430
look at these locking repeaters when we
press

458
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
press
 

459
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,310
press
zero here this is the sign to help us

460
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
zero here this is the sign to help us
 

461
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,269
zero here this is the sign to help us
remember which

462
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
remember which
 

463
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,509
remember which
which button is what zero is the top

464
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
which button is what zero is the top
 

465
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,310
which button is what zero is the top
left

466
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
left
 

467
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,710
left
so it should be off off off off and i'm

468
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
so it should be off off off off and i'm
 

469
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,230
so it should be off off off off and i'm
going to hit it twice here just so it

470
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
going to hit it twice here just so it
 

471
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,470
going to hit it twice here just so it
applies to top and bottom memory

472
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480

 

473
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,829

all right so if we look at those locking

474
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
all right so if we look at those locking
 

475
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,670
all right so if we look at those locking
repeaters it's off off

476
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
repeaters it's off off
 

477
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,269
repeaters it's off off
off off good if we press one

478
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279

 

479
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,110

again we'll press it twice just so it's

480
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
again we'll press it twice just so it's
 

481
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,030
again we'll press it twice just so it's
less confusing

482
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
less confusing
 

483
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,150
less confusing
it's on off off off good just like the

484
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
it's on off off off good just like the
 

485
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,670
it's on off off off good just like the
pattern should be

486
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
pattern should be
 

487
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,870
pattern should be
uh two should be off on

488
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
uh two should be off on
 

489
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,630
uh two should be off on
off off

490
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640

 

491
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,350

did i not press the twice i don't think

492
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
did i not press the twice i don't think
 

493
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,389
did i not press the twice i don't think
i did

494
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
i did
 

495
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,910
i did
there we go off on off off good

496
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
there we go off on off off good
 

497
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,750
there we go off on off off good
and on on off off

498
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
and on on off off
 

499
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,590
and on on off off
again i didn't press it twice

500
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600

 

501
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,230

on off off and you get the idea so i'm

502
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
on off off and you get the idea so i'm
 

503
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,430
on off off and you get the idea so i'm

hooked up this lever here so we can

526
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
hooked up this lever here so we can
 

527
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,069
hooked up this lever here so we can
request items

528
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
request items
 

529

that lever i had to sneak it through
 

531
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,750
that lever i had to sneak it through
and it connects up to this clock here so

532
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
and it connects up to this clock here so
 

533
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,870
and it connects up to this clock here so
if we follow this

534
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
if we follow this
 

535
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,910
if we follow this
this wire down it will eventually lead

536
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
this wire down it will eventually lead
 

537
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,990
this wire down it will eventually lead
to a single

538
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
to a single

dropper in our nexus storage room that

540
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
dropper in our nexus storage room that
 

541
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,069
dropper in our nexus storage room that
that we're gonna get the item

542
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
that we're gonna get the item
 

543
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,910
that we're gonna get the item
from okay and that's probably going to

544
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
from okay and that's probably going to
 

545
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,509
from okay and that's probably going to
cause quite a bit of lag when we're

546
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
cause quite a bit of lag when we're
 

547
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,350
cause quite a bit of lag when we're
requesting items i'm very curious how

548
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
requesting items i'm very curious how
 

549
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,710
requesting items i'm very curious how
laggy this whole thing is going to be

550
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
laggy this whole thing is going to be
 

551
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,790
laggy this whole thing is going to be
when we get it going here

552
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
when we get it going here
 

553
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,990
when we get it going here

get a little closer
this is where the items come from you

590
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
this is where the items come from you
 

591
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,829
this is where the items come from you
see the droppers over there over there

592
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
see the droppers over there over there
 

593
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,509
see the droppers over there over there
it shoots into the ice goes up in the

594
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
it shoots into the ice goes up in the
 

595
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,430
it shoots into the ice goes up in the
water stream and flows this way

596
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
water stream and flows this way
 

597
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,230
water stream and flows this way
we want to get them all collected to a

598
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
we want to get them all collected to a
 

599
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,509
we want to get them all collected to a
central location

600
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
central location
 

601
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,630
central location
and delivered to us so i'm not really

602
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
and delivered to us so i'm not really
 

603
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,310
and delivered to us so i'm not really
sure

604
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
sure
 

605
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,230
sure
how we're gonna do this yet oh actually

606
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
how we're gonna do this yet oh actually
 

607
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,150
how we're gonna do this yet oh actually
you know what

608
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
you know what
 

609
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,269
you know what
uh oh i have it so

610
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
uh oh i have it so
 

611
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,990
uh oh i have it so
items will fall down here from the input

612
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
items will fall down here from the input
 

613
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,310
items will fall down here from the input
so we can't put ice there it won't be

614
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
so we can't put ice there it won't be
 

615
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,030
so we can't put ice there it won't be
able to do that

616
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
able to do that
 

617
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,710
able to do that
because it falls from that top stream

618
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
because it falls from that top stream
 

619
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,069
because it falls from that top stream
down to here

620
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
down to here
 

621
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,910
down to here
we can't block that way

622
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920

 

623
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,030

wait when i

624
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040

we gotta pick a spot that's open where
 

645
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,710
we gotta pick a spot that's open where
we can just drop an item down so it's

646
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
we can just drop an item down so it's
 

647
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,470
we can just drop an item down so it's
gonna like slide off the edge here and

648
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
gonna like slide off the edge here and
 

649
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,990
gonna like slide off the edge here and
fall down somewhere

650
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
fall down somewhere
 

651
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,310
fall down somewhere
we gotta find somewhere where there's no

we gotta find somewhere where there's no
 

653
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,629
we gotta find somewhere where there's no
redstone wiring

redstone wiring
 

655
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,910
redstone wiring
for each of these

656
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:41,920

 

657
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,550

i don't know not too happy about the
 

843
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,710
i don't know not too happy about the
solid state drive at the moment

844
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
solid state drive at the moment
 

845
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,829
solid state drive at the moment
just because it's filled up and it's

846
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
just because it's filled up and it's
 

847

all right like if there was a big like
 

853
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,310
all right like if there was a big like
four dig movie on it or something

854
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,320
four dig movie on it or something
 

855
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,629
four dig movie on it or something
sure just delete that but it's not that

856
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
sure just delete that but it's not that
 

857
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,110
sure just delete that but it's not that
it's all these little files

858
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
it's all these little files
 

859
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,749
it's all these little files
scattered around okay that's good

860
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
scattered around okay that's good
 

861
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,310
scattered around okay that's good
got two left to do here

862
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,320

 

863
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,269

okay guys so we got all eight of those

864
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
okay guys so we got all eight of those
 

865
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,790
okay guys so we got all eight of those
water streams in place

866
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
water streams in place
 

867
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,350
water streams in place
built in place and now we have to merge

868
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
built in place and now we have to merge
 

869
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,269
built in place and now we have to merge
them together so i'm making the items

870
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279
them together so i'm making the items
 

871
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:55,670
them together so i'm making the items
drop

872
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
drop
 

873
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,949
drop
down here and

874
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959
down here and
 

875
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,030
down here and
water is going to push them all to this

876
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
water is going to push them all to this
 

877
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,590
water is going to push them all to this
central channel

878
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600
central channel
 

879
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,110
central channel
like so let's see let's put another sign

880
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
like so let's see let's put another sign
 

881
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,110
like so let's see let's put another sign
over here

882
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
over here
 

883
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,150
over here
and water further so they're all going

884
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160
and water further so they're all going
 

885
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,230
and water further so they're all going
to meet in the middle now

886
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
to meet in the middle now
 

887
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,350
to meet in the middle now
so we got to run this ice all the way

888
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,360
so we got to run this ice all the way
 

889
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,669
so we got to run this ice all the way
and then in the middle i think this is

890
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679
and then in the middle i think this is
 

891
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,949
and then in the middle i think this is
the middle here yes

892
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
the middle here yes
 

893
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,350
the middle here yes
so at the middle here we're going to

894
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
so at the middle here we're going to
 

895
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,590
so at the middle here we're going to
build an item elevator that will bring

896
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
build an item elevator that will bring
 

897
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,350
build an item elevator that will bring
the items from the nexus up here

898
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
the items from the nexus up here
 

899
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,510
the items from the nexus up here
and where does this where does this go

900
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:31,520
and where does this where does this go
 

901
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,430
and where does this where does this go
on the surface

902
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:33,440
on the surface
 

903
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,710
on the surface
take your guesses

904
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720

 

905
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,669

at the control panel yeah so the items

906
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
at the control panel yeah so the items
 

907
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,310
at the control panel yeah so the items
are gonna pop

908
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
are gonna pop
 

909
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,630
are gonna pop
up through the floor here uh i was

910
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
up through the floor here uh i was
 

911
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,430
up through the floor here uh i was
decide

912
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
decide
 

913
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,190
decide
or i was trying to decide do i want

914
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
or i was trying to decide do i want
 

915
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,270
or i was trying to decide do i want
items to go into a chest or do i want

916
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
items to go into a chest or do i want
 

917
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,230
items to go into a chest or do i want
to pop up out of the ground somewhere

918
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,240
to pop up out of the ground somewhere
 

919
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,590
to pop up out of the ground somewhere
for right now we're going to make them

920
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
for right now we're going to make them
 

921
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,150
for right now we're going to make them
just pop

922
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
just pop
 

923
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,750
just pop
out of the ground the reason we're not

924
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
out of the ground the reason we're not
 

925
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,070
out of the ground the reason we're not
making them

926
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,080
making them
 

927
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,230
making them
go into a chest is because we would have

928
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:58,240
go into a chest is because we would have
 

929
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,549
go into a chest is because we would have
to use hoppers to do that

930
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
to use hoppers to do that
 

931
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,750
to use hoppers to do that
and hoppers have a a speed limit to them

932
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:03,760
and hoppers have a a speed limit to them
 

933
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,350
and hoppers have a a speed limit to them
of one item every

934
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,360

 

935
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,630

four redstone ticks right have i not

936
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
four redstone ticks right have i not
 

937
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,510
four redstone ticks right have i not
lost it i think that's what it is

938
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,520
lost it i think that's what it is
 

939
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,750
lost it i think that's what it is
while our nexus here is gonna have a

940
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
while our nexus here is gonna have a
 

941
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,630
while our nexus here is gonna have a
speed of one item every two redstone

942
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:18,640
speed of one item every two redstone
 

943
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,830
speed of one item every two redstone
ticks

944
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
ticks
 

945
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,430
ticks
so it's not gonna be able to keep up

946
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
so it's not gonna be able to keep up
 

947
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,510
so it's not gonna be able to keep up
which is why i'm sort of leaning away

948
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
which is why i'm sort of leaning away
 

949
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,070
which is why i'm sort of leaning away
from that

950
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
from that
 

951
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,190
from that
right now but we might add it later i'm

952
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,200
right now but we might add it later i'm
 

953
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,789
right now but we might add it later i'm
not sure

954
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
not sure
 

955
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,590
not sure
all right so this is coming along

956
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
all right so this is coming along
 

957
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,669
all right so this is coming along
i'm really trying to hurry here because

958
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679
i'm really trying to hurry here because
 

959
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,150
i'm really trying to hurry here because
i've spent two days on this now

960
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
i've spent two days on this now
 

961

963
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,510
and it's late at night and i
don't know i want i set a goal of

964
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
don't know i want i set a goal of
 

965
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,909
don't know i want i set a goal of
getting the nexus done today

966
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
getting the nexus done today
 

967
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,350
getting the nexus done today
but you know it's also good to have

968
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,360
but you know it's also good to have
 

969
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,549
but you know it's also good to have
reasonable goals i'm going to keep

970
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
reasonable goals i'm going to keep
 

971
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,510
reasonable goals i'm going to keep
trying though

972
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
trying though
 

973
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,270
trying though
we'll see if we can do it guys

974
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280

 

975
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,630

you know what actually you know what the

976
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:54,640
you know what actually you know what the
 

977
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,789
you know what actually you know what the
big thing is that's that's really

978
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:56,799
big thing is that's that's really
 

979
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,190
big thing is that's that's really
making me sad right now that water

980
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
making me sad right now that water
 

981
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,630
making me sad right now that water
that's reversed let's go look at that

982
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
that's reversed let's go look at that
 

983
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,150
that's reversed let's go look at that
for a second

984
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
for a second
 

985
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,750
for a second
because i don't know how to fix it

986
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
because i don't know how to fix it
 

987
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,630
because i don't know how to fix it
without wrecking the wiring

988
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
without wrecking the wiring
 

989
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,909
without wrecking the wiring
let's see this is like the worst thing

990
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
let's see this is like the worst thing
 

991
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,510
let's see this is like the worst thing
i've done

992
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
i've done
 

993
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,750
i've done
all right let's sleep really quick so

994
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
all right let's sleep really quick so
 

995
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,350
all right let's sleep really quick so
when i place the water in here some of

996
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
when i place the water in here some of
 

997
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,029
when i place the water in here some of
them i put reverse

998
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
them i put reverse
 

999
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,110
them i put reverse
for some reason don't ask me why don't

1000
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,120
for some reason don't ask me why don't
 

1001
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,470
for some reason don't ask me why don't
ask me what i was thinking

1002
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480

 

1003
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,150

where's where's an example we saw one

1004
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
where's where's an example we saw one
 

1005
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,549
where's where's an example we saw one
earlier

1006
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
earlier
 

1007
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,070
earlier
um i think that one there was wrong

1008
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
um i think that one there was wrong
 

1009
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,870
um i think that one there was wrong
right

1010
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:30,880
right
 

1011
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,150
right
let's go check that one out if we can

1012
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
let's go check that one out if we can
 

1013
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,990
let's go check that one out if we can
get to it

1014
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
get to it
 

1015
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,029
get to it
so yeah it was this one i took a thing

1016
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
so yeah it was this one i took a thing
 

1017
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,390
so yeah it was this one i took a thing
of water out i don't know how i'm gonna

1018
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
of water out i don't know how i'm gonna
 

1019
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,549
of water out i don't know how i'm gonna
replace this water in here like

1020
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
replace this water in here like
 

1021
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,150
replace this water in here like
we gotta turn all these water streams

1022
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
we gotta turn all these water streams
 

1023
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,669
we gotta turn all these water streams
around so instead of starting

1024
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
around so instead of starting
 

1025
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,230
around so instead of starting
there it's gonna start there and go that

1026
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
there it's gonna start there and go that
 

1027
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,350
there it's gonna start there and go that
way

1028
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,360
way
 

1029
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,990
way
uh but it's sealed up pretty tight in

1030
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
uh but it's sealed up pretty tight in
 

1031
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,909
uh but it's sealed up pretty tight in
there

1032
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919

 

1033
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,830

maybe man i really don't want to wreck

1034
00:19:59,830 --> 00:19:59,840
maybe man i really don't want to wreck
 

1035
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,110
maybe man i really don't want to wreck
anything here

1036
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
anything here
 

1037
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,070
anything here
i think we can do this we'll just take

1038
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,080
i think we can do this we'll just take
 

1039
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,350
i think we can do this we'll just take
out all the middles i'm trying very

1040
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
out all the middles i'm trying very
 

1041
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,310
out all the middles i'm trying very
very carefully here not direct anything

1042
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
very carefully here not direct anything
 

1043
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,789
very carefully here not direct anything
yeah if we do this this will work okay

1044
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
yeah if we do this this will work okay
 

1045
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,990
yeah if we do this this will work okay
i guess that's all i'll have to do it

1046
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
i guess that's all i'll have to do it
 

1047
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,710
i guess that's all i'll have to do it
and then i'll just bust out this one

1048
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
and then i'll just bust out this one
 

1049
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,230
and then i'll just bust out this one
at the sign and then place it in

1050
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
at the sign and then place it in
 

1051
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,430
at the sign and then place it in
and then put the glass back

1052
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
and then put the glass back
 

1053
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,110
and then put the glass back
yeah okay we're good okay so i think we

1054
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
yeah okay we're good okay so i think we
 

1055

1059
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,909
merger all complete here as well let's
try it out

1060
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
try it out
 

1061
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,909
try it out
just to make sure so i'm going to throw

1062
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
just to make sure so i'm going to throw
 

1063
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,110
just to make sure so i'm going to throw
a torch against the wall here

1064
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
a torch against the wall here
 

1065
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,310
a torch against the wall here
just to see what it does yeah it goes up

1066
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
just to see what it does yeah it goes up
 

1067
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,149
just to see what it does yeah it goes up
the item elevator there good

1068
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
the item elevator there good
 

1069
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,990
the item elevator there good
so his middle's a bit a bit weird

1070
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,000
so his middle's a bit a bit weird
 

1071
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,149
so his middle's a bit a bit weird
i wanted to go through here as quick as

1072
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,159
i wanted to go through here as quick as
 

1073
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,190
i wanted to go through here as quick as
possible because

1074
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
possible because
 

1075
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,149
possible because
any hang up is gonna delay how long it

1076
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
any hang up is gonna delay how long it
 

1077
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,470
any hang up is gonna delay how long it
takes us to get our items

1078
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
takes us to get our items
 

1079
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,070
takes us to get our items
see like that that's not so good like it

1080
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
see like that that's not so good like it
 

1081
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,070
see like that that's not so good like it
did you see what it did there it bounced

1082
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,080
did you see what it did there it bounced
 

1083
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,549
did you see what it did there it bounced
two blocks over here like up to here and

1084
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:02,559
two blocks over here like up to here and
 

1085
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,029
two blocks over here like up to here and
then it

1086
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
then it
 

1087
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,549
then it
went back and then i wonder how we could

1088
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:06,559
went back and then i wonder how we could
 

1089
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,590
went back and then i wonder how we could
do this a little bit faster

1090
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
do this a little bit faster
 

1091
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,270
do this a little bit faster
if you have ideas let me know uh we'll

1092
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,280
if you have ideas let me know uh we'll
 

1093
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,549
if you have ideas let me know uh we'll
leave it like that for today though

1094
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
leave it like that for today though
 

1095
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,230
leave it like that for today though
let's let's move on with more important

1096
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
let's let's move on with more important
 

1097
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,430
let's let's move on with more important
things

1098
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
things
 

1099
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,909
things
um might go through all this stuff later

1100
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
um might go through all this stuff later
 

1101
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,029
um might go through all this stuff later
and fine-tune it

1102
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
and fine-tune it
 

1103
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,630
and fine-tune it
i know some redstone could be done a

1104
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:20,640
i know some redstone could be done a
 

1105
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,950
i know some redstone could be done a
little bit more efficiently in places

1106
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:22,960
little bit more efficiently in places
 

1107
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,510
little bit more efficiently in places
that kind of stuff but for now we're

1108
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
that kind of stuff but for now we're
 

1109
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,750
that kind of stuff but for now we're
just trying to get it working

1110
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
just trying to get it working
 

1111
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,750
just trying to get it working
okay and we got the water streams fixed

1112
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
okay and we got the water streams fixed
 

1113
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,789
okay and we got the water streams fixed
that's all good so item delivery is

1114
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
that's all good so item delivery is
 

1115
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,870
that's all good so item delivery is
complete

1116
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
complete
 

1117
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,310
complete
pretty sure let's just double check

1118
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
pretty sure let's just double check
 

1119
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,909
pretty sure let's just double check
let's try

1120
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:41,919

 

1121
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,270

that was a bad throw let's just throw

1122
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
that was a bad throw let's just throw
 

1123
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,630
that was a bad throw let's just throw
um or here let's do it like this let's

1124
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
um or here let's do it like this let's
 

1125
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,630
um or here let's do it like this let's
actually use a dropper i'm gonna put my

1126
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
actually use a dropper i'm gonna put my
 

1127
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,390
actually use a dropper i'm gonna put my
bucket in here and we'll see if it ends

1128
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400
bucket in here and we'll see if it ends
 

1129
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,310
bucket in here and we'll see if it ends
up where it's supposed to go

1130
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
up where it's supposed to go
 

1131
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,190
up where it's supposed to go
when this is triggered so you see the

1132
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
when this is triggered so you see the
 

1133
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,990
when this is triggered so you see the
bucket fly up

1134
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
bucket fly up
 

1135
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,789
bucket fly up
there okay and let's just go see if it's

1136
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
there okay and let's just go see if it's
 

1137
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,149
there okay and let's just go see if it's
by the control panel because that's

1138
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159
by the control panel because that's
 

1139
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,549
by the control panel because that's
where it's supposed to end up

1140
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
where it's supposed to end up
 

1141
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,590
where it's supposed to end up
woohoo parkour let's go sleep

1142
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
woohoo parkour let's go sleep
 

1143

woohoo parkour let's go sleep
and it's not there yet that's quite a

1144
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,080
and it's not there yet that's quite a
 

1145
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,230
and it's not there yet that's quite a
delay if it's not there yet

1146
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,240

 

1147
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,590

probably shouldn't have slept oh it is

1148
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
probably shouldn't have slept oh it is
 

1149

is the item in inputs like if we want to

1160
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:29,039
is the item in inputs like if we want to
 

1161
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:29,990
is the item in inputs like if we want to
drop stuff off

1162
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,000
drop stuff off
 

1163
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,830
drop stuff off
into storage uh we need somewhere to do

1164
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
into storage uh we need somewhere to do
 

1165
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,230
into storage uh we need somewhere to do
that

1166
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,240
that
 

1167
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,470
that
in the control room here there probably

1168
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,480
in the control room here there probably
 

1169
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,390
in the control room here there probably
be several ways of doing it like

1170
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
be several ways of doing it like
 

1171
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,190
be several ways of doing it like
minecarts

1172
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,200
minecarts
 

1173
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,350
minecarts
drop-offs and that kind of stuff from

1174
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,360
drop-offs and that kind of stuff from
 

1175
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,470
drop-offs and that kind of stuff from
farms and

1176
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
farms and
 

1177
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,789
farms and
and and whatever but we'll also want

1178
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:44,799
and and whatever but we'll also want
 

1179
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,870
and and whatever but we'll also want
like manual like hey i got

1180
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880
like manual like hey i got
 

1181
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,029
like manual like hey i got
36 stone bricks i don't want so i'll put

1182
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,039
36 stone bricks i don't want so i'll put
 

1183
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,669
36 stone bricks i don't want so i'll put
them in the chest

1184
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
them in the chest
 

1185
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,990
them in the chest
and we'll use a trap chest so that it'll

1186
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
and we'll use a trap chest so that it'll
 

1187
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,830
and we'll use a trap chest so that it'll
stay in there until we close it

1188
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
stay in there until we close it
 

1189
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,710
stay in there until we close it
in case we change our mind and pick it

1190
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
in case we change our mind and pick it
 

1191
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,190
in case we change our mind and pick it
up

1192
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,200
up
 

1193
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,950
up
so it'll go down with hoppers here

1194
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,960
so it'll go down with hoppers here
 

1195
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,230
so it'll go down with hoppers here
and we want to build i'll pick up that

1196
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,240
and we want to build i'll pick up that
 

1197
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,070
and we want to build i'll pick up that
redstone don't you worry

1198
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,080
redstone don't you worry
 

1199
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,870
redstone don't you worry
we want to build one of these an item

1200
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
we want to build one of these an item
 

1201
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,029
we want to build one of these an item
buffer thing

1202
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:13,039
buffer thing
 

1203
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,789
buffer thing
like this so if there's items in a

1204
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:14,799
like this so if there's items in a
 

1205
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,590
like this so if there's items in a
dropper it'll

1206
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:16,600
dropper it'll
 

1207
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,630
dropper it'll
slowly very slowly shoot them out

1208
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:20,640
slowly very slowly shoot them out
 

1209
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,909
slowly very slowly shoot them out
if you do it too quickly hoppers can

1210
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:23,919
if you do it too quickly hoppers can
 

1211
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,310
if you do it too quickly hoppers can
pick up full stacks of items at a time

1212
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
pick up full stacks of items at a time
 

1213
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,029
pick up full stacks of items at a time
is the thing if you do that if we have

1214
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
is the thing if you do that if we have
 

1215
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,630
is the thing if you do that if we have
items entering our storage

1216
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
items entering our storage
 

1217
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,789
items entering our storage
that quickly it's going to mess up all

1218
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
that quickly it's going to mess up all
 

1219
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,190
that quickly it's going to mess up all
our item filters

1220
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,200
our item filters
 

1221
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,990
our item filters
these things over here so like if we get

1222
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
these things over here so like if we get
 

1223
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,950
these things over here so like if we get
a full stack of oaks wood slabs in here

1224
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
a full stack of oaks wood slabs in here
 

1225
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,549
a full stack of oaks wood slabs in here
then the item filter breaks and

1226
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
then the item filter breaks and
 

1227
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,549
then the item filter breaks and
gg gotta redo them all and i will

1228
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
gg gotta redo them all and i will
 

1229
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,830
gg gotta redo them all and i will
hate myself because that is not a not a

1230
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:53,840
hate myself because that is not a not a
 

1231
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,590
hate myself because that is not a not a
fun thing to redo

1232
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
fun thing to redo
 

1233
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,990
fun thing to redo
so let's build one of these down here

1234
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
so let's build one of these down here
 

1235
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,990
so let's build one of these down here
and

1236
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
and
 

1237
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,510
and
then we also have to connect it up to

1238
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,520
then we also have to connect it up to
 

1239
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,830
then we also have to connect it up to
where is it i think up over here yeah

1240
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:07,840
where is it i think up over here yeah
 

1241
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,590
where is it i think up over here yeah
this is the start of the input so we got

1242
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
this is the start of the input so we got
 

1243
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,510
this is the start of the input so we got
to build like a item elevator to bring

1244
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
to build like a item elevator to bring
 

1245
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,750
to build like a item elevator to bring
items up to this water stream

1246
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:13,760
items up to this water stream
 

1247
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,390
items up to this water stream
and then they'll pass by all the the

1248
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
and then they'll pass by all the the
 

1249
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,470
and then they'll pass by all the the
item filters and go into storage and

1250
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
item filters and go into storage and
 

1251
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,950
item filters and go into storage and
then we pretty much got everything taken

1252
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:20,960
then we pretty much got everything taken
 

1253
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,029
then we pretty much got everything taken
care of here

1254
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,039
care of here
 

1255
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,310
care of here
oh wait a second wait a second

1256
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,320
oh wait a second wait a second
 

1257
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,909
oh wait a second wait a second
let's work on the item elevator right

1258
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:27,919
let's work on the item elevator right
 

1259
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,149
let's work on the item elevator right
now that has to be glass beside here

1260
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:30,159
now that has to be glass beside here
 

1261
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,430
now that has to be glass beside here
this fence can attach

1262
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
this fence can attach
 

1263
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,870
this fence can attach
to the sides right i think that's right

1264
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:34,880
to the sides right i think that's right
 

1265
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,070
to the sides right i think that's right
okay so build this up very good

1266
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,080
okay so build this up very good
 

1267
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,310
okay so build this up very good
so items are going to flow up here and

1268
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320
so items are going to flow up here and
 

1269
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,830
so items are going to flow up here and
we might make adjustments to all this

1270
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:41,840
we might make adjustments to all this
 

1271
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,149
we might make adjustments to all this
stuff

1272
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:42,159
stuff
 

1273
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,669
stuff
later if we find it's in the way of

1274
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
later if we find it's in the way of
 

1275
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,750
later if we find it's in the way of
something but uh

1276
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,760
something but uh
 

1277

chests
 

1283
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,909
chests
that looks good so it made its way down

1284
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:53,919
that looks good so it made its way down
 

1285

the hoppers there and get picked up
 

1287
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,430
the hoppers there and get picked up
somewhere where it belongs

1288
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
somewhere where it belongs
 

1289

and it just shoots it randomly but it
 

1333
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,390
and it just shoots it randomly but it
goes around a bend here so it aligns it

1334
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
goes around a bend here so it aligns it
 

1335
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,710
goes around a bend here so it aligns it

against one of the walls
 

1337
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,190
against one of the walls
over here so it gets put against this

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,350
and remember when we were organizing
this place

1498
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,360
this place
 

1499
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,789

in the game pretty much and i still have
 

1503
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,630
in the game pretty much and i still have
them here in these

1504
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:18,640
them here in these
 

1505
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,750

chests we're going to just pick these up
 

1507
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,789
chests we're going to just pick these up
drop them into the nexus i made a backup

1508
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:24,799
drop them into the nexus i made a backup
 

1509
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,310
drop them into the nexus i made a backup
just in case something

1510
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320
just in case something
 

1511
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,909
just in case something
terrible goes wrong here and i have to

1512
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:27,919
terrible goes wrong here and i have to
 

1513
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,590
terrible goes wrong here and i have to
redo this

1514
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:29,600
redo this
 

1515
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,190
redo this
but uh they should automatically go

1516
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,200
but uh they should automatically go
 

1517
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,350
but uh they should automatically go
where they belong in the nexus

1518
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
where they belong in the nexus
 

1519
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,549
where they belong in the nexus
and then when we request an item

1520
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:38,559
and then when we request an item
 

1521
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,990
and then when we request an item
we can just enter the code

1522
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,000

 

1523
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,870

and whatever item we get we can we can

1524
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
and whatever item we get we can we can
 

1525
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,909
and whatever item we get we can we can
give it that code

1526
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:45,919
give it that code
 

1527
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,029
give it that code
like when we name it in an anvil

1528
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,039
like when we name it in an anvil
 

1529
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,350
like when we name it in an anvil
um and put it in these chests here

1530
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,360

 

1531
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,470

that way everything works out perfect

1532
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,480
that way everything works out perfect
 

1533
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,029
that way everything works out perfect
i don't know we will see how this goes

1534
00:29:59,029 --> 00:29:59,039
i don't know we will see how this goes
 

1535
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,630
i don't know we will see how this goes
let's just drop off a whole bunch of

1536
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
let's just drop off a whole bunch of
 

1537
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,149
let's just drop off a whole bunch of
stuff this is actually going to take

1538
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159
stuff this is actually going to take
 

1539
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,630
stuff this is actually going to take
probably too long to do though today

1540
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:04,640
probably too long to do though today
 

1541
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,470
probably too long to do though today
maybe we'll just do one batch here and

1542
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:06,480
maybe we'll just do one batch here and
 

1543
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,110
maybe we'll just do one batch here and
see if we can request any of them

1544
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,120

 

1545
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,510

all right so that's gonna go for a long

1546
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:13,520
all right so that's gonna go for a long
 

1547
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,430
all right so that's gonna go for a long
time probably

1548
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,440

 

1549
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,710

it's the fences let's see if we can spot

1550
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:20,720
it's the fences let's see if we can spot
 

1551
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,470
it's the fences let's see if we can spot
where they're going in

1552
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:24,480

 

1553
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,789

it's probably not going to happen is it

1554
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:26,799
it's probably not going to happen is it
 

1555
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,710
it's probably not going to happen is it
this place is too big to really

1556
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:28,720
this place is too big to really
 

1557
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,149
this place is too big to really
follow whoa um

1558
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:32,159
follow whoa um
 

1559
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,190
follow whoa um
if i remember right that that stuff

1560
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,200
if i remember right that that stuff
 

1561
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,190
if i remember right that that stuff
ends up over here though a lot of those

1562
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,200
ends up over here though a lot of those
 

1563
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,110
ends up over here though a lot of those
items at least the wood

1564
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,120
items at least the wood
 

1565
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,149
items at least the wood
was on this row so we should eventually

1566
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:42,159
was on this row so we should eventually
 

1567
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,909
was on this row so we should eventually
see the items whiz by here i'm

1568
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:43,919
see the items whiz by here i'm

1571
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,789

but it will probably take a little bit

1572
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:48,799
but it will probably take a little bit
 

1573
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,789
but it will probably take a little bit
of time to get all the way over here

1574
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:50,799
of time to get all the way over here
 

1575
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,230
of time to get all the way over here
i'm not too worried about how long it

1576
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,240
i'm not too worried about how long it
 

1577
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,310
i'm not too worried about how long it
takes items to go into the storage room

1578
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,320
takes items to go into the storage room
 

1579
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,669
takes items to go into the storage room
i'm more concerned with how long it

1580
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679
i'm more concerned with how long it
 

1581
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,350
i'm more concerned with how long it
takes to get them out

1582
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,360
takes to get them out
 

1583
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,750
takes to get them out
when we actually need something we don't

they they might have went into storage
 

1615
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,310
