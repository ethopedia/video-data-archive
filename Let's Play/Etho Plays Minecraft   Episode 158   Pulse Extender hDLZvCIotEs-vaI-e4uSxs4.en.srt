00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:15,759
to the nether here i'm still here
 

11
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,430
to the nether here i'm still here
been doing that stuff i said i was going

12
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
been doing that stuff i said i was going
 

13
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,269
been doing that stuff i said i was going
to last episode

14
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
to last episode
 

15
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,070
to last episode
i converted this side of the blaze farm

16
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
i converted this side of the blaze farm
 

17
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,390
i converted this side of the blaze farm
so it's the same as this one

18
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
so it's the same as this one
 

19
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,870
so it's the same as this one
and i got rid of the pistons blocking

20
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:26,880
and i got rid of the pistons blocking
 

21
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,310
and i got rid of the pistons blocking
the viewing area here

22
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
the viewing area here
 

23
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,669
the viewing area here
looks a lot better now again and it

24
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679
looks a lot better now again and it
 

25
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,830
looks a lot better now again and it
doesn't seem to affect things much like

26
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
doesn't seem to affect things much like
 

27
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,110
doesn't seem to affect things much like
the efficiency it works

28
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
the efficiency it works
 

29
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,389
the efficiency it works
just fine without them so that's good

30
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
just fine without them so that's good
 

31
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,830
just fine without them so that's good
glad i did that um

32
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
glad i did that um
 

33
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,750
glad i did that um
a few people told me just to put glass

34
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:43,760
a few people told me just to put glass
 

35
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,510
a few people told me just to put glass
where i have those pressure plates and

36
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
where i have those pressure plates and
 

37
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,630
where i have those pressure plates and
stuff

38
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
stuff
 

39
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,630
stuff
thing is that is actually spawning space

40
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
thing is that is actually spawning space
 

41
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,950
thing is that is actually spawning space
so we don't want to block that off

42
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
so we don't want to block that off
 

43
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,029
so we don't want to block that off
uh like they said just to do it so

44
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
uh like they said just to do it so
 

45
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,110
uh like they said just to do it so
they'll fall straight down but

46
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
they'll fall straight down but
 

47
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,110
they'll fall straight down but
that is a lot of the area we don't want

48
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
that is a lot of the area we don't want
 

49
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,790
that is a lot of the area we don't want
to lose otherwise we'll get

50
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
to lose otherwise we'll get
 

51
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,590
to lose otherwise we'll get
lower rates from this which we

52
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
lower rates from this which we
 

53
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,189
lower rates from this which we
definitely don't want it's running

54
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
definitely don't want it's running
 

55
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,789
definitely don't want it's running
very quickly with these two going

56
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
very quickly with these two going
 

57
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,030
very quickly with these two going
i am actually losing it probably at

58
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
i am actually losing it probably at
 

59
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,550
i am actually losing it probably at
least half of them though from this

60
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
least half of them though from this
 

61
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,870
least half of them though from this
conveyor belt so we need to add a

62
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
conveyor belt so we need to add a
 

63
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,990
conveyor belt so we need to add a
regulator to it

64
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
regulator to it
 

65
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,590
regulator to it
because they keep suffocating

66
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600

 

67
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,109

and jamming up because there's just too

68
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
and jamming up because there's just too
 

69
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,109
and jamming up because there's just too
many going through

70
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
many going through
 

71
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,390
many going through
at uh uncontrolled times so we need to

72
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
at uh uncontrolled times so we need to
 

73
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,590
at uh uncontrolled times so we need to
either put a clock on it or

74
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
either put a clock on it or
 

75
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,870
either put a clock on it or
some sort of delay system so that

76
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880
some sort of delay system so that
 

77
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,149
some sort of delay system so that
that doesn't happen anyway

78
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
that doesn't happen anyway
 

79
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,789
that doesn't happen anyway
this is the big change here thing i'm

80
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
this is the big change here thing i'm
 

81
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,030
this is the big change here thing i'm
really happy about this is the new

82
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
really happy about this is the new
 

83
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,389
really happy about this is the new
killing and holding area for the blaze

84
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:42,399
killing and holding area for the blaze
 

85
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,030
killing and holding area for the blaze
you can see they swim up here there's

86
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,040
you can see they swim up here there's
 

87
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,789
you can see they swim up here there's
actually a hole open where they could

88
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
actually a hole open where they could
 

89
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,789
actually a hole open where they could
possibly shoot us through here but the

90
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
possibly shoot us through here but the
 

91
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,270
possibly shoot us through here but the
thing is

92
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
thing is
 

93
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,990
thing is
uh there's a little bit of a delay

94
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
uh there's a little bit of a delay
 

95
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,830
uh there's a little bit of a delay
before they can start shooting us

96
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
before they can start shooting us
 

97
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,510
before they can start shooting us
if they see us and they swim up before

98
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
if they see us and they swim up before
 

99
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,190
if they see us and they swim up before
they get the chance so it's not

100
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
they get the chance so it's not
 

101
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,830
they get the chance so it's not
dangerous at all

102
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
dangerous at all
 

103
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,389
dangerous at all
or at least it doesn't seem to be

104
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399

 

105
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,309

i did play around with having like a

106
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
i did play around with having like a
 

107
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,710
i did play around with having like a
faucet style thing here where they would

108
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
faucet style thing here where they would
 

109
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,830
faucet style thing here where they would
swim up

110
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
swim up
 

111
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,910
swim up
go to the left and then fall down into a

112
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
go to the left and then fall down into a
 

113
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,110
go to the left and then fall down into a
second tube with no lava in

114
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
second tube with no lava in
 

115
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,869
second tube with no lava in
that didn't work out so good because

116
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
that didn't work out so good because
 

117
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,110
that didn't work out so good because
they really don't want to move those two

118
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
they really don't want to move those two
 

119
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,710
they really don't want to move those two
blocks over

120
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
blocks over
 

121
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,390
blocks over
all that well and you can't really set

122
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
all that well and you can't really set
 

123
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,070
all that well and you can't really set
up a piston thing to

124
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
up a piston thing to
 

125
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,350
up a piston thing to
force them to either and if i'm getting

126
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
force them to either and if i'm getting
 

127
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,949
force them to either and if i'm getting
low frame rates because there's a lot of

128
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
low frame rates because there's a lot of
 

129
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,390
low frame rates because there's a lot of
them here

130
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
them here
 

131
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,390
them here
they're gathering pretty quick um

132
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
they're gathering pretty quick um
 

133
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,190
they're gathering pretty quick um
yeah but this works really well there's

134
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
yeah but this works really well there's
 

135
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,350
yeah but this works really well there's
basically three pistons to control this

136
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
basically three pistons to control this
 

137
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,750
basically three pistons to control this
thing

138
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
thing
 

139
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,030
thing
we have one down here and then there's

140
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
we have one down here and then there's
 

141
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,910
we have one down here and then there's
uh two together up here um

142
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920

 

143
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,110

yeah this one here is to cut off the

144
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
yeah this one here is to cut off the
 

145
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,309
yeah this one here is to cut off the
lava

146
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
lava
 

147
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,229
lava
so that when we kill the blaze none of

148
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
so that when we kill the blaze none of
 

149
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,350
so that when we kill the blaze none of
their drops will

150
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
their drops will
 

151
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,670
their drops will
get burnt or anything or xp won't get

152
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
get burnt or anything or xp won't get
 

153
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,030
get burnt or anything or xp won't get
burnt from the lava

154
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
burnt from the lava
 

155
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,550
burnt from the lava
that's important this one is the gate

156
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
that's important this one is the gate
 

157
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,949
that's important this one is the gate
it keeps any more blaze from coming up

158
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
it keeps any more blaze from coming up
 

159
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:09,990
it keeps any more blaze from coming up
and it also gives them

160
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
and it also gives them
 

161
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,949
and it also gives them
something to stand on and then this one

162
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
something to stand on and then this one
 

163
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,470
something to stand on and then this one
here is the crusher

164
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
here is the crusher
 

165
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,390
here is the crusher
it does suffocation damage to them

166
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
it does suffocation damage to them
 

167
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,190
it does suffocation damage to them
so i'm thinking i'll have two buttons

168
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
so i'm thinking i'll have two buttons
 

169
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,830
so i'm thinking i'll have two buttons
i'll probably

170
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
i'll probably
 

171
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,430
i'll probably
have one on the right here and one on

172
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
have one on the right here and one on
 

173
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,190
have one on the right here and one on
the left

174
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
the left
 

175
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,070
the left
uh the right button when we press it it

176
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
uh the right button when we press it it
 

177
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,390
uh the right button when we press it it
will

178
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
will
 

179
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,830
will
cause all three of these pistons to go

180
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
cause all three of these pistons to go
 

181
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,589
cause all three of these pistons to go
or to extend

182
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
or to extend
 

183
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,710
or to extend
the same time so this one would close

184
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
the same time so this one would close
 

185
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,229
the same time so this one would close
so i'm going to go down and at the same

186
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
so i'm going to go down and at the same
 

187
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,830
so i'm going to go down and at the same
time this one too

188
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840

 

189
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,350

it would be hooked to a timer this

190
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
it would be hooked to a timer this
 

191
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,750
it would be hooked to a timer this
pressure and after a certain amount of

192
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
pressure and after a certain amount of
 

193
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,070
pressure and after a certain amount of
time

194
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
time
 

195
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,190
time
it will come back up

196
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
it will come back up
 

197
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,350
it will come back up
lava will still be cut off

198
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360

 

199
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,509

and then the idea is to get them down to

200
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:55,519
and then the idea is to get them down to
 

201
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,270
and then the idea is to get them down to
one hit kill here

202
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
one hit kill here
 

203
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,869
one hit kill here
of course i didn't time this right

204
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
of course i didn't time this right
 

205
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,190
of course i didn't time this right
and then i'd be free to kill them all

206
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
and then i'd be free to kill them all
 

207
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,670
and then i'd be free to kill them all
i'd be free to hit them meanwhile we

208
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
i'd be free to hit them meanwhile we
 

209
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,270
i'd be free to hit them meanwhile we
still have more blaze below

210
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
still have more blaze below
 

211
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,830
still have more blaze below
gathering there's a second lava source

212
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840
gathering there's a second lava source
 

213
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,390
gathering there's a second lava source
there

214
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
there
 

215
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,870
there
once i get all my stuff and this is

216
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
once i get all my stuff and this is
 

217
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,990
once i get all my stuff and this is
empty

218
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
empty
 

219
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,590
empty
then i would hit the second button on

220
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
then i would hit the second button on
 

221
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,030
then i would hit the second button on
the left here probably

222
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
the left here probably
 

223
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,749
the left here probably
and that will cause this to reset so

224
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
and that will cause this to reset so
 

225
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,230
and that will cause this to reset so
this piston will come up here let the

226
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
this piston will come up here let the
 

227
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,310
this piston will come up here let the
lava down i have this pressure plate as

228
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
lava down i have this pressure plate as
 

229
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,469
lava down i have this pressure plate as
a safety so that

230
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
a safety so that
 

231
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,950
a safety so that
it won't come pouring out here at the

232
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
it won't come pouring out here at the
 

233
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,150
it won't come pouring out here at the
moment

234
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
moment
 

235
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,710
moment
and then also this one will retract

236
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
and then also this one will retract
 

237
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,710
and then also this one will retract
the new blaze with full health will come

238
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
the new blaze with full health will come
 

239
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,550
the new blaze with full health will come
back up

240
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
back up
 

241
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,909
back up
well they don't actually have full

242
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
well they don't actually have full
 

243
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,070
well they don't actually have full
health they tend to take damage from the

244
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
health they tend to take damage from the
 

245
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,390
health they tend to take damage from the
conveyor belt here

246
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
conveyor belt here
 

247
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,110
conveyor belt here
so we'll be a little bit inconsistent i

248
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
so we'll be a little bit inconsistent i
 

249
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,230
so we'll be a little bit inconsistent i
might have to use stone

250
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
might have to use stone
 

251
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,749
might have to use stone
swords to kill them to make up for that

252
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
swords to kill them to make up for that
 

253
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,110
swords to kill them to make up for that
uh have them as a one-hit kill

254
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
uh have them as a one-hit kill
 

255
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,189
uh have them as a one-hit kill
another thing i'm thinking i'll probably

256
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
another thing i'm thinking i'll probably
 

257
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,230
another thing i'm thinking i'll probably
do is put

258
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
do is put
 

259
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,629
do is put
a dispenser right here maybe

260
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
a dispenser right here maybe
 

261
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,749
a dispenser right here maybe
and uh

262
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
and uh
 

263
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,029
and uh
fill that with uh poison potions poison

264
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
fill that with uh poison potions poison
 

265
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,110
fill that with uh poison potions poison
splash potions and i might use that

266
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
splash potions and i might use that
 

267
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,310
splash potions and i might use that
instead of the crusher at times

268
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
instead of the crusher at times
 

269
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,469
instead of the crusher at times
and that will get them all down to one

270
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
and that will get them all down to one
 

271
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,790
and that will get them all down to one
hit kill

272
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
hit kill
 

273
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,310
hit kill
even if they have inconsistent health

274
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
even if they have inconsistent health
 

275
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,469
even if they have inconsistent health
so i think that'll work out good too as

276
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
so i think that'll work out good too as
 

277
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,830
so i think that'll work out good too as
a second option of killing them

278
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
a second option of killing them
 

279
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,469
a second option of killing them
and yeah it's nice and compact i like it

280
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
and yeah it's nice and compact i like it
 

281
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,710
and yeah it's nice and compact i like it
turned out very well happy with this

282
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
turned out very well happy with this
 

283
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,710
turned out very well happy with this
design

284
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
design
 

285
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,710
design
and it looks pretty cool too one thing

286
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
and it looks pretty cool too one thing
 

287
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,310
and it looks pretty cool too one thing
i'm a little bit concerned about is i

288
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
i'm a little bit concerned about is i
 

289
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,909
i'm a little bit concerned about is i
think some of this light can actually

290
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
think some of this light can actually
 

291
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,469
think some of this light can actually
make it to

292
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
make it to
 

293
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,390
make it to
the this here because it's light level

294
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
the this here because it's light level
 

295
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,070
the this here because it's light level
15 then 13

296
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
15 then 13
 

297
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,629
15 then 13
there 11 9

298
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
there 11 9
 

299
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,870
there 11 9
7 5

300
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880

 

301
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,309

yeah so like light level three

302
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
yeah so like light level three
 

303
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,590
yeah so like light level three
seeps in from that so i might have to

304
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
seeps in from that so i might have to
 

305
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,950
seeps in from that so i might have to
get rid of some of this glass or

306
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
get rid of some of this glass or
 

307
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,749
get rid of some of this glass or
something i don't know

308
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
something i don't know
 

309
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,150
something i don't know
doesn't make a huge difference really

310
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
doesn't make a huge difference really
 

311
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,590
doesn't make a huge difference really
but if i

312
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
but if i
 

313
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,070
but if i
if i want to be perfect about it i might

314
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
if i want to be perfect about it i might
 

315
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,950
if i want to be perfect about it i might
consider doing that too

316
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
consider doing that too
 

317
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,710
consider doing that too
otherwise this is working really well i

318
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
otherwise this is working really well i
 

319
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,390
otherwise this is working really well i
just need to add the regulators on the

320
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
just need to add the regulators on the
 

321
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,390
just need to add the regulators on the
conveyor belts

322
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
conveyor belts
 

323
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,070
conveyor belts
and i don't know if i'll do that this

324
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
and i don't know if i'll do that this
 

325
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,510
and i don't know if i'll do that this
episode i kind of want to go to the

326
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
episode i kind of want to go to the
 

327
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,550
episode i kind of want to go to the
silver

328
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
silver
 

329
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,710
silver
excuse me to the silverfish farm right

330
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
excuse me to the silverfish farm right
 

331
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,270
excuse me to the silverfish farm right
now and finish uh

332
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
now and finish uh
 

333
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,230
now and finish uh
getting that working so i'm gonna do

334
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
getting that working so i'm gonna do
 

335
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,550
getting that working so i'm gonna do
that

336
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
that
 

337
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,510
that
now and i might see there

338
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520

 

339
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,029

all right here we are at the silverfish

340
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
all right here we are at the silverfish
 

341
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,830
all right here we are at the silverfish
again at the stronghold

342
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
again at the stronghold
 

343
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,990
again at the stronghold
and all seems to be working well this

344
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
and all seems to be working well this
 

345
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,749
and all seems to be working well this
thing is glitching up every

346
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
thing is glitching up every
 

347
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,909
thing is glitching up every
so often it's very rare but it does

348
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
so often it's very rare but it does
 

349
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,749
so often it's very rare but it does
happen so we're gonna try

350
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
happen so we're gonna try
 

351
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,830
happen so we're gonna try
uh fix it so it's perfect today

352
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
uh fix it so it's perfect today
 

353
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,070
uh fix it so it's perfect today
uh also with the blaze farm i have tried

354
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
uh also with the blaze farm i have tried
 

355
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,270
uh also with the blaze farm i have tried
logging out when there's

356
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
logging out when there's
 

357
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,150
logging out when there's
over 100 mobs in that too and they don't

358
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
over 100 mobs in that too and they don't
 

359
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,070
over 100 mobs in that too and they don't
glitch through the glass when i log back

360
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
glitch through the glass when i log back
 

361
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,950
glitch through the glass when i log back
in which is uh

362
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
in which is uh
 

363
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,270
in which is uh
really good to know too seems to be log

364
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
really good to know too seems to be log
 

365
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,150
really good to know too seems to be log
out safe

366
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
out safe
 

367
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,390
out safe
is he

368
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400

 

369
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,670

anyway the problem with this is i don't

370
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
anyway the problem with this is i don't
 

371
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,589
anyway the problem with this is i don't
have a long enough delay

372
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
have a long enough delay
 

373
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,710
have a long enough delay
on the piston that goes up here

374
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
on the piston that goes up here
 

375
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,430
on the piston that goes up here
uh it needs to be a little bit longer

376
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
uh it needs to be a little bit longer
 

377
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,870
uh it needs to be a little bit longer
because it just goes up and down

378
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
because it just goes up and down
 

379
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,790
because it just goes up and down
up down real quick it's actually i think

380
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
up down real quick it's actually i think
 

381
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,390
up down real quick it's actually i think
uh what happens is this extends

382
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
uh what happens is this extends
 

383
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,350
uh what happens is this extends
you got one tick pulse there one there

384
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
you got one tick pulse there one there
 

385
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,270
you got one tick pulse there one there
and i think it's just a two

386
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280

 

387
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,430

um what is it

388
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440

 

389
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,710

yeah just a two tick pulse that this

390
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
yeah just a two tick pulse that this
 

391
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,710
yeah just a two tick pulse that this
stays up for this i don't think is

392
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
stays up for this i don't think is
 

393
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,150
stays up for this i don't think is
actually doing anything now that i think

394
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
actually doing anything now that i think
 

395
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,749
actually doing anything now that i think
of it

396
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
of it
 

397
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,390
of it
and i i believe i've tried extending

398
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400
and i i believe i've tried extending
 

399
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,270
and i i believe i've tried extending
this

400
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
this
 

401
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,710
this
let's hope there's some repeaters here

402
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
let's hope there's some repeaters here
 

403
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,070
let's hope there's some repeaters here
we can try it

404
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080

 

405
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,469

i've tried extending that a little bit

406
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
i've tried extending that a little bit
 

407
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,390
i've tried extending that a little bit
longer

408
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
longer
 

409
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,350
longer
down there oh please tell me i didn't

410
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
down there oh please tell me i didn't
 

411
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,670
down there oh please tell me i didn't
take them back

412
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680

 

413
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,029

torches

414
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039

 

415
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:31,029

all right i'm gonna make some

416
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039

 

417
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,870

all right so i think what i tried before

418
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
all right so i think what i tried before
 

419
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,430
all right so i think what i tried before
is i had more of these

420
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
is i had more of these
 

421
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,990
is i had more of these
uh to try extend the pulse longer this

422
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
uh to try extend the pulse longer this
 

423
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,149
uh to try extend the pulse longer this
is like a cheat way of doing it

424
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
is like a cheat way of doing it
 

425
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,990
is like a cheat way of doing it
an easy way of doing it that's usually

426
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
an easy way of doing it that's usually
 

427
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,230
an easy way of doing it that's usually
pretty compact

428
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
pretty compact
 

429
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,310
pretty compact
so that should make it up to four tick

430
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
so that should make it up to four tick
 

431
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,990
so that should make it up to four tick
false there

432
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
false there
 

433
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,150
false there
but i think it was a double extending

434
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
but i think it was a double extending
 

435
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,910
but i think it was a double extending
oh and also glitching out you see how

436
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
oh and also glitching out you see how
 

437
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,750
oh and also glitching out you see how
the block got stuck up there

438
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
the block got stuck up there
 

439
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,150
the block got stuck up there
so that's not really working

440
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160

 

441
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:10,230

so we need to make a proper uh

442
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240

 

443
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,949

oh boy did i bring anything to kill him

444
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
oh boy did i bring anything to kill him
 

445
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,470
oh boy did i bring anything to kill him
no i didn't

446
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480

 

447
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,990

that's great um we need a

448
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
that's great um we need a
 

449
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,430
that's great um we need a
a proper pulse sustainer extender here

450
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
a proper pulse sustainer extender here
 

451
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,670
a proper pulse sustainer extender here
we need it probably at least one second

452
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
we need it probably at least one second
 

453
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,630
we need it probably at least one second
long

454
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
long
 

455
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,790
long
so that's what i'm going to do but first

456
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
so that's what i'm going to do but first
 

457
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,910
so that's what i'm going to do but first
i'm going to go

458
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
i'm going to go
 

459
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,910
i'm going to go
to the end and get some mark speed to

460
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
to the end and get some mark speed to
 

461
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,509
to the end and get some mark speed to
enchant the sword

462
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
enchant the sword
 

463
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,350
enchant the sword
so i'm doing a level 50 enchantment on

464
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
so i'm doing a level 50 enchantment on
 

465
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,190
so i'm doing a level 50 enchantment on
the sword because i mainly want to get

466
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
the sword because i mainly want to get
 

467
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,870
the sword because i mainly want to get
looting 3

468
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
looting 3
 

469
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,949
looting 3
and at level 40 you have a 14.5 percent

470
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
and at level 40 you have a 14.5 percent
 

471
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,870
and at level 40 you have a 14.5 percent
chance of getting looting 3 and at level

472
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880
chance of getting looting 3 and at level
 

473
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,150
chance of getting looting 3 and at level
50.

474
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
50.
 

475
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,190
50.
you have a 25.6 so it's almost

476
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
you have a 25.6 so it's almost
 

477
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,110
you have a 25.6 so it's almost
double the chance of it at level 50

478
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
double the chance of it at level 50
 

479
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,870
double the chance of it at level 50
and it's only about a time and a half

480
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
and it's only about a time and a half
 

481
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,470
and it's only about a time and a half
more xp

482
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
more xp
 

483
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,630
more xp
compared to level 40. so uh overall

484
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
compared to level 40. so uh overall
 

485
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,150
compared to level 40. so uh overall
it works out cheaper if that's what

486
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
it works out cheaper if that's what
 

487
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,750
it works out cheaper if that's what
you're going for so here we go

488
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
you're going for so here we go
 

489
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,829
you're going for so here we go
and i got robbed absolutely robbed

490
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
and i got robbed absolutely robbed
 

491
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,949
and i got robbed absolutely robbed
great

492
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959

 

493
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,949

okay so we are actually in a creative

494
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
okay so we are actually in a creative
 

495
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,350
okay so we are actually in a creative
world right now i was having a problem

496
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
world right now i was having a problem
 

497
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,030
world right now i was having a problem
that i needed to figure out

498
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
that i needed to figure out
 

499
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,949
that i needed to figure out
redstone related and it was a lot easier

500
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
redstone related and it was a lot easier
 

501
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,110
redstone related and it was a lot easier
to figure it out here

502
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
to figure it out here
 

503
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,310
to figure it out here
has to do with these uh pulse sustainers

504
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
has to do with these uh pulse sustainers
 

505
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,190
has to do with these uh pulse sustainers

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
okay so uh a pulse sustainer turns a

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,790
okay so uh a pulse sustainer turns a

on off pulse or
 

541
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,190
on off pulse or
yeah lay a quick on off pulse into a

542
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,200
yeah lay a quick on off pulse into a
 

543
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,150
yeah lay a quick on off pulse into a
long

544
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
long
 

545
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,310

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
that's what it does see how long this
 

549
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,910
that's what it does see how long this
piston stays up for

uh the problem i'm having though with

552
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
uh the problem i'm having though with
 

553
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,389
uh the problem i'm having though with
this

554
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
this
 

555
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,350
this
is after it goes down like that there is

556
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
is after it goes down like that there is
 

557
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,150
is after it goes down like that there is
a

558
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
a
 

559
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,389
a
equally long time where you can't

560
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
equally long time where you can't
 

561
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,670
equally long time where you can't
reactivate this

562
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680

 

563
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,630

so once this goes down if i give it a

564
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
so once this goes down if i give it a
 

565
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,509
so once this goes down if i give it a
quick pulse

566
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
quick pulse
 

567
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,150
quick pulse
it doesn't come back up it's still going

568
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
it doesn't come back up it's still going
 

569
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,550
it doesn't come back up it's still going
has to wait for

570
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
has to wait for
 

571
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,949
has to wait for
the repeaters to become unpowered again

572
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959

 

573
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,069

and that's basically the problem i need

574
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
and that's basically the problem i need
 

575
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,069
and that's basically the problem i need
to figure out and i came up with the

576
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
to figure out and i came up with the
 

577
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,550
to figure out and i came up with the
solution it's actually pretty simple

578
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
solution it's actually pretty simple
 

579
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,710
solution it's actually pretty simple
here's another way of doing it with the

580
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
here's another way of doing it with the
 

581
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,389
here's another way of doing it with the
redstone or a snore latch

582
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
redstone or a snore latch
 

583
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,430
redstone or a snore latch
this is the same thing same problem

584
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
this is the same thing same problem
 

585
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,590
this is the same thing same problem
here's our piston to represent the

586
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
here's our piston to represent the
 

587
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,190
here's our piston to represent the
silverfish because

588
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
silverfish because
 

589
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,430
silverfish because
as soon as this goes down silverfish can

590
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
as soon as this goes down silverfish can
 

591
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,629
as soon as this goes down silverfish can
enter the blocks again

592
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
enter the blocks again
 

593
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,750
enter the blocks again
and it'll send out another pulse almost

594
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
and it'll send out another pulse almost
 

595
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,710
and it'll send out another pulse almost
instantly like within two ticks they'll

596
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
instantly like within two ticks they'll
 

597
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,550
instantly like within two ticks they'll
send out another pulse if that happens

598
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560

 

599
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,509

so it's up down

600
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
so it's up down
 

601
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,269
so it's up down
it doesn't stay up when i do it like

602
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
it doesn't stay up when i do it like
 

603
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,550
it doesn't stay up when i do it like
that because it's still powered

604
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
that because it's still powered
 

605
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,310
that because it's still powered
these repeaters need to become unpowered

606
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
these repeaters need to become unpowered
 

607
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,790
these repeaters need to become unpowered
before it it's resettable

608
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
before it it's resettable
 

609
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,030
before it it's resettable
and if you know like my potion room the

610
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
and if you know like my potion room the
 

611
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,990
and if you know like my potion room the
door for it

612
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
door for it
 

613
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,550
door for it
after it opens and closes there's like a

614
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
after it opens and closes there's like a
 

615
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,590
after it opens and closes there's like a
two second

616
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
two second
 

617
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,150
two second
delay before i can open it again that's

618
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
delay before i can open it again that's
 

619
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,470
delay before i can open it again that's
the same problem i'm having there

620
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
the same problem i'm having there
 

621
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,509
the same problem i'm having there
so that the trick to it

622
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
so that the trick to it
 

623
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,470
so that the trick to it
i found is to create a branch off here

624
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480

 

625
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,710

and connect this to here

626
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
and connect this to here
 

627
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,509
and connect this to here
and now look what happens

628
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519

 

629
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,870

stays up way longer and it you can

630
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
stays up way longer and it you can
 

631
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,190
stays up way longer and it you can
reactivate it pretty much instantly

632
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
reactivate it pretty much instantly
 

633
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,710
reactivate it pretty much instantly
after

634
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
after
 

635
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,470
after
uh so it's actually doubling up the

636
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
uh so it's actually doubling up the
 

637
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,470
uh so it's actually doubling up the
length of the repeaters this way

638
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
length of the repeaters this way
 

639
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,590
length of the repeaters this way
so it's even it's twice as compact

640
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
so it's even it's twice as compact
 

641
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,030
so it's even it's twice as compact
repeater wise

642
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040

 

643
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,110

and yeah it just works really well

644
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
and yeah it just works really well
 

645
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,150
and yeah it just works really well
so if i

646
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
so if i
 

647
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,829
so if i
if i was to make this longer

648
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:33,839
if i was to make this longer
 

649
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,870
if i was to make this longer
than this uh what happens i can't

650
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
than this uh what happens i can't
 

651
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,470
than this uh what happens i can't
remember

652
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480

 

653
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,990

it's fine if you make this longer than

654
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
it's fine if you make this longer than
 

655
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,590
it's fine if you make this longer than
than this so what the time it takes for

656
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
than this so what the time it takes for
 

657
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,310
than this so what the time it takes for
it to reset

658
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
it to reset
 

659
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,670
it to reset
the our snore

660
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:51,680

 

661
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,870

it like creates a clock

662
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880

 

663
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,990

so that's no good so

664
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
so that's no good so
 

665
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,790
so that's no good so
yeah anyway i got it figured out this is

666
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
yeah anyway i got it figured out this is
 

667
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,150
yeah anyway i got it figured out this is
going to be very useful for me in the

668
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
going to be very useful for me in the
 

669
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,670
going to be very useful for me in the
future because i use these pulse

670
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:07,680
future because i use these pulse
 

671
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,990
future because i use these pulse
extenders quite often

672
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000
extenders quite often
 

673
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,910
extenders quite often
and this is a problem i always have and

674
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
and this is a problem i always have and
 

675
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,189
and this is a problem i always have and
this is so much cleaner

676
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199
this is so much cleaner
 

677
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,430
this is so much cleaner
all right back to the real world

678
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,440

 

679
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,509

okay so i've made that change now i got

680
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
okay so i've made that change now i got
 

681
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,110
okay so i've made that change now i got
the pulse extender on

682
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
the pulse extender on
 

683
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,870
the pulse extender on
i haven't tried it yet i just finished

684
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
i haven't tried it yet i just finished
 

685
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,829
i haven't tried it yet i just finished
it i think with that this will be

686
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
it i think with that this will be
 

687
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,310
it i think with that this will be
working perfectly now i hope unless i

688
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
working perfectly now i hope unless i
 

689
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,230
working perfectly now i hope unless i
overlook something

690
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
overlook something
 

691
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,350
overlook something
uh so yeah this wire goes down from

692
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
uh so yeah this wire goes down from
 

693
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,150
uh so yeah this wire goes down from
the bud switch there's basically no

694
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
the bud switch there's basically no
 

695
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,910
the bud switch there's basically no
delay on it

696
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
delay on it
 

697
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,949
delay on it
and that goes right to

698
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
and that goes right to
 

699
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,030
and that goes right to
the piston below the silverfish like it

700
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,040
the piston below the silverfish like it
 

701
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,110
the piston below the silverfish like it
did before

702
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
did before
 

703
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,750
did before
and that happens before the smooth the

704
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
and that happens before the smooth the
 

705
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,269
and that happens before the smooth the
new smooth stone

706
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
new smooth stone
 

707
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,269
new smooth stone
goes to where the silver fish are so it

708
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:53,279
goes to where the silver fish are so it
 

709
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,150
goes to where the silver fish are so it
has to be quicker than that which it is

710
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
has to be quicker than that which it is
 

711
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,949
has to be quicker than that which it is
and then it branches off to our extender

712
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
and then it branches off to our extender
 

713
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,629
and then it branches off to our extender
here

714
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
here
 

715
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,030
here
and i just have um

716
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
and i just have um
 

717
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,110
and i just have um
just eight ticks here which doubles up

718
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
just eight ticks here which doubles up
 

719
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,069
just eight ticks here which doubles up
to being

720
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:09,079
to being
 

721
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:12,310
to being
1.6 seconds plus

722
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:12,320
1.6 seconds plus
 

723
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,509
1.6 seconds plus
these here as well so it should be long

724
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
these here as well so it should be long
 

725
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,069
these here as well so it should be long
enough

726
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
enough
 

727
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,189
enough
be close to two seconds of a delay

728
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
be close to two seconds of a delay
 

729
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,350
be close to two seconds of a delay
don't want it too long there's no point

730
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
don't want it too long there's no point
 

731
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,509
don't want it too long there's no point
it's too long

732
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
it's too long
 

733
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,670
it's too long
i just need to give the cobbles or the

734
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
i just need to give the cobbles or the
 

735
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,150
i just need to give the cobbles or the
smooth stone generator time to make

736
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
smooth stone generator time to make
 

737
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,710
smooth stone generator time to make
new stone basically that's the main

738
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
new stone basically that's the main
 

739
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,150
new stone basically that's the main
that's the slowest thing in all this

740
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
that's the slowest thing in all this
 

741
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,389
that's the slowest thing in all this
that we need to wait for so

742
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
that we need to wait for so
 

743
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,749
that we need to wait for so
oh that's not good

744
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
oh that's not good
 

745
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,030
oh that's not good
what happened

746
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
what happened
 

747
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,230
what happened
all right let's see it goes up

748
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
all right let's see it goes up
 

749
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:53,030
all right let's see it goes up
they're falling through somehow

750
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040

 

751
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,870

always another problem there just might

752
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
always another problem there just might
 

753
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,710
always another problem there just might
be too many in there i guess

754
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720

 

755
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,990

it's like 50.

756
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000

 

757
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,110

it might be jammed it's

758
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
it might be jammed it's
 

759
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,509
it might be jammed it's
jammed man can't win

760
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519

 

761
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,150

it does do what i wanted to though stays

762
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
it does do what i wanted to though stays
 

763
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,509
it does do what i wanted to though stays
up

764
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519

 

765
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,790

oh there's a little hole

766
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
oh there's a little hole
 

767
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,870
oh there's a little hole
here for them

768
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880

 

769
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,590

come on fallen yes

770
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600

 

771
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,069

yeah i don't know

772
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
yeah i don't know
 

773
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,590
yeah i don't know
there's no real way to prevent them from

774
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
there's no real way to prevent them from
 

775
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,790
there's no real way to prevent them from
glitching through blocks

776
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800
glitching through blocks
 

777
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,030
glitching through blocks
and

778
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040

 

779
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,230

hmm i don't know what to do about that

780
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240

 

781
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,389

oh the lag whenever they fall down that

782
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
oh the lag whenever they fall down that
 

783
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,749
oh the lag whenever they fall down that
hole it just lags the game like crazy

784
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
hole it just lags the game like crazy
 

785
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:05,590
hole it just lags the game like crazy
for some reason is working

786
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
for some reason is working
 

787
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,870
for some reason is working
oh where'd you come from

788
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
oh where'd you come from
 

789
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,949
oh where'd you come from
i guess it just can't handle a bunch of

790
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
i guess it just can't handle a bunch of
 

791
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,309
i guess it just can't handle a bunch of
them at once

792
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
them at once
 

793
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,230
them at once
that's its only flaw

794
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,240

 

795
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,669

because they glitch through the blocks

796
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679

 

797
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,110

that's it's doing what i wanted to do oh

798
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
that's it's doing what i wanted to do oh
 

799
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,789
that's it's doing what i wanted to do oh
it's like double extending for some

800
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
it's like double extending for some
 

801
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,590
it's like double extending for some
reason

802
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600

 

803
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,230

yeah you see that i got something wrong

804
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
yeah you see that i got something wrong
 

805
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,710
yeah you see that i got something wrong
here

806
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720

 

807
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,470

okay i'll play with it a bit and i'll

808
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,480
okay i'll play with it a bit and i'll
 

809
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,630
okay i'll play with it a bit and i'll
start recording again

810
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640

 

811
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,710

okay i figured out what was going on i

812
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
okay i figured out what was going on i
 

813
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,029
okay i figured out what was going on i
think uh there's this glitch in the game

814
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
think uh there's this glitch in the game
 

815
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,510
think uh there's this glitch in the game
it's been in for a few patches now where

816
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:49,520
it's been in for a few patches now where
 

817
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,190
it's been in for a few patches now where
redstone torches will just

818
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
redstone torches will just
 

819
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,470
redstone torches will just
burn out and then that's it

820
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
burn out and then that's it
 

821
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,870
burn out and then that's it
you can't fix them you can't if you

822
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
you can't fix them you can't if you
 

823
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,669
you can't fix them you can't if you
replace them they just keep burning out

824
00:17:59,669 --> 00:17:59,679
replace them they just keep burning out
 

825
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,549
replace them they just keep burning out
you can't there's no real adjustment you

826
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
you can't there's no real adjustment you
 

827
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,470
you can't there's no real adjustment you
can make to fix them the only way of

828
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,480
can make to fix them the only way of
 

829
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,470
can make to fix them the only way of
fixing them

830
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
fixing them
 

831
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,430
fixing them
that i know of is to quit the game and

832
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
that i know of is to quit the game and
 

833
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,190
that i know of is to quit the game and
then reload the world and then they

834
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
then reload the world and then they
 

835
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,909
then reload the world and then they
should work again so that's what i did

836
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
should work again so that's what i did
 

837
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,750
should work again so that's what i did
and it seems to

838
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
and it seems to
 

839
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,590
and it seems to
i think this torch was burnt out maybe

840
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
i think this torch was burnt out maybe
 

841
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,710
i think this torch was burnt out maybe
and it seems to work okay now

842
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
and it seems to work okay now
 

843
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,669
and it seems to work okay now
stays up it doesn't double extend

844
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
stays up it doesn't double extend
 

845
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,150
stays up it doesn't double extend
like it was doing before i want to try

846
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,160
like it was doing before i want to try
 

847
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,510
like it was doing before i want to try
uh get rid of these

848
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,520
uh get rid of these
 

849
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,470
uh get rid of these
i don't know if they're actually

850
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
i don't know if they're actually
 

851
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,110
i don't know if they're actually
necessary

852
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120

 

853
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,070

just have wire there oh

854
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
just have wire there oh
 

855
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,909
just have wire there oh
hmm

856
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919

 

857
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,270

hmm i didn't expect that

858
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
hmm i didn't expect that
 

859
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,190
hmm i didn't expect that
okay unless it's

860
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
okay unless it's
 

861
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,630
okay unless it's
glitched out again

862
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640

 

863
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,909

no it's good okay but i think i'm still

864
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
no it's good okay but i think i'm still
 

865
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,950
no it's good okay but i think i'm still
gonna have that problem with the

866
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
gonna have that problem with the
 

867
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,830
gonna have that problem with the
silverfish

868
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
silverfish
 

869
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,390
silverfish
going through the block maybe

870
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
going through the block maybe
 

871
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,190
going through the block maybe
i will uh watch it i'm gonna turn it

872
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,200
i will uh watch it i'm gonna turn it
 

873
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,870
i will uh watch it i'm gonna turn it
back on here and watch it for a little

874
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
back on here and watch it for a little
 

875
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,150
back on here and watch it for a little
bit

876
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160

 

877
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,230

all right i've been sitting here letting

878
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
all right i've been sitting here letting
 

879
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,830
all right i've been sitting here letting
letting them build up and we got

880
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840
letting them build up and we got
 

881
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,230
letting them build up and we got
24 probably 24.

882
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240
24 probably 24.
 

883
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,430
24 probably 24.
uh we're gonna try this again

884
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
uh we're gonna try this again
 

885
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,270
uh we're gonna try this again
and again this is like worst case

886
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
and again this is like worst case
 

887
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,750
and again this is like worst case
scenario that we would have this many

888
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
scenario that we would have this many
 

889
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,909
scenario that we would have this many
uh normally that would never happen

890
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:35,919
uh normally that would never happen
 

891
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,549
uh normally that would never happen
unless for some reason

892
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
unless for some reason
 

893
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,950
unless for some reason
i was within tracking range of them for

894
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
i was within tracking range of them for
 

895
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,630
i was within tracking range of them for
a long period of time

896
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640

 

897
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,750

so this is

898
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760

 

899
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,669

ready there should be a block here

900
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:51,679
ready there should be a block here
 

901
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,789
ready there should be a block here
and i think i should have one

902
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:54,799
and i think i should have one
 

903
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,830
and i think i should have one
okay can i break this

904
00:19:59,830 --> 00:19:59,840

 

905
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,149

i think i should make that a solid block

906
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,159
i think i should make that a solid block
 

907
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,430
i think i should make that a solid block
otherwise they can

908
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
otherwise they can
 

909
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,190
otherwise they can
go through the glass and one there

910
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
go through the glass and one there
 

911
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,149
go through the glass and one there
and let's just hope it works

912
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:12,159

 

913
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,669

see

914
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679

 

915
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,350

so if that happens uh

916
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
so if that happens uh
 

917
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,510
so if that happens uh
at least it kills them

918
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,520
at least it kills them
 

919
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,990
at least it kills them
or hurts them uh they don't glitch

920
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000
or hurts them uh they don't glitch
 

921
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,630
or hurts them uh they don't glitch
through and

922
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
through and
 

923
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,230
through and
come attack me

924
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240

 

925
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,510

i got a few in this pit oh they do go in

926
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
i got a few in this pit oh they do go in
 

927
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,430
i got a few in this pit oh they do go in
i think they entered from underneath the

928
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
i think they entered from underneath the
 

929
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,110
i think they entered from underneath the
cobble

930
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
cobble
 

931
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,310
cobble
possibly i'm gonna put one more here

932
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
possibly i'm gonna put one more here
 

933
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,909
possibly i'm gonna put one more here
if i can this is just a test size doing

934
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
if i can this is just a test size doing
 

935
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:44,950
if i can this is just a test size doing
to see if they can

936
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
to see if they can
 

937
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,549
to see if they can
enter a block from underneath it

938
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
enter a block from underneath it
 

939
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,230
enter a block from underneath it
they're not going to let me put it

940
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240

 

941
00:20:52,240 --> 00:21:01,590

go down there

942
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600

 

943
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,149

i don't know what i'm doing here um

944
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159

 

945
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,990

yeah yeah

946
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
yeah yeah
 

947
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,029
yeah yeah
mess this up

948
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,039

 

949
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,630

oh no don't come out okay there's at

950
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:18,640
oh no don't come out okay there's at
 

951
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,029
oh no don't come out okay there's at
least

952
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
least
 

953
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,549
least
one in there can we get another one good

954
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:22,559
one in there can we get another one good
 

955
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,310
one in there can we get another one good
now if they enter any one of these that

956
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,320
now if they enter any one of these that
 

957
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,830
now if they enter any one of these that
means they can enter a block from

958
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
means they can enter a block from
 

959
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,430
means they can enter a block from
underneath

960
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,440

 

961
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,110

and these guys i don't know what they're

962
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,120
and these guys i don't know what they're
 

963
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:43,270
and these guys i don't know what they're
doing if they're still entering

964
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280

 

965
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:50,070

ah they just keep giving me trouble

966
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,080

 

967
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,590

silverfish okay jammed up again somehow

968
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,600

 

969
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:02,070

don't understand why

970
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,080

 

971
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,909

you would think yet a block pushing into

972
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:03,919
you would think yet a block pushing into
 

973
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:15,990
you would think yet a block pushing into
them would move them but nope

974
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,000

 

975
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,909

yeah it was jammed again i just can't

976
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
yeah it was jammed again i just can't
 

977
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,669
yeah it was jammed again i just can't
because they if they get stuck in that

978
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
because they if they get stuck in that
 

979
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,270
because they if they get stuck in that
block they'll be able to enter

980
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:23,280
block they'll be able to enter
 

981
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,230
block they'll be able to enter
the other one anyway so

982
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,240

 

983
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,750

ah yeah

984
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:33,760

 

985
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,909

a few people have done other ways of

986
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
a few people have done other ways of
 

987
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,870
a few people have done other ways of
doing this too

988
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:38,880

 

989
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,230

zuma that's the way you say his name he

990
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
zuma that's the way you say his name he
 

991
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,270
zuma that's the way you say his name he
created a minecarts uh bottleneck

992
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280

 

993
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,029

to make them hopefully enter one at a

994
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:51,039
to make them hopefully enter one at a
 

995
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,830
to make them hopefully enter one at a
time i think that would jam up too

996
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:52,840
time i think that would jam up too
 

997
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,549
time i think that would jam up too
though

998
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:54,559
though
 

999
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:00,230
though
uh under a heavy load on rare occasions

1000
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
uh under a heavy load on rare occasions
 

1001
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,590
uh under a heavy load on rare occasions
and also jl has did a pretty fancy thing

1002
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:05,600
and also jl has did a pretty fancy thing
 

1003
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,430
and also jl has did a pretty fancy thing
i don't know if his is uh stable i think

1004
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
i don't know if his is uh stable i think
 

1005
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,029
i don't know if his is uh stable i think
he was having trouble too

1006
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:09,039
he was having trouble too
 

1007
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,470
he was having trouble too
i don't know how you could make this

1008
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
i don't know how you could make this
 

1009
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:17,510
i don't know how you could make this
stable if this isn't working

1010
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520

 

1011
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,110

oh well

1012
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,120

 

1013
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,390

i'll think about it for a bit more um

1014
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
i'll think about it for a bit more um
 

1015
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,830
i'll think about it for a bit more um
did they enter oh

1016
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
did they enter oh
 

1017
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,149
did they enter oh
actually they're probably oh they did

1018
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159
actually they're probably oh they did
 

1019
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,830
actually they're probably oh they did
yep

1020
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
