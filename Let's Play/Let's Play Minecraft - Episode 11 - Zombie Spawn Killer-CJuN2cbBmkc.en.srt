the forums that says mobs these spawn
 

41
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,399
the forums that says mobs these spawn

00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:15,209
here to capture them live and then if I
 

91
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,090
here to capture them live and then if I

that too
so if you want it just for the items you

104
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:32,910
so if you want it just for the items you
 

105
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,700
so if you want it just for the items you
should try to kill them as fast as

106
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:34,710
should try to kill them as fast as
 

107
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,480
should try to kill them as fast as
possible

108

possible
 

109
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,140

like that I'll have to think about it a
 

137
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:31,160

up here while exploring up here I found

168
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:33,970
up here while exploring up here I found
 

169
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,760
up here while exploring up here I found
a mob spawner and I left it untouched as

170
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:38,770
a mob spawner and I left it untouched as
 

171
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,230
a mob spawner and I left it untouched as
I wanted to conquer its while recording

172
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:43,240
I wanted to conquer its while recording
 

173
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:57,210
I wanted to conquer its while recording
if I can find it in is it over here nope

174
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,220
if I can find it in is it over here nope
 

175
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:03,960
if I can find it in is it over here nope
right here must've been down and we're

176
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:03,970
right here must've been down and we're
 

177
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,310
right here must've been down and we're
hopefully going to build another type of

178
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:05,320
hopefully going to build another type of
 

179
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:17,310
hopefully going to build another type of
mob trap

180
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:17,320

 

181
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:24,220

hmm I get lost so easy in this game it's

182
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:24,230
hmm I get lost so easy in this game it's
 

183
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:35,350
hmm I get lost so easy in this game it's
unreal okay I think it's around here I

184
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
unreal okay I think it's around here I
 

185
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,090
unreal okay I think it's around here I
think it's in here and this is the way I

186
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:40,100
think it's in here and this is the way I
 

187
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:47,560
think it's in here and this is the way I
found it it was covered in gravel so

188
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:47,570
found it it was covered in gravel so
 

189
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:54,750
found it it was covered in gravel so
this should be very easy hopefully

190
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:54,760

 

191
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:01,480

spooky music there might be some guys

192
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:01,490
spooky music there might be some guys
 

193
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,140
spooky music there might be some guys
here I think it's a zombie one not

194
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,150
here I think it's a zombie one not
 

195
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:27,230
here I think it's a zombie one not
entirely sure that was pretty easy

196
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,240

 

197
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:37,470

[Applause]

00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:37,480

 

199
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,560

alright what did we get

200
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:40,570
alright what did we get
 

201
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:48,420
alright what did we get
redstone nice saddles good stuff and

202
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:48,430
redstone nice saddles good stuff and
 

203
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:57,880
redstone nice saddles good stuff and
alright gunpowder not bad not bad other

204
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:57,890
alright gunpowder not bad not bad other
 

205
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:05,640
alright gunpowder not bad not bad other
buckets you never have too many of those

206
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:05,650

 

207
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:12,010

steel the chests okay so I'm gonna mine

208
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,020
steel the chests okay so I'm gonna mine
 

209
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,720
steel the chests okay so I'm gonna mine
this stuff out and then we'll start

210
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:13,730
this stuff out and then we'll start
 

211
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,320
this stuff out and then we'll start
building a that killer machine for it

212
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,330

 

213
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,030

alright it's all cleaned up now and I

214
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,040
alright it's all cleaned up now and I
 

215
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,320
alright it's all cleaned up now and I
got torches around it so that

216
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,330
got torches around it so that
 

217
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,500
got torches around it so that
nothing will spawn over here while we're

218
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:28,510
nothing will spawn over here while we're
 

219
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,620
nothing will spawn over here while we're
working on it and that actually made it

220
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:31,630
working on it and that actually made it
 

221
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,009
working on it and that actually made it
smaller it was a seven by seven area in

222
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:35,019
smaller it was a seven by seven area in
 

223
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:35,930
smaller it was a seven by seven area in
here before

224
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:35,940
here before
 

225
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:56,370
here before
I've I'm gonna make it five by five and

226
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:56,380
I've I'm gonna make it five by five and
 

227
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,199
I've I'm gonna make it five by five and
the reason for that is so that because

228
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:01,209
the reason for that is so that because
 

229
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,819
the reason for that is so that because
we're gonna use this is going to be a

230
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:02,829
we're gonna use this is going to be a
 

231
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:06,210
we're gonna use this is going to be a
drowning trap and we're gonna use water

232
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:06,220
drowning trap and we're gonna use water
 

233
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,170
drowning trap and we're gonna use water
to siphon all the zombies to this point

234
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:10,180
to siphon all the zombies to this point
 

235
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:17,420
to siphon all the zombies to this point
here and this is actually the simplest

236
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,430
here and this is actually the simplest
 

237
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,960
here and this is actually the simplest
way of doing this I've come across it's

238
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:21,970
way of doing this I've come across it's
 

239
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,449
way of doing this I've come across it's
my own design but most of the designs

240
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:27,459
my own design but most of the designs
 

241
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,420
my own design but most of the designs
are pretty pretty similar

242
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:29,430
are pretty pretty similar
 

243
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,949
are pretty pretty similar
they'll either they'll either use lava

244
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:31,959
they'll either they'll either use lava
 

245
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:39,120
they'll either they'll either use lava
or fire or cactus or drowning and this

246
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,130
or fire or cactus or drowning and this
 

247
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:53,010
or fire or cactus or drowning and this
one uses water

248
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,020

 

249
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,070

okay so we got our walls around we're

250
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,080
okay so we got our walls around we're
 

251
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:21,070
okay so we got our walls around we're
gonna put a three high ceiling okay and

252
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:21,080
gonna put a three high ceiling okay and
 

253
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,710
gonna put a three high ceiling okay and
then for this front hearts I like to

254
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
then for this front hearts I like to
 

255
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,350
then for this front hearts I like to
have a two high ceiling so that they

256
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
have a two high ceiling so that they
 

257
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:55,890
have a two high ceiling so that they
can't jump around

258
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:55,900

 

259
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,890

so yeah this this is a good one to do

260
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:58,900
so yeah this this is a good one to do
 

261
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,480
so yeah this this is a good one to do
because you pretty much don't need

262
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:01,490
because you pretty much don't need
 

263
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,050
because you pretty much don't need
anything for it except water and a

264
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,060
anything for it except water and a
 

265
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,990
anything for it except water and a
pressure plate and we're gonna build out

266
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,000
pressure plate and we're gonna build out
 

267
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:23,920
pressure plate and we're gonna build out
a glass so that you guys can see it yep

268
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:23,930
a glass so that you guys can see it yep
 

269
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:30,840
a glass so that you guys can see it yep
and oh you know what I need more water

270
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:30,850
and oh you know what I need more water
 

271
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:38,500
and oh you know what I need more water
meet three buckets of water and guess

272
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:38,510
meet three buckets of water and guess
 

273
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:48,940
meet three buckets of water and guess
what we just got another budget

274
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:48,950

 

275
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:58,629

okay so when one zombie spawned the

276
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
okay so when one zombie spawned the
 

277
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,819
okay so when one zombie spawned the
waters gonna push it him here onto this

278
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:00,829
waters gonna push it him here onto this
 

279
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:03,699
waters gonna push it him here onto this
pressure plate and he's gonna stop he

280
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:03,709
pressure plate and he's gonna stop he
 

281
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:06,490
pressure plate and he's gonna stop he
won't move at all and then when a second

282
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:06,500
won't move at all and then when a second
 

283
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,860
won't move at all and then when a second
one spawns its gonna get pushed here and

284
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:08,870
one spawns its gonna get pushed here and
 

285
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,750
one spawns its gonna get pushed here and
it's gonna push the first zombie over

286
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:10,760
it's gonna push the first zombie over
 

287
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:19,990
it's gonna push the first zombie over
one square by force and we're gonna dig

288
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
one square by force and we're gonna dig
 

289
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:31,150
one square by force and we're gonna dig
down its reefs where's and let's see

290
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,160
down its reefs where's and let's see
 

291
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:42,970
down its reefs where's and let's see
here this is where the items are gonna

292
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:42,980
here this is where the items are gonna
 

293
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:54,910
here this is where the items are gonna
are going to come out okay so we're

294
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:54,920
are going to come out okay so we're
 

295
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,900
are going to come out okay so we're
gonna put up blocks here and since

296
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:01,910
gonna put up blocks here and since
 

297
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,780
gonna put up blocks here and since
there's blocks all around this this

298
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:03,790
there's blocks all around this this
 

299
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,130
there's blocks all around this this
empty space here we can place water

300
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:06,140
empty space here we can place water
 

301
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:16,730
empty space here we can place water
inside and it falls down

302
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:16,740

 

303
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,680

and that's pretty much all there is to

304
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:19,690
and that's pretty much all there is to
 

305
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,830
and that's pretty much all there is to
it so they're gonna fall into this hole

306
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:22,840
it so they're gonna fall into this hole
 

307
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,810
it so they're gonna fall into this hole
and then they're gonna get stuck and

308
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:24,820
and then they're gonna get stuck and
 

309
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,020
and then they're gonna get stuck and
drown and up to two can drown at once

310
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,030
drown and up to two can drown at once
 

311
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:33,090
drown and up to two can drown at once
which is all you need is the only spawn

312
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:33,100
which is all you need is the only spawn
 

313
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,500
which is all you need is the only spawn
so fast and when you get it all set up

314
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,510
so fast and when you get it all set up
 

315
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:45,680
so fast and when you get it all set up
just knock out the lights lock this up

316
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:45,690

 

317
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:55,070

and it's all done you fell in there

318
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:55,080
and it's all done you fell in there
 

319
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,090
and it's all done you fell in there
after a few seconds they'll start

320
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,100
after a few seconds they'll start
 

321
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:03,660
after a few seconds they'll start
drowning and you want to completely dark

322
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:03,670
drowning and you want to completely dark
 

323
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:22,200
drowning and you want to completely dark
in there and there's his feather super

324
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,210
in there and there's his feather super
 

325
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,950
in there and there's his feather super
simple and build this early up in the

326

you do this in the right order I could

404
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:52,420
you do this in the right order I could
 

405
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:58,980
you do this in the right order I could
do that all day I'm gonna place blocks

406
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:58,990
do that all day I'm gonna place blocks
 

407
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:11,820
do that all day I'm gonna place blocks
over top and I think we're gonna place

408
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:11,830
over top and I think we're gonna place
 

409
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:19,899
over top and I think we're gonna place
watering and someone suggested I should

410
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:19,909

 

411
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:33,909

oh it's nighttime already I think you

412
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919
oh it's nighttime already I think you
 

413
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,609
oh it's nighttime already I think you
got a place in every block because it's

414
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:36,619
got a place in every block because it's
 

415
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:42,099
got a place in every block because it's
floating water seems to behave

416
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:42,109
floating water seems to behave
 

417
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:53,949
floating water seems to behave
differently good

418
00:22:53,949 --> 00:22:53,959
differently good
 

419
00:22:53,959 --> 00:23:03,539
differently good
so someone goes in they'll get drowned

420
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:03,549

 

421
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,649

and I don't think they can just walk

422
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:05,659
and I don't think they can just walk
 

423
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:14,939
and I don't think they can just walk
next door this is the time yay

424
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:14,949
next door this is the time yay
 

425
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:17,709
next door this is the time yay
so one other thing I wanted to try I

426
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:17,719
so one other thing I wanted to try I
 

427
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:23,430
so one other thing I wanted to try I
brought some buttons with me and a lever

428
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440

 

429
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,479

let's see what happens if you attach

430
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:25,489
let's see what happens if you attach
 

431
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:36,600
let's see what happens if you attach
them

432
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:36,610

 

433
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:43,270

that doesn't do much and I brought some

434
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,280

438
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:00,200
thought maybe they don't all close at
 

439
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:12,280
thought maybe they don't all close at
once but it's not linked it is unhard

440
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,290
once but it's not linked it is unhard
 

441

446
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:37,869

 

447
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:43,959

that's not gonna work you there she want
 

449
00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:45,219
that's not gonna work you there she want
them all to be late so you have to run

450
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:45,229
them all to be late so you have to run
 

451
00:24:45,229 --> 00:25:08,229
them all to be late so you have to run
wires underneath the pads and probably

452
00:25:08,229 --> 00:25:08,239
wires underneath the pads and probably
 

453
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:38,859
wires underneath the pads and probably
the same problem on Savi okay well

454
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:38,869
the same problem on Savi okay well
 

455
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:42,909
the same problem on Savi okay well

456
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:42,919
that's all I wanted to see I might try
 

457
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,269
that's all I wanted to see I might try
