121
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,190

so to get the chain reaction to happen

122
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
so to get the chain reaction to happen
 

123
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,350
so to get the chain reaction to happen
we are going to have to hit them

124
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360

 

125
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,190

a few times to really get them out

126
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200

 

127
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,789

it comes really easy when they're piled

128
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
it comes really easy when they're piled
 

129
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,949
it comes really easy when they're piled
like this as far as

130
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
like this as far as
 

131
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,309
like this as far as
how i'm going to set up a killing room

132
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
how i'm going to set up a killing room
 

133
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,070
how i'm going to set up a killing room
and all that is going to work i'm not

134
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
and all that is going to work i'm not
 

135
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,350
and all that is going to work i'm not
quite sure yet

136
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360

 

137
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,789

i'm guessing i'm going to be dropping

138
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
i'm guessing i'm going to be dropping
 

139
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,710
i'm guessing i'm going to be dropping
them so they're

140
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
them so they're
 

141
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,110
them so they're
only got two punches on them maybe

142
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
only got two punches on them maybe
 

143
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,310
only got two punches on them maybe
so that every time you hit them it will

144
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
so that every time you hit them it will
 

145
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,909
so that every time you hit them it will
cause them to spawn and then

146
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
cause them to spawn and then
 

147
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,909
cause them to spawn and then
one more hit will kill them i think that

148
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
one more hit will kill them i think that
 

149
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,909
one more hit will kill them i think that
would be the possibly the best way of

150
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
would be the possibly the best way of
 

151
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,550
would be the possibly the best way of
doing it

152
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,390

definitely gonna have to set up a good
chill

180
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
chill
 

181
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,670
chill
a good uh killing room for these guys

182
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
a good uh killing room for these guys
 

183
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,189
a good uh killing room for these guys
because this doesn't work

184
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
because this doesn't work
 

185
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:23,029
because this doesn't work
just like this

186
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039

 

187
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,189

and all right um

188
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
and all right um
 

189
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,350
and all right um
just give me a minute to clean up here

190
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360

 

191
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,029

all right it's time for enchantment

192
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
all right it's time for enchantment
 

193
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,510
all right it's time for enchantment
break i needed a new shovel

194
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
break i needed a new shovel
 

195
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,110
break i needed a new shovel
and i'm going to be doing a little

196
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
and i'm going to be doing a little
 

197
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,189
and i'm going to be doing a little
experiment here usually i go for

198
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
experiment here usually i go for
 

199
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,230
experiment here usually i go for
level 50 whenever i enchant the tool

200
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
level 50 whenever i enchant the tool
 

201
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,830
level 50 whenever i enchant the tool
uh i'm going to try level 41.42

202
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
uh i'm going to try level 41.42
 

203
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,230
uh i'm going to try level 41.42
for a little while and see how how that

204
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
for a little while and see how how that
 

205
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,629
for a little while and see how how that
works out for me

206
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
works out for me
 

207
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,430
works out for me
efficiency four okay so that's not

208
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
efficiency four okay so that's not
 

209
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:53,990
efficiency four okay so that's not
that's not

210
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
that's not
 

211
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,070
that's not
terrible uh because i find efficiency

212
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
terrible uh because i find efficiency
 

213
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,710
terrible uh because i find efficiency
five

214
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
five
 

215
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,150
five
doesn't really work a whole lot better

216
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
doesn't really work a whole lot better
 

217
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,430
doesn't really work a whole lot better
for me as far as speed goes it's

218
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
for me as far as speed goes it's
 

219
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,309
for me as far as speed goes it's
uh it's pretty much or pretty similar

220
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
uh it's pretty much or pretty similar
 

221
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,390
uh it's pretty much or pretty similar
anyway usually when i'm mining

222
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
anyway usually when i'm mining
 

223
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,990
anyway usually when i'm mining
i do the quick mining trick anyway and

224
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
i do the quick mining trick anyway and
 

225
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,070
i do the quick mining trick anyway and
having efficiency 5 doesn't make that

226
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
having efficiency 5 doesn't make that
 

227
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,830
having efficiency 5 doesn't make that
any quicker

228
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840

 

229
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,590

so seems like it would be better just to

230
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600
so seems like it would be better just to
 

231
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,550
so seems like it would be better just to
go for lower level enchantments because

232
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
go for lower level enchantments because
 

233
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,830
go for lower level enchantments because
going like from level 40 to compared to

234
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
going like from level 40 to compared to
 

235
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,309
going like from level 40 to compared to
level

236
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
level
 

237
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,070
level
50 level 50s a time and a half

238
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
50 level 50s a time and a half
 

239
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,749
50 level 50s a time and a half
over a time and a half more experience

240
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
over a time and a half more experience
 

241
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,830
over a time and a half more experience
than level 40.

242
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
than level 40.
 

243
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,070
than level 40.
so it's a big difference

244
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
so it's a big difference
 

245
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,110
so it's a big difference
anyway let's head back to the silverfish

246
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120

 

247
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,710

okay so we're going to be doing a little

248
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
okay so we're going to be doing a little
 

249
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,469
okay so we're going to be doing a little
bit more experimenting with these

250
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
bit more experimenting with these
 

251
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,430
bit more experimenting with these
silverfish

252
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
silverfish
 

253
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,710
silverfish
and the machine here and their behavior

254
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
and the machine here and their behavior
 

255
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,070
and the machine here and their behavior
and stuff like that um

256
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
and stuff like that um
 

257
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,309
and stuff like that um
i do also want to point out i said that

258
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
i do also want to point out i said that
 

259
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,230
i do also want to point out i said that
they can't enter

260
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
they can't enter
 

261
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,390
they can't enter
cracked stone brick and mossy ones last

262
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
cracked stone brick and mossy ones last
 

263
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,629
cracked stone brick and mossy ones last
episode apparently they can

264
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
episode apparently they can
 

265
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,629
episode apparently they can
a lot of you have commented and even

266
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
a lot of you have commented and even
 

267
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,230
a lot of you have commented and even
shown me that they can

268
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
shown me that they can
 

269
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,589
shown me that they can
but when they do they turn the block to

270
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
but when they do they turn the block to
 

271
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,110
but when they do they turn the block to
the regular

272
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
the regular
 

273
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,629
the regular
stone brick texture look so keep that in

274
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
stone brick texture look so keep that in
 

275
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,469
stone brick texture look so keep that in
mind sorry about that mistake

276
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
mind sorry about that mistake
 

277
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,110
mind sorry about that mistake
and also they can do it with the circle

278
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
and also they can do it with the circle
 

279
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,350
and also they can do it with the circle
stone bricks that aren't in the game yet

280
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
stone bricks that aren't in the game yet
 

281
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,830
stone bricks that aren't in the game yet
as well um as far as this machine goes

282
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
as well um as far as this machine goes
 

283
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,029
as well um as far as this machine goes
it's actually working pretty good at the

284
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
it's actually working pretty good at the
 

285
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:31,830
it's actually working pretty good at the
moment

286
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
moment
 

287
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,350
moment
better than i was expecting it to i just

288
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
better than i was expecting it to i just
 

289
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,270
better than i was expecting it to i just
after last episode i hooked it up to

290
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
after last episode i hooked it up to
 

291
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,990
after last episode i hooked it up to
that piston i put underneath them

292
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
that piston i put underneath them
 

293
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,189
that piston i put underneath them
and it seems to be controlling them

294
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
and it seems to be controlling them
 

295
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,070
and it seems to be controlling them
like they can't they don't seem to be

296
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
like they can't they don't seem to be
 

297
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,550
like they can't they don't seem to be
beating

298
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
beating
 

299
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,430
beating
the bud switch like they were doing

300
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
the bud switch like they were doing
 

301
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,710
the bud switch like they were doing
before

302
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
before
 

303

the only thing that's not keeping up now

304
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
the only thing that's not keeping up now
 

305
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,070
the only thing that's not keeping up now
is the cobblestone

306
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
is the cobblestone
 

307
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,589
is the cobblestone
or smooth stone generator so

308
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
or smooth stone generator so
 

309
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,110
or smooth stone generator so
we'll have to tweak this a little bit

310
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
we'll have to tweak this a little bit
 

311
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,390
we'll have to tweak this a little bit
yet we either need to add a delay on the

312
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
yet we either need to add a delay on the
 

313
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,589
yet we either need to add a delay on the
cobblestone generator or make it quicker

314
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
cobblestone generator or make it quicker
 

315
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,909
cobblestone generator or make it quicker
or else uh make it so these guys won't

316
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
or else uh make it so these guys won't
 

317
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,790
or else uh make it so these guys won't
ever group

318
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
ever group
 

319
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,869
ever group
like they're doing right there because

320
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
like they're doing right there because
 

321
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,469
like they're doing right there because
that's what causes

322
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
that's what causes
 

323
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,150
that's what causes
it causes this thing to jam

324
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
it causes this thing to jam
 

325
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,270
it causes this thing to jam
if you want to check if your silverfish

326
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
if you want to check if your silverfish
 

327
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,029
if you want to check if your silverfish
factory is foolproof

328
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
factory is foolproof

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,830
factory is foolproof
get a bunch of them in that spot like

330
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840
get a bunch of them in that spot like
 

331
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,550
get a bunch of them in that spot like
that

332
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,560
that
 

333
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,629
that
then walk a little bit away and see if

334
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
then walk a little bit away and see if
 

335
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,309
then walk a little bit away and see if
it jams up mine

336
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
it jams up mine
 

337
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,350
it jams up mine
will hear for sure but i think it's

338
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
will hear for sure but i think it's
 

339
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,589
will hear for sure but i think it's
because of the

340
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
because of the
 

341
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,350
because of the
generator being too slow and not

342
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
generator being too slow and not
 

343
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,790
generator being too slow and not
actually the detector

344
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
actually the detector
 

345
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,509
actually the detector
which is good let's try it out

346
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519

 

347
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,509

yeah yeah oh no

348
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519

 

349
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,030

that silver fish got through because i'm

350
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
that silver fish got through because i'm
 

351
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,030
that silver fish got through because i'm
just in a block down there

352
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040

 

353
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,630

no it's still going

354
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640

 

355
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,790

i wonder if they're seeing me or

356
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
i wonder if they're seeing me or
 

357
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,230
i wonder if they're seeing me or
something these guys

358
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
something these guys
 

359
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,670
something these guys
this guy needs to get a life i can't hit

360
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
this guy needs to get a life i can't hit
 

361
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,190
this guy needs to get a life i can't hit
them or else uh

362
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
them or else uh
 

363
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,990
them or else uh
yeah you see the lava back there that's

364
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
yeah you see the lava back there that's
 

365
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,630
yeah you see the lava back there that's
because it's

366
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
because it's
 

367
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,630
because it's
messed up or at least one side did

368
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640

 

369
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,269

actually it still might be okay

370
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
actually it still might be okay
 

371
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,269
actually it still might be okay
i'll get lost

372
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279

 

373
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,430

nope um

374
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440

 

375
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,990

fish okay it's jam there's ever a silver

376
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
fish okay it's jam there's ever a silver
 

377
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,710
fish okay it's jam there's ever a silver
fish

378
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
fish
 

379
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,310
fish
uh where they're supposed to be where

380
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
uh where they're supposed to be where
 

381
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,949
uh where they're supposed to be where
they're supposed to go then it's jammed

382
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
they're supposed to go then it's jammed
 

383
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,790
they're supposed to go then it's jammed
so i i don't know if it was this that

384
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
so i i don't know if it was this that
 

385
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,630
so i i don't know if it was this that
jammed or the detector

386
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
jammed or the detector
 

387
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,590
jammed or the detector
but it almost seems like it's the

388
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
but it almost seems like it's the
 

389
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,030
but it almost seems like it's the
generator

390
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040

 

391
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,829

but anyway uh we're gonna try to

392
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
but anyway uh we're gonna try to
 

393
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,670
but anyway uh we're gonna try to
regulate it so that they

394
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
regulate it so that they
 

395
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,590
regulate it so that they
when they spawn they actually go down

396
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
when they spawn they actually go down
 

397
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,590
when they spawn they actually go down
there instead of like having

398
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
there instead of like having
 

399
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,310
there instead of like having
20 or 30 of them stuck in this water i'm

400
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
20 or 30 of them stuck in this water i'm
 

401
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,590
20 or 30 of them stuck in this water i'm
gonna

402
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
gonna
 

403
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,949
gonna
experiment with that a little bit today

404
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
experiment with that a little bit today
 

405
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,630
experiment with that a little bit today
because they spawn a lot slower than

406
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
because they spawn a lot slower than
 

407
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,310
because they spawn a lot slower than
this machine can actually work

408
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
this machine can actually work
 

409
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,069
this machine can actually work
so there's no reason it should jam on us

410
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
so there's no reason it should jam on us
 

411
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,750
so there's no reason it should jam on us
and i also replaced this room with soil

412
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
and i also replaced this room with soil
 

413
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,190
and i also replaced this room with soil
are you still following me

414
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200

 

415
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,110

so hopefully uh they don't make a big

416
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
so hopefully uh they don't make a big
 

417
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,069
so hopefully uh they don't make a big
mess like they did before

418
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
mess like they did before
 

419
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,829
mess like they did before
and i was going to show you how this

420
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839
and i was going to show you how this
 

421
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,870
and i was going to show you how this
works uh

422
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
works uh
 

423
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,550
works uh
this is a group smart piston type thing

424
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560

 

425
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,870

um what you do you just put a torch

426
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
um what you do you just put a torch
 

427
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,990
um what you do you just put a torch
underneath

428
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
underneath
 

429
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,110
underneath
the very last one it pushes to and that

430
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
the very last one it pushes to and that
 

431
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,190
the very last one it pushes to and that
will power this wire

432
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
will power this wire
 

433
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,389
will power this wire
and then it goes up to all the pistons

434
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
and then it goes up to all the pistons
 

435
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,910
and then it goes up to all the pistons
all along there

436
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
all along there
 

437
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,310
all along there
but you you should put in this repeater

438
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
but you you should put in this repeater
 

439
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,110
but you you should put in this repeater
even though it's not

440
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
even though it's not
 

441
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,790
even though it's not
technically technically necessary

442
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
technically technically necessary
 

443
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,750
technically technically necessary
i find sometimes this first piston will

444
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
i find sometimes this first piston will
 

445
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,470
i find sometimes this first piston will
fire but

446
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
fire but
 

447
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,030
fire but
all the other ones don't for some reason

448
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
all the other ones don't for some reason
 

449
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,150
all the other ones don't for some reason
if if there's no

450
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
if if there's no
 

451
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,030
if if there's no
uh repeater it seems to force the

452
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
uh repeater it seems to force the
 

453
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,150
uh repeater it seems to force the
current to stay on

454
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
current to stay on
 

455
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,310
current to stay on
a tad longer maybe possibly

456
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
a tad longer maybe possibly
 

457
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,509
a tad longer maybe possibly
and uh when when a block

458
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
and uh when when a block
 

459
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,350
and uh when when a block
gets this last one then they all extend

460
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
gets this last one then they all extend
 

461
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,350
gets this last one then they all extend
like that and it's ready for another 12

462
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
like that and it's ready for another 12
 

463
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,509
like that and it's ready for another 12
so

464
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
so
 

465
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,069
so
it is possible to use a piston to push

466
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
it is possible to use a piston to push
 

467
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,670
it is possible to use a piston to push
up to 12 blocks

468
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
up to 12 blocks
 

469
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,069
up to 12 blocks
so every piston can move 12 blocks so if

470
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
so every piston can move 12 blocks so if
 

471
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,590
so every piston can move 12 blocks so if
you're

472
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
you're
 

473
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,949
you're
if you got to figure out how many blocks

474
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
if you got to figure out how many blocks
 

475
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,790
if you got to figure out how many blocks
you need to move just divide that by 12

476
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
you need to move just divide that by 12
 

477
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,550
you need to move just divide that by 12
and that's how many pistons you need to

478
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:38,560
and that's how many pistons you need to
 

479
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,910
and that's how many pistons you need to
do it

480
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
do it
 

481
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,710
do it
at best

482
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720

 

483
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,949

all right so this piston here this one

484
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
all right so this piston here this one
 

485
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,389
all right so this piston here this one
below

486
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
below
 

487
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,790
below
where they all gather that's just hooked

488
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
where they all gather that's just hooked
 

489
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,829
where they all gather that's just hooked
up to

490
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
up to
 

491
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,629
up to
over here on the bud switch

492
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
over here on the bud switch
 

493
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,150
over here on the bud switch
uh it branches off to the generator

494
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
uh it branches off to the generator
 

495
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,710
uh it branches off to the generator
there and

496
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
there and
 

497
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,350
there and
also goes down low

498
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360

 

499
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,110

to here comes down

500
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
to here comes down
 

501
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,150
to here comes down
got to go into these two repeaters just

502
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
got to go into these two repeaters just
 

503
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,509
got to go into these two repeaters just
to try

504
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
to try
 

505
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,590
to try
stabilize this redstone wire and also

506
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
stabilize this redstone wire and also
 

507
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,790
stabilize this redstone wire and also
i think it might extend it hopefully

508
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
i think it might extend it hopefully
 

509
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,629
i think it might extend it hopefully
kind of like a cheap way of doing it

510
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
kind of like a cheap way of doing it
 

511
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,790
kind of like a cheap way of doing it
real simple

512
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
real simple
 

513
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,790
real simple
um again i'm going to back away here and

514
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
um again i'm going to back away here and
 

515
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,069
um again i'm going to back away here and
see if it jams

516
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
see if it jams
 

517
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,110
see if it jams
or how it jams

518
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
or how it jams
 

519
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,509
or how it jams
yeah so generator could not keep up

520
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
yeah so generator could not keep up
 

521
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,030
yeah so generator could not keep up
one thing i could do is put

522
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
one thing i could do is put
 

523
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,389
one thing i could do is put
a bud switch next to this lava

524
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
a bud switch next to this lava
 

525
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,990
a bud switch next to this lava
so that if the lab was to make it all

526
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
so that if the lab was to make it all
 

527
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,430
so that if the lab was to make it all
the way down then it could

528
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
the way down then it could
 

529
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,230
the way down then it could
detect that it's jammed and reset itself

530
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
detect that it's jammed and reset itself
 

531
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,389
detect that it's jammed and reset itself
as well

532
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
as well
 

533
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,710
as well
that's one idea at the moment i can fix

534
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
that's one idea at the moment i can fix
 

535
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,150
that's one idea at the moment i can fix
it just by

536
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
it just by
 

537
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,150
it just by
doing that

538
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160

 

539
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,470

oh wait no there was no block to push

540
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
oh wait no there was no block to push
 

541
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,949
oh wait no there was no block to push
there we go

542
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959

 

543
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,590

but uh generally it doesn't jam on me

544
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
but uh generally it doesn't jam on me
 

545
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,790
but uh generally it doesn't jam on me
because i don't have

546
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800
because i don't have
 

547
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:25,990
because i don't have
like 20 or 30 in there at once usually

548
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000

 

549
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,470

hmm it's a jam

550
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480

 

551
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:38,150

nope it's not jammed there we go

552
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160

 

553
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,710

yeah so i think one thing we should try

554
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
yeah so i think one thing we should try
 

555
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,509
yeah so i think one thing we should try
today is

556
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:41,519
today is
 

557
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,910
today is
get rid of that drop because they try to

558
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
get rid of that drop because they try to
 

559
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,269
get rid of that drop because they try to
avoid drops

560
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
avoid drops
 

561
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,310
avoid drops
and they swim against the current to to

562
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
and they swim against the current to to
 

563
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,590
and they swim against the current to to
try avoid it

564
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:49,600
try avoid it
 

565
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,269
try avoid it
i also want to try

566
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279

 

567
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,310

oh boy there's a lot of them here i also

568
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
oh boy there's a lot of them here i also
 

569
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,110
oh boy there's a lot of them here i also
want to try

570
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
want to try
 

571
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,189
want to try
uh maybe putting half slabs under the

572
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
uh maybe putting half slabs under the
 

573
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,150
uh maybe putting half slabs under the
water

574
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
water
 

575
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,470
water
so that they can't touch the ground and

576
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,480
so that they can't touch the ground and
 

577
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,269
so that they can't touch the ground and
jump

578
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
jump
 

579
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,710
jump
to maybe prevent them from swimming

580
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
to maybe prevent them from swimming
 

581
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,750
to maybe prevent them from swimming
against the current as strongly

582
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
against the current as strongly
 

583
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,590
against the current as strongly
so we'll do that first and then we'll

584
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
so we'll do that first and then we'll
 

585
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,670
so we'll do that first and then we'll
try to get rid of the drop and see

586
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
try to get rid of the drop and see
 

587
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,829
try to get rid of the drop and see
how they work out i'm going to try to

588
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
how they work out i'm going to try to
 

589
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,430
how they work out i'm going to try to
store these in blocks so before i do

590
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
store these in blocks so before i do
 

591
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,030
store these in blocks so before i do
that

592
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040

 

593
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,189

yeah another thing i want to mention is

594
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
yeah another thing i want to mention is
 

595
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,030
yeah another thing i want to mention is
a lot of people are wondering why i was

596
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,040
a lot of people are wondering why i was
 

597
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,189
a lot of people are wondering why i was
using flint and steel last episode to

598
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
using flint and steel last episode to
 

599
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,949
using flint and steel last episode to
kill the silverfish

600
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
kill the silverfish
 

601
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,590
kill the silverfish
it's because if you kill them with

602
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
it's because if you kill them with
 

603
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,189
it's because if you kill them with
environmental damage

604
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
environmental damage
 

605
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,870
environmental damage
like fire lava falling whatever

606
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880
like fire lava falling whatever
 

607
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,710
like fire lava falling whatever
it won't cause anymore to spawn if

608
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:38,720
it won't cause anymore to spawn if
 

609
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,030
it won't cause anymore to spawn if
there's some nearby in blocks

610
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
there's some nearby in blocks
 

611
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,110
there's some nearby in blocks
they spawn if you hit them and don't

612
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
they spawn if you hit them and don't
 

613
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,030
they spawn if you hit them and don't
kill them

614
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,040
kill them
 

615
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,550
kill them
so if you punch them with your fist it

616
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
so if you punch them with your fist it
 

617
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,230
so if you punch them with your fist it
causes lots to

618
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
causes lots to
 

619
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,550
causes lots to
spawn every every time you hit it it'll

620
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:50,560
spawn every every time you hit it it'll
 

621
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,310
spawn every every time you hit it it'll
spawn a few more if they're in the area

622
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,320

 

623
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,590

if you use flint and steel you don't

624
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:55,600
if you use flint and steel you don't
 

625
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,670
if you use flint and steel you don't
have that problem also if you have a

626
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680
have that problem also if you have a
 

627
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,509
have that problem also if you have a
diamond sword with at least

628
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
diamond sword with at least
 

629
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,189
diamond sword with at least
sharpness one on or a bane of arthropods

630
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:03,199
sharpness one on or a bane of arthropods
 

631
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,870
sharpness one on or a bane of arthropods
i think would probably do it too

632
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
i think would probably do it too
 

633
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,310
i think would probably do it too
you could one hit kill them and they

634
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
you could one hit kill them and they
 

635
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,949
you could one hit kill them and they
won't spawn anymore from blocks either

636
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
won't spawn anymore from blocks either
 

637
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,590
won't spawn anymore from blocks either
so once this sword sword's done i'll

638
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
so once this sword sword's done i'll
 

639
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,269
so once this sword sword's done i'll
probably go get a

640
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
probably go get a
 

641
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,030
probably go get a
sword with sharpness one or something

642
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040

 

643
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,430

anyway i put half slabs down here i'm

644
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
anyway i put half slabs down here i'm
 

645
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,629
anyway i put half slabs down here i'm
going to put water

646
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
going to put water
 

647
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,550
going to put water
above it fill it in

648
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
above it fill it in
 

649
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,150
above it fill it in
gonna let a bunch spawn here and see

650
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
gonna let a bunch spawn here and see
 

651
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,350
gonna let a bunch spawn here and see
what happens

652
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360

 

653
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,430

all right this is uh this is pretty

654
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
all right this is uh this is pretty
 

655
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,030
all right this is uh this is pretty
weird actually

656
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
weird actually
 

657
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,949
weird actually
the silverfish are able to fall through

658
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
the silverfish are able to fall through
 

659
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,230
the silverfish are able to fall through
the water and walk around

660
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
the water and walk around
 

661
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,069
the water and walk around
i've never seen this happen before with

662
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
i've never seen this happen before with
 

663
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,430
i've never seen this happen before with
any other mob but

664
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
any other mob but
 

665
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,389
any other mob but
since they're slightly taller than half

666
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
since they're slightly taller than half
 

667
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,509
since they're slightly taller than half
a block

668
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
a block
 

669
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,949
a block
they will actually take suffocation

670
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
they will actually take suffocation
 

671
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,590
they will actually take suffocation
damage from the water as they're walking

672
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
damage from the water as they're walking
 

673
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,350
damage from the water as they're walking
on the half slabs which is a little

674
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
on the half slabs which is a little
 

675
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,629
on the half slabs which is a little
strange

676
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
strange
 

677
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,670
strange
then uh the other ones that swim in the

678
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
then uh the other ones that swim in the
 

679
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,150
then uh the other ones that swim in the
water

680
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
water
 

681
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,550
water
that don't fall through they're still

682
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
that don't fall through they're still
 

683
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,990
that don't fall through they're still
they still are able to fight it like

684
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
they still are able to fight it like
 

685
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,189
they still are able to fight it like
they were before so

686
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199

 

687
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,030

yeah that's not gonna work so we're

688
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
yeah that's not gonna work so we're
 

689
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,749
yeah that's not gonna work so we're
going to try lower this then

690
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
going to try lower this then
 

691
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,189
going to try lower this then
so that it's even with the the

692
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
so that it's even with the the
 

693
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,350
so that it's even with the the
detector block or whatever the block

694
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
detector block or whatever the block
 

695
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,829
detector block or whatever the block
they go in

696
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839

 

697
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,350

yeah oh yeah i should probably prove

698
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
yeah oh yeah i should probably prove
 

699
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,069
yeah oh yeah i should probably prove
that they're

700
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
that they're
 

701
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,069
that they're
half a block so they're tracking me

702
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079

 

703
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,590

oh now he jumped up bad timing for that

704
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
oh now he jumped up bad timing for that
 

705
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,389
oh now he jumped up bad timing for that
to happen

706
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399

 

707
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,230

come on oh we got one

708
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
come on oh we got one
 

709
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,389
come on oh we got one
see he can't fit through that he tried

710
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
see he can't fit through that he tried
 

711
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,590
see he can't fit through that he tried
but he wasn't able to

712
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600

 

713
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,590

all right i'm gonna adjust that and we

714
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600
all right i'm gonna adjust that and we
 

715
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,110
all right i'm gonna adjust that and we
will try again

716
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,120

 

717
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,430

okay so now i have it lowered one more

718
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
okay so now i have it lowered one more
 

719
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,990
okay so now i have it lowered one more
block it's level with this

720
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
block it's level with this
 

721
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,990
block it's level with this
so now they should have hopefully no

722
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
so now they should have hopefully no
 

723
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,910
so now they should have hopefully no
reason for fighting the current so

724
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
reason for fighting the current so
 

725
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,909
reason for fighting the current so
they'll just go with it and

726
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919

 

727
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,429

get put in the block a lot quicker

728
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
get put in the block a lot quicker
 

729
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,390
get put in the block a lot quicker
hopefully that's the goal with this

730
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
hopefully that's the goal with this
 

731
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,390
hopefully that's the goal with this
and if that happens it's a lot less

732
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
and if that happens it's a lot less
 

733
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,789
and if that happens it's a lot less
likely to jam up

734
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
likely to jam up
 

735
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:21,270
likely to jam up
so let's try it out turn it back on

736
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280

 

737
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,990

step back and watch what happens oh i

738
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,000
step back and watch what happens oh i
 

739
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,830
step back and watch what happens oh i
didn't put the water

740
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:30,840

 

741
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,350

um

742
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
um
 

743
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,630
um
it's all good

744
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640

 

745
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,909

let's try this again

746
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919

 

747
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,750

nice all right no they're still fighting

748
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:45,760
nice all right no they're still fighting
 

749
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,510
nice all right no they're still fighting
it

750
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
it
 

751
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:54,230
it
kind of hmm

752
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240

 

753
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,830

i can't remember if it's jammed right

754
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
i can't remember if it's jammed right
 

755
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,950
i can't remember if it's jammed right
now

756
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:58,960

 

757
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,669

nope

758
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679

 

759
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,870

hmm they don't seem to be there we go

760
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
hmm they don't seem to be there we go
 

761
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,150
hmm they don't seem to be there we go
it might take them a little while i

762
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
it might take them a little while i
 

763
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,070
it might take them a little while i
guess um

764
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
guess um
 

765
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,190
guess um
all right let's just watch it for a

766
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
all right let's just watch it for a
 

767
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,750
all right let's just watch it for a
little bit so i heard uh

768
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,150
but yeah local split screen on minecraft
would be a lot of fun

804
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
would be a lot of fun

815
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,510
getting that i won't be
recording any of it because i don't have

816
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
recording any of it because i don't have
 

817
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,549
recording any of it because i don't have
one of those uh hipachi boxes or

818
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
one of those uh hipachi boxes or
 

819
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,750
one of those uh hipachi boxes or
anything

820
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:25,760
anything
 

821
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,110
anything
so i can't record

822
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120

 

823
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,870

uh okay well i'm gonna sit here for a

824
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
uh okay well i'm gonna sit here for a
 

825
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,390
uh okay well i'm gonna sit here for a
little while and see if it

826
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,400
little while and see if it
 

827
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,390
little while and see if it
if they all gather here or if they keep

828
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
if they all gather here or if they keep
 

829
00:19:38,400 --> 00:20:04,830
if they all gather here or if they keep
entering the blocks like i want them to

830
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:04,840

 

831
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:24,070

so

832
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080

 

833
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,590

okay this thing seems to be working

834
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
okay this thing seems to be working
 

835
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,669
okay this thing seems to be working
really well actually i'm

836
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:27,679
really well actually i'm
 

837
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,149
really well actually i'm
pretty surprised that clip was about

838
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:30,159
pretty surprised that clip was about
 

839
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,909
pretty surprised that clip was about
four minutes long i sped it up

840
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
four minutes long i sped it up
 

841
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,590
four minutes long i sped it up
six times the speed uh and this is still

842
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600
six times the speed uh and this is still
 

843
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,510
six times the speed uh and this is still
going it hasn't jammed yet

844
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:37,520
going it hasn't jammed yet
 

845
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,110
going it hasn't jammed yet
just that regular rates like it would

846
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,120
just that regular rates like it would
 

847
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,630
just that regular rates like it would
get

848
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640
get
 

849
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,029
get
it seems to keep up pretty good

850
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039

 

851
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,430

uh yeah so i think it's stable enough

852
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440
uh yeah so i think it's stable enough
 

853
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,950
uh yeah so i think it's stable enough
for right now anyway i can probably

854
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:54,960
for right now anyway i can probably
 

855
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,669
for right now anyway i can probably
comfortably

856
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
comfortably
 

857
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,549
comfortably
build the storage rooms now for the

858
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:58,559
build the storage rooms now for the
 

859
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,990
build the storage rooms now for the
blocks

860
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
blocks
 

861
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,470
blocks
uh without having to worry about maybe

862
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
uh without having to worry about maybe
 

863
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,549
uh without having to worry about maybe
moving this or anything i think it's

864
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
moving this or anything i think it's
 

865
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,230
moving this or anything i think it's
good the way it is and they will fight

866
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
good the way it is and they will fight
 

867
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,510
good the way it is and they will fight
the current if they're facing that

868
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
the current if they're facing that
 

869
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,230
the current if they're facing that
direction but

870
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
direction but
 

871
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,270
direction but
generally they seem to have no trouble

872
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,280
generally they seem to have no trouble
 

873
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,430
generally they seem to have no trouble
getting there

874
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:17,440
getting there
 

875
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,830
getting there
um yeah a lot of people were saying i

876
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
um yeah a lot of people were saying i
 

877
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,390
um yeah a lot of people were saying i
should adjust the timing on this

878
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
should adjust the timing on this
 

879
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,430
should adjust the timing on this
generator uh

880
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,440
generator uh
 

881
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,830
generator uh
so that the bud switch can keep up and

882
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:29,840
so that the bud switch can keep up and
 

883
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,350
so that the bud switch can keep up and
so that i don't need

884
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360

 

885
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,430

this piston here but the thing is this

886
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
this piston here but the thing is this
 

887
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,230
this piston here but the thing is this
is actually set right the way it is

888
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
is actually set right the way it is
 

889
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,070
is actually set right the way it is
i have played around with other timings

890
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
i have played around with other timings
 

891
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,149
i have played around with other timings
and it doesn't work

892
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
and it doesn't work
 

893
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,230
and it doesn't work
i've tried lots of different timings for

894
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,240
i've tried lots of different timings for
 

895
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,149
i've tried lots of different timings for
this and different

896
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:46,159
this and different
 

897
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,950
this and different
ways of syncing it up but the thing is

898
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:48,960
ways of syncing it up but the thing is
 

899
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,029
ways of syncing it up but the thing is
this is one delay here

900
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,039
this is one delay here
 

901
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,990
this is one delay here
torch adds another one

902
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000

 

903
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,630

and this generator pushes the block

904
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:58,640
and this generator pushes the block
 

905
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,710
and this generator pushes the block
after two so it's the same that one's

906
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
after two so it's the same that one's
 

907
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,110
after two so it's the same that one's
two

908
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,120
two
 

909
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,870
two
and this is two they meet up at the same

910
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
and this is two they meet up at the same
 

911
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,270
and this is two they meet up at the same
time if you extend this longer

912
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,280
time if you extend this longer
 

913
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,510
time if you extend this longer
this piston on the butt switch will

914
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,520
this piston on the butt switch will
 

915
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,630
this piston on the butt switch will
extend twice

916
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:08,640
extend twice
 

917
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,950
extend twice
i believe so the way it is right now is

918
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:12,960
i believe so the way it is right now is
 

919
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,950
i believe so the way it is right now is
proper

920
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
proper
 

921
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,230
proper
and this piston i am still

922
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
and this piston i am still
 

923
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,470
and this piston i am still
this one i'm still is very i'm still

924
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480
this one i'm still is very i'm still
 

925
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,830
this one i'm still is very i'm still
very convinced that we need it

926
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840

 

927
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,830

um yeah

928
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
um yeah
 

929
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,110
um yeah
and as far as killing them um i don't

930
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,120
and as far as killing them um i don't
 

931
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,789
and as far as killing them um i don't
know

932
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
know
 

933
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,549
know
i think i'll set up rooms that are

934
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:36,559
i think i'll set up rooms that are
 

935
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,070
i think i'll set up rooms that are
that store the blocks in a 12. by

936
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,080
that store the blocks in a 12. by
 

937
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,830
that store the blocks in a 12. by
let's see 12 times 12 times 6

938
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
let's see 12 times 12 times 6
 

939
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,750
let's see 12 times 12 times 6
would get us pretty close to 50 levels i

940
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760
would get us pretty close to 50 levels i
 

941
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,430
would get us pretty close to 50 levels i
think

942
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:51,440
think
 

943
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,990
think
so i think that's what i'll aim for and

944
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
so i think that's what i'll aim for and
 

945
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,950
so i think that's what i'll aim for and
i'll probably do it

946
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
i'll probably do it
 

947
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,510
i'll probably do it
much like this uh

948
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,520

 

949
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,950

probably 12 by 12 horizontally and then

950
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,960
probably 12 by 12 horizontally and then
 

951
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,430
probably 12 by 12 horizontally and then
six vertically silver fish have

952
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
six vertically silver fish have
 

953
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,990
six vertically silver fish have
four hearts so they can fall 11 blocks

954
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,000
four hearts so they can fall 11 blocks
 

955
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,070
four hearts so they can fall 11 blocks
without dying

956
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,080
without dying
 

957
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,710
without dying
so that should be okay if

958
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,720

 

959
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,270

that would work out all right i could

960
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,280
that would work out all right i could
 

961
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,669
that would work out all right i could
make a room that's 11 blocks high

962
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:21,679
make a room that's 11 blocks high
 

963
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,310
make a room that's 11 blocks high
and put them at the very top so that

964
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
and put them at the very top so that
 

965
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,149
and put them at the very top so that
they'll take quite a bit of fall damage

966
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
they'll take quite a bit of fall damage
 

967
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,390
they'll take quite a bit of fall damage
when they spawn because they they always

968
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
when they spawn because they they always
 

969
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,750
when they spawn because they they always
spawn with four hearts

970
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
spawn with four hearts
 

971
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,630
spawn with four hearts
health and then i could maybe use poison

972
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,640
health and then i could maybe use poison
 

973
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,470
health and then i could maybe use poison
potions or

974
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
potions or
 

975
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,710
potions or
the instant damage potions to finish

976
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720
the instant damage potions to finish
 

977
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,990
the instant damage potions to finish
them off

978
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
them off
 

979
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,789
them off
i don't know we'll see we'll see

980
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
i don't know we'll see we'll see
 

981
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,470
i don't know we'll see we'll see
and i was talking about maybe building

982
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:48,480
and i was talking about maybe building
 

983
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,750
and i was talking about maybe building
my storage room and mob system here

984
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
my storage room and mob system here
 

985
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,950
my storage room and mob system here
instead of that other area the idea is i

986
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
instead of that other area the idea is i
 

987
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,789
instead of that other area the idea is i
would have the floor for the storage

988
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799
would have the floor for the storage
 

989
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,430
would have the floor for the storage
room maybe

990
00:23:59,430 --> 00:23:59,440
room maybe
 

991
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,149
room maybe
like right at this level here so that

992
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:02,159
like right at this level here so that
 

993
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,830
like right at this level here so that
when i'd be walking around

994
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:03,840
when i'd be walking around
 

995
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,990
when i'd be walking around
doing stuff i would be within range of

996
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
doing stuff i would be within range of
 

997
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,510
doing stuff i would be within range of
the spawner here

998
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:07,520
the spawner here
 

999
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,830
the spawner here
and yet still outside of the range of

1000
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
and yet still outside of the range of
 

1001
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,990
and yet still outside of the range of
the silverfish so they

1002
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
the silverfish so they
 

1003
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,310
the silverfish so they
they would do that on their own without

1004
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,320
they would do that on their own without
 

1005
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,590
they would do that on their own without
tracking me

1006
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600
tracking me
 

1007
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,750
tracking me
because they fall down quite a few

1008
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
because they fall down quite a few
 

1009
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,510
because they fall down quite a few
blocks and i think we would be out of

1010
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
blocks and i think we would be out of
 

1011
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,710
blocks and i think we would be out of
range

1012
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720
range
 

1013
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,110
range
of them so

1014
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,120
of them so
 

1015
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,909
of them so
could be could be pretty cool and this

1016
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:27,919
could be could be pretty cool and this
 

1017
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:28,950
could be could be pretty cool and this
is not just an

1018
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:28,960
is not just an
 

1019
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,269
is not just an
xp system some people are wondering why

1020
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,279
xp system some people are wondering why
 

1021
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,789
xp system some people are wondering why
i keep building all these xp

1022
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
i keep building all these xp
 

1023
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,070
i keep building all these xp
systems it's because i like it that's

1024
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,080
systems it's because i like it that's
 

1025
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,750

probably my favorite thing in minecraft

1026
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:37,760
probably my favorite thing in minecraft
 

1027
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,710
probably my favorite thing in minecraft
is uh

1028

you could spawn them in this room for

1046
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,080
you could spawn them in this room for
 

1047
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,070
you could spawn them in this room for
example

1048

example
 

1049
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,070
example
and then walk them to wherever you want

1050
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
and then walk them to wherever you want
 

1051
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,430
and then walk them to wherever you want
to do some digging because they all

1052
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,440
to do some digging because they all
 

1053
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,029
to do some digging because they all
follow you

1054

follow you
 

1055
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,789
follow you
and then if you go outside of range of

1056
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:12,799
and then if you go outside of range of
 

1057
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,029
and then if you go outside of range of
them they will all enter

1058
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
them they will all enter
 

1059
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,310
them they will all enter
blocks all the stone blocks

1060
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320

remember minecraft is mostly like

1062
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:20,640
remember minecraft is mostly like

minecraft world is mostly made

1064
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,400
minecraft world is mostly made
 

1065
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,390
minecraft world is mostly made
of stone so

1066
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,400

 

1067
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,510

they could do a lot of digging if you

1068
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
they could do a lot of digging if you
 

1069
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,789
they could do a lot of digging if you
were to leave the area they would enter

1070
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
were to leave the area they would enter
 

1071
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,669
were to leave the area they would enter
the blocks

1072
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:31,679
the blocks
 

1073
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,590
the blocks
then you can make them spawn again and

1074
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
then you can make them spawn again and
 

1075
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,909
then you can make them spawn again and
they would break all those blocks

1076
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:35,919
they would break all those blocks
 

1077
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,310
they would break all those blocks
uh then you could get like a hundred

1078
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,320
uh then you could get like a hundred
 

1079
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,430
uh then you could get like a hundred
spawns

1080
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,440

1081
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,110
spawns
leave the area again they would all

1082
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,120
leave the area again they would all
 

1083
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,789
leave the area again they would all
enter blocks again

1084
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:42,799
enter blocks again
 

1085
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,430
enter blocks again
hit them they would break a hundred more

1086
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:45,440
hit them they would break a hundred more
 

1087
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,190
hit them they would break a hundred more
blocks and you could dig pretty quick

1088
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,200
blocks and you could dig pretty quick
 

1089
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,430
blocks and you could dig pretty quick
doing that you know

1090
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:49,440
doing that you know
 

1091
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,350
doing that you know
just repeat that cycle you could dig a

1092
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
just repeat that cycle you could dig a
 

1093
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,430
just repeat that cycle you could dig a
deep hole really fast

1094
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,440
deep hole really fast
 

1095
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,630
deep hole really fast
i think so that is a

1096
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:56,640
i think so that is a
 

1097
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,789
i think so that is a

for large projects maybe and i think
they could do that

1104
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,520

 

1105

and i'm worried about lighting it up
 

1155
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,029
and i'm worried about lighting it up
once i dig through it

1156

once i dig through it
 

1157
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,830
once i dig through it
and making it clean looking because it's

ocd about it but if i build a
 

1181
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,269
ocd about it but if i build a
mine somewhere far off i won't have to

1182

mine somewhere far off i won't have to
 

1183
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,190
mine somewhere far off i won't have to
worry anymore i could just dig

1184
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,200
worry anymore i could just dig
 

1185
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,630

are all spaced
a precise distance from each other so

1190
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
a precise distance from each other so
 

1191
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,909
a precise distance from each other so
that

1192
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:43,919
that
 

1193

okay i found out which one i lit up very

1214
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:13,039
okay i found out which one i lit up very
 

1215
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,389
okay i found out which one i lit up very
carefully

1216
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:14,399
carefully
 

1217
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,870
carefully
it's uh this one

1218
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:18,880
it's uh this one
 

1219
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,590
it's uh this one
so every every 10 on the zed

1220
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:23,600
so every every 10 on the zed
 

1221
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,510
so every every 10 on the zed
is where i would place the torch that

1222
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:25,520
is where i would place the torch that
 

1223
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,110

way it's easy to figure it out

1224
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
way it's easy to figure it out
 

1225
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,789
way it's easy to figure it out
you don't have to count it you just look

1226
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:28,799
you don't have to count it you just look
 

1227
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,230
you don't have to count it you just look
at the z number

1228
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
at the z number
 

1229
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,149
at the z number
and it's easy to figure out stuff by

1230
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:32,159
and it's easy to figure out stuff by
 

1231
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,909
and it's easy to figure out stuff by
tens i think you can actually go

1232
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:33,919
tens i think you can actually go
 

1233
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,549
tens i think you can actually go
i think by twelves and the light would

1234
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,559
i think by twelves and the light would
 

1235
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,190
i think by twelves and the light would
be enough

1236
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,200
be enough
 

1237
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,710
be enough
but uh it's just easier to go by tens

1238
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720

 

1239
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,029

1315
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,350
so yeah if i was to do a 12 by 12 by 6
that would be about 800 silver fish so i

1316
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,360
that would be about 800 silver fish so i
 

1317
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,310

might have to

1318

1319
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,029

uh do half of them at a time or

1320
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:47,039
uh do half of them at a time or
 

1321
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,470
uh do half of them at a time or
something because that could be

1322

something because that could be
 

1323
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,270
