but first let's check out the old crummy
 

15
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,790
but first let's check out the old crummy
design

16
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
design
 

17
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,750
design
so this is my current best mini farm in

18
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
so this is my current best mini farm in
 

19
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,790
so this is my current best mini farm in
our world here

20
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800

the one i've been using uh today i was
 

23
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,990
the one i've been using uh today i was
this

24
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000
this
 

25
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,269
this
i was getting some carrots because i

26
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
i was getting some carrots because i
 

27
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,189
i was getting some carrots because i
want to start using golden carrots and

28
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
want to start using golden carrots and
 

29
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,950
want to start using golden carrots and
for our food instead of steak all the

30
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
for our food instead of steak all the
 

31
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,670
for our food instead of steak all the
time

32
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
time
 

33
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,110
time
uh golden carrots have a better

34
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
uh golden carrots have a better
 

35
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,870
uh golden carrots have a better
saturation value

36
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:36,880
saturation value
 

37
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,990
saturation value
so i built this off camera um

38
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,000
so i built this off camera um
 

39
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,990
so i built this off camera um
i don't know if i've shown it in a video

40
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
i don't know if i've shown it in a video
 

41
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,510
i don't know if i've shown it in a video
but basically we got a little bit of a

42
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
but basically we got a little bit of a
 

43
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,470
but basically we got a little bit of a
shield here

44
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,480
shield here
 

45
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,150
shield here
because we want to be able to afk here

46
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
because we want to be able to afk here
 

47
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,430
because we want to be able to afk here
we don't want creepers sneaking up

48
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
we don't want creepers sneaking up
 

49
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,790
we don't want creepers sneaking up
behind us

50
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
behind us
 

51
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,869
behind us
skeletons can still shoot through which

52
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
skeletons can still shoot through which
 

53
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,830
skeletons can still shoot through which
was

54
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
was
 

55
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,790
was
kind of dumb on my part but whatever and

56
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
kind of dumb on my part but whatever and
 

57
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,029
kind of dumb on my part but whatever and
this is a switch to turn it on

58
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,039
this is a switch to turn it on
 

59
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,110
this is a switch to turn it on
uh so each of these dispensers has bone

60
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
uh so each of these dispensers has bone
 

61
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,029
uh so each of these dispensers has bone
meal in it

62
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
meal in it
 

63
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,830
meal in it
basically you plant down your crop and

64
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
basically you plant down your crop and
 

65
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,030
basically you plant down your crop and
then

66
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
then
 

67
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,350
then
dispensers grow it pretty much instantly

68
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
dispensers grow it pretty much instantly
 

69
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,550
dispensers grow it pretty much instantly
with the bone meal

70
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560
with the bone meal
 

71
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,030
with the bone meal
and because it's a dark spot we then up

72
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
and because it's a dark spot we then up
 

73
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,230
and because it's a dark spot we then up
update the carrot

74
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
update the carrot
 

75
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,670
update the carrot
and it causes it to uproot and goes back

76
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
and it causes it to uproot and goes back
 

77
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,590
and it causes it to uproot and goes back
into our inventory here

78
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
into our inventory here
 

79
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,789
into our inventory here
um are we losing carrots sometimes if

80
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
um are we losing carrots sometimes if
 

81
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,350
um are we losing carrots sometimes if
you get the timing wrong it doesn't work

82
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
you get the timing wrong it doesn't work
 

83
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,950
you get the timing wrong it doesn't work
yeah we're still losing carrots gotta

84
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
yeah we're still losing carrots gotta
 

85
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,710
yeah we're still losing carrots gotta
like stop and right click and

86
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
like stop and right click and
 

87
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,630
like stop and right click and
then the number will go up yeah now it's

88
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
then the number will go up yeah now it's
 

89
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,670
then the number will go up yeah now it's
going up okay so this is the sweet spot

90
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
going up okay so this is the sweet spot

as long as you want
 

95
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,670
as long as you want
is the goal a lot of these mini farms

96
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
is the goal a lot of these mini farms
 

97
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,870
is the goal a lot of these mini farms
though they have the problem

98
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
though they have the problem
 

99
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,910
though they have the problem
your inventory is gonna fill up a food

100
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
your inventory is gonna fill up a food
 

101
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,550
your inventory is gonna fill up a food
right and then it starts falling on the

102
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
right and then it starts falling on the
 

103
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,270
right and then it starts falling on the
ground

104
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
ground
 

105
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,109
ground
and then it'll despawn over time like

106
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
and then it'll despawn over time like
 

107
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,550
and then it'll despawn over time like
within five ten minutes you're probably

108
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
within five ten minutes you're probably
 

109
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,469
within five ten minutes you're probably
gonna have items despawning

110
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
gonna have items despawning
 

111
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,550
gonna have items despawning
so the the big change i made with this

112
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
so the the big change i made with this
 

113
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,230
so the the big change i made with this
farm compared to my other ones

114
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
farm compared to my other ones
 

115
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,630
farm compared to my other ones
is you can automatically pick up the

116
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
is you can automatically pick up the
 

117
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,310
is you can automatically pick up the
items so underneath this slab is a

118
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
items so underneath this slab is a
 

119
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,109
items so underneath this slab is a
hopper

120
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
hopper
 

121
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,510
hopper
and underneath the tilt soil here is a

122
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
and underneath the tilt soil here is a
 

123
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,270
and underneath the tilt soil here is a
hopper mine carts

124
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
hopper mine carts
 

125
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,749
hopper mine carts
so food lands there it gets picked up

126
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
so food lands there it gets picked up
 

127
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,670
so food lands there it gets picked up
which is pretty cool

128
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
which is pretty cool
 

129
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,350
which is pretty cool
if you just kept the hopper minecart

130
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
if you just kept the hopper minecart
 

131
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,029
if you just kept the hopper minecart
underneath that soil though you would

132
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
underneath that soil though you would
 

133
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,030
underneath that soil though you would
not get any carrots or seeds in your

134
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
not get any carrots or seeds in your
 

135
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,470
not get any carrots or seeds in your
inventory

136
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
inventory
 

137
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,990
inventory
and you would run out of stuff to plant

138
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
and you would run out of stuff to plant
 

139
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,910
and you would run out of stuff to plant
so you have to like

140
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
so you have to like
 

141
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,910
so you have to like
not just leave the hopper mine cart

142
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
not just leave the hopper mine cart
 

143
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,190
not just leave the hopper mine cart
there but like

144
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
there but like
 

145
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,510
there but like
bounce it back and forth so it'll pick

146
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
bounce it back and forth so it'll pick
 

147
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,869
bounce it back and forth so it'll pick
up a little bit of stuff but you'll

148
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
up a little bit of stuff but you'll
 

149
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,630
up a little bit of stuff but you'll
still get enough items in your inventory

150
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
still get enough items in your inventory
 

151
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,110
still get enough items in your inventory
you

152
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
you
 

153
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,670
you
won't run out of seeds and carrots and

154
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
won't run out of seeds and carrots and
 

155
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,229
won't run out of seeds and carrots and
it's been working pretty good here

156
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
it's been working pretty good here
 

157
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,830
it's been working pretty good here
so far so then items go down to your

158
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
so far so then items go down to your
 

159
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,470
so far so then items go down to your
storage

160
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
storage
 

161
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,630
storage
yeah so today guys i was using that farm

162
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
yeah so today guys i was using that farm
 

163
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,790
yeah so today guys i was using that farm
and i got to thinking i bet you could do

164
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
and i got to thinking i bet you could do
 

165
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,710
and i got to thinking i bet you could do
something better with observer blocks

166
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
something better with observer blocks
 

167
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,229
something better with observer blocks
now right

168
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
now right
 

169
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,350
now right
and within a minute of trying it's like

170
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
and within a minute of trying it's like
 

171
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,630
and within a minute of trying it's like

keep it hydrated all three dispensers
are facing the farmland and then you

200
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
are facing the farmland and then you
 

201
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,830
are facing the farmland and then you
gotta block out the light to that

202
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
gotta block out the light to that
 

203
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,229
gotta block out the light to that
that block there so a slab works nicely

223
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,670

uh-huh but if you only place down one

224
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
uh-huh but if you only place down one
 

225
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,869
uh-huh but if you only place down one
seed

226
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
seed
 

227
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,910
seed
it'll uproot and then

228
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
it'll uproot and then
 

229
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,589
it'll uproot and then
uh it doesn't grow it actually uproots

230
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
uh it doesn't grow it actually uproots
 

231
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,949
uh it doesn't grow it actually uproots
before the

232
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
before the
 

233
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,949
before the
it tries to get bone milled here so the

234
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
it tries to get bone milled here so the
 

235
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,070
it tries to get bone milled here so the
second one you place

236
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
second one you place
 

237
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,789
second one you place
catches the bone meal from the first one

238
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
catches the bone meal from the first one
 

239
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,030
catches the bone meal from the first one
and keeps the cycle going

240
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
and keeps the cycle going
 

241
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,550
and keeps the cycle going
and the other thing that's really cool

242
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
and the other thing that's really cool
 

243
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,550
and the other thing that's really cool
about it is it's really fast here like

244
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
about it is it's really fast here like
 

245
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,750
about it is it's really fast here like
if you look at the number

246
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
if you look at the number
 

247
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,429
if you look at the number
in the dispenser or 35 or so if we start

248
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
in the dispenser or 35 or so if we start
 

249
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,550
in the dispenser or 35 or so if we start
growing

250
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560

 

251
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,990

uh it actually uses the bone meal faster

252
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
uh it actually uses the bone meal faster
 

253
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,310
uh it actually uses the bone meal faster
than

254
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
than
 

255
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,870
than
a single hopper can refill it now if we

256
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
a single hopper can refill it now if we
 

257
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,310
a single hopper can refill it now if we
look the number is actually lower than

258
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
look the number is actually lower than
 

259
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,990
look the number is actually lower than
when we started

260
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
when we started
 

261
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,189
when we started
so if you want to like keep it

262
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
so if you want to like keep it
 

263
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,110
so if you want to like keep it
continuously running you need to hook up

264
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
continuously running you need to hook up
 

265
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,590
continuously running you need to hook up
two hoppers to the dispenser and have

266
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
two hoppers to the dispenser and have
 

267
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,590
two hoppers to the dispenser and have
like a double chest above

268
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
like a double chest above
 

269
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,270
like a double chest above

sword if we can

338
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
sword if we can
 

339
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,270
sword if we can
and interruption yes

340
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
and interruption yes
 

341
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,790
and interruption yes
i think the trick is not to add them

342
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
i think the trick is not to add them
 

343
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,710
i think the trick is not to add them
onto the sword one by one i think we

344
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
onto the sword one by one i think we
 

345
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,350
onto the sword one by one i think we
want to

346
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
want to
 

347
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,070
want to
try pyramid style this so combine the

348
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
try pyramid style this so combine the
 

349
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,150
try pyramid style this so combine the
books first

350
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
books first
 

351
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,309
books first
so we combined two books into one there

352
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
so we combined two books into one there
 

353
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,990
so we combined two books into one there
then we'll combine these two books into

354
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
then we'll combine these two books into
 

355
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,590
then we'll combine these two books into
one

356
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
one
 

357
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,270
one
i think if we just added them one by one

358
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
i think if we just added them one by one
 

359
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,510
i think if we just added them one by one
to the sword uh wouldn't it be possible

360
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
to the sword uh wouldn't it be possible
 

361
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,230
to the sword uh wouldn't it be possible
become too expensive and we'll combine

362
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
become too expensive and we'll combine
 

363
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,309
become too expensive and we'll combine
these two

364
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
these two
 

365
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,150
these two
and you know i'm not even trying to

366
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
and you know i'm not even trying to
 

367
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,670
and you know i'm not even trying to
rearrange these i should do that

368
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
rearrange these i should do that
 

369
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,270
rearrange these i should do that
actually

370
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
actually
 

371
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,590
actually
because that was cheaper okay and then

372
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
because that was cheaper okay and then
 

373
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,510
because that was cheaper okay and then
we want to combo

374
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
we want to combo
 

375
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,110
we want to combo
these two together maybe 15 levels

376
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
these two together maybe 15 levels
 

377
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,110
these two together maybe 15 levels
now eight levels that way okay

378
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
now eight levels that way okay
 

379
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,469
now eight levels that way okay
yeah i might have messed it up already

380
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
yeah i might have messed it up already
 

381
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,710
yeah i might have messed it up already
because i wasn't rearranging the books

382
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
because i wasn't rearranging the books
 

383
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,150
because i wasn't rearranging the books
i'm not sure or i might have just wasted

384
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
i'm not sure or i might have just wasted
 

385
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,629
i'm not sure or i might have just wasted
levels that's probably what i did

386
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
levels that's probably what i did
 

387
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,830
levels that's probably what i did
okay and now i think we can probably

388
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
okay and now i think we can probably
 

389
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,150
okay and now i think we can probably
combine these two

390
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
combine these two
 

391
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,270
combine these two
for 30 23 okay

392
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
for 30 23 okay
 

393
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,670
for 30 23 okay
look at that are we gonna be able to get

394
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
look at that are we gonna be able to get
 

395
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,990
look at that are we gonna be able to get
him onto the sword

396
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
him onto the sword
 

397
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,029
him onto the sword
no i messed it up no

398
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039

 

399
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,710

darn ah so sad so

400
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
darn ah so sad so
 

401
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,790
darn ah so sad so
sad but we got another chance at this

402
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
sad but we got another chance at this
 

403
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,629
sad but we got another chance at this
i'm gonna try it again

404
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
i'm gonna try it again
 

405
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,230
i'm gonna try it again
uh we got eight books here we're gonna

406
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
uh we got eight books here we're gonna
 

407
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,990
uh we got eight books here we're gonna
try to combine them pyramid style

408
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
try to combine them pyramid style
 

409
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,230
try to combine them pyramid style
again this time i'm gonna be careful

410
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
again this time i'm gonna be careful
 

411
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,510
again this time i'm gonna be careful
though like i'm trying to keep this

412
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
though like i'm trying to keep this
 

413
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,550
though like i'm trying to keep this
enchantment cost

414
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
enchantment cost
 

415
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,589
enchantment cost
low i think is the goal

416
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
low i think is the goal
 

417
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,070
low i think is the goal
that's ten that's two okay so i'm going

418
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
that's ten that's two okay so i'm going
 

419
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,990
that's ten that's two okay so i'm going
to combine those two

420
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
to combine those two
 

421
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,510
to combine those two

yeah i think this is working out much
 

427
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,830
yeah i think this is working out much
better okay we'll do uh

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
better okay we'll do uh
 

429
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,550
better okay we'll do uh

00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
sweeping edge and unbreaking three was
 

435
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,749
sweeping edge and unbreaking three was
only three at the cheapest

436
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759

 

437
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,749

00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:01,199
to the sword first
 

447
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,629
to the sword first
and then add the other book on top of

448
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
and then add the other book on top of
 

449
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,790
and then add the other book on top of
the sword

450
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
the sword
 

451
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,390
the sword
hopefully oh that's 27 already

and let's go try it out so we got a
 

479
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,589
and let's go try it out so we got a
sweeping edge on this baby i haven't

480
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
sweeping edge on this baby i haven't
 

481
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,949
sweeping edge on this baby i haven't
played around with that yet

482
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
played around with that yet
 

483
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,110

uh from what i understand it makes it so
 

485
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,870
uh from what i understand it makes it so
your sweep attacks

486
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
your sweep attacks
 

487
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,870
your sweep attacks
apply more damage to the mobs around you

488
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
apply more damage to the mobs around you
 

489
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,949
apply more damage to the mobs around you
so maybe if we

490
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
so maybe if we
 

491
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,790
so maybe if we
take a swing at our cows here it'll kill

492
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800

no okay so it doesn't do a lot of damage

496
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480

 

497
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,509

yeah yeah i'm not impressed

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:09,920
like the splash damage usually would
 

501
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,829
like the splash damage usually would
only do

502
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
only do
 

503
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,630
only do

something now i'm not sure

506
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880

 

507
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,030

but anyways guys i wanted to show you

508
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
but anyways guys i wanted to show you
 

509
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,870
but anyways guys i wanted to show you
the flash furnace system again here

510
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
the flash furnace system again here
 

511
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,550
the flash furnace system again here
today because i've been working on it

512
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
today because i've been working on it
 

513
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,750
today because i've been working on it
and it's it's pretty much

514
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
and it's it's pretty much
 

515
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,350
and it's it's pretty much
all done now uh the guts of it at least

516
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
all done now uh the guts of it at least
 

517
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,670
all done now uh the guts of it at least
and i've added in a fuel port to it now

518
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
and i've added in a fuel port to it now
 

519
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,230
and i've added in a fuel port to it now
so if we want to give it fuel

520
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
so if we want to give it fuel
 

521
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,310
so if we want to give it fuel
i've been using planks planks seem to

522
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
i've been using planks planks seem to
 

523
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,710
i've been using planks planks seem to
work very good for this actually

524
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
work very good for this actually
 

525
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,310
work very good for this actually
so just throw the fuel in there it

526
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
so just throw the fuel in there it
 

527
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,990
so just throw the fuel in there it
distributes it

528
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
distributes it
 

529
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,310
distributes it
to both sides and then there's a hopper

530
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
to both sides and then there's a hopper
 

531
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,150
to both sides and then there's a hopper
minecart right over there that runs over

532
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
minecart right over there that runs over
 

533
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,710
minecart right over there that runs over
top of

534
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
top of
 

535
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,750
top of
each of the furnaces and delivers one

536
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
each of the furnaces and delivers one
 

537
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,269
each of the furnaces and delivers one
plank on the way and one plank on the

538
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
plank on the way and one plank on the
 

539
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,550
plank on the way and one plank on the
way back

540
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
way back
 

541
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,750
way back
um every time it smelts an item which is

542
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
um every time it smelts an item which is
 

543
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,870
um every time it smelts an item which is
pretty cool

544
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
pretty cool
 

545
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,230
pretty cool
and let's just go ahead and check out

546
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
and let's just go ahead and check out
 

547
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,310
and let's just go ahead and check out
the speed of this thing so you might

548
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
the speed of this thing so you might
 

549
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,870
the speed of this thing so you might
have noticed i also

550
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
have noticed i also
 

551
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,030
have noticed i also
doubled the amount of furnaces so it's

552
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
doubled the amount of furnaces so it's
 

553
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,230
doubled the amount of furnaces so it's
not 64 anymore it's 128

554
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
not 64 anymore it's 128
 

555
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,949
not 64 anymore it's 128
so it'll smelt twice as quick now and i

556
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
so it'll smelt twice as quick now and i
 

557
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,069
so it'll smelt twice as quick now and i
think we can actually go up to

558
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
think we can actually go up to
 

559
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,470
think we can actually go up to
uh 192 at the most and then we're gonna

560
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
uh 192 at the most and then we're gonna
 

561
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,230
uh 192 at the most and then we're gonna
start having trouble

562
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
start having trouble
 

563
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,990
start having trouble
but yeah basically we throw in our fuel

564
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
but yeah basically we throw in our fuel
 

565
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,710
but yeah basically we throw in our fuel
over here it gets distributed

566
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
over here it gets distributed
 

567
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,910
over here it gets distributed
distributed distributed

568
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
distributed distributed
 

569
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,190
distributed distributed
to all the furnaces evenly and

570
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
to all the furnaces evenly and
 

571
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,949
to all the furnaces evenly and
takes 10 seconds for the first item to

572
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
takes 10 seconds for the first item to
 

573
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,470
takes 10 seconds for the first item to
smelt

574
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
smelt
 

575
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,790
smelt
plus whatever leg you have from your

576
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
plus whatever leg you have from your
 

577
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,750
plus whatever leg you have from your
hoppers and stuff

578
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
hoppers and stuff
 

579
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,829
hoppers and stuff
also gets added onto that which is not

580
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
also gets added onto that which is not
 

581
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,230
also gets added onto that which is not
much time at all

582
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
much time at all
 

583
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,150
much time at all
so it does one stack at first just to

584
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
so it does one stack at first just to
 

585
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,430
so it does one stack at first just to
get it done and then it does

586
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
get it done and then it does
 

587
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,550
get it done and then it does
two every every 10 seconds here

588
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
two every every 10 seconds here
 

589
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,870
two every every 10 seconds here
if we made it 192 furnaces though it

590
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
if we made it 192 furnaces though it
 

591
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,630
if we made it 192 furnaces though it
would do three every 10 seconds so

592
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
would do three every 10 seconds so
 

593
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,710
would do three every 10 seconds so
i'm tempted to do it but uh

594
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
i'm tempted to do it but uh
 

595
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,310
i'm tempted to do it but uh
yeah that's that's the rough speed of it

596
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
yeah that's that's the rough speed of it
 

597
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,949
yeah that's that's the rough speed of it
now which is pretty awesome

598
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
now which is pretty awesome
 

599
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,829
now which is pretty awesome
i was thinking about it today uh using

600
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
i was thinking about it today uh using
 

601
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,110
i was thinking about it today uh using
charcoal is actually

602
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
charcoal is actually
 

603
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,750
charcoal is actually
terrible i just realized how bad

604
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
terrible i just realized how bad
 

605
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,150
terrible i just realized how bad
charcoal is as a fuel actually

606
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
charcoal is as a fuel actually
 

607
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,509
charcoal is as a fuel actually
because like you can convert one piece

608
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
because like you can convert one piece
 

609
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,350
because like you can convert one piece
of wood into one piece of charcoal right

610
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
of wood into one piece of charcoal right
 

611
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,949
of wood into one piece of charcoal right
a piece of charcoal will smelt eight

612
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:16,959
a piece of charcoal will smelt eight
 

613
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,310
a piece of charcoal will smelt eight
items uh but you have to smelt

614
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
items uh but you have to smelt
 

615
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,550
items uh but you have to smelt
the wood so it's it's like you're

616
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
the wood so it's it's like you're
 

617
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,389
the wood so it's it's like you're
getting seven items out of one piece of

618
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
getting seven items out of one piece of
 

619
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,670
getting seven items out of one piece of
charcoal

620
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
charcoal
 

621
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,550
charcoal
while if you just turn it into planks

622
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
while if you just turn it into planks
 

623
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,630
while if you just turn it into planks
four planks will smelt six items so six

624
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
four planks will smelt six items so six
 

625
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,829
four planks will smelt six items so six
items versus seven

626
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
items versus seven
 

627
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,870
items versus seven
yeah the charcoal is a little bit better

628
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
yeah the charcoal is a little bit better
 

629
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,870
yeah the charcoal is a little bit better
in terms of efficiency but it's very

630
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
in terms of efficiency but it's very
 

631
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,310
in terms of efficiency but it's very
easy to waste

632
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
easy to waste
 

633
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,069
easy to waste
the fuel efficient efficiency if you

634
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
the fuel efficient efficiency if you
 

635
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,030
the fuel efficient efficiency if you
don't smelt exactly eight items with it

636
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
don't smelt exactly eight items with it
 

637
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,829
don't smelt exactly eight items with it
yeah so that leads nicely into our next

638
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
yeah so that leads nicely into our next
 

639
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,310
yeah so that leads nicely into our next
big

640
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
big
 

641
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,870
big
building project guys our next big farm

642
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:48,880
building project guys our next big farm
 

643
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,470
building project guys our next big farm
that we're gonna work on in our world

644
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
that we're gonna work on in our world
 

645
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,190
that we're gonna work on in our world
here

646
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
here
 

647
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,269
here
it's gonna be a fuel farm we're gonna

648
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
it's gonna be a fuel farm we're gonna
 

649
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,670
it's gonna be a fuel farm we're gonna
dedicate a farm to making furnace fuel

650
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
dedicate a farm to making furnace fuel
 

651
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,150
dedicate a farm to making furnace fuel
for our

652
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
for our
 

653
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,629
for our
our big smelter now and like i said

654
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:58,639
our big smelter now and like i said
 

655
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,110
our big smelter now and like i said
charcoal is not really a great option

656
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
charcoal is not really a great option
 

657
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,670
charcoal is not really a great option
uh but we're not gonna use planks either

658
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
uh but we're not gonna use planks either
 

659
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,710
uh but we're not gonna use planks either
blaze rods

660
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
blaze rods
 

661
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,790
blaze rods
not so great because you gotta actually

662
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
not so great because you gotta actually
 

663
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,509
not so great because you gotta actually
kill the blazes yourself to get the

664
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:09,519
kill the blazes yourself to get the
 

665
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,230
kill the blazes yourself to get the
the blaze rods we could use coal but

666
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
the blaze rods we could use coal but
 

667
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,870
the blaze rods we could use coal but
we'll run out of it eventually

668
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
we'll run out of it eventually
 

669
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,389
we'll run out of it eventually
and i would rather use it for building

670
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:16,399
and i would rather use it for building
 

671
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,990
and i would rather use it for building
blocks in case i want to use

672
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
blocks in case i want to use
 

673
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,269
blocks in case i want to use
coal blocks and lava buckets are are the

674
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
coal blocks and lava buckets are are the
 

675
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,150
coal blocks and lava buckets are are the
best

676
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
best
 

677
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,069
best
fuel source in the game they can smelt

678
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
fuel source in the game they can smelt
 

679
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,430
fuel source in the game they can smelt
100 items but if we have 128 furnaces

680
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
100 items but if we have 128 furnaces
 

681
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,910
100 items but if we have 128 furnaces
that's that means we need to smelt 12

682
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
that's that means we need to smelt 12
 

683
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,710
that's that means we need to smelt 12
800 items to make use of all the fuel

684
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
800 items to make use of all the fuel
 

685
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,069
800 items to make use of all the fuel
in a single smelting cycle

686
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
in a single smelting cycle
 

687
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,269
in a single smelting cycle
or that's like 200 stacks of items

688
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
or that's like 200 stacks of items
 

689
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,590
or that's like 200 stacks of items
so yeah lava's not great in our our

690
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
so yeah lava's not great in our our
 

691
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,069
so yeah lava's not great in our our
giant smelter thing we want something

692
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
giant smelter thing we want something
 

693
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,030
giant smelter thing we want something
that will only do like one one item or

694
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
that will only do like one one item or
 

695
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,829
that will only do like one one item or
so

696
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
so
 

697
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,470
so
and surprise surprise this might shock

698
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
and surprise surprise this might shock
 

699
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,350
and surprise surprise this might shock
you a little bit

700
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
you a little bit
 

701
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,430
you a little bit
we're going to be using mushroom blocks

702
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
we're going to be using mushroom blocks
 

703
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,910
we're going to be using mushroom blocks
as our main fuel source

704
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
as our main fuel source
 

705
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,110
as our main fuel source
so they have the same fuel

706
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
so they have the same fuel
 

707
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,190
so they have the same fuel
smelting time as planks it's one and a

708
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
smelting time as planks it's one and a
 

709
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,790
smelting time as planks it's one and a
half items

710
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
half items
 

711
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,230
half items
so we don't have to worry too much about

712
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
so we don't have to worry too much about
 

713
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,629
so we don't have to worry too much about
wasting fuel with them

714
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
wasting fuel with them
 

715
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,110
wasting fuel with them
which is nice and also you can instant

716
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
which is nice and also you can instant
 

717
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,030
which is nice and also you can instant
mine mushroom blocks so that

718
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
mine mushroom blocks so that
 

719
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,910
mine mushroom blocks so that
uh that opens up some interesting

720
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
uh that opens up some interesting
 

721
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,509
uh that opens up some interesting
possibilities when farming them

722
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
possibilities when farming them
 

723
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,790
possibilities when farming them
unlike wood which if you're manually

724
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
unlike wood which if you're manually
 

725
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,670
unlike wood which if you're manually
harvesting it

726
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
harvesting it
 

727
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,550
harvesting it
it can take a little bit of time all

728
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
it can take a little bit of time all
 

729
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,310
it can take a little bit of time all
right guys so this should be pretty fun

730
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
right guys so this should be pretty fun
 

731
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,110
right guys so this should be pretty fun
i've never

732
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
i've never
 

733
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,870
i've never
made a farm quite like what we're about

734
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
made a farm quite like what we're about
 

735
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,150
made a farm quite like what we're about
to build here i got an

736
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
to build here i got an
 

737
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,870
to build here i got an
idea in mind for it um so here's our

738
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
idea in mind for it um so here's our
 

739
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,030
idea in mind for it um so here's our
smelter building right over here

740
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
smelter building right over here
 

741
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,949
smelter building right over here
and we're going to try to keep it fairly

742
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
and we're going to try to keep it fairly
 

743
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,910
and we're going to try to keep it fairly
close to that so we can send the fuel

744
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
close to that so we can send the fuel
 

745
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,230
close to that so we can send the fuel
by rail or something to it and we don't

746
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
by rail or something to it and we don't
 

747
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,069
by rail or something to it and we don't
have to move it ourselves manually it'll

748
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079
have to move it ourselves manually it'll
 

749
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,470
have to move it ourselves manually it'll
be all automatic hopefully

750
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480
be all automatic hopefully
 

751
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,590
be all automatic hopefully
and we're going to just build the

752
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
and we're going to just build the
 

753
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,670
and we're going to just build the
mushroom farm around the perimeter of

754
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
mushroom farm around the perimeter of
 

755
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,829
mushroom farm around the perimeter of
our pumpkin farm here

756
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
our pumpkin farm here
 

757
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,910
our pumpkin farm here
i think would be a good idea should look

758
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
i think would be a good idea should look
 

759
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,150
i think would be a good idea should look
half decent that way too

760
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
half decent that way too
 

761
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,550
half decent that way too
because we need a big long straight line

762
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
because we need a big long straight line
 

763
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,269
because we need a big long straight line
for this

764
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:57,279
for this
 

765
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,629
for this
is is the goal so one issue about

766
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
is is the goal so one issue about
 

767
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,550
is is the goal so one issue about
like trees is leafy spawn time right

768
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
like trees is leafy spawn time right
 

769
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,470
like trees is leafy spawn time right
with mushrooms that's not going to be as

770
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
with mushrooms that's not going to be as
 

771
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,310
with mushrooms that's not going to be as
big of a problem like after you chop it

772
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
big of a problem like after you chop it
 

773
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,110
big of a problem like after you chop it
down

774
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
down
 

775
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,030
down
you don't have to wait for the leaves to

776
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
you don't have to wait for the leaves to
 

777
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,030
you don't have to wait for the leaves to
to disappear and like

778
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
to disappear and like
 

779
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,910
to disappear and like
reclaim the drops the saplings with

780
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
reclaim the drops the saplings with
 

781
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,670
reclaim the drops the saplings with
mushrooms you chop it down

782
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
mushrooms you chop it down
 

783
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,350
mushrooms you chop it down
then you grow another one you chop it

784
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
then you grow another one you chop it
 

785
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,030
then you grow another one you chop it
down and you grow another one so that's

786
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
down and you grow another one so that's
 

787
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,230
down and you grow another one so that's
what we're hopefully going to be able to

788
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
what we're hopefully going to be able to
 

789
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,150
what we're hopefully going to be able to
do with this

790
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
do with this
 

791
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,110
do with this
let's first figure out how high this has

792
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
let's first figure out how high this has
 

793
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,949
let's first figure out how high this has
to be i want to dig two blocks down

794
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
to be i want to dig two blocks down
 

795
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,269
to be i want to dig two blocks down
maybe we'll go up to here so you in

796
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
maybe we'll go up to here so you in
 

797
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,150
maybe we'll go up to here so you in
order to get it

798
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
order to get it
 

799
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,150
order to get it
to grow on normal soil you need to build

800
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
to grow on normal soil you need to build
 

801
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,310
to grow on normal soil you need to build
a sun shield

802
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
a sun shield
 

803
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,069
a sun shield
for the mushroom so you got to go and

804
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
for the mushroom so you got to go and
 

805
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,590
for the mushroom so you got to go and
make a diamond above it

806
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
make a diamond above it
 

807
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,710
make a diamond above it
at the minimum that's the center you

808
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
at the minimum that's the center you
 

809
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,110
at the minimum that's the center you
gotta

810
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
gotta
 

811
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,870
gotta
go two blocks out from it all around

812
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
go two blocks out from it all around
 

813
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,230
go two blocks out from it all around
all right let's see if that'll grow

814
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240
all right let's see if that'll grow
 

815
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,069
all right let's see if that'll grow
yeah now we can plant it here okay cool

816
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,079
yeah now we can plant it here okay cool
 

817
00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,069
yeah now we can plant it here okay cool
so if we grow this it will be

818
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079

 

819
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,990

uh yeah that's perfect that's exactly

820
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
uh yeah that's perfect that's exactly
 

821
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,430
uh yeah that's perfect that's exactly
what i want so i want it to be

822
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
what i want so i want it to be
 

823
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,949
what i want so i want it to be
where we can walk underneath it

824
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959

 

825
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,389

and it always grows one block below

826
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
and it always grows one block below
 

827
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,150
and it always grows one block below
your barrier up here so it'll always

828
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
your barrier up here so it'll always
 

829
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,750
your barrier up here so it'll always
leave an air space there

830
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
leave an air space there
 

831
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,350
leave an air space there
so if for example we set up

832
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
so if for example we set up
 

833
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,430
so if for example we set up
something for us to walk uh walk on at

834
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
something for us to walk uh walk on at
 

835
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,629
something for us to walk uh walk on at
this level

836
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
this level
 

837
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,750
this level
and we use our our axe

838
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
and we use our our axe
 

839
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,030
and we use our our axe
we'll be able to instant mine all the

840
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
we'll be able to instant mine all the
 

841
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,949
we'll be able to instant mine all the
way down like that and then if we go on

842
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
way down like that and then if we go on
 

843
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,269
way down like that and then if we go on
the other side

844
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:29,279
the other side
 

845
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,550
the other side
we'll get the other part of it right

846
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
we'll get the other part of it right
 

847
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,069
we'll get the other part of it right
and that'll be a pretty quick way of

848
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
and that'll be a pretty quick way of
 

849
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,949
and that'll be a pretty quick way of
chopping down a mushroom i think

850
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
chopping down a mushroom i think
 

851
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,710
chopping down a mushroom i think
but let's not just settle on the first

852
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:38,720
but let's not just settle on the first
 

853
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,389
but let's not just settle on the first
idea guys let's try a couple different

854
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
idea guys let's try a couple different
 

855
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,829
idea guys let's try a couple different
things here and figure out what is the

856
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
things here and figure out what is the
 

857
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,470
things here and figure out what is the
best

858
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
best
 

859
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,030
best
method for chopping down mushrooms uh so

860
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,040
method for chopping down mushrooms uh so
 

861
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,030
method for chopping down mushrooms uh so
i grew them in a line like i plan on

862
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
i grew them in a line like i plan on
 

863
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,910
i grew them in a line like i plan on
i'm doing in the farm here and we're

864
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
i'm doing in the farm here and we're
 

865
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,710
i'm doing in the farm here and we're
gonna try out mr horsey first off

866
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:52,720
gonna try out mr horsey first off
 

867
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,230
gonna try out mr horsey first off
got a couple ideas to try out i think

868
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
got a couple ideas to try out i think
 

869
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,150
got a couple ideas to try out i think
the horses could actually be really good

870
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
the horses could actually be really good
 

871
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,430
the horses could actually be really good
though

872
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
though
 

873
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,430
though
um because horses are fast if you have a

874
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
um because horses are fast if you have a
 

875
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,949
um because horses are fast if you have a
fast taurus and you give it a speed

876
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
fast taurus and you give it a speed
 

877
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,230
fast taurus and you give it a speed
potion

878
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
potion
 

879
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,790
potion
oh my goodness things will be crazy

880
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
oh my goodness things will be crazy
 

881
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,550
oh my goodness things will be crazy
let's see if we can instant mine while

882
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
let's see if we can instant mine while
 

883
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,990
let's see if we can instant mine while
riding a horse though okay so he's got

884
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
riding a horse though okay so he's got
 

885
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,910
riding a horse though okay so he's got
oh yeah we're fast we're fast

886
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920

 

887
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,990

oh oh yeah we go underneath the mushroom

888
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
oh oh yeah we go underneath the mushroom
 

889
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,030
oh oh yeah we go underneath the mushroom
if uh

890
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040

 

891
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,470

we go underneath the mushroom if we're

892
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
we go underneath the mushroom if we're
 

893
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,949
we go underneath the mushroom if we're
riding a horse too that's right

894
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:24,959
riding a horse too that's right
 

895
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,310
riding a horse too that's right
here let's let's do it a little bit less

896
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
here let's let's do it a little bit less
 

897
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,189
here let's let's do it a little bit less
chaotic let's just hold left and go

898
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
chaotic let's just hold left and go
 

899
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,670
chaotic let's just hold left and go
see if it gets every block or if it

900
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
see if it gets every block or if it
 

901
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,310
see if it gets every block or if it
leaves any behind

902
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
leaves any behind
 

903
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,069
leaves any behind
that's not bad that's not bad right

904
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:38,079
that's not bad that's not bad right
 

905
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,069
that's not bad that's not bad right
maybe if we had a haste beacon here it

906
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
maybe if we had a haste beacon here it
 

907
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,949
maybe if we had a haste beacon here it
would be better even

908
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
would be better even
 

909
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,949
would be better even
it's hard to say but yeah that's fast

910
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:44,959
it's hard to say but yeah that's fast
 

911
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,910
it's hard to say but yeah that's fast
that is really fast

912
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
that is really fast
 

913
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,629
that is really fast
cool okay that's one idea just out of

914
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
cool okay that's one idea just out of
 

915
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,150
cool okay that's one idea just out of
curiosity i want to see if we can

916
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
curiosity i want to see if we can
 

917
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,350
curiosity i want to see if we can
harvest the mushroom while flying

918
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360

 

919
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,509

what just happened i have no idea did

920
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
what just happened i have no idea did
 

921
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,189
what just happened i have no idea did
you see that i was like going slow and

922
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
you see that i was like going slow and
 

923
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,509
you see that i was like going slow and
then i just flew

924
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
then i just flew
 

925
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,829
then i just flew
that was crazy

926
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839

 

927
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,110

oh ah nah it's it's not really gonna

928
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
oh ah nah it's it's not really gonna
 

929
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,710
oh ah nah it's it's not really gonna
work

930
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
work
 

931
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,949
work
and let's go ahead and try out the mine

932
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
and let's go ahead and try out the mine
 

933
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,549
and let's go ahead and try out the mine
carts now i think this one will be

934
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:16,559
carts now i think this one will be
 

935
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,590
carts now i think this one will be
pretty good

936
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:17,600
pretty good
 

937
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,429
pretty good
so we're not going to have haste to

938
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
so we're not going to have haste to
 

939
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,949
so we're not going to have haste to
begin with and then as we get closer to

940
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
begin with and then as we get closer to
 

941
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:21,750
begin with and then as we get closer to
the beacon there

942
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,760
the beacon there
 

943
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,189
the beacon there
we will get haste and we'll see if that

944
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,199
we will get haste and we'll see if that
 

945
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,789
we will get haste and we'll see if that
makes a difference as we

946
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799
makes a difference as we
 

947
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,189
makes a difference as we
chop down here okay and we want to be

948
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
chop down here okay and we want to be
 

949
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,710
chop down here okay and we want to be
able to get at least half the mushroom

950
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:28,720
able to get at least half the mushroom
 

951
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,510
able to get at least half the mushroom
as we go

952
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520
as we go
 

953
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,190
as we go
so let's go

954
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
so let's go
 

955
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,070
so let's go
hold left click all the way down looks

956
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,080
hold left click all the way down looks
 

957
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,430
hold left click all the way down looks
like we're doing a fair bit of it i

958
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
like we're doing a fair bit of it i
 

959
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,789
like we're doing a fair bit of it i
don't know forgetting the entire thing

960
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
don't know forgetting the entire thing
 

961
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,070
don't know forgetting the entire thing
though

962
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
though
 

963
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,590
though
oh it's much like the horse like it's

964
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
oh it's much like the horse like it's
 

965
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,190
oh it's much like the horse like it's
it's it's kind of choppy like when

966
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,200
it's it's kind of choppy like when
 

967
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,630
it's it's kind of choppy like when
you're in a minecart or you're riding

968
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
you're in a minecart or you're riding
 

969
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,190
you're in a minecart or you're riding
something

970
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
something
 

971
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,470
something
you you uh

972
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
you you uh
 

973
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,470
you you uh
what am i what am i trying to say you

974
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
what am i what am i trying to say you
 

975
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,909
what am i what am i trying to say you
can only chop things down half

976
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
can only chop things down half
 

977
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,630
can only chop things down half
half the speed of normal so that is the

978
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:54,640
half the speed of normal so that is the
 

979
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,990
half the speed of normal so that is the
downside

980
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,000
downside
 

981
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,830
downside
and it looks like we're not doing enough

982
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:58,840
and it looks like we're not doing enough
 

983
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,150
and it looks like we're not doing enough
here

984
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
here
 

985
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,830
here
yeah because if we went by on the other

986
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
yeah because if we went by on the other
 

987
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,909
yeah because if we went by on the other
side we would leave blocks behind still

988
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919
side we would leave blocks behind still
 

989
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,590
side we would leave blocks behind still
so that's not gonna work i think we'll

990
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
so that's not gonna work i think we'll
 

991
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,630
so that's not gonna work i think we'll
just have to to watch it probably

992
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
just have to to watch it probably
 

993
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,390
just have to to watch it probably
oh check this out guys this trick still

994
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
oh check this out guys this trick still
 

995
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,830
oh check this out guys this trick still
works apparently like if you don't want

996
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
works apparently like if you don't want
 

997
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,710
works apparently like if you don't want
to set up

998
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
to set up
 

999
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,350
to set up
a sun shield for the mushrooms if i try

1000
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
a sun shield for the mushrooms if i try
 

1001
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,190
a sun shield for the mushrooms if i try
to place this here i can't i can't grow

1002
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200
to place this here i can't i can't grow
 

1003
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,630
to place this here i can't i can't grow
the mushroom here because it's in direct

1004
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:18,640
the mushroom here because it's in direct
 

1005
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,870
the mushroom here because it's in direct
sunlight but

1006
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
sunlight but
 

1007
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,390
sunlight but
if you place down a water bucket first

1008
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
if you place down a water bucket first
 

1009
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,390
if you place down a water bucket first
then place it in there before the water

1010
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,400
then place it in there before the water
 

1011
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,510
then place it in there before the water
spreads

1012
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
spreads
 

1013
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,909
spreads
then you can plant it down but as soon

1014
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,919
then you can plant it down but as soon
 

1015
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,190
then you can plant it down but as soon
as it updates it will

1016
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
as it updates it will
 

1017
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,950
as it updates it will
it'll pop off so you gotta like just

1018
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
it'll pop off so you gotta like just
 

1019
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,870
it'll pop off so you gotta like just
grow it right away

1020
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:34,880
grow it right away
 

1021
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,430
grow it right away
like uh let's try that again

1022
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,440

 

1023
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,350

or i bet if you try growing it and it

1024
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,360
or i bet if you try growing it and it
 

1025
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,630
or i bet if you try growing it and it
fails then it'll probably pop

1026
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
fails then it'll probably pop
 

1027
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,549
fails then it'll probably pop
off too like if there's

1028
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
off too like if there's
 

1029
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,830
off too like if there's
there's something blocking it from

1030
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
there's something blocking it from
 

1031
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,669
there's something blocking it from
growing like that

1032
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:49,679
growing like that
 

1033
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,470
growing like that
if we try to grow it oh it doesn't pop

1034
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
if we try to grow it oh it doesn't pop
 

1035
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:52,870
if we try to grow it oh it doesn't pop
off

1036
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
off
 

1037
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,390
off
really but if you place a block next to

1038
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
really but if you place a block next to
 

1039
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,070
really but if you place a block next to
it and it updates then it pops off weird

1040
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,080
it and it updates then it pops off weird
 

1041
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,590
it and it updates then it pops off weird
now we don't have a whole lot of time

1042
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
now we don't have a whole lot of time
 

1043
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,110
now we don't have a whole lot of time
left this episode guys but we'll we'll

1044
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
left this episode guys but we'll we'll
 

1045
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,350
left this episode guys but we'll we'll
try get started on this project anyways

1046
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360
try get started on this project anyways
 

1047
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,350
try get started on this project anyways
so i figured out a design i like here

1048
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,360
so i figured out a design i like here
 

1049
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,270
so i figured out a design i like here
for the sun shield

1050
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
for the sun shield
 

1051
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,950
for the sun shield
because we want to be able to grow our

1052
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
because we want to be able to grow our
 

1053
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,029
because we want to be able to grow our
mushrooms on regular dirt without

1054
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
mushrooms on regular dirt without
 

1055
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,390
mushrooms on regular dirt without
having to worry about anything

1056
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,400
having to worry about anything
 

1057
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,870
having to worry about anything
so this seems to work out pretty good uh

1058
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
so this seems to work out pretty good uh
 

1059
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,710
so this seems to work out pretty good uh
basically you need a five wide

1060
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
basically you need a five wide
 

1061
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,710
basically you need a five wide
area blocked above it and uh

1062
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
area blocked above it and uh
 

1063
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,070
area blocked above it and uh
put some glowstone over there so it'll

1064
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
put some glowstone over there so it'll
 

1065
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,990
put some glowstone over there so it'll
light up the area as well

1066
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
light up the area as well
 

1067
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,430
light up the area as well
but it's not too bright that the

1068
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
but it's not too bright that the
 

1069
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,270
but it's not too bright that the
mushroom can't grow there so that should

1070
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
mushroom can't grow there so that should
 

1071
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,190
mushroom can't grow there so that should
be good and let's just double check our

1072
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,200
be good and let's just double check our
 

1073
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,110
be good and let's just double check our
height again

1074
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
height again
 

1075
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,710
height again
yeah that's a good height there okay

1076
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:36,720
yeah that's a good height there okay
 

1077
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,470
yeah that's a good height there okay
cool uh so our

1078
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:38,480
cool uh so our
 

1079
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,750
cool uh so our
our thing we walk on is going to be

1080
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
our thing we walk on is going to be
 

1081
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,230
our thing we walk on is going to be
running all along here and all along

1082
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,240
running all along here and all along
 

1083
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,510
running all along here and all along
here

1084
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
here
 

1085
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,590
here
and then we'll also want to set up like

1086
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
and then we'll also want to set up like
 

1087
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,830
and then we'll also want to set up like
a water system to automatically collect

1088
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
a water system to automatically collect
 

1089
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,150
a water system to automatically collect
the

1090
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
the
 

1091
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,510
the
the drops together at some point here as

1092
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
the drops together at some point here as
 

1093
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,070
the drops together at some point here as
well

1094
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,080
well
 

1095
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,750
well
but this is the pattern i'm doing it's

1096
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
but this is the pattern i'm doing it's
 

1097
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,870
but this is the pattern i'm doing it's
pretty simple just glowstone there

1098
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880
pretty simple just glowstone there
 

1099
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,230
pretty simple just glowstone there
oak stairs all around that

1100
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,240
oak stairs all around that
 

1101
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,390
oak stairs all around that
and tried to break up the pattern a

1102
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400
and tried to break up the pattern a
 

1103
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,149
and tried to break up the pattern a
little bit with the bracing in between

1104
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
little bit with the bracing in between
 

1105
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,430
little bit with the bracing in between
with these dark oaks

1106
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
with these dark oaks
 

1107
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,789
with these dark oaks
and then we'll probably connect it on

1108
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:08,799
and then we'll probably connect it on
 

1109
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,870
and then we'll probably connect it on
the side somehow too

1110
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:10,880
the side somehow too
 

1111
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,630
the side somehow too
this part over here how did i do it

1112
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
this part over here how did i do it
 

1113
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,830
this part over here how did i do it
i think i did it like that and then

1114
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
i think i did it like that and then
 

1115
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,669
i think i did it like that and then
like that's not that you probably care

1116
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
like that's not that you probably care
 

1117
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,710
like that's not that you probably care
but i'll show you anyways um and then

1118
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
but i'll show you anyways um and then
 

1119
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,630
but i'll show you anyways um and then
like that and like that yeah that's

1120
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
like that and like that yeah that's
 

1121
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,190
like that and like that yeah that's
that's the pattern

1122
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,200
that's the pattern
 

1123
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,110
that's the pattern
and uh today i also want to show you

1124
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,120
and uh today i also want to show you
 

1125
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,190
and uh today i also want to show you
guys my rough plan for the redstone like

1126
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,200
guys my rough plan for the redstone like
 

1127
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,710
guys my rough plan for the redstone like
how we're gonna

1128
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:34,720
how we're gonna
 

1129
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,190
how we're gonna
operate this farm how it's gonna work so

1130
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
operate this farm how it's gonna work so
 

1131
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,070
operate this farm how it's gonna work so
obviously

1132
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,080
obviously
 

1133
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,470
obviously
we would like to have a dispenser to

1134
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
we would like to have a dispenser to
 

1135
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,590
we would like to have a dispenser to
grow the mushrooms

1136
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:41,600
grow the mushrooms
 

1137
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,669
grow the mushrooms
right this would be filled up with bone

1138
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:43,679
right this would be filled up with bone
 

1139
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,029
right this would be filled up with bone
meal which will hopefully

1140
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:45,039
meal which will hopefully
 

1141
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,590
meal which will hopefully
deliver with a a mine cart of some sort

1142
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600
deliver with a a mine cart of some sort
 

1143
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,190
deliver with a a mine cart of some sort
so we don't have to manually refill

1144
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
so we don't have to manually refill
 

1145
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,710
so we don't have to manually refill
each and every mushroom spot and

1146
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
each and every mushroom spot and
 

1147
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,990
each and every mushroom spot and
that'll make the the mushroom grow

1148
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
that'll make the the mushroom grow
 

1149
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,390
that'll make the the mushroom grow
and then what we want to do is deal with

1150
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
and then what we want to do is deal with
 

1151
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,310
and then what we want to do is deal with
the mushroom stem so i picked this

1152
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,320
the mushroom stem so i picked this
 

1153
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,390
the mushroom stem so i picked this
height for a reason

1154
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
height for a reason
 

1155
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,149
height for a reason
there's four mushroom stem blocks in

1156
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
there's four mushroom stem blocks in
 

1157
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,830
there's four mushroom stem blocks in
total two of them are above ground and

1158
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:05,840
total two of them are above ground and
 

1159
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,830
total two of them are above ground and
two of them are below ground like if we

1160
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:07,840
two of them are below ground like if we
 

1161
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,070
two of them are below ground like if we
if we mine these out see there's two

1162
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
if we mine these out see there's two
 

1163
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,669
if we mine these out see there's two
blocks down there

1164
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
blocks down there
 

1165
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,190
blocks down there
dealing with these is a little bit

1166
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,200
dealing with these is a little bit
 

1167
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,750
dealing with these is a little bit
tricky with a mushroom farm

1168
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:15,760
tricky with a mushroom farm
 

1169
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,950
tricky with a mushroom farm
but i have an idea we're gonna set up

1170
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
but i have an idea we're gonna set up
 

1171
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,230
but i have an idea we're gonna set up
two pistons over here to push us

1172
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,240
two pistons over here to push us
 

1173
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,390
two pistons over here to push us
the stem sideways when it grows and then

1174
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
the stem sideways when it grows and then
 

1175
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,350
the stem sideways when it grows and then
we'll

1176
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,360
we'll
 

1177
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,430
we'll
probably control those with like

1178
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,440

 

1179
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,029

a redstone torch here we'll probably go

1180
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:31,039
a redstone torch here we'll probably go
 

1181
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,549
a redstone torch here we'll probably go
down again

1182
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
down again
 

1183
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,870
down again
like that okay and then

1184
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
like that okay and then
 

1185
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,470
like that okay and then
what do we want to do guys i want to

1186
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
what do we want to do guys i want to
 

1187
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,070
what do we want to do guys i want to
give a shout out to

1188
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
give a shout out to
 

1189
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,110
give a shout out to

1192
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
blocks came out
 

1193
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,710
blocks came out
i saw he posted a video with all kinds

1194
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
i saw he posted a video with all kinds
 

1195
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,390
i saw he posted a video with all kinds

double extenders different designs for

1198
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
double extenders different designs for
 

1199
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,750
double extenders different designs for
double extenders and

1200
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
double extenders and
 

1201
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,190
double extenders and
i'm going to be using one of them over

1202
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,200
i'm going to be using one of them over
 

1203
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,830
i'm going to be using one of them over
here so

1204
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:55,840
here so
 

1205
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,510
here so
sticky piston regular piston

1206
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520
sticky piston regular piston
 

1207
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,830
sticky piston regular piston
and i think he had a block underneath

1208
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
and i think he had a block underneath
 

1209
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,029
and i think he had a block underneath
here i'm trying to build this off of

1210
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,039
here i'm trying to build this off of
 

1211
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,029
here i'm trying to build this off of
memory a little bit

1212
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
memory a little bit
 

1213
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,270
memory a little bit
and you send power to this block over

1214
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:07,280
and you send power to this block over
 

1215
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,750
and you send power to this block over
here to activate it

1216
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:09,760
here to activate it
 

1217
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,630
here to activate it
then i think he puts let's see i think

1218
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:12,640
then i think he puts let's see i think
 

1219
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,590
then i think he puts let's see i think
he put a piston over here

1220
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
he put a piston over here
 

1221
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,750
he put a piston over here
yeah so that gets that gets activated

1222
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:17,760
yeah so that gets that gets activated
 

1223
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,710
yeah so that gets that gets activated
and then he faced his observer

1224
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
and then he faced his observer
 

1225
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,789
and then he faced his observer
that's a dispenser observer blocks

1226
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:22,799
that's a dispenser observer blocks
 

1227
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,310
that's a dispenser observer blocks
downwards so when

1228
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
downwards so when
 

1229
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,430
downwards so when
the piston arm gets detected it'll send

1230
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
the piston arm gets detected it'll send
 

1231
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,789
the piston arm gets detected it'll send
power to

1232
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
power to
 

1233
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,909
power to
this block over here

1234
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:31,919
this block over here
 

1235
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,830
this block over here
and when this piston is up one block

1236
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
and when this piston is up one block
 

1237
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,990
and when this piston is up one block
then it gets powered from that

1238
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
then it gets powered from that
 

1239
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,830
then it gets powered from that
and yeah i think that's that's the idea

1240
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:39,840
and yeah i think that's that's the idea
 

1241
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,270
and yeah i think that's that's the idea
let's go ahead and try it

1242
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,280
let's go ahead and try it
 

1243
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,029
let's go ahead and try it
hopefully i didn't mess that up so let's

1244
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:43,039
hopefully i didn't mess that up so let's
 

1245
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,950
hopefully i didn't mess that up so let's
pretend these glowstone blocks

1246
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:44,960
pretend these glowstone blocks
 

1247
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,950
pretend these glowstone blocks
are mushroom stems right

1248
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:48,960
are mushroom stems right
 

1249
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,110
are mushroom stems right
so no

1250
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,120
so no
 

1251
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,110
so no
well these two would push them over to

1252
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,120
well these two would push them over to
 

1253
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,789
well these two would push them over to
over here then

1254
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:56,799
over here then
 

1255
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,870
over here then
so let's put them over there first then

1256
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
so let's put them over there first then
 

1257
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,390
so let's put them over there first then
we press the button

1258
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
we press the button
 

1259
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,990
we press the button
and you see it makes it go up two blocks

1260
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000
and you see it makes it go up two blocks
 

1261
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,830
and you see it makes it go up two blocks
so it would then be next to the mushroom

1262
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:03,840
so it would then be next to the mushroom
 

1263
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,350
so it would then be next to the mushroom
stem that's over here

1264
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,360
stem that's over here
 

1265
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,710
stem that's over here
they'll be grouped which is pretty cool

1266
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
they'll be grouped which is pretty cool
 

1267
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,950
they'll be grouped which is pretty cool
if you put a sticky piston up over here

1268
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
if you put a sticky piston up over here
 

1269
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,990
if you put a sticky piston up over here
it'll actually

1270
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
it'll actually
 

1271
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,350
it'll actually
pull the block down as well

1272
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
pull the block down as well
 

1273
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,230
pull the block down as well
you see that that's so cool such a good

1274
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
you see that that's so cool such a good
 

1275
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,230
you see that that's so cool such a good
design and you can tile this design

1276
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240
design and you can tile this design
 

1277
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,230
design and you can tile this design
like side by side and it works which is

1278
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,240
like side by side and it works which is
 

1279
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,830
like side by side and it works which is
amazing

1280
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:23,840
amazing
 

1281
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,870
amazing
very cool stuff all right so yeah we'll

1282
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:26,880
very cool stuff all right so yeah we'll
 

1283
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,870
very cool stuff all right so yeah we'll
use a regular piston there

1284
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:28,880
use a regular piston there
 

1285
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,390
use a regular piston there
okay so let's try to figure out the

1286
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:30,400
okay so let's try to figure out the
 

1287
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,310
okay so let's try to figure out the
timing we need on this thing

1288
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
timing we need on this thing
 

1289
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,310
timing we need on this thing
um i think we want to activate the

1290
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,320
um i think we want to activate the
 

1291
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,990
um i think we want to activate the
double extenders first and then

1292
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
double extenders first and then
 

1293
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,990
double extenders first and then
these pistons on the side i think would

1294
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,000
these pistons on the side i think would
 

1295
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,110
these pistons on the side i think would
be better

1296
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
be better
 

1297
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,549
be better
so i have four ticks of delay over there

1298
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
so i have four ticks of delay over there
 

1299
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,710
so i have four ticks of delay over there
and we have a monostable circuit here

1300
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
and we have a monostable circuit here
 

1301
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,430
and we have a monostable circuit here
see if we can use this

1302
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,440

 

1303
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,029

i think that worked right

1304
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
i think that worked right
 

1305
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,750
i think that worked right
and then oh no no this block's not

1306
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:55,760
and then oh no no this block's not
 

1307
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,710
and then oh no no this block's not
supposed to be there

1308
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:58,720

 

1309
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,750

huh i wonder if that broke it yeah i did

1310
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:01,760
huh i wonder if that broke it yeah i did
 

1311
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,070
huh i wonder if that broke it yeah i did
this

1312
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,080
this
 

1313
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,190
this
piston is not supposed to be there

1314
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,200
piston is not supposed to be there
 

1315
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,350
piston is not supposed to be there
either okay so we're doing it too fast

1316
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360
either okay so we're doing it too fast
 

1317
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,909
either okay so we're doing it too fast
let's slow it down

1318
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
let's slow it down
 

1319
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,830
let's slow it down
let's try hmm

1320
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
let's try hmm
 

1321
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,870
let's try hmm
we will bump this up to four i think the

1322
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
we will bump this up to four i think the
 

1323
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,230
we will bump this up to four i think the
the delay was too short

1324
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
the delay was too short
 

1325
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,549
the delay was too short
okay let's try this again make sure it

1326
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
okay let's try this again make sure it
 

1327
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,149
okay let's try this again make sure it
doesn't break

1328
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159

 

1329
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,149

okay that time the piston retracted with

1330
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:26,159
okay that time the piston retracted with
 

1331
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,669
okay that time the piston retracted with
it that's good

1332
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:27,679
it that's good
 

1333
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,070
it that's good
and this did not go though let's add

1334
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,080
and this did not go though let's add
 

1335
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,789
and this did not go though let's add
maybe a little bit more delay here okay

1336
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:34,799
maybe a little bit more delay here okay
 

1337
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,470
maybe a little bit more delay here okay
let's try again that time it seemed like

1338
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:36,480
let's try again that time it seemed like
 

1339
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,870
let's try again that time it seemed like
it worked

1340
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880

 

1341
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,149

yeah so that would go up you would

1342
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:40,159
yeah so that would go up you would
 

1343
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,310
yeah so that would go up you would
harvest this and then you're left with a

1344
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,320
harvest this and then you're left with a
 

1345
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,230
harvest this and then you're left with a
one by one hole instead of a two by one

1346
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,240
one by one hole instead of a two by one
 

1347
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,669
one by one hole instead of a two by one
another thing we're gonna do with this

1348
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
another thing we're gonna do with this
 

1349
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,669
another thing we're gonna do with this
guys is we're gonna plant mushrooms

1350
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:49,679
guys is we're gonna plant mushrooms
 

1351
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,830
guys is we're gonna plant mushrooms
diagonal of the spot over here

1352
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:51,840
diagonal of the spot over here
 

1353
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,590
diagonal of the spot over here
so we can put one over here one over

1354
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:53,600
so we can put one over here one over
 

1355
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,510
so we can put one over here one over
there and hopefully we can squeeze them

1356
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
there and hopefully we can squeeze them
 

1357
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,149
there and hopefully we can squeeze them
in

1358
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
in
 

1359
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,390
in
in a couple other spots so that this

1360
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400
in a couple other spots so that this
 

1361
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,909
in a couple other spots so that this
will be the only place they can spread

1362
00:24:59,909 --> 00:24:59,919
will be the only place they can spread
 

1363
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:00,630
will be the only place they can spread
to

1364
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,640
to
 

1365
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,630
to
and when they spread there we don't even

1366
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
and when they spread there we don't even
 

1367
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,549
and when they spread there we don't even
necessarily have to plant them ourselves

1368
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,559
necessarily have to plant them ourselves
 

1369
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,310
necessarily have to plant them ourselves
they'll just spread to that spot and

1370
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320
they'll just spread to that spot and
 

1371
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,750
they'll just spread to that spot and
grow automatically

1372
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760
grow automatically
 

1373
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,470
grow automatically
which would be cool uh but let's go

1374
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:10,480
which would be cool uh but let's go
 

1375
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,430
which would be cool uh but let's go
ahead and try this

1376
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
ahead and try this
 

1377
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,510
ahead and try this
uh using mushroom blocks now so these

1378
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
uh using mushroom blocks now so these
 

1379
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,269
uh using mushroom blocks now so these
two blocks would always stay here these

1380
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:15,279
two blocks would always stay here these
 

1381
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,630
two blocks would always stay here these
two mushroom blocks right

1382
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:16,640
two mushroom blocks right
 

1383
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,510
two mushroom blocks right
so that we have a one by one hole and

1384
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,520
so that we have a one by one hole and
 

1385
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,310
so that we have a one by one hole and
then

1386
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,320
then
 

1387
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,190
then
this would grow grow

1388
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,200

 

1389
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,350

no nothing blocking it okay just got

1390
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
no nothing blocking it okay just got
 

1391
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,029
no nothing blocking it okay just got
unlucky

1392
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039
unlucky
 

1393
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,549
unlucky
and then when you press the button

1394
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:32,559
and then when you press the button
 

1395
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,950
and then when you press the button
it'll do that so there'll be a two by

1396
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:34,960
it'll do that so there'll be a two by
 

1397
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,549
it'll do that so there'll be a two by
two thing of stems here

1398
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
two thing of stems here
 

1399
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,590
two thing of stems here
and then when you chop that down

1400
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
and then when you chop that down
 

1401
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,350
and then when you chop that down
these two blocks will be there still

1402
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,360
these two blocks will be there still
 

1403
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,870
these two blocks will be there still
okay so then you just gotta remove the

1404
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:42,880
okay so then you just gotta remove the
 

1405
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,070
okay so then you just gotta remove the
top here

1406
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,080
top here
 

1407
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,390
top here
and hopefully that will make this fairly

1408
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:46,400
and hopefully that will make this fairly
 

1409
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,909
and hopefully that will make this fairly
easy to do

1410
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:47,919
easy to do
 

1411
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,510
easy to do
and then there's gonna be water streams

1412
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:49,520
and then there's gonna be water streams
 

1413
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,950
and then there's gonna be water streams
like here

1414
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:50,960
like here
 

1415
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,149
like here
here here and here to push all the

1416
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:54,159
here here and here to push all the
 

1417
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,350
here here and here to push all the
the drops to the center here um

1418
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,360
the drops to the center here um
 

1419
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,870
the drops to the center here um
all the drops will fall down this hole

1420
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
all the drops will fall down this hole
 

1421
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,149
all the drops will fall down this hole
and then we'll have a hopper mine cart

1422
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:00,159
and then we'll have a hopper mine cart
 

1423
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,990
and then we'll have a hopper mine cart
that runs underneath that dirt block

1424
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,000
that runs underneath that dirt block
 

1425
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,630
that runs underneath that dirt block
there

1426
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
there
 

1427
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,029
there
to pick up the stuff through the ground

1428
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
to pick up the stuff through the ground
 

1429
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,549
to pick up the stuff through the ground
is my plan that's what i want to do

gonna have to wrap up here
 

1443
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,950
gonna have to wrap up here
uh this is how we get snowballs in case

1444
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:22,960
uh this is how we get snowballs in case
 

1445
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,470
uh this is how we get snowballs in case
you didn't know

1446
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
you didn't know
 

1447
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,549

uh we'll try to get more done on that
 

1449
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,149
uh we'll try to get more done on that
mushroom farm next episode and probably

1450
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:28,159
mushroom farm next episode and probably
 

1451
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,510
mushroom farm next episode and probably
some other things as well

1452
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:29,520
some other things as well
 

1453

treasure dave i know it was basically

1460
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:37,600
treasure dave i know it was basically
 

1461
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,350
treasure dave i know it was basically
abandoned since it wasn't too efficient

1462
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,360
abandoned since it wasn't too efficient
 

1463
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,630
abandoned since it wasn't too efficient
or practical

1464
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
or practical
 

1465
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,470
or practical
but what happened to the space you had

1466
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
but what happened to the space you had
 

1467
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,149
but what happened to the space you had
cleared

1468
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
cleared
 

1469
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,750
cleared
nobody ever asks about the treasure cave

1470
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:45,760
nobody ever asks about the treasure cave
 

1471
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,430
nobody ever asks about the treasure cave
i think about it all the time but nobody

1472
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:47,440
i think about it all the time but nobody
 

1473
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,310
i think about it all the time but nobody
cares about it

1474
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320

except for you good sir or madame
 

1477
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,029
except for you good sir or madame
uh yeah this is the way over to the

1478
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:53,039
uh yeah this is the way over to the
 

1479
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,350
uh yeah this is the way over to the
treasure cave we don't go over here too

1480
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,360
treasure cave we don't go over here too
 

1481
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,630
treasure cave we don't go over here too
often

1482
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
often
 

1483
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,870
often
uh the original plan with this was to

1484
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
uh the original plan with this was to
 

1485
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,870
uh the original plan with this was to
have our

1486
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:00,880
have our
 

1487
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,549
have our
if any of you played donkey kong country

1488
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:02,559
if any of you played donkey kong country
