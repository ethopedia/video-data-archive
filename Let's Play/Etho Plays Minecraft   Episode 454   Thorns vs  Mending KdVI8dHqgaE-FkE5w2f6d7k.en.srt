stuff breaks super quickly if you have

338
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
stuff breaks super quickly if you have
 

339
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,469
stuff breaks super quickly if you have
thorns

340
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
thorns
 

341
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,430
thorns
but if you combine it with mending i'm

342
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
but if you combine it with mending i'm
 

343
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,550
but if you combine it with mending i'm
just checking if

344
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
just checking if
 

345
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,550
just checking if
if the xp you get from the mobs is

346
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
if the xp you get from the mobs is
 

347
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,710
if the xp you get from the mobs is
enough to repair it

348
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
enough to repair it
 

349
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,309
enough to repair it
compared to how much damage it takes

350
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
compared to how much damage it takes
 

351
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,029
compared to how much damage it takes
and so far it almost looks like the

352
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
and so far it almost looks like the
 

353
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,230
and so far it almost looks like the
armor is breaking

354
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
armor is breaking
 

355
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,589
armor is breaking
i'm gonna have to test it for a little

356
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
i'm gonna have to test it for a little
 

357
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,270
i'm gonna have to test it for a little
bit longer

358
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
bit longer
 

359
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,230
bit longer
94 93 the boots are taking longer to

360
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
94 93 the boots are taking longer to
 

361
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,870
94 93 the boots are taking longer to
repair

362
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
repair
 

363
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,710
repair
oh now we're back up to 95.

364
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720

 

365
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,909

i don't know it's kind of weird

366
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
i don't know it's kind of weird
 

367
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,070
i don't know it's kind of weird
i also heard there's might be a glitch

368
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
i also heard there's might be a glitch
 

369
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,150
i also heard there's might be a glitch
in the game

370
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
in the game
 

371
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,749
in the game
which i'm curious about

372
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759

 

373
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,790

let's see how did he die he was so far

374
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
let's see how did he die he was so far
 

375
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,309
let's see how did he die he was so far
away

376
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
away
 

377
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,830
away

00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
that was very weird oh yeah and because
 

383
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,070
that was very weird oh yeah and because
they're attacking me

384
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
they're attacking me
 

385
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,830
they're attacking me
it counts as my kill right so i think

386
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:29,840
it counts as my kill right so i think
 

387
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,749
it counts as my kill right so i think
the looting effect from my sword

388
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
the looting effect from my sword
 

389
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,790
the looting effect from my sword
takes effect and i also get the special

390
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
takes effect and i also get the special
 

391
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,670
takes effect and i also get the special
drops so like

392
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
drops so like
 

393
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,350

spiders give me spider eyes which you

394
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
spiders give me spider eyes which you
 

395

normally don't get if you just drop them

396
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
normally don't get if you just drop them
 

397
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,110
normally don't get if you just drop them
and and obviously you could apply this

398
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
and and obviously you could apply this
 

399
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,790
and and obviously you could apply this
to lots of other different farms this

400
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
to lots of other different farms this
 

401
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,469
to lots of other different farms this
concept

402
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
concept
 

403
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,110
concept
um yeah i heard though there might be a

404
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
um yeah i heard though there might be a
 

405
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,110
um yeah i heard though there might be a
glitch where if you

406
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
glitch where if you
 

407
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,189
glitch where if you
put an item with thorns in your off hand

408
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199

but it doesn't take durability which
 

415
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,670
but it doesn't take durability which
would be super cheaty

416
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:03,680
would be super cheaty
 

417
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,150
would be super cheaty

i have decided let's go into a creative

476
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
i have decided let's go into a creative
 

477
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,949
i have decided let's go into a creative
world

478
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
world
 

479
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,230
world
because i was having a lot of trouble

480
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
because i was having a lot of trouble
 

481
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,550
because i was having a lot of trouble
testing out this whole thorns concept

482
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
testing out this whole thorns concept
 

483
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,630
testing out this whole thorns concept
in my lp world that spider farm for

484
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
in my lp world that spider farm for
 

485
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,590
in my lp world that spider farm for
example

486
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
example
 

487
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,269
example
i wasn't dropping the spiders from the

488
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
i wasn't dropping the spiders from the
 

489
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,710
i wasn't dropping the spiders from the
proper height so sometimes they were

490
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
proper height so sometimes they were
 

491
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,870
proper height so sometimes they were
taking more than one hit to kill

492
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
taking more than one hit to kill
 

493
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,310
taking more than one hit to kill
with the thorns armor and that was

494
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
with the thorns armor and that was
 

495
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,070
with the thorns armor and that was
throwing off the whole math the whole

496
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
throwing off the whole math the whole
 

497
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,750
throwing off the whole math the whole
point of this is just to see if the

498
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
point of this is just to see if the
 

499
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,509
point of this is just to see if the
armor is able to repair itself

500
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
armor is able to repair itself
 

501
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,190
armor is able to repair itself
so we need we need to make sure all the

502
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
so we need we need to make sure all the
 

503
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,750
so we need we need to make sure all the
mobs die in one hit from the armor

504
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
mobs die in one hit from the armor
 

505
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,430
mobs die in one hit from the armor
so i decided let's go to creative world

506
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
so i decided let's go to creative world
 

507
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,110
so i decided let's go to creative world
i set up a quick enderman farm here

508
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
i set up a quick enderman farm here
 

509
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,269
i set up a quick enderman farm here
because it's one of the easiest farms to

510
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
because it's one of the easiest farms to
 

511
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,069
because it's one of the easiest farms to
to do this with although it doesn't make

512
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
to do this with although it doesn't make
 

513
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,910
to do this with although it doesn't make
a lot of sense

514
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
a lot of sense
 

515
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,670
a lot of sense
you would probably want to do this idea

516
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
you would probably want to do this idea
 

517
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,310
you would probably want to do this idea
more with like a afk wither skeleton

518
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
more with like a afk wither skeleton
 

519
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,829
more with like a afk wither skeleton
firm or something like that so

520
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
firm or something like that so
 

521
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,430
firm or something like that so
something that has a special drop like a

522
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
something that has a special drop like a
 

523
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,230
something that has a special drop like a
wither head or spider eyes from spiders

524
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
wither head or spider eyes from spiders
 

525
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,269
wither head or spider eyes from spiders
or

526
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
or
 

527
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,790
or
gold ingots from gold from zombie pigmen

528
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
gold ingots from gold from zombie pigmen
 

529
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,310
gold ingots from gold from zombie pigmen
that kind of thing you know enderman

530
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
that kind of thing you know enderman
 

531
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,750
that kind of thing you know enderman
they just drop ender pearls so you don't

532
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
they just drop ender pearls so you don't
 

533
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,949
they just drop ender pearls so you don't
need to farm extras

534
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
need to farm extras
 

535
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,069
need to farm extras
of those uh but let's just use this to

536
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
of those uh but let's just use this to
 

537
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,670
of those uh but let's just use this to
try out the concept so let's go

538
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
try out the concept so let's go
 

539
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,470
try out the concept so let's go
oh we are in game mode zero good so what

540
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
oh we are in game mode zero good so what
 

541
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,990
oh we are in game mode zero good so what
you would do

542
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
you would do
 

543
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,829
you would do
set it up so that you can afk and the

544
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
set it up so that you can afk and the
 

545
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,069
set it up so that you can afk and the
mobs come attack you so with enderman i

546
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
mobs come attack you so with enderman i
 

547
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,750
mobs come attack you so with enderman i
have a line of sight set up here so that

548
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
have a line of sight set up here so that
 

549
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,710
have a line of sight set up here so that
they

550
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
they
 

551
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,150
they
i get into this loop of pain this never

552
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
i get into this loop of pain this never
 

553
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,389
i get into this loop of pain this never
ending onslaught and we're

554
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
ending onslaught and we're
 

555
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,030
ending onslaught and we're
just checking if we can gain any levels

556
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
just checking if we can gain any levels
 

557
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,710
just checking if we can gain any levels
and if our armor can keep up

558
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
and if our armor can keep up
 

559
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,150
and if our armor can keep up
repairing itself also i wanted to know

560
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
repairing itself also i wanted to know
 

561
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,710
repairing itself also i wanted to know
how

562
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
how
 

563
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,710
how
how good the beacon was at keeping us

564
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
how good the beacon was at keeping us
 

565
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,030
how good the beacon was at keeping us
alive so we do have resistance to

566
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
alive so we do have resistance to
 

567
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,590
alive so we do have resistance to
and regeneration but if i stop eating

568
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
and regeneration but if i stop eating
 

569
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,829
and regeneration but if i stop eating
they do actually kill me you see my

570
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
they do actually kill me you see my
 

571
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,350
they do actually kill me you see my
hearts are going down so i have to keep

572
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
hearts are going down so i have to keep
 

573
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,389
hearts are going down so i have to keep
eating

574
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399
eating
 

575
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,269
eating
on hard mode here in order to stay alive

576
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
on hard mode here in order to stay alive
 

577
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,269
on hard mode here in order to stay alive
on normal you might be able to

578
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
on normal you might be able to
 

579
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,110
on normal you might be able to
survive this i'm not sure let's go to a

580
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
survive this i'm not sure let's go to a
 

581
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,069
survive this i'm not sure let's go to a
difficulty

582
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079

 

583
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,430

can't spell normal

584
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
can't spell normal
 

585
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,870
can't spell normal
maybe okay let's not eat

586
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
maybe okay let's not eat
 

587
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,750
maybe okay let's not eat
see if our hearts stay up or nuts

588
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
see if our hearts stay up or nuts
 

589
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,870
see if our hearts stay up or nuts
see this is more bounced

590
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
see this is more bounced
 

591
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,350
see this is more bounced
uh looks like they are going down still

592
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
uh looks like they are going down still
 

593
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,990
uh looks like they are going down still
though

594
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
though
 

595
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,470
though
so yeah you would need to play on easy

596
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
so yeah you would need to play on easy
 

597
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,670
so yeah you would need to play on easy
probably to do this

598
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
probably to do this
 

599
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,389
probably to do this
with enderman anyway um if it's a mob

600
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
with enderman anyway um if it's a mob
 

601
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,550
with enderman anyway um if it's a mob
that does less damage

602
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
that does less damage
 

603
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,990
that does less damage
it's a really stupid idea i'm just

604
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
it's a really stupid idea i'm just
 

605
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,990
it's a really stupid idea i'm just
telling you that now it doesn't seem

606
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
telling you that now it doesn't seem
 

607
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,430
telling you that now it doesn't seem
like it's gonna work

608
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
like it's gonna work
 

609
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,190
like it's gonna work
and also the durability on the armor is

610
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
and also the durability on the armor is
 

611
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,790
and also the durability on the armor is
going down

612
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
going down
 

613
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,710
going down
so that's no no bueno uh

614
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
so that's no no bueno uh
 

615
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,230
so that's no no bueno uh
but it was a fun concept to try out

616
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
but it was a fun concept to try out
 

617
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,870
but it was a fun concept to try out
anyway if i get rid of like

618
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
anyway if i get rid of like
 

619
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,190
anyway if i get rid of like
my full set of thorns here um

620
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
my full set of thorns here um
 

621
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,470
my full set of thorns here um
let's say i just do one piece of thorns

622
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,480
let's say i just do one piece of thorns
 

623
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,269
let's say i just do one piece of thorns
three and the rest is regular armor like

624
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
three and the rest is regular armor like
 

625
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,790
three and the rest is regular armor like
protection

626
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
protection
 

627
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,990
protection
protection armor here put that on so

628
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
protection armor here put that on so
 

629
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,750
protection armor here put that on so
because when you use thorns you lose

630
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
because when you use thorns you lose
 

631
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,590
because when you use thorns you lose
three durability when its effect takes

632
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
three durability when its effect takes
 

633
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,230
three durability when its effect takes
place

634
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
place
 

635
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,150
place
you just have regular armor durability

636
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
you just have regular armor durability
 

637
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,430
you just have regular armor durability
is gonna go down a lot less

638
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:39,440
is gonna go down a lot less
 

639
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,110
is gonna go down a lot less
but i think what happens as well the

640
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
but i think what happens as well the
 

641
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,710
but i think what happens as well the
endermen don't necessarily

642
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
endermen don't necessarily
 

643
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,990
endermen don't necessarily
die every time they hit you

644
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
die every time they hit you
 

645
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,190
die every time they hit you
if you don't have as much thorns

646
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
if you don't have as much thorns
 

647
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,470
if you don't have as much thorns
although it looks like it's just about

648
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
although it looks like it's just about
 

649
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,790
although it looks like it's just about
every time right

650
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
every time right
 

651
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,629
every time right
you see the endermans turn red and die

652
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
you see the endermans turn red and die
 

653
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,910
you see the endermans turn red and die
on the side there

654
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
on the side there
 

655
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,430
on the side there
right there i think i got hit six or

656
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
right there i think i got hit six or
 

657
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,990
right there i think i got hit six or
seven times in a row without any dying

658
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,000
seven times in a row without any dying
 

659
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,069
seven times in a row without any dying
so you do want more more thorns

660
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
so you do want more more thorns
 

661
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,069
so you do want more more thorns
pieces than just one

662
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
pieces than just one
 

663
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,190
pieces than just one
um and even with just

664
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
um and even with just
 

665
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,590
um and even with just
one it seems like the durability still

666
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:13,600
one it seems like the durability still
 

667
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,389
one it seems like the durability still
goes down

668
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
goes down
 

669
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,230
goes down
right

670
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240

 

671
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,509

it's like just a little bit of a loss on

672
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
it's like just a little bit of a loss on
 

673
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,790
it's like just a little bit of a loss on
the durability yeah it's going down

674
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
the durability yeah it's going down
 

675
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,310
the durability yeah it's going down
quite a bit actually

676
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
quite a bit actually
 

677
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,069
quite a bit actually
the chest piece so

678
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
the chest piece so
 

679
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,790
the chest piece so
yeah that is the idea it doesn't work

680
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
yeah that is the idea it doesn't work
 

681
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,230
yeah that is the idea it doesn't work
just thought i would show you though

682
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
just thought i would show you though
 

683
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,030
just thought i would show you though
now one other thing here if you do the

684
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
now one other thing here if you do the
 

685
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,790
now one other thing here if you do the
chidi thing where you put the thorns

686
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
chidi thing where you put the thorns
 

687
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,189
chidi thing where you put the thorns
piece

688
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,199
piece
 

689
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,750
piece
in your off hand so you don't lose the

690
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
in your off hand so you don't lose the
 

691
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,470
in your off hand so you don't lose the
crazy

692
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
crazy
 

693
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,030
crazy
durability from the thorns effect and

694
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
durability from the thorns effect and
 

695
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,829
durability from the thorns effect and
then the rest of this is just normal

696
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:46,839
then the rest of this is just normal
 

697
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,230
then the rest of this is just normal
armor then

698
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
armor then
 

699
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,670
armor then
it seems it can actually keep up

700
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
it seems it can actually keep up
 

701
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,110
it seems it can actually keep up
repairing the armor so it would never

702
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
repairing the armor so it would never
 

703
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,030
repairing the armor so it would never
break when you're afk

704
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
break when you're afk
 

705
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,150
break when you're afk
because that's what's going to kill you

706
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
because that's what's going to kill you
 

707
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,670
because that's what's going to kill you
if your armor breaks when you're aft

708
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
if your armor breaks when you're aft
 

709
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,030
if your armor breaks when you're aft
eventually

710
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
eventually
 

711
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,509
eventually
you would die from the mobs right with

712
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
you would die from the mobs right with
 

713
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,389
you would die from the mobs right with
this method

714
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
this method
 

715
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,310
this method
it seems like it can keep up with xp you

716
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
it seems like it can keep up with xp you
 

717
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,670
it seems like it can keep up with xp you
get

718
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
get
 

719
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,590
get
and you even gain a little bit extra my

720
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
and you even gain a little bit extra my
 

721
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,350
and you even gain a little bit extra my
levels are going up ever so slightly

722
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,360
levels are going up ever so slightly
 

723
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,629
levels are going up ever so slightly
here

724
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639

 

725
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,269

maybe maybe you could get this to work

726
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
maybe maybe you could get this to work
 

727
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,030
maybe maybe you could get this to work
but this is a bit of a cheating concept

728
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
but this is a bit of a cheating concept
 

729
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,069
but this is a bit of a cheating concept
because i don't know if this is

730
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
because i don't know if this is
 

731
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,310
because i don't know if this is
intended they might eventually patch

732
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320
intended they might eventually patch
 

733
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,150
intended they might eventually patch
that feature

734
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
that feature
 

735
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,389
that feature
it's hard to say you never know with

736
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
it's hard to say you never know with
 

737
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,110
it's hard to say you never know with
mojang

738
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120

 

739
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,629

wait a minute here i just had another

740
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639
wait a minute here i just had another
 

741
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,470
wait a minute here i just had another
idea let's be thorough

742
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480
idea let's be thorough
 

743
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,069
idea let's be thorough
i forgot you could probably do something

744
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
i forgot you could probably do something
 

745
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,590
i forgot you could probably do something
with shields too right

746
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
with shields too right
 

747
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,710
with shields too right
so in survival mode you can put

748
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
so in survival mode you can put
 

749
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,189
so in survival mode you can put
unbreaking on the shields but mending on

750
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
unbreaking on the shields but mending on
 

751
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,069
unbreaking on the shields but mending on
a shield

752
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
a shield
 

753
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,949
a shield
you cannot put thorns on a shield though

754
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
you cannot put thorns on a shield though
 

755
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,629
you cannot put thorns on a shield though
all right

756
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
all right
 

757
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,189
all right
so this would lower the amount of damage

758
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:45,199
so this would lower the amount of damage
 

759
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,629
so this would lower the amount of damage
you take right

760
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639

 

761
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,350

oh man that shield is breaking fast and

762
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,360
oh man that shield is breaking fast and
 

763
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,750
oh man that shield is breaking fast and
it's

764
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:53,760
it's
 

765
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,189
it's
gone all right that mending did not save

766
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
gone all right that mending did not save
 

767
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,430
gone all right that mending did not save
it

768
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,440
it
 

769
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,350
it
all right guys so we are back in our lp

770
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
all right guys so we are back in our lp
 

771
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,629
all right guys so we are back in our lp
world now i think we're done with the

772
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
world now i think we're done with the
 

773
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,910
world now i think we're done with the
testing

774
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
testing
 

775
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,990
testing
i have decided let's go ahead and just

776
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
i have decided let's go ahead and just
 

777
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,150
i have decided let's go ahead and just
do it just do it why not

778
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
do it just do it why not
 

779
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,670
do it just do it why not
i feel like building something now we're

a cave spider farm i think in my world i
actually don't

786
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
actually don't
 

787
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,990
actually don't
really have a good way of getting spider

788
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
really have a good way of getting spider
 

789
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,590
really have a good way of getting spider
eyes i've just been using the ones we

790
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600
eyes i've just been using the ones we
 

791
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,949
eyes i've just been using the ones we
collected like

792
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
collected like
 

793
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,910
collected like
hundreds of episodes ago i had at one

794
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
hundreds of episodes ago i had at one
 

795
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,269
hundreds of episodes ago i had at one
point probably three or four double

796
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
point probably three or four double
 

797
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,110
point probably three or four double
chests and this is what we're down to

798
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
chests and this is what we're down to
 

799
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,150
chests and this is what we're down to
now

800
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
now
 

801
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,030
now
uh this is like i think most of my stash

802
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
uh this is like i think most of my stash
 

803
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,230
uh this is like i think most of my stash
you use them up

804
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
you use them up
 

805
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,069
you use them up
not super quickly but because i use

806
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
not super quickly but because i use
 

807
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,150
not super quickly but because i use
potions a lot you do use them

808
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
potions a lot you do use them
 

809
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,470
potions a lot you do use them
with potions fermented spider eyes and

810
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
with potions fermented spider eyes and
 

811
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,550
with potions fermented spider eyes and
and like damage potions

812
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:40,560
and like damage potions
 

813
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,030
and like damage potions

814
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
use them up poison potions that kind of
 

815
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,910
use them up poison potions that kind of
thing

816
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
thing
 

817
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,310
thing
so slowly over time here i am running

818
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,320
so slowly over time here i am running
 

819
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,990
so slowly over time here i am running
out of them

820
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
out of them
 

821
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,150
out of them
and since we're looking for a farm to do

822
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
and since we're looking for a farm to do
 

823
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,990
and since we're looking for a farm to do
this with i think a spider farm is a

824
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,000
this with i think a spider farm is a
 

825
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,350
this with i think a spider farm is a
good idea

826
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
good idea
 

827
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,710
good idea
so off over this way

828
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
so off over this way
 

829
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,189
so off over this way
a long long time ago i believe we found

830
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
a long long time ago i believe we found
 

831
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,269
a long long time ago i believe we found
a dual cave spider spawner

832
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
a dual cave spider spawner
 

833
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,150
a dual cave spider spawner
another one i have two already and i

834
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
another one i have two already and i
 

835
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,430
another one i have two already and i
found another one over here

836
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,440
found another one over here
 

837
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,110
found another one over here
that i think we'll use

838
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
that i think we'll use
 

839
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,470
that i think we'll use
just so i don't have to modify the other

840
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:10,480
just so i don't have to modify the other
 

841
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,790
just so i don't have to modify the other
ones was it this ravine or was it

842
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
ones was it this ravine or was it
 

843
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,350
ones was it this ravine or was it
was there another ravine after this i

844
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
was there another ravine after this i
 

845
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,790
was there another ravine after this i
think there was another ravine after

846
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
think there was another ravine after
 

847
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,949
think there was another ravine after
this

848
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:18,959
this
 

849
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,470
this
yeah okay and also beyond the village if

850
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
yeah okay and also beyond the village if
 

851
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,829
yeah okay and also beyond the village if
we ever want to expand it this is

852
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
we ever want to expand it this is
 

853
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,189
we ever want to expand it this is
probably where we're going to go

854
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
probably where we're going to go
 

855
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,230
probably where we're going to go
off to this area is this ravine no this

856
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,240
off to this area is this ravine no this
 

857
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,790
off to this area is this ravine no this
is just the mine shaft

858
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
is just the mine shaft
 

859
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,590
is just the mine shaft
okay i want to show you guys where it is

860
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
okay i want to show you guys where it is
 

861
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,350
okay i want to show you guys where it is
if we can find it

862
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
if we can find it
 

863
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,949
if we can find it
and dead

864
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959

 

865
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,069

and free all right good

866
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
and free all right good
 

867
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,069
and free all right good
now i'm all disoriented where where were

868
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:44,079
now i'm all disoriented where where were
 

869
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,310
now i'm all disoriented where where were
we i think we ender pearled up here

870
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,320
we i think we ender pearled up here
 

871
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,749
we i think we ender pearled up here
yeah oh yeah here here this is it

872
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
yeah oh yeah here here this is it
 

873
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,389
yeah oh yeah here here this is it
so this is a ravine we found a long time

874
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
so this is a ravine we found a long time
 

875
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,150
so this is a ravine we found a long time
ago

876
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
ago
 

877
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,590
ago
and i remember being off this way

878
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
and i remember being off this way
 

879
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,509
and i remember being off this way
i think floating floating

880
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
i think floating floating
 

881
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,069
i think floating floating
oh it's over there okay yeah i guess

882
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
oh it's over there okay yeah i guess
 

883
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,429
oh it's over there okay yeah i guess
it's kind of above the ravine

884
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
it's kind of above the ravine
 

885
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,429
it's kind of above the ravine
can we get to there let's just enter

886
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
can we get to there let's just enter
 

887
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,390
can we get to there let's just enter
pearl i guess

888
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400

 

889
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,069

so there's one over here and then i

890
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
so there's one over here and then i
 

891
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,150
so there's one over here and then i
think there was one more

892
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
think there was one more
 

893
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,350
think there was one more
this way yeah right there

894
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:17,360
this way yeah right there
 

895
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,630
this way yeah right there
side by side perfectly united

896
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
side by side perfectly united
 

897
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,309
side by side perfectly united
can't ask for much better so this is

898
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
can't ask for much better so this is
 

899
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,829
can't ask for much better so this is
going to be great

900
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:23,839
going to be great
 

901
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,470
going to be great
and i haven't made like a mob spawner

902
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
and i haven't made like a mob spawner
 

903
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,789
and i haven't made like a mob spawner
mop farm

904
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
mop farm
 

905
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,630
mop farm
what did i just say i haven't made a

906
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
what did i just say i haven't made a
 

907
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,630
what did i just say i haven't made a
like a farm that uses mob spawners in a

908
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,640
like a farm that uses mob spawners in a
 

909
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,070
like a farm that uses mob spawners in a
long time so i'm

910
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
long time so i'm
 

911
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,750
long time so i'm
kind of curious how the mechanics have

912
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
kind of curious how the mechanics have
 

913
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,350
kind of curious how the mechanics have
changed i heard there was a change

914
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
changed i heard there was a change
 

915
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,510
changed i heard there was a change
recently i think in 1.8

916
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
recently i think in 1.8
 

917
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,669
recently i think in 1.8
where it takes a nine by nine spawning

918
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
where it takes a nine by nine spawning
 

919
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,590
where it takes a nine by nine spawning
area now instead of eight by eight

920
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
area now instead of eight by eight
 

921
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,669
area now instead of eight by eight
so we'll test that out and also i just

922
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
so we'll test that out and also i just
 

923
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,830
so we'll test that out and also i just
want to get used to

924
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:47,840
want to get used to
 

925
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,950
want to get used to
how the cave spider path finding works

926
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
how the cave spider path finding works
 

927
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,909
how the cave spider path finding works
and all that kind of stuff because i

928
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
and all that kind of stuff because i
 

929
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,350
and all that kind of stuff because i
haven't done anything with them in so

930
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,360
haven't done anything with them in so
 

931
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,190
haven't done anything with them in so
long so i think this will be

932
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
long so i think this will be
 

933
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,870
long so i think this will be
a pretty fun project oh i actually had a

934
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
a pretty fun project oh i actually had a
 

935
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,470
a pretty fun project oh i actually had a
way down

936
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
way down
 

937
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,190
way down
from the surface interesting so yeah let

938
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
from the surface interesting so yeah let
 

939
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,710
from the surface interesting so yeah let
me clear out some space here

940
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720
me clear out some space here
 

941
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,310
me clear out some space here
i guess i'll set up the beacons already

942
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
i guess i'll set up the beacons already
 

943
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,150
i guess i'll set up the beacons already
to do that

944
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
to do that
 

945
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,190
to do that
okay very cool guys so now uh we got a

946
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,200
okay very cool guys so now uh we got a
 

947
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,870
okay very cool guys so now uh we got a
fair bit of space cleared out here i'm

948
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:10,880
fair bit of space cleared out here i'm
 

949
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,510
fair bit of space cleared out here i'm
starting to enclose the spawners making

950
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,520
starting to enclose the spawners making
 

951
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,230
starting to enclose the spawners making
a room just big enough to maximize the

952
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,240
a room just big enough to maximize the
 

953
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,230
a room just big enough to maximize the
spawning potential

954
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
spawning potential
 

955
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,590
spawning potential
from the spawners how many times did i

956
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
from the spawners how many times did i
 

957
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,350
from the spawners how many times did i
say spawn in that sentence i don't even

958
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
say spawn in that sentence i don't even
 

959
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,070
say spawn in that sentence i don't even
know

960
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
know
 

961
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,070
know
alright so i'm going to leave one

962
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
alright so i'm going to leave one
 

963
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,669
alright so i'm going to leave one
airspace above

964
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
airspace above
 

965
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,270
airspace above
one airspace below the spawners and then

966
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
one airspace below the spawners and then
 

967
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,830
one airspace below the spawners and then
water

968
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
water
 

969
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,310
water
at this level here to push them off of

970
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
at this level here to push them off of
 

971
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,430
at this level here to push them off of
here

972
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440
here
 

973
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,110
here
is what i'm going to try to begin with

974
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120
is what i'm going to try to begin with
 

975
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,630
is what i'm going to try to begin with
here anyway

976
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
here anyway
 

977
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,630
here anyway
so in the past this is what we really

978
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
so in the past this is what we really
 

979
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,110
so in the past this is what we really
got to test

980
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
got to test
 

981
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,110
got to test
they used to only spawn in an eight by

982
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
they used to only spawn in an eight by
 

983
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,070
they used to only spawn in an eight by
eight that was true with all spawners

984
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
eight that was true with all spawners
 

985
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,190
eight that was true with all spawners
favoring the negative coordinates so

986
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
favoring the negative coordinates so
 

987
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,470
favoring the negative coordinates so
let's test the positive coordinates here

988
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
let's test the positive coordinates here
 

989
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,310
let's test the positive coordinates here
which is this way and this way so this

990
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
which is this way and this way so this
 

991
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,990
which is this way and this way so this
way and this way are positive

992
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
way and this way are positive
 

993
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,990
way and this way are positive
x and z um that means in the past

994
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,000
x and z um that means in the past
 

995
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,830
x and z um that means in the past
let's count it from the spawner spawners

996
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
let's count it from the spawner spawners
 

997
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,190
let's count it from the spawner spawners
over here so one

998
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
over here so one
 

999
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,390
over here so one
two three four and

1000
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
two three four and
 

1001
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,510
two three four and
one two three four so this row

1002
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
one two three four so this row
 

1003
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,950
one two three four so this row
all the way down here they used to not

1004
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
all the way down here they used to not
 

1005
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,029
all the way down here they used to not
be able to spawn it and

1006
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
be able to spawn it and
 

1007
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,470
be able to spawn it and
all the way one two three oh i think i

1008
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
all the way one two three oh i think i
 

1009
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,830
all the way one two three oh i think i
got marked here actually and all the way

1010
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
got marked here actually and all the way
 

1011
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,950
got marked here actually and all the way
down this row

1012
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:22,960
down this row
 

1013
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,070
down this row
so let's make a dark

1014
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
so let's make a dark
 

1015
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,390
so let's make a dark
at that row and just see if we can get

1016
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
at that row and just see if we can get
 

1017
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,710
at that row and just see if we can get
any to spawn in this tiny little space

1018
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:30,720
any to spawn in this tiny little space
 

1019
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,630
any to spawn in this tiny little space
we give them

1020
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640

 

1021
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,070

and if they can spawn in here that means

1022
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
and if they can spawn in here that means
 

1023
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,830
and if they can spawn in here that means
it's true

1024
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
it's true
 

1025
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,669
it's true
so and it'll be a nine by nine then

1026
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
so and it'll be a nine by nine then
 

1027
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,950
so and it'll be a nine by nine then
so i'll oh

1028
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:46,960

 

1029
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,830

oh wow okay that was fast i did not cut

1030
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
oh wow okay that was fast i did not cut
 

1031
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,430
oh wow okay that was fast i did not cut
there that just happened right away so

1032
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
there that just happened right away so
 

1033
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,549
there that just happened right away so
that was awesome

1034
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
that was awesome
 

1035
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,029
that was awesome
so it is true it's a 9x9 now by the

1036
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:55,039
so it is true it's a 9x9 now by the
 

1037
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,150
so it is true it's a 9x9 now by the
looks of it

1038
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
looks of it
 

1039
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:04,830
looks of it
so i'm going to make my room here that

1040
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:04,840

 

1041
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,540

big

1042
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:07,550
big
 

1043
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:18,149
big
[Applause]

1044
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:18,159

 

1045
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,710

oh oops okay a little problem has come

1046
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720
oh oops okay a little problem has come
 

1047
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,190
oh oops okay a little problem has come
up here

1048
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
up here
 

1049
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,390
up here
because we're doing a 9x9 area guys the

1050
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
because we're doing a 9x9 area guys the
 

1051
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,029
because we're doing a 9x9 area guys the
water

1052
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:27,039
water
 

1053
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,029
water
doesn't reach all the way if you put in

1054
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:29,039
doesn't reach all the way if you put in
 

1055
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,710
doesn't reach all the way if you put in
the back here because it only travels

1056
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,720
the back here because it only travels
 

1057
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,230
the back here because it only travels
eight blocks right

1058
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,240
eight blocks right
 

1059
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,510
eight blocks right
which is perfect for spawners usually

1060
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:35,520
which is perfect for spawners usually
 

1061
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,789
which is perfect for spawners usually
but if you want to take advantage of the

1062
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:36,799
but if you want to take advantage of the
 

1063
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,190
but if you want to take advantage of the
full 9x9 space now

1064
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
full 9x9 space now
 

1065
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,990
full 9x9 space now
uh that means we have to do a step down

1066
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,000
uh that means we have to do a step down
 

1067
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,990
uh that means we have to do a step down
somewhere like this

1068
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,000
somewhere like this
 

1069
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,590
somewhere like this
which doesn't look as clean

1070
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600

 

1071
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,149

but yeah i guess i'll do that uh the

1072
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
but yeah i guess i'll do that uh the
 

1073
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,590
but yeah i guess i'll do that uh the
reason we're doing this whole water

1074
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:51,600
reason we're doing this whole water
 

1075
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,270
reason we're doing this whole water
thing instead of dropping them right off

1076
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
thing instead of dropping them right off
 

1077
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,909
thing instead of dropping them right off
the bat

1078
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
the bat
 

1079
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,390
the bat
by the way if they were to spawn at this

1080
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400
by the way if they were to spawn at this
 

1081
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,830
by the way if they were to spawn at this
top block

1082
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
top block
 

1083
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,909
top block
compared to this bottom block that makes

1084
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
compared to this bottom block that makes
 

1085
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,110
compared to this bottom block that makes
one heart difference

1086
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
one heart difference
 

1087
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,950
one heart difference
in their total health after we drop them

1088
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:02,960
in their total health after we drop them
 

1089
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,950
in their total health after we drop them
here oops

1090
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
here oops
 

1091
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,230
here oops
i fell down um we want to get him to

1092
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
i fell down um we want to get him to
 

1093
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,950
i fell down um we want to get him to
exactly one hit to kill him with our

1094
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:10,960
exactly one hit to kill him with our
 

1095
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,470
exactly one hit to kill him with our
thorn's armor otherwise we're going to

1096
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
thorn's armor otherwise we're going to
 

1097
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,950
thorn's armor otherwise we're going to
lose a lot more durability on it

1098
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
lose a lot more durability on it
 

1099
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,110
lose a lot more durability on it
and that can't happen as we saw in our

1100
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,120
and that can't happen as we saw in our
 

1101
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,750
and that can't happen as we saw in our
testing the threshold is very

1102
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
testing the threshold is very
 

1103
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,149
testing the threshold is very
very close at the moment so we don't

1104
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:22,159
very close at the moment so we don't
 

1105
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,110
very close at the moment so we don't
want to lose

1106
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120
want to lose
 

1107
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,549
want to lose
any more durability on it

1108
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:26,559
any more durability on it
 

1109
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,990
any more durability on it
so we're going to try to drop them

1110
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,000
so we're going to try to drop them
 

1111
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,909
so we're going to try to drop them
consistently from the same height every

1112
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:29,919
consistently from the same height every
 

1113
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,149
consistently from the same height every
time

1114
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:32,159
time
 

1115
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,190
time
okay so i put the water in the back

1116
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,200
okay so i put the water in the back
 

1117
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,710
okay so i put the water in the back
there you see how the back is

1118
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
there you see how the back is
 

1119
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,789
there you see how the back is
is higher than the front they still have

1120
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
is higher than the front they still have
 

1121
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,190
is higher than the front they still have
the one air space below the spawner

1122
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,200
the one air space below the spawner
 

1123
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,390
the one air space below the spawner
totally free though um

1124
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
totally free though um
 

1125
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,830
totally free though um
so the water brings them to the edge

1126
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:45,840
so the water brings them to the edge
 

1127
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,630
so the water brings them to the edge
here we drop them down

1128
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
here we drop them down
 

1129
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,070
here we drop them down
and i'm just watching how they behave

1130
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
and i'm just watching how they behave
 

1131
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,909
and i'm just watching how they behave
like do they try to climb

1132
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
like do they try to climb
 

1133
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,350
like do they try to climb
do they get stuck anywhere that sort of

1134
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
do they get stuck anywhere that sort of
 

1135
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,149
do they get stuck anywhere that sort of
thing

1136
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
thing
 

1137
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,390
thing
and also i'm trying to find the sweet

1138
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:00,400
and also i'm trying to find the sweet
 

1139
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,909
and also i'm trying to find the sweet
spots

1140
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
spots
 

1141
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,750
spots
where they don't die when they hit the

1142
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
where they don't die when they hit the
 

1143
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,070
where they don't die when they hit the
ground but i can kill them with a punch

1144
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,080
ground but i can kill them with a punch
 

1145
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,149
ground but i can kill them with a punch
like that so that's good

1146
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
like that so that's good
 

1147
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,669
like that so that's good
are they dying it's like a big

1148
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:13,679
are they dying it's like a big
 

1149
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,630
are they dying it's like a big
big mess here string everywhere the idea

1150
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
big mess here string everywhere the idea
 

1151
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:16,870
big mess here string everywhere the idea
is

1152
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:16,880
is
 

1153
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,310
is
we stand over here underneath the

1154
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,320
we stand over here underneath the
 

1155
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,270
we stand over here underneath the
spawners so we're within range of them

1156
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
spawners so we're within range of them
 

1157
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,470
spawners so we're within range of them
we drop them down to one hit

1158
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
we drop them down to one hit
 

1159
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,549
we drop them down to one hit
oh yeah see some of them are falling too

1160
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:26,559
oh yeah see some of them are falling too
 

1161
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,230
oh yeah see some of them are falling too
far still

1162
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,240
far still
 

1163
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,110
far still
so i might have to raise this a block or

1164
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,120
so i might have to raise this a block or
 

1165
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,990
so i might have to raise this a block or
maybe even a

1166
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
maybe even a
 

1167
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,029
maybe even a
half slab maybe i should do a slab

1168
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
half slab maybe i should do a slab
 

1169
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,950
half slab maybe i should do a slab
because it's like just on the verge of

1170
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
because it's like just on the verge of
 

1171
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,470
because it's like just on the verge of
sometimes like

1172
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
sometimes like
 

1173
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,230
sometimes like
depending on where they are on the water

1174
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
depending on where they are on the water
 

1175
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,830
depending on where they are on the water
when they fall down

1176
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
when they fall down
 

1177
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,750
when they fall down
they might be a little bit higher a

1178
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:45,760
they might be a little bit higher a
 

1179
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,669
they might be a little bit higher a
little bit lower

1180
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
little bit lower
 

1181
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,190
little bit lower
because they kind of swim on the water

1182
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,200
because they kind of swim on the water
 

1183
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,350
because they kind of swim on the water
you know they go up and down on it

1184
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,360
you know they go up and down on it
 

1185
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,430
you know they go up and down on it
so i'm gonna put some slabs down here i

1186
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,440
so i'm gonna put some slabs down here i
 

1187
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,070
so i'm gonna put some slabs down here i
guess and hopefully that'll fix it

1188
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080

 

1189
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,789

okay still not working even with the

1190
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:00,799
okay still not working even with the
 

1191
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,230
okay still not working even with the
slab higher

1192
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
slab higher
 

1193
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,750
slab higher
some of them are also taking more than

1194
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:03,760
some of them are also taking more than
 

1195
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,230
some of them are also taking more than
one hit to kill so i'm trying to add a

1196
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,240
one hit to kill so i'm trying to add a
 

1197
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,149
one hit to kill so i'm trying to add a

so i left a slab spacing there hopefully

1230
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
so i left a slab spacing there hopefully
 

1231
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,029
so i left a slab spacing there hopefully
that is enough for them to fit through

1232
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,039
that is enough for them to fit through
 

1233
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,029
that is enough for them to fit through
if they climb above that like they were

1234
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,039
if they climb above that like they were
 

1235
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,430
if they climb above that like they were
doing um they should eventually let

all will be good
 

1241
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,510
all will be good
i'll just have to monitor it for a

1242
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,520
i'll just have to monitor it for a
 

1243
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,870
i'll just have to monitor it for a
little bit here

1244
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:02,880

 

1245
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,630

got through for sure
 

1263
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,549
got through for sure
they didn't die they should be one hit

1264
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:24,559
they didn't die they should be one hit
 

1265
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,830
they didn't die they should be one hit
kills for sure

1266
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840
kills for sure
 

1267
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,909
kills for sure
what oh no way

1268
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:29,919
what oh no way
 

1269
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,909
what oh no way
are they climbing as they fall down

1270
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:33,919

 

1271
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,590

that must be what it is then

1272
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600

 

1273
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,750

or maybe just before they hit the ground

1274
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:39,760
or maybe just before they hit the ground
 

1275
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,909
or maybe just before they hit the ground
they pathfind towards me and then start

1276
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
they pathfind towards me and then start
 

1277
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,590
they pathfind towards me and then start
climbing on the wall towards

1278
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600
climbing on the wall towards
 

1279
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,390
climbing on the wall towards
towards me i think that could be it

1280
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
towards me i think that could be it
 

1281
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,390
towards me i think that could be it
yeah this guy was not a one-hit kill

1282
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
yeah this guy was not a one-hit kill
 

1283
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,510
yeah this guy was not a one-hit kill
again

1284
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:51,520
again
 

1285
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,549
again
so they're clinging on this wall as they

1286
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:54,559
so they're clinging on this wall as they
 

1287
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:59,990
so they're clinging on this wall as they
fall down i'll have to remove it then

1288
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
fall down i'll have to remove it then
 

1289
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,950
fall down i'll have to remove it then
okay so guys i think we might actually

1290
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:02,960
okay so guys i think we might actually
 

1291
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,990
okay so guys i think we might actually
have this working

1292
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,000
have this working
 

1293
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,710
have this working
pretty good now we're getting great

1294
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
pretty good now we're getting great
 

1295
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,470
pretty good now we're getting great
spawning rates

1296
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
spawning rates
 

1297
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,430
spawning rates
um you'll notice my hearts are not going

1298
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
um you'll notice my hearts are not going

um you'll notice my hearts are not going
down

1300
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
down
 

1301
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,510
down
i have solved the inconsistency problem

1302
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
i have solved the inconsistency problem
 

1303
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,909
i have solved the inconsistency problem
as well so by removing

1304
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:17,919
as well so by removing
 

1305
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,510
as well so by removing
oh let a few of these guys die

1306
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,520
oh let a few of these guys die
 

1307
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,390

uh by removing the walls as they fall

1308
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,400
uh by removing the walls as they fall
 

1309
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,830
uh by removing the walls as they fall
down you see how it's three wide up

1310
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:25,840
down you see how it's three wide up
 

1311
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,390
down you see how it's three wide up
there now

1312
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:26,400
there now
 

1313
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,149
there now
they have no way of clinging to them as

1314
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:28,159
they have no way of clinging to them as
 

1315
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,510
they have no way of clinging to them as
they fall so

1316
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
they fall so
 

1317
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,510
they fall so
it's consistently getting them down to

1318
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:31,520
it's consistently getting them down to
 

1319
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,350
it's consistently getting them down to
half a heart one hit kill with the

much damage to me let's just go away
 

1431
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,789
much damage to me let's just go away
in a little hidey hole here

1432
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:54,799

 

1433
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,789

let the poison run out and see if i can

1434
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:56,799
let the poison run out and see if i can
 

1435
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,070
let the poison run out and see if i can
recover then

1436
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,080
recover then
 

1437
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,070
recover then
we could do something like set up a

1438
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
we could do something like set up a
 

1439
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,230
we could do something like set up a
hopper timer

1440
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,240
hopper timer
 

1441
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,230
hopper timer
uh to pull us out of danger so we we're

1442
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:04,240
uh to pull us out of danger so we we're
 

1443
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,070
uh to pull us out of danger so we we're
not poisoned constantly and see if we

1444
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,080
not poisoned constantly and see if we
 

1445
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,029
not poisoned constantly and see if we
can recover that way

1446
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:09,039
can recover that way
 

1447
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,389
can recover that way
let's see if our hearts go up now that

1448
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:10,399
let's see if our hearts go up now that
 

1449
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,070
let's see if our hearts go up now that
we're not poisoned

1450
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,080
we're not poisoned
 

1451
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,990
we're not poisoned
so we're at one one and a half one

1452
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
so we're at one one and a half one
 

1453
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,750
so we're at one one and a half one
i kind of get the impression i can't

1454
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:17,760
i kind of get the impression i can't
 

1455
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,389
i kind of get the impression i can't
heal at all

1456
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:20,399
heal at all
 

1457
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,669
heal at all
the the damage from not having food is

1458
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:23,679
the the damage from not having food is
 

1459
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,750
the the damage from not having food is
equivalent to the regeneration we get

1460
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:25,760
equivalent to the regeneration we get
 

1461
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,269
equivalent to the regeneration we get
from the beacon

1462
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:27,279
from the beacon
 

1463
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,549
from the beacon
which is why i'm dying slowly here

1464
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:30,559
which is why i'm dying slowly here
 

1465
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,710
which is why i'm dying slowly here
yeah ah

1466
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:34,720
yeah ah
 

1467
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,389
yeah ah
that that kind of stinks

1468
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:38,399
that that kind of stinks
 

1469
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,149
that that kind of stinks
so the only way to recover health then

1470
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
so the only way to recover health then
 

1471
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,190
so the only way to recover health then
is to get like instant health potions

1472
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,200
is to get like instant health potions
 

1473
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,510
is to get like instant health potions
dispensed on us every so often

1474
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520

 

1475
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,389

that complicates things greatly

1476
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:50,399
that complicates things greatly
 

1477
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,909
that complicates things greatly

00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:25,919
does work so normally you get zero to
 

1505
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,350
does work so normally you get zero to
two string

1506
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:27,360
two string
 

1507
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,029
two string
per kill that time i got three i believe

1508
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:31,039
per kill that time i got three i believe
 

1509
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,310
per kill that time i got three i believe
and a 33 chance of getting one spider

1510
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,320
and a 33 chance of getting one spider
 

1511
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,789
and a 33 chance of getting one spider
eye

1512
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:34,799
eye
 

1513
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,269
eye
so we're at 37 we just got four spider

1514
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:37,279
so we're at 37 we just got four spider
 

1515
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:37,990
so we're at 37 we just got four spider
eyes

1516
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,000
eyes
 

1517
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,029
eyes
three spider eyes three more right

1518
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:43,039
three spider eyes three more right
 

1519
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,230
three spider eyes three more right
i'm very bad at counting

1520
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,240

 

1521
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,909

so yeah definitely getting the looting

1522

so yeah definitely getting the looting
 

1523
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,430
so yeah definitely getting the looting
effect so that's cool

1524
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:49,440
effect so that's cool
 

1525
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,830
effect so that's cool
the idea is we would set up a hopper

1526
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:51,840
the idea is we would set up a hopper
 

1527
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,990
the idea is we would set up a hopper
kind of like where we're standing

1528
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,000
kind of like where we're standing
 

1529
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,909
kind of like where we're standing
or a few hoppers actually to pick up the

1530
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
or a few hoppers actually to pick up the
 

1531
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,590
or a few hoppers actually to pick up the
string and the spider eyes

1532
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:57,600
string and the spider eyes
 

1533
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,630
string and the spider eyes
item filters to sort it and it seems

1534
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
item filters to sort it and it seems
 

1535
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,029
item filters to sort it and it seems
like

1536
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:01,039
like
 

1537
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,789
like
if i actually want to do this i'm going

1538
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:02,799
if i actually want to do this i'm going
 

1539
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,870
if i actually want to do this i'm going
to need some sort of brewing system to

1540
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:04,880
to need some sort of brewing system to
 

1541
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,350
to need some sort of brewing system to
keep me alive as well

1542
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,360
keep me alive as well
 

1543
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,990
keep me alive as well
unless you guys have another idea but i

1544
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,000
unless you guys have another idea but i
 

1545
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,789
unless you guys have another idea but i
think like a

1546
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:10,799
think like a
 

1547
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,630
think like a
instant health potion every five minutes

1548
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:12,640
instant health potion every five minutes

or so
 

1551
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,669
or so
should do the trick but yeah otherwise

1552
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:17,679
should do the trick but yeah otherwise
 

1553
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,630
should do the trick but yeah otherwise
it's totally

1554

00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:03,519
i do find my space bar on this keyboard
 

1583
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,269
i do find my space bar on this keyboard
though is not the best like a lot of

1584
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:05,279
though is not the best like a lot of
 

1585
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:05,990
though is not the best like a lot of
times

1586
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,000
times
 

1587
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,669
times
because i have to hold like two or three

1588
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:07,679
because i have to hold like two or three
 

1589

buttons down at the same time
sometimes the space bar doesn't want to

1592
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:10,720
sometimes the space bar doesn't want to
 

1593
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,149
sometimes the space bar doesn't want to
work

1594
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:12,159
work
 

1595
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,549
work
um but yeah guys we're gonna have to

um but yeah guys we're gonna have to
 

1597
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,230
um but yeah guys we're gonna have to
finish it up next episode

1598
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,240
finish it up next episode

we are pretty much out of time here so
 

1601
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,870
we are pretty much out of time here so
let's do the comment of the day

1602
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:20,880
let's do the comment of the day
 

1603
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,269
let's do the comment of the day
and if you have ideas for it let me know

1604
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:23,279
and if you have ideas for it let me know
 

1605
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,470
and if you have ideas for it let me know
so that i can actually

1606
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,480
so that i can actually
 

1607
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,269
so that i can actually
implement them leave a comment uh it

1608
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:27,279
implement them leave a comment uh it
 

1609
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,549
implement them leave a comment uh it

how do you feel about the observer block

1612
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:30,640
how do you feel about the observer block
 

1613
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,990
how do you feel about the observer block
that might possibly

1614
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,000
that might possibly
 

1615
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,909
that might possibly
be implemented into minecraft in 1.10

1616
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:35,919
be implemented into minecraft in 1.10
 

1617
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,470
be implemented into minecraft in 1.10
if it is added would you do the long job

1618
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:38,480
if it is added would you do the long job
 

1619
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,350
if it is added would you do the long job
of fixing

1620
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,360
of fixing
 

1621
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,909
of fixing
all your redstone machines that use buds

1622
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:41,919
all your redstone machines that use buds
 

1623
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,310
all your redstone machines that use buds
or what

1624
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,320
or what
 

1625
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,070
or what
so if you guys don't know the observer

1626
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,080
so if you guys don't know the observer
 

1627
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,590
so if you guys don't know the observer
block was a talked about

1628
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:47,600
block was a talked about
 

1629
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,509
block was a talked about
potential uh bud switch

1630
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:51,519
potential uh bud switch
 

1631
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,149
potential uh bud switch
properly implemented into minecraft so a

1632
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:54,159
properly implemented into minecraft so a
 

1633
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,110
properly implemented into minecraft so a
single block

1634
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,120
single block
 

1635
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,830
single block
bud switch uh they were talking about

1636
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840
bud switch uh they were talking about
 

1637
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,549
bud switch uh they were talking about
doing that for 1.10

1638
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:00,559
doing that for 1.10
 

1639
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,710
doing that for 1.10
uh honestly i would not update my

1640
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:04,720
uh honestly i would not update my
 

1641
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,509
uh honestly i would not update my
machines

1642
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:05,519
machines
 

1643
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,230
machines
or my redstone stuff if i didn't have to

1644
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,240
or my redstone stuff if i didn't have to
 

1645
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,750
or my redstone stuff if i didn't have to
if you guys don't know

1646
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760
if you guys don't know
 

1647
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,750
if you guys don't know
bud switches let's see if i can find my

1648
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:11,760
bud switches let's see if i can find my
 

1649
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,509
bud switches let's see if i can find my
redstone here

1650
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:13,519
redstone here
 

1651
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,549
redstone here
got that got that oh i need a block bud

1652
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:16,559
got that got that oh i need a block bud
 

1653
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,269
got that got that oh i need a block bud
switches

1654
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:17,279
switches
 

1655
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,549
switches
are pretty compact already i don't

1656
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:20,559
are pretty compact already i don't
 

1657
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,509
are pretty compact already i don't
really see the

1658
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:21,519
really see the
 

1659
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,070
really see the
need to add a special block just for

1660
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,080
need to add a special block just for
 

1661
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,430
need to add a special block just for
them

1662
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:25,440
them
 

1663
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,549
them
um you can do it in three blocks

1664
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:28,559
um you can do it in three blocks
 

1665
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,149
um you can do it in three blocks
a vertical one like a so that's all you

1666
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:32,159
a vertical one like a so that's all you
 

1667
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,590
a vertical one like a so that's all you
got to do so every time you place a

1668
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:33,600
got to do so every time you place a
 

1669
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,430
got to do so every time you place a
block next to the piston

1670
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:35,440
block next to the piston
 

1671
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,630
block next to the piston
it detects it or whenever

1672
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:38,640
it detects it or whenever
 

1673
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,909
it detects it or whenever
the block next to the piston changes and

1674
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:41,919
the block next to the piston changes and
 

1675
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,430
the block next to the piston changes and
there's a horizontal one too let's see

1676
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:43,440
there's a horizontal one too let's see
 

1677
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,789
there's a horizontal one too let's see
if i can remember how to do it

1678
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:44,799
if i can remember how to do it
 

1679
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,990
if i can remember how to do it
i don't use this one as much although

1680
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,000
i don't use this one as much although
 

1681
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,509
i don't use this one as much although
it's pretty good too

1682
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:49,519
it's pretty good too
 

1683
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,789
it's pretty good too
oh let's steal that steal that redstone

1684
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:52,799
oh let's steal that steal that redstone
 

1685
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:53,509
oh let's steal that steal that redstone
block

1686
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:53,519
block
 

1687
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,269
block
like i saw i think you also have to add

1688
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:57,279
like i saw i think you also have to add
 

1689
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,190
like i saw i think you also have to add
another block at the end if i remember

1690
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,200
another block at the end if i remember
 

1691
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,950
another block at the end if i remember
right

1692
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:00,960
right
 

1693
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,549
right
let's try it now yeah looks good without

1694
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:04,559
let's try it now yeah looks good without
 

1695
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,710
let's try it now yeah looks good without
that block does it work

1696
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:06,720
that block does it work
 

1697
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,430
that block does it work
no it spans out ah

1698
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:11,440
no it spans out ah
 

1699
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,630
no it spans out ah
so yeah they're pretty compact as it is

1700
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
so yeah they're pretty compact as it is
 

1701
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,310
so yeah they're pretty compact as it is
the only reason i would change it is if

1702
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,320
the only reason i would change it is if
 

1703
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,230
the only reason i would change it is if
they broke redstone

1704
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,240
they broke redstone
 

1705
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,830
they broke redstone
here's the thing though that it confuses

1706
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:19,840
here's the thing though that it confuses
 

1707
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,909
here's the thing though that it confuses
a lot of people bud switches

1708
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:21,919
a lot of people bud switches
 

1709
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,509
a lot of people bud switches
like they've talked about getting rid of

1710
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:23,519
like they've talked about getting rid of
 

1711
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,190
like they've talked about getting rid of
the quasi connectivity

1712
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:25,200
the quasi connectivity
 

1713
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,950
the quasi connectivity
in minecraft that's the diagonal

1714
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:26,960
in minecraft that's the diagonal
 

1715
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,470
in minecraft that's the diagonal
powering

1716
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:28,480
powering
 

1717
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,070
powering
um so for example this redstone block

1718
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,080
um so for example this redstone block
 

1719
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,389
um so for example this redstone block
here

1720
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:32,399
here
 

1721
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,590
here
powers this piston it just doesn't

1722
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:35,600
powers this piston it just doesn't
 

1723
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,110
powers this piston it just doesn't
update

1724
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:37,120
update
 

1725
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,830
update
right away so if it's gone it stays

1726
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:39,840
right away so if it's gone it stays
 

1727
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,830
right away so if it's gone it stays
extended

1728
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:41,840
extended
 

1729
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,350
extended
and that that's how a lot of butt

1730
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:43,360
and that that's how a lot of butt
 

1731
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,990
and that that's how a lot of butt
switches work but that is not the only

1732
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,000
switches work but that is not the only
 

1733
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,190
switches work but that is not the only
way they can work

1734
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,200
way they can work
 

1735
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,630
way they can work
they're they're kind of two separate

1736
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:48,640
they're they're kind of two separate
 

1737
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,029
they're they're kind of two separate
things in minecraft so

1738
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,039
things in minecraft so
 

1739
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,710
things in minecraft so
yeah even if they get rid of that

1740
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
yeah even if they get rid of that
 

1741
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,389
yeah even if they get rid of that
feature bud switches will still be a

1742
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:54,399
feature bud switches will still be a
 

1743
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,269
feature bud switches will still be a
thing

1744
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:55,279
thing
 

1745
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,149
thing
just you have to do it differently um

1746
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:58,159
just you have to do it differently um
 

1747
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,190
just you have to do it differently um
and also

1748
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,200
and also
 

1749
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,269
and also
other redstone uses quasi connectivity

1750
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:01,279
other redstone uses quasi connectivity
 

1751
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,950
other redstone uses quasi connectivity
so it's a good thing

1752
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:02,960
so it's a good thing
 

1753
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,190
so it's a good thing
that they don't remove it because it'll

1754
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:05,200
that they don't remove it because it'll
 

1755
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,789
that they don't remove it because it'll
break a lot of stuff not just bud

1756
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:06,799
break a lot of stuff not just bud
 

1757
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,710
break a lot of stuff not just bud
switches

1758
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:08,720
switches
 

1759
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,389
switches
aha anyways ramble ramble

1760
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:12,399

uh i have done some more work on the

1762
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:15,440
uh i have done some more work on the
 

1763
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,869
uh i have done some more work on the
the nexus here guys i don't know if you

1764
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:16,879
the nexus here guys i don't know if you
 

1765
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,790
the nexus here guys i don't know if you
remember but this middle part was all

1766
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:18,800
remember but this middle part was all
 

1767
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,510
remember but this middle part was all
like

1768
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:19,520
like
 

1769
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,349
like
grass and stuff i've tried to make it

1770
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:21,359
grass and stuff i've tried to make it
 

1771
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,710
grass and stuff i've tried to make it
look a little bit cleaner a little bit

1772
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
look a little bit cleaner a little bit
 

1773
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,990
look a little bit cleaner a little bit
nicer i got like

1774
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,000
nicer i got like
 

1775
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,710
nicer i got like
glass all over here now glass instead of

1776
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:26,720
glass all over here now glass instead of
 

1777
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,149
glass all over here now glass instead of
grass i know it's amazing

1778
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,159
grass i know it's amazing
 

1779
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,909
grass i know it's amazing
such a change and also i redid some of

1780
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:31,919
such a change and also i redid some of
 

1781
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,710
such a change and also i redid some of
the redstone stuff too and made a few

1782
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:34,720
the redstone stuff too and made a few
 

1783
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,629
the redstone stuff too and made a few
other things nicer like i got

1784
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:36,639
other things nicer like i got
 

1785
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,829
other things nicer like i got
a couple extra chests so it can handle

1786
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:39,839
a couple extra chests so it can handle
 

1787
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,069
a couple extra chests so it can handle
items quicker

1788
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:42,079
items quicker
 

1789
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,990
items quicker
the dropper elevator i was using here

1790
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:44,000
the dropper elevator i was using here
 

1791
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,069
the dropper elevator i was using here
before used redstone torches

1792
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:46,079
before used redstone torches
 

1793
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,470
before used redstone torches
now it's just using redstone wire

1794
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:48,480
now it's just using redstone wire
 

1795
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,790
now it's just using redstone wire
redstone torches cause lighting updates

1796
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:50,800
redstone torches cause lighting updates
 

1797
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,270
redstone torches cause lighting updates
so it was lagging my game quite a bit

1798
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:53,280
so it was lagging my game quite a bit
 

1799
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,470
so it was lagging my game quite a bit
actually

1800
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
actually
 

1801
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,430
actually
when it was running and since it runs

1802
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:57,440
when it was running and since it runs
 

1803
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,270
when it was running and since it runs
like all the time

1804
00:34:59,270 --> 00:34:59,280
like all the time
 

1805
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,950
like all the time
definitely wanted to change that so

1806
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:00,960
definitely wanted to change that so
 

1807
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,030
definitely wanted to change that so
that's good we do need to make a

1808
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,040
that's good we do need to make a
 

1809
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,550
that's good we do need to make a
building here still so i'm

1810
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:04,560
building here still so i'm
 

1811
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,470
building here still so i'm
trying to think of plans of how to do

1812
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,480
trying to think of plans of how to do
 

1813
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,069
trying to think of plans of how to do
that oh yeah and i removed like a bunch

1814
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079
that oh yeah and i removed like a bunch
 

1815
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,069
that oh yeah and i removed like a bunch
of land over here too

1816
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:10,079
of land over here too
 

1817
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,510
of land over here too
there used to be like a big mountain

1818
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:11,520
there used to be like a big mountain
 

1819
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,710
there used to be like a big mountain
over here it's gone now

1820
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:14,720
over here it's gone now
 

1821
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,190
over here it's gone now
my big problem with this though is like

1822
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,200
my big problem with this though is like
 

1823
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,950
my big problem with this though is like
this is where the main room is going to

1824
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:18,960
this is where the main room is going to
 

1825
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,910
this is where the main room is going to
be

1826
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:19,920
be
 

1827
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,109
be
