00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:41,689
going to go underwater so I'll probably
 

165
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:48,159
going to go underwater so I'll probably
want to make it maybe six or seven

166
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:48,169
want to make it maybe six or seven
 

167
00:07:48,169 --> 00:08:10,869
want to make it maybe six or seven
blocks deep at least one of the reasons

168
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
blocks deep at least one of the reasons
 

169
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,179
blocks deep at least one of the reasons
why I'm digging down instead of building

170
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:13,189
why I'm digging down instead of building
 

171
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:17,260
why I'm digging down instead of building
houses so I can get resources because

172
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,270
houses so I can get resources because
 

173
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,829
houses so I can get resources because
right now I have none and I need lots

right now I have none and I need lots
and lots of cobblestone and stuff so

176
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:28,399
and lots of cobblestone and stuff so
 

177
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:37,269
and lots of cobblestone and stuff so
this works out perfect and I'll try to

178
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
this works out perfect and I'll try to
 

179
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,519
this works out perfect and I'll try to
keep things lit so you can guys can see

180
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:39,529
keep things lit so you can guys can see

183
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,660

all right so the road itself is about

184
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:53,670
all right so the road itself is about
 

185
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,310
all right so the road itself is about
eight blocks wide

186
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:55,320
eight blocks wide
 

187
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:04,300
eight blocks wide
oh it's nighttime oh boy this is dirt

188
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,310
oh it's nighttime oh boy this is dirt
 

189

all right good as so the road it's going
 

195
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,850
all right good as so the road it's going
to be eight blocks wide so I think I'm

196
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:28,860
to be eight blocks wide so I think I'm
 

197
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:35,300
to be eight blocks wide so I think I'm
going to start here and make this eight

198
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,310
going to start here and make this eight
 

199
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:46,130
going to start here and make this eight
blocks wide that's four yeah so the road

200
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:46,140
blocks wide that's four yeah so the road
 

201
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,940
blocks wide that's four yeah so the road
itself is eight blocks wide but I forgot

202
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:49,950
itself is eight blocks wide but I forgot
 

203
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,260
itself is eight blocks wide but I forgot
I'm going to need some kind of side

204
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:51,270
I'm going to need some kind of side
 

205
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,320
I'm going to need some kind of side
entrance to get onto the road so this is

206
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,330
entrance to get onto the road so this is
 

207
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,770
entrance to get onto the road so this is
actually going to be wider than that if

208
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:57,780
actually going to be wider than that if
 

209
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,470
actually going to be wider than that if
you're if you're wondering you know what

210
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
you're if you're wondering you know what
 

211
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,670

the heck is this guy talking about just

212
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:04,680
the heck is this guy talking about just
 

213
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,900
the heck is this guy talking about just
check out this link and you can see a

214
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:08,910
check out this link and you can see a
 

215
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:20,759
check out this link and you can see a
prototype of what I'm building

216
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:20,769

 

217
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:23,979

all right I'm going to make some more

218
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:23,989
all right I'm going to make some more
 

219
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:37,900
all right I'm going to make some more
tools so I think first I'm going to see

220
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:37,910
tools so I think first I'm going to see
 

221
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:43,389
tools so I think first I'm going to see
how far it is to the ocean stick

222
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:43,399
how far it is to the ocean stick
 

223
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:52,629
how far it is to the ocean stick
straight through here it's not very far

224
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:52,639
straight through here it's not very far
 

225
00:10:52,639 --> 00:11:17,109
straight through here it's not very far
I'm sure if I'm under the water and I

226
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:17,119
I'm sure if I'm under the water and I
 

227
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,919
I'm sure if I'm under the water and I
can't see

228
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:17,929
can't see
 

229
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:28,210
can't see
I think I'm under the water I try to dig

230
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:28,220
I think I'm under the water I try to dig
 

231
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:40,269
I think I'm under the water I try to dig
up yep all right I guess that's kind of

232
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:40,279
up yep all right I guess that's kind of
 

233
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,329
up yep all right I guess that's kind of
a good thing

234
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:42,339
a good thing
 

235
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:46,079
a good thing
so my side entrance is going to be here

236
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:46,089
so my side entrance is going to be here
 

237
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:54,400
so my side entrance is going to be here
and make that two blocks wide so my road

238
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,410
and make that two blocks wide so my road
 

239
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:01,090
and make that two blocks wide so my road
will start here I think and it's going

240
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,100
will start here I think and it's going
 

241
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:08,739
will start here I think and it's going
to be eight blocks wide clear a little

242
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:08,749
to be eight blocks wide clear a little
 

243
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:16,420
to be eight blocks wide clear a little
bit more space all right

244
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:16,430
bit more space all right
 

245
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:24,730
bit more space all right

going to come down the stairs and this
 

251
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,990
going to come down the stairs and this
is the start of the road that means my

252
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,000
is the start of the road that means my
 

253
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,710
is the start of the road that means my
boat dispenser is going to be right here

254
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720

 

255
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:55,990

and my boat return is going to be over

256
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
and my boat return is going to be over
 

257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:09,480
and my boat return is going to be over
here and I'm going to have wall there

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:09,490

 

259
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:16,240

and wall there so I'm going to be able

260
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,250
and wall there so I'm going to be able
 

261
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,540
and wall there so I'm going to be able
to come down the stairs walk in and

262
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:19,550
to come down the stairs walk in and
 

263
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,720
to come down the stairs walk in and
there'll be a boat right here I'll

264
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:22,730
there'll be a boat right here I'll
 

265
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,250
there'll be a boat right here I'll
right-click on it and then they'll just

266
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:24,260
right-click on it and then they'll just
 

267
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,420
right-click on it and then they'll just
shoot me down to the island over there
