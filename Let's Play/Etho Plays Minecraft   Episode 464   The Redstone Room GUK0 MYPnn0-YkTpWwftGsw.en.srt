00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,990
had a spot in our world where we could
keep these and i can reference them

it's been an idea of mine for a little

152
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
it's been an idea of mine for a little
 

153
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,309
it's been an idea of mine for a little
while and we're gonna build it in that

154
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
while and we're gonna build it in that
 

155
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,430
while and we're gonna build it in that
spot over

156
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
spot over
 

157
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,150
spot over
over there i think uh for the longest

158
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
over there i think uh for the longest
 

159
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,110
over there i think uh for the longest
time

160
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
time
 

161
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,110
time
we used to do our redstone right over

162
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
we used to do our redstone right over
 

163
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,990
we used to do our redstone right over
here we would come up to the spot

164
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
here we would come up to the spot
 

165
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,869
here we would come up to the spot
and uh start designing you know then the

166
00:02:58,869 --> 00:02:58,879
and uh start designing you know then the
 

167
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,949
and uh start designing you know then the
horses moved in here there's water

168

so it's not exactly an ideal spot to do

176
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
so it's not exactly an ideal spot to do
 

177
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,229
so it's not exactly an ideal spot to do
redstone and also the ground's only like

178
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
redstone and also the ground's only like
 

179
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,190
redstone and also the ground's only like
two blocks thick

180
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
two blocks thick
 

181
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,589
two blocks thick
in places which poses a problem um

182
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
in places which poses a problem um
 

183
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,190
in places which poses a problem um
yeah so like this has been here for

184
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
yeah so like this has been here for
 

185
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,229
yeah so like this has been here for
at least a year i'm sure um and if we go

186
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
at least a year i'm sure um and if we go
 

187
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:26,789
at least a year i'm sure um and if we go
over here

188
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
over here
 

189
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,710
over here
oh i messed that up i haven't heard

190
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
oh i messed that up i haven't heard
 

191
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,710
oh i messed that up i haven't heard

taking a hard time taking off here with
 

193
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,149
taking a hard time taking off here with
the elijah wings because there's so many

194
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
the elijah wings because there's so many
 

195
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,270
the elijah wings because there's so many
trees around

196

197
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,350

it's actually a bit of an issue because

198
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
it's actually a bit of an issue because
 

199
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,030
it's actually a bit of an issue because
if i do take off i just crash right into

200
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
if i do take off i just crash right into
 

201
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,550
if i do take off i just crash right into
one of them

202
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
one of them
 

203
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,070
one of them
yeah like right there i would have

204
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
yeah like right there i would have
 

205
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,830
yeah like right there i would have
gotten off the ground but nope

206
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
gotten off the ground but nope
 

207
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,270
gotten off the ground but nope
um and you remember the other day we did

208
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
um and you remember the other day we did
 

209
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,869
um and you remember the other day we did
that minecart stuff this was like the

210
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
that minecart stuff this was like the
 

211
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,110
that minecart stuff this was like the
only other open field i had

212
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
only other open field i had
 

213
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,710
only other open field i had
where i could do redstone and now it's

214
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
where i could do redstone and now it's
 

215
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,309
where i could do redstone and now it's
filled up and i'm not quite ready to

216
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
filled up and i'm not quite ready to
 

217
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,710
filled up and i'm not quite ready to
tear that down yet

218
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
tear that down yet
 

219
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,390
tear that down yet
because i might want to reference it for

220
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
because i might want to reference it for
 

221
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,550
because i might want to reference it for
a future episode here

222
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
a future episode here
 

223
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,990
a future episode here
but something that was suggested

224
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
but something that was suggested
 

225

uh a lot over time and especially on the
last episode

228
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319

there we go is that we build some sort

234
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
there we go is that we build some sort
 

235
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,270
there we go is that we build some sort
of redstone

236
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
of redstone
 

237
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,870
of redstone
room and that's what we're gonna start

238
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
room and that's what we're gonna start
 

239
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,830
room and that's what we're gonna start
off here uh with this redstone museum or

240
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
off here uh with this redstone museum or
 

241
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,070
off here uh with this redstone museum or
the facility 2.0 whatever we're going to

242
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
the facility 2.0 whatever we're going to
 

243
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,110
the facility 2.0 whatever we're going to
call it

244
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
call it
 

245
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,150

uh there's a nice open area here it's

246
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
uh there's a nice open area here it's
 

247
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,990
uh there's a nice open area here it's
not a super exciting build i basically

248
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
not a super exciting build i basically
 

249
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,590
not a super exciting build i basically
just want to build a big square room

250
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
just want to build a big square room
 

251
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,510
just want to build a big square room
where we can do redstone

252
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
where we can do redstone
 

253
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,230
where we can do redstone
and have a nice flat surface you know

254
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
and have a nice flat surface you know
 

255
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,670
and have a nice flat surface you know
that kind of thing

256
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
that kind of thing
 

257
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,670
that kind of thing
so the explosion did a lot of work here

258
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
so the explosion did a lot of work here
 

259
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,430
so the explosion did a lot of work here
oh my aim sucks

260
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440

 

261
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,469

it's not gonna happen really

262
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
it's not gonna happen really
 

263
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,230
it's not gonna happen really
oh man through the magic of editing

264
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
oh man through the magic of editing
 

265
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,510
oh man through the magic of editing
maybe maybe i didn't set that up right

266
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
maybe maybe i didn't set that up right
 

267
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,270
maybe maybe i didn't set that up right
here let's do this this is a good idea

268
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
here let's do this this is a good idea
 

269
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,990

271
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,270

clear out a little bit more space i

272
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
clear out a little bit more space i
 

273
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,189
clear out a little bit more space i
brought some tnt here too so

274
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
brought some tnt here too so
 

275
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,189
brought some tnt here too so
yeah basically i want a big square room

276
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
yeah basically i want a big square room
 

277
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,469
yeah basically i want a big square room
here to do redstone maybe a

278
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:15,479
here to do redstone maybe a
 

279
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,110
here to do redstone maybe a
25 or so 25 by 25 area

280
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
25 or so 25 by 25 area
 

281
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,070
25 or so 25 by 25 area
oh i just figured it out i used the

282
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
oh i just figured it out i used the
 

283
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,749
oh i just figured it out i used the
stone button because i wanted it to be

284
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
stone button because i wanted it to be
 

285
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,110
stone button because i wanted it to be
hidden you know to be like a little

286
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
hidden you know to be like a little
 

287
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,909
hidden you know to be like a little
secret oh

288
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
secret oh
 

289

secret oh
what's he doing he's shooting the

290
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
what's he doing he's shooting the
 

291
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,430
what's he doing he's shooting the
terrain for some reason

292
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
terrain for some reason
 

293
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,110
terrain for some reason
i just remembered you can't actually

294
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
i just remembered you can't actually
 

295
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,029
i just remembered you can't actually
activate a stone button you have to use

296
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
activate a stone button you have to use
 

297
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,830
activate a stone button you have to use
a wooden button

298
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840

 

299
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,510

duh

300
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
duh
 

301
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,029
duh
i wanted to try i don't know if i've

302
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
i wanted to try i don't know if i've
 

303
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,749
i wanted to try i don't know if i've
ever done this

304
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
ever done this
 

305
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,310
ever done this
oh gotta use a fire bow right

306
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320

 

307
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,830

it doesn't give it the highlight i

308
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
it doesn't give it the highlight i
 

309
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,870
it doesn't give it the highlight i
thought it would have interesting

310
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
thought it would have interesting
 

311
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,029
thought it would have interesting
so i'm using spectral arrows on the tnt

312
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
so i'm using spectral arrows on the tnt
 

313
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:55,990
so i'm using spectral arrows on the tnt
but it doesn't

314
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
but it doesn't
 

315
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,830
but it doesn't
mark it

316
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840

 

317
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:15,189

i don't think no it doesn't

318
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199

 

319
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,189

i think i finally realized the trick

320
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
i think i finally realized the trick
 

321
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,510
i think i finally realized the trick
with the new skeletons

322
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
with the new skeletons
 

323
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,790
with the new skeletons
i can pretty much dodge him 100 if i

324
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
i can pretty much dodge him 100 if i
 

325
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,710
i can pretty much dodge him 100 if i
just hold left or right

326
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
just hold left or right
 

327
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,189
just hold left or right
unless he's walking forward a lot then

328
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
unless he's walking forward a lot then
 

329
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,950
unless he's walking forward a lot then
he might hit me

330
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
he might hit me
 

331
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,309
he might hit me
like right now he's walking backwards

332
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
like right now he's walking backwards
 

333
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,830
like right now he's walking backwards
now he's walking forward he could

334
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
now he's walking forward he could
 

335
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,670
now he's walking forward he could
possibly hit me if i don't back up as

336

when doing redstone because if you ever
 

367
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,710
when doing redstone because if you ever
have to dig it's nice and easy

interesting
until you move in like once you close

374
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
until you move in like once you close
 

375
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,629
until you move in like once you close
that distance then then he can hit you

376
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
that distance then then he can hit you
 

377
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,390
that distance then then he can hit you
so you have to like run in right after

385
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,110

also check this out if you are engaged

386
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
also check this out if you are engaged
 

387
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,189
also check this out if you are engaged
in combat they will sometimes walk into

388
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
in combat they will sometimes walk into

399
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,950

all right so over here i don't know how

400
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
all right so over here i don't know how
 

401
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,390
all right so over here i don't know how
important the looks are going to be with

402
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
important the looks are going to be with
 

403
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,309
important the looks are going to be with
this whole redstone museum but just so

404
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
this whole redstone museum but just so
 

405
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,390
this whole redstone museum but just so
we're not looking at a stone wall here

406
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
we're not looking at a stone wall here
 

407
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,670
we're not looking at a stone wall here
forever

408
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
forever
 

409
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,029
forever
i'm going to do a pretty simple pattern

410
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
i'm going to do a pretty simple pattern
 

411
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,749
i'm going to do a pretty simple pattern
so i got bone blocks then red clay bump

412
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
so i got bone blocks then red clay bump
 

413
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,469
so i got bone blocks then red clay bump
back one block so it has a shadow on it

414
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
back one block so it has a shadow on it
 

415
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,950
back one block so it has a shadow on it
otherwise it looks pretty plain that

416
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
otherwise it looks pretty plain that
 

417
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,990
otherwise it looks pretty plain that
this kind of gives it a cool

418
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
this kind of gives it a cool
 

419
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,430
this kind of gives it a cool
look when it has a shadow and then you

420
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
look when it has a shadow and then you
 

421
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,189
look when it has a shadow and then you
go forward with the bone block and i

422
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
go forward with the bone block and i
 

423
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,230
go forward with the bone block and i
might do the same thing repeated

424
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
might do the same thing repeated
 

425
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,710
might do the same thing repeated
up here because i kind of need a tall

426
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
up here because i kind of need a tall
 

427
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,150
up here because i kind of need a tall
wall for this room probably

428
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
wall for this room probably
 

429
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,430
wall for this room probably
so i'm going to do maybe rgb red green

430
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
so i'm going to do maybe rgb red green
 

431
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,150
so i'm going to do maybe rgb red green
blue

432
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
blue
 

433
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,150
blue
so do green then boom block then blue

434
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
so do green then boom block then blue
 

435
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,350
so do green then boom block then blue
and see what that looks like for a

436
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
and see what that looks like for a
 

437
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,190
and see what that looks like for a
pattern nice and simple shouldn't take

438
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
pattern nice and simple shouldn't take
 

439
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,149
pattern nice and simple shouldn't take
too long to do

440
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159

 

441
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,630

okay so check it out guys we got it

442
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640
okay so check it out guys we got it
 

443
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,149
okay so check it out guys we got it
pretty much all done here we got the red

444
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
pretty much all done here we got the red
 

445
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,750
pretty much all done here we got the red
green blue going on

446
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
green blue going on
 

447
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,470
green blue going on
and this might not be one of my better

448
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
and this might not be one of my better
 

449
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,310
and this might not be one of my better
builds

450
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
builds
 

451
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,750
builds
i'll see what you guys say about it

452
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
i'll see what you guys say about it
 

453
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,910
i'll see what you guys say about it
though uh might need to do some

454
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
though uh might need to do some
 

455
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,430
though uh might need to do some
adjustments here

456
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
adjustments here
 

457
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,829
adjustments here
but i find it's a little crazy on the

458
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:53,839
but i find it's a little crazy on the
 

459
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,509
but i find it's a little crazy on the
eyes and i'm not exactly sure

460
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
eyes and i'm not exactly sure
 

461
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,829
eyes and i'm not exactly sure
why uh so then i tried to tone it down a

462
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
why uh so then i tried to tone it down a
 

463
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,509
why uh so then i tried to tone it down a
bit so i tried some other patterns i got

464
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
bit so i tried some other patterns i got
 

465
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,470
bit so i tried some other patterns i got
red

466
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
red
 

467
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,310
red
green red get rid of one of the colors

468
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
green red get rid of one of the colors
 

469
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,310
green red get rid of one of the colors
and then i tried red red red

470
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
and then i tried red red red
 

471
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,230
and then i tried red red red
but honestly i almost find this is

472
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
but honestly i almost find this is
 

473
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,470
but honestly i almost find this is
easier to look at and i think the reason

474
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
easier to look at and i think the reason
 

475
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,710
easier to look at and i think the reason
is because there's more to focus on

476
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
is because there's more to focus on
 

477
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,470
is because there's more to focus on
there's more colors

478
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
there's more colors
 

479
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,710
there's more colors
uh the problem is it's too uniform this

480
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
uh the problem is it's too uniform this
 

481
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,630
uh the problem is it's too uniform this
whole build i'm pretty sure like

482
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
whole build i'm pretty sure like
 

483
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,790
whole build i'm pretty sure like
these are all perfectly evenly spaced to

484
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
these are all perfectly evenly spaced to
 

485
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,949
these are all perfectly evenly spaced to
parts i just added these pillars in

486
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
parts i just added these pillars in
 

487
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,710
parts i just added these pillars in
mainly to hide more lighting so i got

488
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
mainly to hide more lighting so i got
 

489
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,870
mainly to hide more lighting so i got
torches behind each of these

490
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
torches behind each of these
 

491
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,550
torches behind each of these
which helps to light up the wall and the

492
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
which helps to light up the wall and the
 

493
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,790
which helps to light up the wall and the
floor a little bit i also added some sea

494
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
floor a little bit i also added some sea
 

495
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,829
floor a little bit i also added some sea
lanterns

496
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
lanterns
 

497
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,910
lanterns
so this will stop mobs from spawning

498
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
so this will stop mobs from spawning
 

499
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,670
so this will stop mobs from spawning
probably going to add a glass ceiling on

500
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
probably going to add a glass ceiling on
 

501
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,190
probably going to add a glass ceiling on
this as well

502
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
this as well
 

503
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,350
this as well
but uh yeah

504
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
but uh yeah
 

505
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,750
but uh yeah
you know we will be adding doors onto

506
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
you know we will be adding doors onto
 

507
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,870
you know we will be adding doors onto
this room though like there might be a

508
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
this room though like there might be a
 

509
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,790
this room though like there might be a
door here or something to go to another

510
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
door here or something to go to another
 

511
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,710
door here or something to go to another
part of the redstone museum and probably

512
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
part of the redstone museum and probably
 

513
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,470
part of the redstone museum and probably
another one on that side

514
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
another one on that side
 

515
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,590
another one on that side
uh go further into the mountain here uh

516
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
uh go further into the mountain here uh
 

517
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,790
uh go further into the mountain here uh
so it might not look all

518
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
so it might not look all
 

519
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,509
so it might not look all
super uniform after after i do that and

520
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
super uniform after after i do that and
 

521
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,389
super uniform after after i do that and
also

522
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
also
 

523
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,790
also
i think i'm gonna add some chests with

524
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
i think i'm gonna add some chests with
 

525
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,230
i think i'm gonna add some chests with
redstone supplies maybe a bed

526
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
redstone supplies maybe a bed
 

527
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,829
redstone supplies maybe a bed
infinite water source that kind of stuff

528
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
infinite water source that kind of stuff
 

529
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,269
infinite water source that kind of stuff
would be nice as well because you use

530
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
would be nice as well because you use
 

531
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,069
would be nice as well because you use
that

532
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
that
 

533
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,190
that
quite often when doing redstone uh yep

534
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
quite often when doing redstone uh yep
 

535
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,389
quite often when doing redstone uh yep
so we're definitely going to want to get

536
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
so we're definitely going to want to get
 

537
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,550
so we're definitely going to want to get
a ceiling in here otherwise it will rain

538
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
a ceiling in here otherwise it will rain
 

539
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,030
a ceiling in here otherwise it will rain
inside and that will get annoying i made

540
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
inside and that will get annoying i made
 

541
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,990
inside and that will get annoying i made
a little compartment

542
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
a little compartment
 

543
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,150
a little compartment
area here for the the chests and for my

544
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
area here for the the chests and for my
 

545
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,269
area here for the the chests and for my
bed and that kind of stuff

546
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
bed and that kind of stuff
 

547
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,030
bed and that kind of stuff
just a little work area so probably

548
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040
just a little work area so probably
 

549
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,350
just a little work area so probably
do something like this with the chest so

550
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
do something like this with the chest so
 

551
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,430
do something like this with the chest so
i i want to always have some redstone on

552
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
i i want to always have some redstone on
 

553
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,949

00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
my ender chest here but not always and
 

563
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,870
my ender chest here but not always and
maybe like a little bit of every type of

564
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
maybe like a little bit of every type of
 

565
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,230
maybe like a little bit of every type of
block

566
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
block
 

567
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,470
block
like one stack of each of the types of

568
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
like one stack of each of the types of
 

569
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,990
like one stack of each of the types of
clay and that might be nice for this as

570
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
clay and that might be nice for this as
 

571
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,310
clay and that might be nice for this as
well

572
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
well
 

573
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,750
well
for when we're designing stuff um

574
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
for when we're designing stuff um
 

575
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,790
for when we're designing stuff um
yeah i brought my bed with me so cool

576
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800

578
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
can go ahead and sleep here whenever
 

579
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,870
can go ahead and sleep here whenever
it's nighttime and i brought some water

580
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
it's nighttime and i brought some water
 

581
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,509
it's nighttime and i brought some water
but it's maybe we will

582
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
but it's maybe we will
 

583
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,269
but it's maybe we will
hide those actually let's put it behind

584
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
hide those actually let's put it behind
 

585
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,190
hide those actually let's put it behind
the ender chest here

586
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
the ender chest here
 

587
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,949
the ender chest here
if we can let's see

588
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
if we can let's see
 

589
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,870
if we can let's see
if we put water down here is that going

590
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
if we put water down here is that going
 

591
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,590
if we put water down here is that going
to be hidden

592
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600

 

593
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,150

and then we'll put the red clay no i

594
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
and then we'll put the red clay no i
 

595
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,750
and then we'll put the red clay no i
can't put the red clay back

596
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
can't put the red clay back
 

597
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,710
can't put the red clay back
ooh could do something like that though

598
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
ooh could do something like that though
 

599
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,190
ooh could do something like that though
and then

600
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
and then
 

601
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,590
and then
put that back here and then if we want

602
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
put that back here and then if we want
 

603
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,630
put that back here and then if we want
to get water ever

604
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
to get water ever
 

605
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,949
to get water ever
you can still do it but it's not like in

606
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
you can still do it but it's not like in
 

607
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,829
you can still do it but it's not like in
your face right

608
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839
your face right
 

609
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,990
your face right
yeah so i might do that as well

610
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
yeah so i might do that as well
 

611
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,069
yeah so i might do that as well
all right cool guys so we pretty much

612
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
all right cool guys so we pretty much
 

613
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,389
all right cool guys so we pretty much
got the redstone room all set up here

614
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
got the redstone room all set up here
 

615
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,389
got the redstone room all set up here
got the ceiling on now i used white

616
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
got the ceiling on now i used white
 

617
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,710
got the ceiling on now i used white
glass might need to do some terraforming

618
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
glass might need to do some terraforming
 

619
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,470
glass might need to do some terraforming
up there to make it look nicer later

620
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
up there to make it look nicer later
 

621
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,269
up there to make it look nicer later
but let's go ahead and give this a test

622
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
but let's go ahead and give this a test
 

623
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,630
but let's go ahead and give this a test
run now let's design

624
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
run now let's design
 

625
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,190
run now let's design
a redstone project together so i got a

626
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
a redstone project together so i got a
 

627
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,190
a redstone project together so i got a
couple supplies over here not quite

628
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
couple supplies over here not quite
 

629
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,470
couple supplies over here not quite
everything i want but oh i forgot

630
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
everything i want but oh i forgot
 

631
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,750
everything i want but oh i forgot
hoppers

632
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
hoppers
 

633
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,990
hoppers
there's no hoppers darn it

634
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
there's no hoppers darn it
 

635
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,670
there's no hoppers darn it
all right we're missing hoppers but

636
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
all right we're missing hoppers but
 

637
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,870
all right we're missing hoppers but
otherwise i think we're pretty much

638
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
otherwise i think we're pretty much
 

639
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,230
otherwise i think we're pretty much
stocked here

640
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
stocked here
 

641
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,710
stocked here
um yeah let's let's design something

642
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
um yeah let's let's design something
 

643
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,150
um yeah let's let's design something
here this is an idea i've had for a

644
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
here this is an idea i've had for a
 

645
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,949
here this is an idea i've had for a
little while for

646
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
little while for
 

647
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,590
little while for
possibly if i can get it to work here

648
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
possibly if i can get it to work here
 

649
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,030
possibly if i can get it to work here
one of the simplest

650
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
one of the simplest
 

651
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,949
one of the simplest
counting devices you can possibly make

652
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
counting devices you can possibly make
 

653
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,550
counting devices you can possibly make
in minecraft

654
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
in minecraft
 

655
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,150
in minecraft
uh so what we're going to want to do is

656
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,160
uh so what we're going to want to do is
 

657
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,590
uh so what we're going to want to do is
set up nine lights

658
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
set up nine lights
 

659
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,829
set up nine lights
and if if we can figure this out it'll

660
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
and if if we can figure this out it'll
 

661
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,629
and if if we can figure this out it'll
be pretty cool i think let's see let's

662
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
be pretty cool i think let's see let's
 

663
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,069
be pretty cool i think let's see let's
get our stone brick see this is nice

664
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079

okay so there is a trick i found out a

684
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
okay so there is a trick i found out a
 

685
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,509
okay so there is a trick i found out a
long

686
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
long
 

687
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,110
long
long time ago like back when the

688
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
long time ago like back when the
 

689
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,509
long time ago like back when the
redstone update first came out

690
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
redstone update first came out
 

691
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,829
redstone update first came out
and i forgot about it for the longest

692
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
and i forgot about it for the longest
 

693
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,910
and i forgot about it for the longest
time up until

694
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
time up until
 

695
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,470
time up until
i made that armor stand game with doc on

696
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
i made that armor stand game with doc on
 

697
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,310
i made that armor stand game with doc on
the hermitcraft server i remembered the

698
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
the hermitcraft server i remembered the
 

699
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,069
the hermitcraft server i remembered the
trick again

700
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
trick again
 

701
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,389
trick again
which is again a reason why the redstone

702
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
which is again a reason why the redstone
 

703
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,350
which is again a reason why the redstone
museum would be nice here because

704
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
museum would be nice here because
 

705
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,870
museum would be nice here because
a lot of times i forget about stuff and

706
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
a lot of times i forget about stuff and
 

707
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,509
a lot of times i forget about stuff and
i don't remember how to rebuild it later

708
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
i don't remember how to rebuild it later
 

709
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,670
i don't remember how to rebuild it later
i think this was the pattern though

710
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
i think this was the pattern though
 

711
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,230
i think this was the pattern though
there's a cool thing you can do

712
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
there's a cool thing you can do
 

713
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,990
there's a cool thing you can do
for displaying numbers in minecraft

714
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
for displaying numbers in minecraft
 

715
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,110
for displaying numbers in minecraft
let's see here we're gonna need uh items

716
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
let's see here we're gonna need uh items
 

717
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,470
let's see here we're gonna need uh items
that don't stack so i'm gonna make a

718
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,480
that don't stack so i'm gonna make a
 

719
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,150
that don't stack so i'm gonna make a
bunch of swords here

720
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
bunch of swords here
 

721
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,269
bunch of swords here
to fill up the dropper all right that

722
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
to fill up the dropper all right that
 

723
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,550
to fill up the dropper all right that
should work

724
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
should work
 

725
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,829
should work
put those in here so every time there's

726
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:32,839
put those in here so every time there's
 

727
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,430
put those in here so every time there's
one sword added we want one more light

728
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
one sword added we want one more light
 

729
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,110
one sword added we want one more light
to turn on is the idea and if you

730
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120
to turn on is the idea and if you
 

731
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,030
to turn on is the idea and if you
position the redstone just right you can

732
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
position the redstone just right you can
 

733
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,550
position the redstone just right you can
make that happen

734
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
make that happen
 

735
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,389
make that happen
so we got two on that's good three

736
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
so we got two on that's good three
 

737
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,430
so we got two on that's good three
um actually if i have that just over

738
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
um actually if i have that just over
 

739
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:47,990
um actually if i have that just over
there you see

740
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
there you see
 

741
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,910
there you see
it two it goes three we don't want that

742
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
it two it goes three we don't want that
 

743
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,110
it two it goes three we don't want that
we need it to go

744
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120

 

745
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,110

um this might need to be moved see

746
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
um this might need to be moved see
 

747
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,509
um this might need to be moved see
this is why we need references because

748
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
this is why we need references because
 

749
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,990
this is why we need references because
now i gotta re-figure this out

750
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
now i gotta re-figure this out
 

751
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,310
now i gotta re-figure this out
okay so i managed to figure it out here

752
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
okay so i managed to figure it out here
 

753
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,110
okay so i managed to figure it out here
again

754
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
again
 

755
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,030
again
uh this is the redstone pattern it's

756
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
uh this is the redstone pattern it's
 

757
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,949
uh this is the redstone pattern it's
pretty simple so it kind of does a

758
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959
pretty simple so it kind of does a
 

759
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:09,670
pretty simple so it kind of does a
zigzag

760
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
zigzag
 

761
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,629
zigzag
back and forth uh over the redstone

762
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:12,639
back and forth uh over the redstone
 

763
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,670
back and forth uh over the redstone
lamps here

764
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
lamps here
 

765
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,990
lamps here
and in one of these droppers we have

766
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
and in one of these droppers we have
 

767
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,670
and in one of these droppers we have
nine swords the other one's empty and

768
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
nine swords the other one's empty and
 

769
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,829
nine swords the other one's empty and
basically they're facing each other

770
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
basically they're facing each other
 

771
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,069
basically they're facing each other
and this is a really cool really simple

772
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,079
and this is a really cool really simple
 

773
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,750
and this is a really cool really simple
way of doing a counting system so

774
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
way of doing a counting system so
 

775
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,590
way of doing a counting system so
whenever we press this button it adds

776
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
whenever we press this button it adds
 

777
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,069
whenever we press this button it adds
one to the display

778
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
one to the display
 

779
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,509
one to the display
and whenever we press this one it

780
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
and whenever we press this one it
 

781
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,670
and whenever we press this one it
subtracts and the really cool thing

782
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
subtracts and the really cool thing
 

783
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,710
subtracts and the really cool thing
about doing it this way

784
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
about doing it this way
 

785
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,829
about doing it this way
is it's also super fast like you can you

786
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
is it's also super fast like you can you
 

787
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,430
is it's also super fast like you can you
make a counting system as quick as you

788
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
make a counting system as quick as you
 

789
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,670
make a counting system as quick as you
want really

790
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
want really
 

791
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,310
want really
aha so today what i want to try to do is

792
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
aha so today what i want to try to do is
 

793
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,230
aha so today what i want to try to do is
take this idea and take it one step

794
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
take this idea and take it one step
 

795
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,790
take this idea and take it one step
further

796
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
further
 

797
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,350
further
can we that make it so that when we get

798
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
can we that make it so that when we get
 

799
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,030
can we that make it so that when we get
to the very end here

800
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
to the very end here
 

801
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,949
to the very end here
up to nine the next time we

802
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
up to nine the next time we
 

803
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,110
up to nine the next time we
press a button it goes down to zero and

804
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
press a button it goes down to zero and
 

805
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,990
press a button it goes down to zero and
adds one

806
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
adds one
 

807
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,110
adds one
to a display above that so it represents

808
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
to a display above that so it represents
 

809
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,470
to a display above that so it represents
the number 10 you know

810
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:00,480
the number 10 you know
 

811
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,150
the number 10 you know
is that possible how difficult would

812
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160
is that possible how difficult would
 

813
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,470
is that possible how difficult would
that be to do

814
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
that be to do
 

815
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,990
that be to do
let's figure it out

816
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,000

 

817
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,829

okay so yeah basically what we want to

818
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
okay so yeah basically what we want to
 

819
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,590
okay so yeah basically what we want to
happen here is when this gets to the

820
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
happen here is when this gets to the
 

821
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,069
happen here is when this gets to the
number

822
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
number
 

823
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,350
number
nine and this has no items left in the

824
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
nine and this has no items left in the
 

825
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,790
nine and this has no items left in the
dropper when all the swords are into

826
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
dropper when all the swords are into
 

827
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,069
dropper when all the swords are into
this one and we add one more

828
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
this one and we add one more
 

829
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,910
this one and we add one more
uh obviously nothing's going to happen

830
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
uh obviously nothing's going to happen
 

831
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,590
uh obviously nothing's going to happen
here because it's empty but we want to

832
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
here because it's empty but we want to
 

833
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,470
here because it's empty but we want to
then add one to the display above

834
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
then add one to the display above
 

835
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,430
then add one to the display above
and then reset this back down to zero

836
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
and then reset this back down to zero
 

837
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,829
and then reset this back down to zero
which

838
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
which
 

839
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,550
which
uh it's actually a little bit tricky

840
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
uh it's actually a little bit tricky
 

841
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,150
uh it's actually a little bit tricky
because it's going to be slow

842
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
because it's going to be slow
 

843
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,670
because it's going to be slow
like let's say for example we set up

844
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
like let's say for example we set up
 

845
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,350
like let's say for example we set up
a comparator clock to do it right i'll

846
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
a comparator clock to do it right i'll
 

847
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,710
a comparator clock to do it right i'll
show you the issue that

848
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
show you the issue that
 

849
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,269
show you the issue that
that'll come up with that this c lantern

850
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
that'll come up with that this c lantern
 

851
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,790
that'll come up with that this c lantern
might not be the best choice actually

852
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
might not be the best choice actually
 

853
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,550
might not be the best choice actually
because i can't put redstone on it

854
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
because i can't put redstone on it
 

855
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,749
because i can't put redstone on it
i just realized um yeah let's set up a

856
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:49,759
i just realized um yeah let's set up a
 

857
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,670
i just realized um yeah let's set up a
comparator clock here though

858
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
comparator clock here though
 

859
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,949
comparator clock here though
so basically

860
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:54,959
so basically
 

861
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,430
so basically
um like for example seven segment

862
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
um like for example seven segment
 

863
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,189
um like for example seven segment
displays i think the quickest ones of

864
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
displays i think the quickest ones of
 

865
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,629
displays i think the quickest ones of
those are usually about

866
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639
those are usually about
 

867
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,509
those are usually about
you can update them twice a second or so

868
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519
you can update them twice a second or so
 

869
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,150
you can update them twice a second or so
um

870
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
um
 

871
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,470
um
with this we would have an issue for

872
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
with this we would have an issue for
 

873
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,269
with this we would have an issue for
sure

874
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:07,279
sure
 

875
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,430
sure
like we could only update it once every

876
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
like we could only update it once every
 

877
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,710
like we could only update it once every
two seconds or so

878
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
two seconds or so
 

879
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,150
two seconds or so
because watch how long it takes for this

880
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
because watch how long it takes for this
 

881
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,990
because watch how long it takes for this
to count down again

882
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000

 

883
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,069

you know it's fast but we need it to

884
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,079
you know it's fast but we need it to
 

885
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,670
you know it's fast but we need it to
happen pretty much instantly so that's

886
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
happen pretty much instantly so that's
 

887
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,949
happen pretty much instantly so that's
our first challenge

888
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
our first challenge
 

889
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,710
our first challenge
second challenge is we gotta figure out

890
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
second challenge is we gotta figure out
 

891
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,509
second challenge is we gotta figure out
when to add one to this so

892
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
when to add one to this so
 

893
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,030
when to add one to this so
how does it know we're at the number

894
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
how does it know we're at the number
 

895
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,430
how does it know we're at the number
nine well this is going to be empty

896
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
nine well this is going to be empty
 

897
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,430
nine well this is going to be empty
so if this comparator is off

898
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440
so if this comparator is off
 

899
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,590
so if this comparator is off
and we detect a button press we should

900
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
and we detect a button press we should
 

901
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,790
and we detect a button press we should
be able to do it with just an

902
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
be able to do it with just an
 

903
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,430
be able to do it with just an
and gate somehow here no

904
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440

 

905
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,030

darn you know i thought this would be

906
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
darn you know i thought this would be
 

907
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,629
darn you know i thought this would be
super simple if we could do something

908
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
super simple if we could do something
 

909
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,189
super simple if we could do something
like this but it doesn't quite work

910
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
like this but it doesn't quite work
 

911
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,350
like this but it doesn't quite work
uh in order for this redstone lamp to

912
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
uh in order for this redstone lamp to
 

913
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,710
uh in order for this redstone lamp to
turn to turn on

914
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720
turn to turn on
 

915
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,030
turn to turn on
and this torch to turn on this wire has

916
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
and this torch to turn on this wire has
 

917
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,110
and this torch to turn on this wire has
to turn off so two things need to happen

918
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
to turn off so two things need to happen
 

919
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,670
to turn off so two things need to happen
this

920
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680
this
 

921
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,069
this
redstone torch needs to go off and the

922
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
redstone torch needs to go off and the
 

923
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,990
redstone torch needs to go off and the
comparator needs to go off which happens

924
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
comparator needs to go off which happens
 

925
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,309
comparator needs to go off which happens
when this runs out of swords right

926
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
when this runs out of swords right
 

927
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,630
when this runs out of swords right
uh the problem is this activates on the

928
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:06,640
uh the problem is this activates on the
 

929
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,069
uh the problem is this activates on the
number eight to nine

930
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079
number eight to nine
 

931
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,230
number eight to nine
and we want it to happen on nine to ten

932
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240

 

933
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,230

so we're at number eight now so next

934
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
so we're at number eight now so next
 

935
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,909
so we're at number eight now so next
time we press it it's not supposed to

936
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
time we press it it's not supposed to
 

937
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,150
time we press it it's not supposed to
turn this on but it does

938
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
turn this on but it does
 

939
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,270
turn this on but it does
yeah because right away this sword goes

940
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
yeah because right away this sword goes
 

941
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,710
yeah because right away this sword goes
out of the dropper here

942
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
out of the dropper here
 

943
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,029
out of the dropper here
uh we could probably get around that if

944
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
uh we could probably get around that if
 

945
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,630
uh we could probably get around that if
we add in some delay here

946
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
we add in some delay here
 

947
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,990
we add in some delay here
so basically it's only going to work if

948
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
so basically it's only going to work if
 

949
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,669
so basically it's only going to work if
this comparator was on

950
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
this comparator was on
 

951
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,029
this comparator was on
when we first pressed the button

952
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
when we first pressed the button
 

953
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,230
when we first pressed the button
so yeah something like this add a little

954
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
so yeah something like this add a little
 

955
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,690
so yeah something like this add a little
a repeater after the comparator

956
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:43,700
a repeater after the comparator
 

957
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,830
a repeater after the comparator
[Music]

958
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:44,840
[Music]
 

959
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,909
[Music]
and i guess

960
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
and i guess
 

961
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,310
and i guess
i don't know what i'm doing instead of

962
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
i don't know what i'm doing instead of
 

963
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,909
i don't know what i'm doing instead of
sending this a button press it has to be

964
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
sending this a button press it has to be
 

965
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,909
sending this a button press it has to be
a very quick pulse

966
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
a very quick pulse
 

967
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,630
a very quick pulse
in order to get away with this okay so

968
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
in order to get away with this okay so
 

969
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,390
in order to get away with this okay so
check this out i got a monostable

970
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
check this out i got a monostable
 

971
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,310
check this out i got a monostable
circuit set up here so notice how quick

972
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
circuit set up here so notice how quick
 

973
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,710
circuit set up here so notice how quick
this

974
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
this
 

975
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,070
this
repeater turns on and off

976
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080

 

977
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,270

it's like on off real quick uh you'll

978
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
it's like on off real quick uh you'll
 

979
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,270
it's like on off real quick uh you'll
notice though this redstone torch is not

980
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
notice though this redstone torch is not
 

981
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,110
notice though this redstone torch is not
changing when we do that

982
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,120
changing when we do that
 

983
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,789
changing when we do that
and that is because redstone torches

984
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799
and that is because redstone torches
 

985
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,310
and that is because redstone torches
need a delay of at least

986
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
need a delay of at least
 

987
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,750
need a delay of at least
two in order to activate

988
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760
two in order to activate
 

989
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,830
two in order to activate
so now you'll see it switches so that's

990
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
so now you'll see it switches so that's
 

991
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,430
so now you'll see it switches so that's
a very minimum

992
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
a very minimum
 

993
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,669
a very minimum
pulse we can send this and still have it

994
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:23,679
pulse we can send this and still have it
 

995
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,430
pulse we can send this and still have it
functioning

996
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
functioning
 

997
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,789
functioning
so now we want this to to

998
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
so now we want this to to
 

999
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,029
so now we want this to to
turn the lamp on from nine to ten but

1000
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
turn the lamp on from nine to ten but
 

1001
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,310
turn the lamp on from nine to ten but
not eight to nine so let's see what

1002
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
not eight to nine so let's see what
 

1003
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,590
not eight to nine so let's see what
happens right now

1004
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
happens right now
 

1005
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,710
happens right now
with the way we have it all right we're

1006
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
with the way we have it all right we're
 

1007
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:36,950
with the way we have it all right we're
at

1008
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
at
 

1009
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,549
at
eight to nine right now it didn't switch

1010
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:40,559
eight to nine right now it didn't switch
 

1011
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,669
eight to nine right now it didn't switch
on that's good

1012
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
on that's good
 

1013
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,990
on that's good
possibly nine to ten now we want it to

1014
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
possibly nine to ten now we want it to
 

1015
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,390
possibly nine to ten now we want it to
turn on

1016
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
turn on
 

1017
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,470
turn on
and i guess it works first time here i

1018
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
and i guess it works first time here i
 

1019
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,870
and i guess it works first time here i
thought i would have to adjust this

1020
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
thought i would have to adjust this
 

1021
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,390
thought i would have to adjust this
wait a second maybe it just works with

1022
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
wait a second maybe it just works with
 

1023
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,830
wait a second maybe it just works with
because i have the monostable let's get

1024
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
because i have the monostable let's get
 

1025
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,510
because i have the monostable let's get
rid of that

1026
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520
rid of that
 

1027
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,470
rid of that
uh let's try this again maybe we don't

1028
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
uh let's try this again maybe we don't
 

1029
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,430
uh let's try this again maybe we don't
need any more delay because the

1030
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,440
need any more delay because the
 

1031
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,270
need any more delay because the
comparator has a little bit of delay

1032
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,280
comparator has a little bit of delay
 

1033
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,270
comparator has a little bit of delay
itself okay

1034
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280
itself okay
 

1035
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,070
itself okay
okay it's not turning on good so now it

1036
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
okay it's not turning on good so now it
 

1037
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,830
okay it's not turning on good so now it
didn't turn on okay

1038
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840
didn't turn on okay
 

1039
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,669
didn't turn on okay
oh yeah so we don't even need a repeater

1040
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679
oh yeah so we don't even need a repeater
 

1041
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,350
oh yeah so we don't even need a repeater
there this is the

1042
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
there this is the
 

1043
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,950
there this is the
this will work we just have to send it a

1044
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:16,960
this will work we just have to send it a
 

1045
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,190
this will work we just have to send it a
quick pulse cool

1046
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
quick pulse cool
 

1047
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,029
quick pulse cool
that's one problem figured out now how

1048
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
that's one problem figured out now how
 

1049
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,430
that's one problem figured out now how
do we reset this quickly

1050
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
do we reset this quickly
 

1051
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,510
do we reset this quickly
okay so i thought of possibly three

1052
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
okay so i thought of possibly three
 

1053
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,590
okay so i thought of possibly three
methods we could use to reset this

1054
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
methods we could use to reset this
 

1055
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,630
methods we could use to reset this
quickly

1056
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
quickly
 

1057
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,710
quickly
uh like if we want to get the swords out

1058
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:30,720
uh like if we want to get the swords out
 

1059
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,470
uh like if we want to get the swords out
of here into this dropper there's no

1060
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
of here into this dropper there's no
 

1061
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,070
of here into this dropper there's no
real way of doing that quickly using

1062
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,080
real way of doing that quickly using
 

1063
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,350
real way of doing that quickly using
redstone like

1064
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,360
redstone like
 

1065
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,669
redstone like
there's 10 redstone updates per second

1066
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:37,679
there's 10 redstone updates per second
 

1067
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,070
there's 10 redstone updates per second
if the game's running smoothly so

1068
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
if the game's running smoothly so
 

1069
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,870
if the game's running smoothly so
pulse on pulse off you can do that five

1070
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:42,880
pulse on pulse off you can do that five
 

1071
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,909
pulse on pulse off you can do that five
times five items per second

1072
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:45,919
times five items per second
 

1073
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,789
times five items per second
can be moved so the only other physical

1074
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
can be moved so the only other physical
 

1075
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,070
can be moved so the only other physical
way of moving items

1076
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,080
way of moving items
 

1077
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,270
way of moving items
is using minecarts

1078
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
is using minecarts
 

1079
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,590
is using minecarts
or is using hoppers right if you just

1080
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
or is using hoppers right if you just
 

1081
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,190
or is using hoppers right if you just
use a hopper though you can only put one

1082
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
use a hopper though you can only put one
 

1083
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,710
use a hopper though you can only put one
underneath here

1084
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:58,720
underneath here
 

1085
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,549
underneath here
you have to use minecart hoppers if you

1086
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
you have to use minecart hoppers if you
 

1087
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,070
you have to use minecart hoppers if you
want to move it quickly

1088
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
want to move it quickly
 

1089
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,830
want to move it quickly
so you would have to set up nine of

1090
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:04,840
so you would have to set up nine of
 

1091
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,149
so you would have to set up nine of
these

1092
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
these
 

1093
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,830
these
and then like push it underneath there

1094
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:07,840
and then like push it underneath there
 

1095
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,149
and then like push it underneath there
when you want it to to reset

1096
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,159
when you want it to to reset
 

1097
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,990
when you want it to to reset
it's not really what i would consider an

1098
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,000
it's not really what i would consider an
 

1099
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,549
it's not really what i would consider an
ideal method but it would work

1100
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
ideal method but it would work
 

1101
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,590
ideal method but it would work
very well actually yeah basically you

1102
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
very well actually yeah basically you
 

1103
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,350
very well actually yeah basically you
drop that when you want to reset it

1104
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
drop that when you want to reset it
 

1105
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,110
drop that when you want to reset it
and get the swords out of there you

1106
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,120
and get the swords out of there you
 

1107
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,270
and get the swords out of there you
would then send a piston

1108
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,280
would then send a piston
 

1109
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,070
would then send a piston
a pulse that moves it under there those

1110
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
a pulse that moves it under there those
 

1111
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,390
a pulse that moves it under there those
would go out of there super quick like

1112
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
would go out of there super quick like
 

1113
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,510
would go out of there super quick like
right away and then if timing was really

1114
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
right away and then if timing was really
 

1115
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,110
right away and then if timing was really
important you would do the same above

1116
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
important you would do the same above
 

1117
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,270
important you would do the same above
here to put them into this dropper again

1118
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
here to put them into this dropper again
 

1119
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,070
here to put them into this dropper again
so you need 18 mine carts in total

1120
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,080
so you need 18 mine carts in total
 

1121
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,110
so you need 18 mine carts in total
if you want it super fast not very

1122
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,120
if you want it super fast not very
 

1123
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,789
if you want it super fast not very
practical

1124
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799
practical
 

1125
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,110
practical
another method we could use is mirror

1126
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,120
another method we could use is mirror
 

1127
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,789
another method we could use is mirror
this so we have another set of droppers

1128
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:48,799
this so we have another set of droppers
 

1129
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,149
this so we have another set of droppers
connected to the same display and

1130
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
connected to the same display and
 

1131
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,710
connected to the same display and
when we need this thunderstorm

1132
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:56,720
when we need this thunderstorm
 

1133
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,270
when we need this thunderstorm
when we need this to reset basically we

1134
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
when we need this to reset basically we
 

1135
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,190
when we need this to reset basically we
switch over to this one that's already

1136
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,200
switch over to this one that's already
 

1137
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,990
switch over to this one that's already
reset

1138
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000
reset
 

1139
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,110
reset
and that way the display updates

1140
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,120
and that way the display updates
 

1141
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,630
and that way the display updates
instantly instead of having to wait

1142
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640
instantly instead of having to wait
 

1143
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,470
instantly instead of having to wait
and the third method here the one we're

1144
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:10,480
and the third method here the one we're
 

1145
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,909
and the third method here the one we're
actually going to use here because it's

1146
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:11,919
actually going to use here because it's
 

1147
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,870
actually going to use here because it's
probably going to be a lot

1148
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:12,880
probably going to be a lot
 

1149
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,230
probably going to be a lot
simpler than the other two and more

1150
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
simpler than the other two and more
 

1151
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,470
simpler than the other two and more
compact uh is not

1152
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
compact uh is not
 

1153
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,950
compact uh is not
as ideal function wise because we're

1154
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
as ideal function wise because we're
 

1155
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,510
as ideal function wise because we're
gonna have to disable the display here

1156
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
gonna have to disable the display here
 

1157
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,750
gonna have to disable the display here
for two seconds when it resets but

1158
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:23,760
for two seconds when it resets but
 

1159
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,669
for two seconds when it resets but
everything should uh

1160
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679
everything should uh
 

1161
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,070
everything should uh
still add up properly so we're gonna do

1162
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,080
still add up properly so we're gonna do
 

1163
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,510
still add up properly so we're gonna do
the comparator method like i said we

1164
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
the comparator method like i said we
 

1165
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,149
the comparator method like i said we
shouldn't do

1166
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
shouldn't do
 

1167
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,950
shouldn't do
originally i realized it's going to work

1168
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:32,960
originally i realized it's going to work
 

1169
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,710
originally i realized it's going to work
here because

1170
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
here because
 

1171
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,950
here because
like let's say we send this exactly nine

1172
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
like let's say we send this exactly nine
 

1173
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,669
like let's say we send this exactly nine
pulses when we want it to reset

1174
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:39,679
pulses when we want it to reset
 

1175
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,870
pulses when we want it to reset
if we add one during that it'll still

1176
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:42,880
if we add one during that it'll still
 

1177
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,710
if we add one during that it'll still
work out properly like there'll be eight

1178
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
work out properly like there'll be eight
 

1179
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,590
work out properly like there'll be eight
in in here and one in this one

1180
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600
in in here and one in this one
 

1181
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,789
in in here and one in this one
so it's going to count properly but

1182
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
so it's going to count properly but
 

1183
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,470
so it's going to count properly but
we don't want that weird display thing

1184
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
we don't want that weird display thing
 

1185
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,549
we don't want that weird display thing
where it counts down after it resets we

1186
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:54,559
where it counts down after it resets we
 

1187
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,990
where it counts down after it resets we
we don't want to be able to see that so

1188
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
we don't want to be able to see that so
 

1189
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,590
we don't want to be able to see that so
what we're going to do is while it's

1190
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
what we're going to do is while it's
 

1191
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,710
what we're going to do is while it's
resetting

1192
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:58,720
resetting
 

1193
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,310
resetting
we're going to turn this to subtraction

1194
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,320
we're going to turn this to subtraction
 

1195
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,830
we're going to turn this to subtraction
mode

1196
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
mode
 

1197
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,149
mode
and give this a redstone a strong

1198
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:04,159
and give this a redstone a strong
 

1199
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,149
and give this a redstone a strong
redstone signal so that'll turn off the

1200
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:06,159
redstone signal so that'll turn off the
 

1201
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,830
redstone signal so that'll turn off the
display and make it look like it's at 0.

1202
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:09,840
display and make it look like it's at 0.
 

1203
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,350
display and make it look like it's at 0.
this will still function properly if

1204
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
this will still function properly if
 

1205
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,110
this will still function properly if
it's in subtract mode that doesn't

1206
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,120
it's in subtract mode that doesn't
 

1207
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,470
it's in subtract mode that doesn't
change anything

1208
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,480
change anything
 

1209
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,630
change anything
so basically we're sacrificing the

1210
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
so basically we're sacrificing the
 

1211
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,549
so basically we're sacrificing the
display for two seconds

1212
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:18,559
display for two seconds
 

1213
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,909
display for two seconds
uh whenever we reset here awesome so i

1214
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
uh whenever we reset here awesome so i
 

1215
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,270
uh whenever we reset here awesome so i
spent some time here putting this

1216
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:23,280
spent some time here putting this
 

1217
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,149
spent some time here putting this
together guys

1218
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
together guys
 

1219
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,870
together guys
and it seems to be working uh this is

1220
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
and it seems to be working uh this is
 

1221
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,270
and it seems to be working uh this is
what it looks like over here which

1222
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
what it looks like over here which
 

1223
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,590
what it looks like over here which
i know looks like looks like a lot but

1224
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:31,600
i know looks like looks like a lot but
 

1225
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,270
i know looks like looks like a lot but
really for what this is doing this is

1226
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,280
really for what this is doing this is
 

1227
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,830
really for what this is doing this is
not too bad it's fairly compact

1228
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
not too bad it's fairly compact
 

1229
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,350
not too bad it's fairly compact
uh could probably be improved a little

1230
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:37,360
uh could probably be improved a little
 

1231
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,950
uh could probably be improved a little
bit more here if i spend some more time

1232
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
bit more here if i spend some more time
 

1233
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,669
bit more here if i spend some more time
on it but

1234
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
on it but
 

1235
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,830
on it but
basically uh it seems to be working here

1236
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
basically uh it seems to be working here
 

1237
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,430
basically uh it seems to be working here
i'm still debugging it though and

1238
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
i'm still debugging it though and
 

1239
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,510
i'm still debugging it though and
figuring out what the speed limit is

1240
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
figuring out what the speed limit is
 

1241
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,750
figuring out what the speed limit is
i can see here's the problem with

1242
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760
i can see here's the problem with
 

1243
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,909
i can see here's the problem with
redstone torches by the way like if i

1244
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:51,919
redstone torches by the way like if i
 

1245
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,470
redstone torches by the way like if i
do this as quick as possible the

1246
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
do this as quick as possible the
 

1247
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,070
do this as quick as possible the
redstone torch is going to burn out so

1248
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,080
redstone torch is going to burn out so
 

1249
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,669
redstone torch is going to burn out so
whenever you build a redstone circuit

1250
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:57,679
whenever you build a redstone circuit
 

1251
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,270
whenever you build a redstone circuit
with redstone torches in

1252
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,280
with redstone torches in
 

1253
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,510
with redstone torches in
you can't you can't like go

1254
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,520
you can't you can't like go
 

1255
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,830
you can't you can't like go
on a pulse off a pulse that's too fast

1256
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
on a pulse off a pulse that's too fast
 

1257
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,430
on a pulse off a pulse that's too fast
for it

1258
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
for it
 

1259
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,070
for it
even at a delay of two it'll still burn

1260
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
even at a delay of two it'll still burn
 

1261
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,590
even at a delay of two it'll still burn
out

1262
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,600

 

1263
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,870

so yeah uh the very quickest this

1264
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
so yeah uh the very quickest this
 

1265
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,549
so yeah uh the very quickest this
could possibly run because there's

1266
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:18,559
could possibly run because there's
 

1267
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,390
could possibly run because there's
redstone torches in the

1268
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,400
redstone torches in the
 

1269
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,270
redstone torches in the
circuitry is at three here at this speed

1270
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,280
circuitry is at three here at this speed
 

1271
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,029
circuitry is at three here at this speed
it won't burn out

1272
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:25,039
it won't burn out
 

1273
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,190
it won't burn out
and i'm not sure if it runs that fast

1274
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200
and i'm not sure if it runs that fast
 

1275
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,230
and i'm not sure if it runs that fast
let's just

1276
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,240
let's just
 

1277
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,430
let's just
let's just check it here um

1278
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
let's just check it here um
 

1279
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,149
let's just check it here um
how do we check this let's see if we can

1280
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
how do we check this let's see if we can
 

1281
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:34,549
how do we check this let's see if we can
count

1282
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:34,559
count
 

1283
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,230
count
quick enough i got this hooked up to a

1284
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:36,240
quick enough i got this hooked up to a
 

1285
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,310
quick enough i got this hooked up to a
light so maybe it'll make it clearer

1286
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320
light so maybe it'll make it clearer
 

1287
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,430
light so maybe it'll make it clearer
right now we're at 49 right four

1288
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:41,440
right now we're at 49 right four
 

1289
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,110
right now we're at 49 right four
plus nine um let's count the pulses here

1290
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
plus nine um let's count the pulses here
 

1291
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,870
plus nine um let's count the pulses here
and i'll shut it off

1292
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
and i'll shut it off
 

1293
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,390
and i'll shut it off
so one two three four five

1294
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
so one two three four five
 

1295
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,149
so one two three four five
six seven eight nine okay so we added

1296
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
six seven eight nine okay so we added
 

1297
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,110
six seven eight nine okay so we added
nine

1298
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
nine
 

1299
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,310
nine
and now we're at 54.

1300
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,320

 

1301
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,789

so no that did not work properly so it's

1302
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:02,799
so no that did not work properly so it's
 

1303
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,470
so no that did not work properly so it's
running a little bit faster than it can

1304
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
running a little bit faster than it can
 

1305
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,269
running a little bit faster than it can
handle we're gonna try slow it down here

1306
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:07,279
handle we're gonna try slow it down here
 

1307
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,750
handle we're gonna try slow it down here
we'll turn it on again so we're at fifth

1308
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
we'll turn it on again so we're at fifth
 

1309
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,990
we'll turn it on again so we're at fifth
or no right

1310
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
or no right
 

1311
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,269
or no right
wait what happened we're at 64 now

1312
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:15,279
wait what happened we're at 64 now
 

1313
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,029
wait what happened we're at 64 now
i think that was too fast one two 3 4

1314
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:19,039
i think that was too fast one two 3 4
 

1315
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,230
i think that was too fast one two 3 4
5 6 7 8

1316
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,240
5 6 7 8
 

1317
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,990
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12. so we should be

1318
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,000
9 10 11 12. so we should be
 

1319
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,190
9 10 11 12. so we should be
at 64 plus 12 is

1320
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,200

 

1321
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,590

76 okay so at four ticks

1322
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
76 okay so at four ticks
 

1323
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,350
76 okay so at four ticks
that seems to be the fastest we can run

1324
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:35,360
that seems to be the fastest we can run
 

1325
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,710
that seems to be the fastest we can run
this right now and that worked out

1326
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:36,720
this right now and that worked out
 

1327
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,070
this right now and that worked out
pretty good

1328
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,080
pretty good
 

1329
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,110
pretty good
so that actually added properly uh there

1330
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
so that actually added properly uh there
 

1331
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,430
so that actually added properly uh there
is

1332
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440
is
 

1333
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,590
is
one issue when it does the reset

1334
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,600
one issue when it does the reset
 

1335
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,110
one issue when it does the reset
you see how it turns off and then turns

1336
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
you see how it turns off and then turns
 

1337
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,750
you see how it turns off and then turns
on there so it's not super smooth

1338
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:51,760
on there so it's not super smooth
 

1339
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,149
on there so it's not super smooth
that's that's the two second delay that

1340
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:54,159
that's that's the two second delay that
 

1341
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,350
that's that's the two second delay that
the

1342
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,360
the
 

1343
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,950
the
display gets shut off that i was talking

1344
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:56,960
display gets shut off that i was talking
 

1345
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,710
display gets shut off that i was talking
about also when

1346
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
about also when
 

1347
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,789
about also when
we we go over here it's not quite

1348
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
we we go over here it's not quite
 

1349
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,390
we we go over here it's not quite
perfect either you saw it went to one

1350
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:02,400
perfect either you saw it went to one
 

1351
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,430
perfect either you saw it went to one
and then zero so

1352
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
and then zero so
 

1353
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,430
and then zero so
it's still showing the the reset a

1354
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
it's still showing the the reset a
 

1355
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,630
it's still showing the the reset a
little bit

1356
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:06,640
little bit
 

1357
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,789
little bit
uh let's try to get rid of the display

1358
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:08,799
uh let's try to get rid of the display
 

1359
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,070
uh let's try to get rid of the display
shut off i just got to break the

1360
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,080
shut off i just got to break the
 

1361
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,310
shut off i just got to break the
repeater here

1362
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
repeater here
 

1363
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,470
repeater here
kind of curious what that looks like

1364
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,480

 

1365
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,269

and so it'll actually show the countdown

1366
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:19,279
and so it'll actually show the countdown
 

1367
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:19,750
and so it'll actually show the countdown
now

1368
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:19,760
now
 

1369
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,269
now
i think yeah and it yeah that

1370
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:23,279
i think yeah and it yeah that
 

1371
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,310
i think yeah and it yeah that
might not look that bad actually

1372
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,320
might not look that bad actually
 

1373
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,950
might not look that bad actually
so maybe it's not a big deal

1374
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:30,960

 

1375
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,950

anyways so what we got going on here is

1376
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:32,960
anyways so what we got going on here is
 

1377
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,070
anyways so what we got going on here is
this is running two

1378
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,080
this is running two
 

1379
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,549
this is running two
amount of stable circuits this this wire

1380
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
amount of stable circuits this this wire
 

1381
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,870
amount of stable circuits this this wire
on the side here is not important really

1382
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880
on the side here is not important really
 

1383
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,149
on the side here is not important really
uh this is the monostable circuit here

1384
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:42,159
uh this is the monostable circuit here
 

1385
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,669
uh this is the monostable circuit here
this little two by three thing we got

1386
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:45,679
this little two by three thing we got
 

1387
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,190
this little two by three thing we got
i use that instead of the pistons

1388
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,200
i use that instead of the pistons
 

1389
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,630
i use that instead of the pistons
because it's quieter oh yeah and then

1390
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640
because it's quieter oh yeah and then
 

1391
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,909
because it's quieter oh yeah and then
the redstone torch

1392
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
the redstone torch
 

1393
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,269
the redstone torch
over here so the actual input to this

1394
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
over here so the actual input to this
 

1395
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,470
over here so the actual input to this
is right over here it goes to that and

1396
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:56,480
is right over here it goes to that and
 

1397
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,909
is right over here it goes to that and
gate thing we set up before

1398
00:25:57,909 --> 00:25:57,919
gate thing we set up before
 

1399
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,990
gate thing we set up before
to this torch this turns on when we go

1400
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,000
to this torch this turns on when we go
 

1401
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,510
to this torch this turns on when we go
from nine to ten

1402
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,520
from nine to ten
 

1403
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,549
from nine to ten
and then runs up here sends a a pulse to

1404
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
and then runs up here sends a a pulse to
 

1405
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,669
and then runs up here sends a a pulse to
this dropper

1406
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:05,679
this dropper
 

1407
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,870
this dropper
which adds one to the tens and it also

1408
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:08,880
which adds one to the tens and it also
 

1409
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,549
which adds one to the tens and it also
goes off this way

1410
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
goes off this way
 

1411
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,190
goes off this way
uh this is just a pulse lengthener this

1412
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
uh this is just a pulse lengthener this
 

1413
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,710
uh this is just a pulse lengthener this
comparator thing we got here i can show

1414
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:14,720
comparator thing we got here i can show
 

1415
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,110
comparator thing we got here i can show
you example that right here so when we

1416
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,120
you example that right here so when we
 

1417
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,510
you example that right here so when we
send this a signal it takes a while for

1418
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:19,520
send this a signal it takes a while for
 

1419
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,789
send this a signal it takes a while for
it to bleed out

1420
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:20,799
it to bleed out
 

1421
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,830
it to bleed out
um so it just creates a long long pulse

1422
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:23,840
um so it just creates a long long pulse
 

1423
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,830
um so it just creates a long long pulse
kind of like a hopper clock

1424
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
kind of like a hopper clock
 

1425
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,549
kind of like a hopper clock
and that goes down to a comparator clock

1426
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:28,559
and that goes down to a comparator clock
 

1427
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,430
and that goes down to a comparator clock
here which sends

1428
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,440
here which sends
 

1429
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,350
here which sends
exactly nine pulses to

1430
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,360
exactly nine pulses to
 

1431
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,190
exactly nine pulses to
the reset and also it sends a signal to

1432
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
the reset and also it sends a signal to
 

1433
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,870
the reset and also it sends a signal to
this if we want to shut the display off

1434
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:38,880
this if we want to shut the display off
 

1435
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,549
this if we want to shut the display off
during that

1436
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:40,559
during that
 

1437
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,710
during that
so yeah anyways if it wasn't clear

1438
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:42,720
so yeah anyways if it wasn't clear
 

1439
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,230
so yeah anyways if it wasn't clear
already you can take this

1440
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,240
already you can take this
 

1441
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,789
already you can take this
and we have ones and tens shown here but

1442
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:46,799
and we have ones and tens shown here but
 

1443
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,470
and we have ones and tens shown here but
you can go hundreds thousands ten

1444
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,480
you can go hundreds thousands ten
 

1445
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,269
you can go hundreds thousands ten
thousands

1446
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:49,279
thousands
 

1447
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,950
thousands
it represents a really big number with

1448
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
it represents a really big number with
 

1449
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,390
it represents a really big number with
this just by tiling it

1450
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:52,400
this just by tiling it
 

1451
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,789
this just by tiling it
more more and more times i tried to

1452
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:54,799
more more and more times i tried to
 

1453
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,710
more more and more times i tried to
build it in a way here that is tileable

1454
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:56,720
build it in a way here that is tileable
 

1455
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,710
build it in a way here that is tileable
i tried to keep it a low profile so most

1456
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:58,720
i tried to keep it a low profile so most
 

1457
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,710
i tried to keep it a low profile so most
of the redstone is only two blocks tall

1458
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:00,720
of the redstone is only two blocks tall
 

1459
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,590
of the redstone is only two blocks tall
here

1460
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:01,600
here
 

1461
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,830
here
uh at the back it goes three blocks tall

1462
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840
uh at the back it goes three blocks tall
 

1463
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,190
uh at the back it goes three blocks tall
but uh

1464
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,200
but uh
 

1465
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,710
but uh
you know you could you could move this

1466
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
you know you could you could move this
 

1467
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,269
you know you could you could move this
up higher or i got it forward to and up

1468
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279
up higher or i got it forward to and up
 

1469
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,230
up higher or i got it forward to and up
to

1470
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,240
to
 

1471
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,310
to
each level here but you can arrange it

1472
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,320
each level here but you can arrange it
 

1473
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,510
each level here but you can arrange it
however you want

1474
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,520
however you want
 

1475
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,350
however you want
i tried to keep the redstone fairly

1476
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:15,360
i tried to keep the redstone fairly
 

1477
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,710
i tried to keep the redstone fairly
loose to connect to that next level here

1478
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:18,720
loose to connect to that next level here
 

1479
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,149
loose to connect to that next level here
and if you really worked on this i'm

1480
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
and if you really worked on this i'm
 

1481
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,350
and if you really worked on this i'm
sure you could get to work on

1482
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360

his overall health gain and then i can
only
