00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,870
use torches as we go here
putting redstone on sand great idea

514
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880

 

515
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,389

oh i'm still trying to shift click

516
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
oh i'm still trying to shift click
 

517
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,750
oh i'm still trying to shift click
things

518
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760

 

519
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,590

this is fun for me i hope it's fun for

520
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
this is fun for me i hope it's fun for
 

521
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,230
this is fun for me i hope it's fun for
you guys i love uh

522
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
you guys i love uh
 

523
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,430
you guys i love uh
i love checking out my old stuff here

524
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
i love checking out my old stuff here
 

525
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,710
i love checking out my old stuff here
all right let's get some more lights

526
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
all right let's get some more lights
 

527
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,750
all right let's get some more lights
i spent a good like two hours on this

528
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
i spent a good like two hours on this
 

529
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,750
i spent a good like two hours on this
on this redstone project so i guess the

530
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
on this redstone project so i guess the
 

531
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,590
on this redstone project so i guess the
pressure plates are above here

532
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
pressure plates are above here
 

533
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,790
pressure plates are above here
and there i think there's one pressure

534
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
and there i think there's one pressure
 

535
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,710
and there i think there's one pressure
plate above that block and that one

536
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
plate above that block and that one
 

537
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,990
plate above that block and that one
and it comes to here repeaters

538
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
and it comes to here repeaters
 

539
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,829
and it comes to here repeaters
we didn't have repeaters back then so uh

540
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
we didn't have repeaters back then so uh
 

541
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,590
we didn't have repeaters back then so uh
you have to use like redstone torches

542
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
you have to use like redstone torches
 

543
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,670
you have to use like redstone torches
like this

544
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680

 

545
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,750

anyway i got it working it took me a few

546
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
anyway i got it working it took me a few
 

547
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,230
anyway i got it working it took me a few
hours but i figured it out might not be

548
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
hours but i figured it out might not be
 

549
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,550
hours but i figured it out might not be
the most efficient thing

550
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
the most efficient thing
 

551
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,990
the most efficient thing
oh it's night time i don't think we

552
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
oh it's night time i don't think we
 

553
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,350
oh it's night time i don't think we
should record at night

554
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
should record at night
 

555
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,870
should record at night
i think that's a bad idea

556
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880

 

557
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,389

yeah i think i'll i'll be right back i

558
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
yeah i think i'll i'll be right back i
 

559
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,629
yeah i think i'll i'll be right back i
don't know i can't remember i don't

560
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
don't know i can't remember i don't
 

561
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,829
don't know i can't remember i don't
think beds were in the game

562
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839

at this point so i probably can't sleep
 

565
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,030
at this point so i probably can't sleep
this away either

566
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040

um it wasn't until i started doing
 

609
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,550
um it wasn't until i started doing
youtube videos that i actually

610
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
youtube videos that i actually
 

611
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,430
youtube videos that i actually
switched to playing with mobs on again

612
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
switched to playing with mobs on again
 

613
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,069
switched to playing with mobs on again
because i figured

614

because i figured
 

615
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,750
because i figured
it'd make my videos a little more

616
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
it'd make my videos a little more
 

617
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,590
it'd make my videos a little more
entertaining than playing on peaceful

618
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
entertaining than playing on peaceful
 

619
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,949
entertaining than playing on peaceful

pretty proud of this gazebo i built
 

641
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,069
pretty proud of this gazebo i built
i think this looks pretty good even

642
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
i think this looks pretty good even
 

643
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,069
i think this looks pretty good even
still it looks pretty good i think

644

still it looks pretty good i think
 

645
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,430
still it looks pretty good i think
probably the nicest thing i've built in

646

yeah i think that's what it was so then

672
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
yeah i think that's what it was so then

should probably go to the house
 

701
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,550
should probably go to the house

710
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839

 

711
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,509

and then to leave the basement that's
 

1243
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,269
and then to leave the basement that's
the storage room up there that we saw

1244
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
the storage room up there that we saw
 

1245
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,789
the storage room up there that we saw
earlier

1246
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:00,799
earlier
 

1247
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,510

i guess that was so i could figure out
 

1257
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,669
i guess that was so i could figure out
where the center was

1258
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
where the center was
 

1259
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,669
where the center was

that makes sense so they stopped my
minecarts here i guess

1360
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880

 

1361
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,230

i don't know i can't remember how to get

1362
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,240
i don't know i can't remember how to get
 

1363
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,870
i don't know i can't remember how to get
them going again

1364
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
them going again
 

1365
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,710
them going again
i think if i break it and just place it

1366
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:52,720
i think if i break it and just place it
 

1367
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,070
i think if i break it and just place it
here it should work

1368
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,080
here it should work
 

1369
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,830
here it should work
yeah cool cool

1370
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,840

1385
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,350

this was the first minecart thing i ever

1386
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,360
this was the first minecart thing i ever
 

1387
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,029
this was the first minecart thing i ever
made this was just to get to the other

1388
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:25,039
made this was just to get to the other
 

1389

1403
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,269

cool computer room over here

1404
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:47,279

 

1405
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,830

basically a bunch of redstone wire

1406
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:49,840
basically a bunch of redstone wire
 

1407
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,590
basically a bunch of redstone wire
redstone repeaters that go to each of

1408
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:51,600
redstone repeaters that go to each of
 

1409
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,630
redstone repeaters that go to each of
the doors

1410
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:54,640

 

1411
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,190

and this redstone wire runs all the way

1412
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,200
and this redstone wire runs all the way
 

1413
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,870
and this redstone wire runs all the way
up to the surface to

1414
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:58,880
up to the surface to
 

1415
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,149
up to the surface to
a giant staircase thing

1416
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:04,159
a giant staircase thing
 

1417
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,630
a giant staircase thing
you know what i i'm just realizing this

1418
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:06,640
you know what i i'm just realizing this
 

1419
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,470
you know what i i'm just realizing this
now but i must have hated torches back

1420
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:08,480
now but i must have hated torches back
 

1421
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,070
now but i must have hated torches back
then too because i had

1422
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,080
then too because i had
 

1423
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,669
then too because i had
i had pot lights throughout this whole

1424
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:11,679
i had pot lights throughout this whole
 

1425
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,669
i had pot lights throughout this whole
thing and i'm noticing like a lot of

1426
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:13,679
thing and i'm noticing like a lot of
 

1427
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,470
thing and i'm noticing like a lot of
places i

1428
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:14,480
places i
 

1429
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,110
places i
i use pot lights instead of torches just

1430
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,120
i use pot lights instead of torches just
 

1431
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:17,509
i use pot lights instead of torches just
so i

1432
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:17,519
so i
 

1433
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,549
so i
i wouldn't see the torch you know

1434
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:20,559
i wouldn't see the torch you know
 

1435
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,830
i wouldn't see the torch you know
try to make it a little fancier water

1436
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:23,840
try to make it a little fancier water
 

1437
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,909
try to make it a little fancier water
ladder back up

1438
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:25,919
ladder back up
 

1439
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,149
ladder back up
pretty cool um

1440
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:30,159

 

1441
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,070

here let's go take our our water slide

1442
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
here let's go take our our water slide
 

1443
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,509
here let's go take our our water slide
oh no is it dark

1444
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:33,519
oh no is it dark
 

1445
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,630
oh no is it dark
i think it's getting dark this is one of

1446
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:36,640
i think it's getting dark this is one of
 

1447
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,149
i think it's getting dark this is one of
the later things i added in the world

1448
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:38,159
the later things i added in the world
 

1449
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,909
the later things i added in the world
too

1450
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:39,919
too
 

1451
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,950
too
giant water slide goes up to

1452
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:42,960
giant water slide goes up to
 

1453
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,110
giant water slide goes up to
the build limit which was 128 at that

1454
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,120
the build limit which was 128 at that
 

1455
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,269
the build limit which was 128 at that
time

1456
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
time
 

1457
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,870
time
and uh it was actually pretty quick

1458
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:50,880
and uh it was actually pretty quick
 

1459
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,029
and uh it was actually pretty quick
though

1460
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,039
though
 

1461
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,830
though
can i go in f5 mode yeah f5 mode works

1462
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840

 

1463
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,549

oh you can't do the forward-facing

1464
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:00,559
oh you can't do the forward-facing
 

1465
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,389
oh you can't do the forward-facing
camera though

1466
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:04,399

 

1467
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,389

this goes quite a ways and it goes over

1468
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:06,399
this goes quite a ways and it goes over
 

1469
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,269
this goes quite a ways and it goes over
to my giant tree farm over here

1470
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:09,279
to my giant tree farm over here
 

1471
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,710
to my giant tree farm over here
huge drop

1472
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:12,720

 

1473
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,590

you go way underwater it's pretty cool

1474
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:19,600

 

1475
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,269

uh when you break the boats there's no

1476
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:21,279
uh when you break the boats there's no
 

1477
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,789
uh when you break the boats there's no
way to get the boat back it always would

1478
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:22,799
way to get the boat back it always would
 

1479
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,350
way to get the boat back it always would
break into the planks and sticks

1480
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360

 

1481
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,750

yeah this is a giant tree farm area

1482
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:31,760

 

1483
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,470

pretty cool and then the back i had

1484
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:34,480
pretty cool and then the back i had
 

1485
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,590
pretty cool and then the back i had
another one of those

1486
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:35,600
another one of those
 

1487
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,549
another one of those
water slide things over here and i guess

1488
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:38,559
water slide things over here and i guess
 

1489
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,070
water slide things over here and i guess
i should stop recording again because

1490
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,080
i should stop recording again because
 

1491
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,710
i should stop recording again because
it's night time

1492

here this is an under underwater

1510
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:06,640
here this is an under underwater
 

1511
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,269
here this is an under underwater
minecart rail line that i built which

1512
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:09,279
minecart rail line that i built which
 

1513
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,110
minecart rail line that i built which
was a huge pain

1514
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,120
was a huge pain
 

1515
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,509
was a huge pain
back then to build underwater there's no

1516
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:13,519
back then to build underwater there's no
 

1517
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,950
back then to build underwater there's no
efficiency tools or

1518
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:14,960
efficiency tools or
 

1519
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,990
efficiency tools or
aqua breathing or anything like that and

1520
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,000
aqua breathing or anything like that and
 

1521
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,310
aqua breathing or anything like that and
