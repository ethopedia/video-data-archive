00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,520
everything on the list I decided to axe
 

83
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,770
everything on the list I decided to axe
off a few items though that seemed like

84
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:06,780
off a few items though that seemed like
 

85
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,380
off a few items though that seemed like
unnecessary to store like anything I

86
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:09,390
unnecessary to store like anything I
 

87
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,290
unnecessary to store like anything I
would craft like in place I wouldn't

88
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:12,300
would craft like in place I wouldn't
 

89
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,530
would craft like in place I wouldn't
really need or earth

90
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:13,540
really need or earth
 

91
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,910
really need or earth
things I wouldn't use very often I

92
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:14,920
things I wouldn't use very often I
 

93
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,800
things I wouldn't use very often I
decide not to include like daylight

94
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:16,810
decide not to include like daylight
 

95
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,399
decide not to include like daylight
sensor I've made maybe two of those or

96
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:20,409
sensor I've made maybe two of those or
 

97
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:22,559
sensor I've made maybe two of those or
three of those in my world since since I

98
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:22,569
three of those in my world since since I
 

99
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:24,929
three of those in my world since since I
started it so I don't think I need three

100
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:24,939
started it so I don't think I need three
 

101
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:26,880
started it so I don't think I need three
double chests full of daylight sensors

102
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:26,890
double chests full of daylight sensors
 

103
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,770
double chests full of daylight sensors
sort of things so I decided to axe those

104
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:28,780
sort of things so I decided to axe those
 

105
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,670
sort of things so I decided to axe those
off the list for example and now what we

106
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:32,680
off the list for example and now what we
 

107
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,740
off the list for example and now what we
got to do maybe we will grab our dyes

108
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:36,750
got to do maybe we will grab our dyes
 

109
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,899
got to do maybe we will grab our dyes
and maybe glass let's do the dyes first

110
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:42,909
and maybe glass let's do the dyes first
 

111
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:45,390
and maybe glass let's do the dyes first
you got to take all these items and

112
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:45,400
you got to take all these items and
 

113
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,649
you got to take all these items and
start adding them to the item filters in

114
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:48,659
start adding them to the item filters in
 

115
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,800
start adding them to the item filters in
our nexus storage room here so I decided

116
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:52,810
our nexus storage room here so I decided
 

117
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,869
our nexus storage room here so I decided
to put all these colored things like the

118
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
to put all these colored things like the
 

119
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,899
to put all these colored things like the
colored clay and the colored wool on the

120
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:57,909
colored clay and the colored wool on the
 

121
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:00,720
colored clay and the colored wool on the
top floor of this because they're least

122
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:00,730
top floor of this because they're least
 

123
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,869
top floor of this because they're least
likely to cause me problems down the

124
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:03,879
likely to cause me problems down the
 

125
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,289
likely to cause me problems down the
line like the random blocks I might need

126
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:07,299
line like the random blocks I might need
 

127
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:10,649
line like the random blocks I might need
to add or remove them in the future and

128
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:10,659
to add or remove them in the future and
 

129
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:12,649
to add or remove them in the future and
Oh

130
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:12,659
Oh
 

131
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,640
Oh
or I'm more likely to make a mistake

132
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:14,650
or I'm more likely to make a mistake
 

133
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,119
or I'm more likely to make a mistake
with them too so wait this isn't the top

134
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:18,129
with them too so wait this isn't the top
 

135
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:21,569
with them too so wait this isn't the top
floor I want the top floor up here let's

136
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:21,579
floor I want the top floor up here let's
 

137
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:24,809
floor I want the top floor up here let's
make sure I do this right so yeah it

138
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:24,819
make sure I do this right so yeah it
 

139
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:26,159
make sure I do this right so yeah it
makes most sense to put the colored

140
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:26,169
makes most sense to put the colored
 

141
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:27,659
makes most sense to put the colored
stuff on the top floor and then like the

142
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:27,669
stuff on the top floor and then like the
 

143
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:32,309
stuff on the top floor and then like the
random stuff on the bottom all right so

144
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
random stuff on the bottom all right so
 

145
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,099
random stuff on the bottom all right so
we should also try to keep this as

146
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:35,109
we should also try to keep this as
 

147
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:37,710
we should also try to keep this as
organized as we can because the easier

148
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:37,720
organized as we can because the easier
 

149
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,300
organized as we can because the easier
it is to remember where stuff is the

150
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,310
it is to remember where stuff is the
 

151
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,119
it is to remember where stuff is the
better so maybe we'll try to follow a

152
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:42,129
better so maybe we'll try to follow a
 

153
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,979
better so maybe we'll try to follow a
color pattern like will do the

154
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:43,989
color pattern like will do the
 

155
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,229
color pattern like will do the
monochrome stuff first we'll go white to

156
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
monochrome stuff first we'll go white to
 

157
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,159
monochrome stuff first we'll go white to
the dark gray black we have 32 items per

158
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:53,169
the dark gray black we have 32 items per
 

159
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,860
the dark gray black we have 32 items per
row that we can enter here and that

160
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:55,870
row that we can enter here and that
 

161
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,599
row that we can enter here and that
works out pretty good because there's 16

162
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:57,609
works out pretty good because there's 16

00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:55,389
turns out I thought we would have a few
 

199
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:57,809
turns out I thought we would have a few
extra spots after it was all said and

200
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:57,819
extra spots after it was all said and
 

201
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:03,959
extra spots after it was all said and
done no in fact we went over by like 16

items so I removed the dyes from the

204
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:06,699
items so I removed the dyes from the
 

205
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:09,119
items so I removed the dyes from the
system just so that there would be

206
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:09,129
system just so that there would be
 

207
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:11,700
system just so that there would be
enough room for everything and in the

208
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:11,710
enough room for everything and in the
 

209
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,770
enough room for everything and in the
future like I know you guys you're like

etho what it what if there's an update

212
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:15,810
etho what it what if there's an update
 

213
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,480
etho what it what if there's an update
factors one coming out soon I think

214
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:18,490
factors one coming out soon I think
 

215
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,999
factors one coming out soon I think
what if there's an update that adds more

216
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:21,009
what if there's an update that adds more
 

217
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:24,450
what if there's an update that adds more
blocks and stuff well I think if that

218
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:24,460
blocks and stuff well I think if that
 

219
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,070
blocks and stuff well I think if that
happens I'm going to remove anything

220
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
happens I'm going to remove anything
 

221
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,860
happens I'm going to remove anything
that I'm not using very much like that's

222
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:28,870
that I'm not using very much like that's
 

223
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,899
that I'm not using very much like that's
a low priority and I'll replace it with

224
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:30,909
a low priority and I'll replace it with
 

225
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:34,589
a low priority and I'll replace it with
the new item if I think I'll use it I

226
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:34,599
the new item if I think I'll use it I
 

227
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:36,209
the new item if I think I'll use it I
think that's the best way of handling

228
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:36,219
think that's the best way of handling
 

229
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:39,689
think that's the best way of handling
this the next step of this we we are

gotta load the back up and try again

290
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:26,580

 

291
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,249

292
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:29,259
this isn't so bad actually I realized I
 

293
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,129
this isn't so bad actually I realized I
can just put packed ice here and I only

294
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:32,139
can just put packed ice here and I only
 

295
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,140
can just put packed ice here and I only
need the regular ice over the chest so

296
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,150
need the regular ice over the chest so
 

297
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,180
need the regular ice over the chest so
that's just four spots there's no way

298
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,190
that's just four spots there's no way
 

299
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,760
that's just four spots there's no way
for this to leak out if it melts so it's

300
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:38,770
for this to leak out if it melts so it's
 

301
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:44,060
for this to leak out if it melts so it's
perfect and I'm stuck in a hopper no I

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:14,530
we were ready for updates so I think the
 

321
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,809
we were ready for updates so I think the
snapshots are going to be coming out

322
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:15,819
snapshots are going to be coming out
 

323
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:17,339
snapshots are going to be coming out
soon and we're gonna actually see what

324
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:17,349
soon and we're gonna actually see what
 

325
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:20,730
soon and we're gonna actually see what
content they have made and I am pretty

326
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:20,740
content they have made and I am pretty
 

327
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,830
content they have made and I am pretty
hyped about it it's been a few months

328
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:22,840
hyped about it it's been a few months
 

329
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,339
hyped about it it's been a few months
since the last update and we desperately

330
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:26,349
since the last update and we desperately
 

331
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:28,980
since the last update and we desperately
need a new one

332
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:28,990
need a new one
 

333
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,969
need a new one
so the combat update has me pretty

334
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:32,979
so the combat update has me pretty
 

335
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,430
so the combat update has me pretty
interested I don't know if that means

336
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
interested I don't know if that means
 

337
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,459
interested I don't know if that means
they have like focused on redoing game

338
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:38,469
they have like focused on redoing game
 

339
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:40,889
they have like focused on redoing game
mechanics like combat mechanics to the

340
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:40,899
mechanics like combat mechanics to the
 

341
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:43,860
mechanics like combat mechanics to the
game if they have I kind of hope they

342
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:43,870
game if they have I kind of hope they
 

343
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,210
game if they have I kind of hope they
make it more reactionary like where you

344
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:47,220
make it more reactionary like where you
 

345
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,100
make it more reactionary like where you
you can like prayer parry attacks and

346
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,110
you can like prayer parry attacks and
 

347
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,890
you can like prayer parry attacks and
block attacks and like counter

348
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:52,900
block attacks and like counter
 

349
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,900
block attacks and like counter
counter what people do and sort of do

350
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:54,910
counter what people do and sort of do
 

351
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,120
counter what people do and sort of do
that but I don't know how well that

352
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,130
that but I don't know how well that
 

353
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,770
that but I don't know how well that
would work I think no matter what they

354
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:58,780
would work I think no matter what they
 

355
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,620
would work I think no matter what they
do if they rebounce the combat mechanics

356
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:01,630
do if they rebounce the combat mechanics
 

357
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,600
do if they rebounce the combat mechanics
they're going to upset quite a few

358
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:03,610
they're going to upset quite a few
 

359
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,430
they're going to upset quite a few
people yeah it's one of those hard

360
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:08,440
people yeah it's one of those hard
 

361
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,800
people yeah it's one of those hard
things to change because no matter what

362
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:10,810
things to change because no matter what
 

363
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,450
things to change because no matter what
they do they still have to deal with leg

364
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:12,460
they do they still have to deal with leg
 

365
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,210
they do they still have to deal with leg
and I don't think they can ever perfect

366
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:15,220
and I don't think they can ever perfect
 

367
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,310
and I don't think they can ever perfect
it really but I think maybe it's not so

368
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
it really but I think maybe it's not so
 

369
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,650
it really but I think maybe it's not so
much like combat mechanics of change but

370
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:22,660
much like combat mechanics of change but
 

371
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,750
much like combat mechanics of change but
maybe they've just added more combat

372
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:24,760
maybe they've just added more combat
 

373
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,850
maybe they've just added more combat
things to the game like I'm pretty sure

374
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:26,860
things to the game like I'm pretty sure
 

375
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,290
things to the game like I'm pretty sure
they've redone the Enderdragon fight and

376
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:30,300
they've redone the Enderdragon fight and
 

377
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,270
they've redone the Enderdragon fight and
it sounded like they even changed

378
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:33,280
it sounded like they even changed
 

379
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,030
it sounded like they even changed
terrain generation in the end and and a

380
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,040
terrain generation in the end and and a
 

381
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,970
terrain generation in the end and and a
whole bunch other stuff with it so I'm

382
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:38,980
whole bunch other stuff with it so I'm
 

383
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,860
whole bunch other stuff with it so I'm
excited to see that and I don't know

384
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:43,870
excited to see that and I don't know
 

385
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,150
excited to see that and I don't know
what else they've been doing but they've

386
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,160
what else they've been doing but they've
 

387
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,530
what else they've been doing but they've
been working on it for quite a while so

388
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:46,540
been working on it for quite a while so
 

389
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,120
been working on it for quite a while so
I'm sure there's a lot of things they

390
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,130
I'm sure there's a lot of things they
 

391
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,730
I'm sure there's a lot of things they
haven't shown us so yeah it's going to

392
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:50,740
haven't shown us so yeah it's going to
 

393
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:57,150
haven't shown us so yeah it's going to
be pretty cool um this is done with that

394
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,160
be pretty cool um this is done with that
 

395
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,880
be pretty cool um this is done with that
I think we finished it so I got water

396
00:09:59,880 --> 00:09:59,890
I think we finished it so I got water
 

397
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,370
I think we finished it so I got water
streams running between all the rows now

398
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:02,380
streams running between all the rows now
 

399
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,650
streams running between all the rows now
all the water streams are in so this

400
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:04,660
all the water streams are in so this
 

401
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,740
all the water streams are in so this
should fully automatically pick up items

402
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:07,750
should fully automatically pick up items
 

403
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,110
should fully automatically pick up items
and store them now we're gonna have to

404
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,120
and store them now we're gonna have to
 

405
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,580
and store them now we're gonna have to
try this out okay guys so at the very

406
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:14,590
try this out okay guys so at the very
 

407
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,680
try this out okay guys so at the very
top left of the Nexus here this is where

408
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:16,690
top left of the Nexus here this is where
 

409
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,390
top left of the Nexus here this is where
the water stream begins for the

410
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:18,400
the water stream begins for the
 

411
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,940
the water stream begins for the
automatic storage and I'm just going to

412
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:20,950
automatic storage and I'm just going to
 

413
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:25,550
automatic storage and I'm just going to
add in one more alignment thing here

414
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:25,560
add in one more alignment thing here
 

415
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,100
add in one more alignment thing here
alright so when you throw in an item it

416
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,110
alright so when you throw in an item it
 

417
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,550
alright so when you throw in an item it
should hit the ender chest and then it

418
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
should hit the ender chest and then it
 

419
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,860
should hit the ender chest and then it
physicians item between the hopper and

420
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:34,870
physicians item between the hopper and
 

421
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,140
physicians item between the hopper and
the ice so it can still move very

422
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,150
the ice so it can still move very
 

423
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,750
the ice so it can still move very
quickly through the water streams but

424
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
quickly through the water streams but
 

425
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,220
quickly through the water streams but
the hoppers are able to pick them up

426
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,230
the hoppers are able to pick them up
 

427
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,540
the hoppers are able to pick them up
still the very last item this is going

428
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:45,550
still the very last item this is going
 

429
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,870
still the very last item this is going
to reach is the oak oak wood so I'm

430
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
to reach is the oak oak wood so I'm
 

431
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,190
to reach is the oak oak wood so I'm
going to throw a couple of these in and

432
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,200
going to throw a couple of these in and
 

433
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,400
going to throw a couple of these in and
see if they make it all the way and

434
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,410
see if they make it all the way and
 

435
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,150
see if they make it all the way and
maybe just a few oak planks too and

436
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,160
maybe just a few oak planks too and
 

437
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,340
maybe just a few oak planks too and
we'll kind of get an idea of how long it

438
00:10:59,340 --> 00:10:59,350
we'll kind of get an idea of how long it
 

439
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,190
we'll kind of get an idea of how long it
takes it to pass through all this so it

440
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,200
takes it to pass through all this so it
 

441
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,610
takes it to pass through all this so it
just does it oh let's not break that it

442
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:05,620
just does it oh let's not break that it
 

443
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,809
just does it oh let's not break that it
does as IG's I hear

444
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:06,819
does as IG's I hear
 

445
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:07,979
does as IG's I hear
so it's going to come back you see it

446
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:07,989
so it's going to come back you see it
 

447
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:10,650
so it's going to come back you see it
whizzing by now and then it goes down

448
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:10,660
whizzing by now and then it goes down
 

449
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,859
whizzing by now and then it goes down
there and it goes around the band comes

450
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:13,869
there and it goes around the band comes
 

451
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:16,710
there and it goes around the band comes
back and then it falls down to the the

452
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
back and then it falls down to the the
 

453
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,869
back and then it falls down to the the
bottom level because there's two levels

454
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:18,879
bottom level because there's two levels
 

455
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,629
bottom level because there's two levels
to this whole thing they should start

456
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:21,639
to this whole thing they should start
 

457
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:27,650
to this whole thing they should start
falling down here yeah looking good and

458
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:27,660
falling down here yeah looking good and
 

459
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,239
falling down here yeah looking good and
we got to make sure these items can get

460
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:30,249
we got to make sure these items can get
 

461
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:32,159
we got to make sure these items can get
through all this before they despawn so

462
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:32,169
through all this before they despawn so
 

463
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,379
through all this before they despawn so
if it takes longer than five minutes

464
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:33,389
if it takes longer than five minutes
 

465
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:36,419
if it takes longer than five minutes
that's not going to be so good we'll

466
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:36,429
that's not going to be so good we'll
 

467
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,719
that's not going to be so good we'll
have to like add something to refresh

468
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:39,729
have to like add something to refresh
 

469
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:42,719
have to like add something to refresh
the items if that happens but if we go

470
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:42,729
the items if that happens but if we go
 

471
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:47,789
the items if that happens but if we go
all the way down here this is the end of

472
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:47,799
all the way down here this is the end of
 

473
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,650
all the way down here this is the end of
it up there

474
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:49,660
it up there
 

475
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,590
it up there
yeah up there is the very end so this is

476
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:52,600
yeah up there is the very end so this is
 

477
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,999
yeah up there is the very end so this is
the Oakwood and I think this is the oak

478
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:57,009
the Oakwood and I think this is the oak
 

479
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,729
the Oakwood and I think this is the oak
planks here so if we give it just a

480
00:11:59,729 --> 00:11:59,739
planks here so if we give it just a
 

481
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:01,439
planks here so if we give it just a
little bit of time it should finally

482
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:01,449
little bit of time it should finally
 

483
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:03,539
little bit of time it should finally
make it here might be able to see it

484
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:03,549
make it here might be able to see it
 

485
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:08,309
make it here might be able to see it
whiz by here even doo-doo-doo I think it

486
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:08,319
whiz by here even doo-doo-doo I think it
 

487
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:14,279
whiz by here even doo-doo-doo I think it
would be a belt now come on I hope it

488
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:14,289
would be a belt now come on I hope it
 

489
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:17,639
would be a belt now come on I hope it
doesn't get stuck anywhere this is gonna

490
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:17,649
doesn't get stuck anywhere this is gonna
 

491
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,609
doesn't get stuck anywhere this is gonna
be so cool when it's all done guys I'm

492
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:20,619
be so cool when it's all done guys I'm
 

493
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:23,969
be so cool when it's all done guys I'm
excited for it this was a big step if we

494
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:23,979
excited for it this was a big step if we
 

495
00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:27,419
excited for it this was a big step if we
can get this to work they still haven't

496
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:27,429
can get this to work they still haven't
 

497
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:29,219
can get this to work they still haven't
made it though maybe I missed them maybe

498
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:29,229
made it though maybe I missed them maybe
 

499
00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:33,239
made it though maybe I missed them maybe
they went by and I didn't see it let's

500
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:33,249
they went by and I didn't see it let's
 

501
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:40,909
they went by and I didn't see it let's
check nope hmm out there they are whoops

502
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:40,919
check nope hmm out there they are whoops
 

503
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,759
check nope hmm out there they are whoops
okay I forgot some enderchest here that

504
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:44,769
okay I forgot some enderchest here that
 

505
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,189
okay I forgot some enderchest here that
makes sense

506
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:46,199
makes sense
 

507
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:50,219
makes sense
aha good thing I checked so what we got

508
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:50,229
aha good thing I checked so what we got
 

509
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,079
aha good thing I checked so what we got
to do is put two ender chests here you

510
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:52,089
to do is put two ender chests here you
 

511
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:54,509
to do is put two ender chests here you
have to use two otherwise it doesn't

512
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:54,519
have to use two otherwise it doesn't
 

513
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:58,249
have to use two otherwise it doesn't
align it properly from what I could tell

514
00:12:58,249 --> 00:12:58,259
align it properly from what I could tell
 

515
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:00,809
align it properly from what I could tell
okay now they should be able to make it

516
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:00,819
okay now they should be able to make it
 

517
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:03,719
okay now they should be able to make it
the rest of the way nope here they come

518
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:03,729
the rest of the way nope here they come
 

519
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:06,179
the rest of the way nope here they come
I so I tried it again here guys with

520
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:06,189
I so I tried it again here guys with
 

521
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:08,849
I so I tried it again here guys with
spruce wood and just want to make sure

522
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:08,859
spruce wood and just want to make sure
 

523
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:11,519
spruce wood and just want to make sure
can do the whole loop so those should

524
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:11,529
can do the whole loop so those should
 

525
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:14,460
can do the whole loop so those should
end up in the third spot if I remember

526
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:14,470
end up in the third spot if I remember
 

527
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,269
end up in the third spot if I remember
right goes oak birch spruce jungle yeah

528
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:18,279
right goes oak birch spruce jungle yeah
 

529
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,769
right goes oak birch spruce jungle yeah
look at that

530
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:19,779
look at that
 

531
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:24,660
look at that
oh it's so cool very cool so yeah

532
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:24,670
oh it's so cool very cool so yeah
 

533
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,610
oh it's so cool very cool so yeah
automatic sorting and storage is working

534
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:28,620
automatic sorting and storage is working
 

535
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,840
automatic sorting and storage is working
what we're going to have to start

536
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:30,850
what we're going to have to start
 

537
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,139
what we're going to have to start
getting into next is probably building

538
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:34,149
getting into next is probably building
 

539
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:36,720
getting into next is probably building
our command room over here because what

540
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:36,730
our command room over here because what
 

541
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,480
our command room over here because what
we got to do is attach to the water

542
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:39,490
we got to do is attach to the water
 

543
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,730
we got to do is attach to the water
stream at the top left there will want

544
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:41,740
stream at the top left there will want
 

545
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,360
stream at the top left there will want
like a chest in the command room where

546
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,370
like a chest in the command room where
 

547
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,579
like a chest in the command room where
we can basically just drop off stuff and

548
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:47,589
we can basically just drop off stuff and
 

549
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:51,179
we can basically just drop off stuff and
then it's going to put it into a dropper

550
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:51,189
then it's going to put it into a dropper
 

551
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:52,319
then it's going to put it into a dropper
and it's going to shoot it out at a

552
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:52,329
and it's going to shoot it out at a
 

553
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:54,960
and it's going to shoot it out at a
certain speed he'll go up an item

554
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:54,970
certain speed he'll go up an item
 

555
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,059
certain speed he'll go up an item
elevator and then to the water stream

556
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:57,069
elevator and then to the water stream
 

557
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,910
elevator and then to the water stream
there and it'll do the loop and then

558
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
there and it'll do the loop and then
 

559
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,949
there and it'll do the loop and then
anything that doesn't get sorted by the

560
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:01,959
anything that doesn't get sorted by the
 

561
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,470
anything that doesn't get sorted by the
system is going to shoot out the end of

562
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:04,480
system is going to shoot out the end of
 

563
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,900
system is going to shoot out the end of
there so we'll have to bring it back to

564
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:06,910
there so we'll have to bring it back to
 

565
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,449
there so we'll have to bring it back to
the command room here and store it in a

566
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:09,459
the command room here and store it in a
 

567
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:10,799
the command room here and store it in a
chest and that will be the junk that

568
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:10,809
chest and that will be the junk that
 

569
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,319
chest and that will be the junk that
that can't get sorted or that there's no

570
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:13,329
that can't get sorted or that there's no
 

571
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:16,139
that can't get sorted or that there's no
space left for and that way it doesn't

572
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:16,149
space left for and that way it doesn't
 

573
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:20,069
space left for and that way it doesn't
just go to waste you know uhm so yeah I

574
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:20,079
just go to waste you know uhm so yeah I
 

575
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,590
just go to waste you know uhm so yeah I
think that'll be pretty cool for the

576
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:22,600
think that'll be pretty cool for the
 

577
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,139
think that'll be pretty cool for the
command room here I'm a little bit

578
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:25,149
command room here I'm a little bit
 

579
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:27,299
command room here I'm a little bit
inspired to buy what I built in my

580
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:27,309
inspired to buy what I built in my
 

581
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:30,540
inspired to buy what I built in my
modded series that little command room

582
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:30,550
modded series that little command room
 

583
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,699
modded series that little command room
so I think we might go for like a grey

584
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:32,709
so I think we might go for like a grey
 

585
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:36,809
so I think we might go for like a grey
floor with white walls like same style

586
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:36,819
floor with white walls like same style
 

587
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:38,939
floor with white walls like same style
but difference like vanilla blocks

588
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:38,949
but difference like vanilla blocks
 

589
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:41,519
but difference like vanilla blocks
instead of modded blocks so we might use

590
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:41,529
instead of modded blocks so we might use
 

591
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:44,519
instead of modded blocks so we might use
courts for the walls and then cyan clay

592
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:44,529
courts for the walls and then cyan clay
 

593
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,860
courts for the walls and then cyan clay
for like the black parts and do

594
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:46,870
for like the black parts and do
 

595
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,410
for like the black parts and do
something sort of similar like really

596
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:49,420
something sort of similar like really
 

597
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,059
something sort of similar like really
high-tech looking build ooh and what

598
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,069
high-tech looking build ooh and what
 

599
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:56,639
high-tech looking build ooh and what
else did we have light blue so we might

600
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:56,649
else did we have light blue so we might
 

601
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:58,230
else did we have light blue so we might
use light blue as like a high light

602
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
use light blue as like a high light
 

603
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,860
use light blue as like a high light
thing to kind of those colors you hear

604
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:04,870
thing to kind of those colors you hear
 

605
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,600
thing to kind of those colors you hear

that
 

607
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,720
that
is that in the building I'm pretty sure

608
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:10,730
is that in the building I'm pretty sure
 

609
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:17,790
is that in the building I'm pretty sure
I put torches in all these very weird

on the Nexus today I think we'll change

628
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:56,630
on the Nexus today I think we'll change
 

629
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,230
on the Nexus today I think we'll change
it up now and do work on a few other

630

good I was thinking let's do some work
 

635
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,140
good I was thinking let's do some work
on our sandy city here haven't worked on

636
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,150
on our sandy city here haven't worked on
 

637
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,800
on our sandy city here haven't worked on
in a little while yeah we're missing a

638
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:14,810
in a little while yeah we're missing a
 

639
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,500
in a little while yeah we're missing a
piece of carpet now over there oh well

640
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:17,510
piece of carpet now over there oh well
 

641
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,860
piece of carpet now over there oh well
so I was looking at this I thought it

642
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:20,870
so I was looking at this I thought it
 

643
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,400
so I was looking at this I thought it
would be cool if we maybe added a wall

644
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,410
would be cool if we maybe added a wall
 

645
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,790
would be cool if we maybe added a wall
around it because look at this we got

646
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:27,800
around it because look at this we got
 

647
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,400
around it because look at this we got
the sharp transition from sand to grass

648
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:30,410
the sharp transition from sand to grass
 

649
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,200
the sharp transition from sand to grass
I think that's always going to look bad

650
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,210
I think that's always going to look bad
 

651
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,870
I think that's always going to look bad
it's going to be really hard to smooth

652
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
it's going to be really hard to smooth
 

653
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,510
it's going to be really hard to smooth
that out but if we have a wall we could

654
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:37,520
that out but if we have a wall we could
 

655
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,370
that out but if we have a wall we could
have sand on one side and grass on the

656
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:39,380
have sand on one side and grass on the
 

657
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,860
have sand on one side and grass on the
other and it'll kind of create a

658
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:41,870
other and it'll kind of create a
 

659
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,920
other and it'll kind of create a
separation of the two and I think it is

660
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:44,930
separation of the two and I think it is
 

661
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,290
separation of the two and I think it is
so cool just have a wall around the city

662
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:47,300
so cool just have a wall around the city
 

663
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,550
so cool just have a wall around the city
so let's do it

664
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
so let's do it
 

665
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,250
so let's do it
let's see what we can do here I'm gonna

666
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:51,260
let's see what we can do here I'm gonna
 

667
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,090
let's see what we can do here I'm gonna
try build it out a sandstone primarily

668
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,100
try build it out a sandstone primarily
 

669
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,550
try build it out a sandstone primarily
gravity we need more we need more stairs

670
00:16:59,550 --> 00:16:59,560
gravity we need more we need more stairs
 

671
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,540
gravity we need more we need more stairs
let's make a few more oh I have the

672
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:01,550
let's make a few more oh I have the
 

673
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,670
let's make a few more oh I have the
carpet on me I don't even see that cool

674
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
carpet on me I don't even see that cool
 

675
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:12,160
carpet on me I don't even see that cool
let's put that back okay so maybe where

676
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,170
let's put that back okay so maybe where
 

677
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,949
let's put that back okay so maybe where
should we start this let's start

678
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959

 

679
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,559

yeah maybe let's plan to put a wall down

680
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:19,569
yeah maybe let's plan to put a wall down
 

681
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,960
yeah maybe let's plan to put a wall down
this line here okay

682
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:21,970
this line here okay
 

683
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,340
this line here okay
so doesn't necessarily need to be very

684
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:26,350
so doesn't necessarily need to be very
 

685
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,850
so doesn't necessarily need to be very
tall I like to work with odd numbers all

686
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:29,860
tall I like to work with odd numbers all
 

687
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,999
tall I like to work with odd numbers all
the time I could do pattern like this

688
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:33,009
the time I could do pattern like this
 

689
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:41,460
the time I could do pattern like this
and then three ah it's amazing let's

690
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:41,470
and then three ah it's amazing let's
 

691
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,090
and then three ah it's amazing let's
build it up one more and then maybe

692
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,100
build it up one more and then maybe
 

693
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,919
build it up one more and then maybe
we'll do the arch thing like we were

694
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:46,929
we'll do the arch thing like we were
 

695
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:48,539
we'll do the arch thing like we were
kind of planning on doing on the pyramid

696
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:48,549
kind of planning on doing on the pyramid
 

697
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:51,989
kind of planning on doing on the pyramid
so let's do like stairs that kind of

698
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:51,999
so let's do like stairs that kind of
 

699
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:54,629
so let's do like stairs that kind of
curve is that going to be might need to

700
00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:54,639
curve is that going to be might need to
 

701
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:57,210
curve is that going to be might need to
go a little bit taller and we could do

702
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:57,220
go a little bit taller and we could do
 

703
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,859
go a little bit taller and we could do
like the castle wall thing like where

704
00:17:58,859 --> 00:17:58,869
like the castle wall thing like where
 

705
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:04,830
like the castle wall thing like where
it's jagged kind of like that might be

706
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:04,840
it's jagged kind of like that might be
 

707
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,629
it's jagged kind of like that might be
cool yeah I like that

708
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:09,639
cool yeah I like that
 

709
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:13,769
cool yeah I like that
okay so let's fill this in and I would

710
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:13,779
okay so let's fill this in and I would
 

711
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:15,060
okay so let's fill this in and I would
like to make it so we can actually go on

712
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,070
like to make it so we can actually go on
 

713
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,499
like to make it so we can actually go on
the wall to not just like a one wide

714
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:16,509
the wall to not just like a one wide
 

715
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:21,450
the wall to not just like a one wide
thing that's kind of cool here I don't

716
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:21,460
thing that's kind of cool here I don't
 

717
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,580
thing that's kind of cool here I don't
like this sharp thing let's put a slab

718
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:23,590
like this sharp thing let's put a slab
 

719
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:29,340
like this sharp thing let's put a slab
between like that yeah so maybe let's

720
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:29,350
between like that yeah so maybe let's
 

721
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,989
between like that yeah so maybe let's
make it three wide so will will kind of

722
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:33,999
make it three wide so will will kind of
 

723
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:36,210
make it three wide so will will kind of
copy that on this side and then in

724
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:36,220
copy that on this side and then in
 

725
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,239
copy that on this side and then in
between we could here let's grab some

726
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:39,249
between we could here let's grab some
 

727
00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:41,879
between we could here let's grab some
birch slabs because that's kind of what

728
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:41,889
birch slabs because that's kind of what
 

729
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:45,629
birch slabs because that's kind of what
I've been using here um and that's not

730
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:45,639
I've been using here um and that's not
 

731
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:50,970
I've been using here um and that's not
very materials were my materials I've

732
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:50,980
very materials were my materials I've
 

733
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,889
very materials were my materials I've
been building like all over our world

734
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:52,899
been building like all over our world
 

735
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,950
been building like all over our world
here so I got stuff like in so many

736
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:55,960
here so I got stuff like in so many
 

737
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,810
here so I got stuff like in so many
different locations I'll split up and

738
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:57,820
different locations I'll split up and
 

739
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,830
different locations I'll split up and
it's it's gone for good basically got to

740
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
it's it's gone for good basically got to
 

741
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,090
it's it's gone for good basically got to
do a bunch of farming again to get more

742
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,100
do a bunch of farming again to get more
 

743
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,590
do a bunch of farming again to get more
yeah this might be nice though do that

744
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
yeah this might be nice though do that
 

745
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,200
yeah this might be nice though do that
maybe in places we could set up like an

746
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,210
maybe in places we could set up like an
 

747
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,180
maybe in places we could set up like an
overhang above us and have some lighting

748
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:12,190
overhang above us and have some lighting
 

749
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:17,039
overhang above us and have some lighting
too but yeah maybe we'll just do this

750
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:17,049
too but yeah maybe we'll just do this
 

751
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:20,399
too but yeah maybe we'll just do this
first off I'll go around our city here

752
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:20,409
first off I'll go around our city here
 

753
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,820
first off I'll go around our city here
and then we could add points of interest

754
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:23,830
and then we could add points of interest
 

755
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,200
and then we could add points of interest
on the wall to like to have certain

756
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,210
on the wall to like to have certain
 

757
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,700
on the wall to like to have certain
sections that are a little bit different

758
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:26,710
sections that are a little bit different
 

759
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,389
sections that are a little bit different
just so it's not so so boring like all

760
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:30,399
just so it's not so so boring like all
 

761
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:30,630
just so it's not so so boring like all
this

762
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:30,640
this
 

763
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,270
this
same how's that aha so check it out guys

764
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:36,280
same how's that aha so check it out guys
 

765
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,800
same how's that aha so check it out guys
I've been working on this for a little

766
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:37,810
I've been working on this for a little
 

767
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,650
I've been working on this for a little
bit and I am pretty happy with what we

768
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:40,660
bit and I am pretty happy with what we
 

769
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,740
bit and I am pretty happy with what we
got here so far I think that looks

770
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:43,750
got here so far I think that looks
 

771
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,070
got here so far I think that looks
pretty cool right now I haven't put the

772
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,080
pretty cool right now I haven't put the
 

773
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,290
pretty cool right now I haven't put the
blocks in between like the filler I

774
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:49,300
blocks in between like the filler I
 

775
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,310
blocks in between like the filler I
don't know what to use um yeah I just

776
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:53,320
don't know what to use um yeah I just
 

777
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,660
don't know what to use um yeah I just
got it going up and around the village

778
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:54,670
got it going up and around the village
 

779
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,700
got it going up and around the village
here try to keep the shape of it as best

780
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:56,710
here try to keep the shape of it as best
 

781
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,710
here try to keep the shape of it as best
as I could did a little bit of

782
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:58,720
as I could did a little bit of
 

783
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,900
as I could did a little bit of
terraforming on the way we'll have to

784
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:00,910
terraforming on the way we'll have to
 

785
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,120
terraforming on the way we'll have to
clean it up a bit

786
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,130
clean it up a bit
 

787
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,010
clean it up a bit
like this should be sand we want sand on

788
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:05,020
like this should be sand we want sand on
 

789
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,870
like this should be sand we want sand on
this side of the wall and grass on the

790
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,880
this side of the wall and grass on the
 

791
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,920
this side of the wall and grass on the
other side where it's possible so I'm

792
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:10,930
other side where it's possible so I'm
 

793
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,720
other side where it's possible so I'm
trying to go down like the biome line

794
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:12,730
trying to go down like the biome line
 

795
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,360
trying to go down like the biome line
here so that we don't have brown grass

796
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,370
here so that we don't have brown grass
 

797
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,360
here so that we don't have brown grass
anywhere this is very close to the man

798
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,370
anywhere this is very close to the man
 

799
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,400
anywhere this is very close to the man
cave as well so we'll have to try

800
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:20,410
cave as well so we'll have to try
 

801
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,850
cave as well so we'll have to try
incorporate this into maybe this path

802
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:23,860
incorporate this into maybe this path
 

803
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,310
incorporate this into maybe this path
over here we could blend those two

804
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
over here we could blend those two
 

805
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,920
over here we could blend those two
together somehow would be amazing like

806
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:28,930
together somehow would be amazing like
 

807
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,070
together somehow would be amazing like
we could put a gate on the wall maybe

808
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,080
we could put a gate on the wall maybe
 

809
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,170
we could put a gate on the wall maybe
over here and then like redo this area a

810
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:34,180
over here and then like redo this area a
 

811
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,790
over here and then like redo this area a
little bit could be cool and I like the

812
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:38,800
little bit could be cool and I like the
 

813
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,710
little bit could be cool and I like the
view from up here you can sort of run

814
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:40,720
view from up here you can sort of run
 

815
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,780
view from up here you can sort of run
around the top of the wall you get a

816
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:42,790
around the top of the wall you get a
 

817
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,200
around the top of the wall you get a
little raised view of the whole area I

818
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,210
little raised view of the whole area I
 

819
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,990
little raised view of the whole area I
think is pretty cool and we'll probably

820
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,000
think is pretty cool and we'll probably
 

821
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,140
think is pretty cool and we'll probably
add like towers in the corners and a few

822
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,150
add like towers in the corners and a few
 

823
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,740
add like towers in the corners and a few
places to like with a floor above us

824
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:55,750
places to like with a floor above us
 

825
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,840
places to like with a floor above us
type of thing and you can have like a

00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:04,180
underneath the leaf there that was the
 

833
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,390
underneath the leaf there that was the

867
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,470
have probably noticed it I used to do
like five or six a week and now it's

868
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:55,480
like five or six a week and now it's
 

869
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,790
like five or six a week and now it's
more like four it's not good it's very

870
00:21:59,790 --> 00:21:59,800
more like four it's not good it's very
 

871
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,750
more like four it's not good it's very
very bad um it's not because I'm on the

872
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
very bad um it's not because I'm on the
 

873
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,400
very bad um it's not because I'm on the
couch watching TV or anything like that

874
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:05,410
couch watching TV or anything like that
 

875
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,970
couch watching TV or anything like that
it's because I have a lot of series that

876
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:08,980
it's because I have a lot of series that
 

877
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,340
it's because I have a lot of series that
are huge time sinks and this is one of

878
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:11,350
are huge time sinks and this is one of
 

879
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,760
are huge time sinks and this is one of
them I know I can't just end this series

880
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:14,770
them I know I can't just end this series
 

881
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,910
them I know I can't just end this series
oh I that would not be a good idea I

882
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:17,920
oh I that would not be a good idea I
 

883
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,940
oh I that would not be a good idea I
don't think I need to maybe come up with

884
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:20,950
don't think I need to maybe come up with
 

885
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,860
don't think I need to maybe come up with
ways of spending less time per episode

886
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:22,870
ways of spending less time per episode
 

887
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,910
ways of spending less time per episode
though like today I've spent over twelve

888
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:26,920
though like today I've spent over twelve
 

889
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,890
though like today I've spent over twelve
hours on this episode and same with the

890
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:28,900
hours on this episode and same with the
 

891
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,840
hours on this episode and same with the
last one I spent over twelve hours on it

892
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:30,850
last one I spent over twelve hours on it
 

893
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,380
last one I spent over twelve hours on it
it's not it's not good turnover time um

894
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:33,390
it's not it's not good turnover time um
 

895
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,300
it's not it's not good turnover time um
and it doesn't necessarily make the

896
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,310
and it doesn't necessarily make the
 

897
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,270
and it doesn't necessarily make the
video more entertaining spending that

898
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280
video more entertaining spending that
 

899
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,980
video more entertaining spending that
much time on it like most of that was

900
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:40,990
much time on it like most of that was
 

901
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,660
much time on it like most of that was
just collecting the items together to

902
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:42,670
just collecting the items together to
 

903
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:47,580
just collecting the items together to
put into the Nexus and and yeah spent

904
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:47,590
put into the Nexus and and yeah spent
 

905
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,020
put into the Nexus and and yeah spent
like four or five hours on that then I

906
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,030
like four or five hours on that then I
 

907
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,990
like four or five hours on that then I
built it a lot off camera and lots of

908
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,000
built it a lot off camera and lots of
 

909
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,970
built it a lot off camera and lots of
off camera stuff which isn't necessarily

910
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:53,980
off camera stuff which isn't necessarily
 

911
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,860
off camera stuff which isn't necessarily
good so currently I have four series I

912
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:58,870
good so currently I have four series I
 

913

got hermit craft and Flyboys all four of

916
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:04,660
got hermit craft and Flyboys all four of
 

917
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,600
got hermit craft and Flyboys all four of
those are building series that take

918
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:06,610
those are building series that take
 

919
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,750
those are building series that take
quite a bit of time per episode to make

920
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
quite a bit of time per episode to make
 

921
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,850
quite a bit of time per episode to make
ah so what do I do I don't know like if

922
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:14,860
ah so what do I do I don't know like if
 

923
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,010
ah so what do I do I don't know like if
I just upload them less than people

924
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,020
I just upload them less than people
 

925
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,320
I just upload them less than people
aren't happy if I can them people aren't

926
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:19,330
aren't happy if I can them people aren't
 

927
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,220
aren't happy if I can them people aren't
happy it's a tough situation I'm not

928
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,230
happy it's a tough situation I'm not
 

929
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:28,500
happy it's a tough situation I'm not
sure the best course of action um yeah

930
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:28,510
sure the best course of action um yeah
 

931
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,240
sure the best course of action um yeah
but that's basically what's going on

932
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,250
but that's basically what's going on
 

933
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,980
but that's basically what's going on
I'll have to try figure something out

934
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:31,990
I'll have to try figure something out
 

935
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,960
I'll have to try figure something out
and maybe if you have ideas leave it in

936
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:33,970
and maybe if you have ideas leave it in
 

937
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,700
and maybe if you have ideas leave it in
the in the comments and hopefully

938
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:35,710
the in the comments and hopefully
 

939
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,550
the in the comments and hopefully
somehow I can get more episodes out I

940
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:38,560
somehow I can get more episodes out I
 

941
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,100
somehow I can get more episodes out I
think regardless I'm going to try to do

942
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,110
think regardless I'm going to try to do
 

943
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,670
think regardless I'm going to try to do
some more like custom map stuff maybe

944
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:44,680
some more like custom map stuff maybe
 

945
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,670
some more like custom map stuff maybe
maybe start another game and just see if

946
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:47,680
