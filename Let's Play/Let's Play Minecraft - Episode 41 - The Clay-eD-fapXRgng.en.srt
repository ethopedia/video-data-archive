00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,910
where I speak okay so we might have to
go back to one of those other methods we

328
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:26,920
go back to one of those other methods we
 

329
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:34,590
go back to one of those other methods we
tried last time actually I'm gonna try

330
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:34,600
tried last time actually I'm gonna try
 

331
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,750
tried last time actually I'm gonna try
drown them first to see how that works

332
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:38,760

 

333
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,329

here we go again

334
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:41,339
here we go again
 

335
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,650
here we go again
we're gonna try drowning on this time

336
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:43,660
we're gonna try drowning on this time
 

337
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:50,670
we're gonna try drowning on this time
I've made this quite a bit bigger I kind

338
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:50,680
I've made this quite a bit bigger I kind
 

339
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,250
I've made this quite a bit bigger I kind
of just how high I would need to make it

340
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:55,260
of just how high I would need to make it
 

341
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,050
of just how high I would need to make it
hopefully they don't drown on their way

342
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:58,060
hopefully they don't drown on their way
 

343
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,410
hopefully they don't drown on their way
up I mean like completely drown

344
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:03,420
up I mean like completely drown
 

345
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:09,470
up I mean like completely drown
[Music]

346
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:09,480

 

347
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,790

it's too big I'm going to make it small

348
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
it's too big I'm going to make it small
 

349
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:28,199
it's too big I'm going to make it small
so I've adjusted it and it seems to be a

350
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:28,209
so I've adjusted it and it seems to be a
 

351
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:32,449
so I've adjusted it and it seems to be a
little bit unreliable

352
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:32,459

 

353
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,439

sometimes they drown on their way up

354
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:34,449
sometimes they drown on their way up
 

355
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:39,090
sometimes they drown on their way up
sometimes they don't one hint that's

356
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:39,100
sometimes they don't one hint that's
 

357
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,759
sometimes they don't one hint that's
good that's what we want one hit you hit

358
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:44,769
good that's what we want one hit you hit
 

359
00:15:44,769 --> 00:16:10,919
good that's what we want one hit you hit
the ground I appreciate that skeleton

360
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:10,929
the ground I appreciate that skeleton
 

361
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:26,660
the ground I appreciate that skeleton
and you didn't die

362
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:26,670

 

363
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,220

so I've been watching the sink for a few

364
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,230
so I've been watching the sink for a few
 

365
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,160
so I've been watching the sink for a few
minutes and I've concluded that drowning

366
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,170
minutes and I've concluded that drowning
 

367
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,769
minutes and I've concluded that drowning
is a fair bit less reliable than

368
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:36,779
is a fair bit less reliable than
 

369
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,990
is a fair bit less reliable than
weakening weakening the mobs with

370
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
weakening weakening the mobs with
 

371
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,620
weakening weakening the mobs with
gravity one shot the odd time they will

372
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:46,630
gravity one shot the odd time they will
 

373
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:53,630
gravity one shot the odd time they will
actually drown in this tube shot and

374
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:53,640
actually drown in this tube shot and
 

375
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,200
actually drown in this tube shot and
sometimes it down in there too sometimes

376
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,210
sometimes it down in there too sometimes
 

377
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,600
sometimes it down in there too sometimes
they take up the three hits to kill

378
00:16:59,600 --> 00:16:59,610
they take up the three hits to kill
 

379
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:15,750
they take up the three hits to kill
after they get out so yeah

380
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760
after they get out so yeah
 

381
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:29,520
after they get out so yeah
I'm probably gonna stick to gravity how

382
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:29,530
I'm probably gonna stick to gravity how
 

383
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,650
I'm probably gonna stick to gravity how
about not exactly sure how I'm gonna do

384
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:31,660
about not exactly sure how I'm gonna do
 

385
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:37,080
about not exactly sure how I'm gonna do
that yet since it has issues to be two

386
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,090
that yet since it has issues to be two
 

387
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:44,910
that yet since it has issues to be two
shots I don't want to do the I don't

388
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:44,920
shots I don't want to do the I don't
 

389
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,350
shots I don't want to do the I don't
want to shoot them with dispensers

390
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:46,360
want to shoot them with dispensers
 

391
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,600
want to shoot them with dispensers
because that's not really a long-term

392
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:50,610
because that's not really a long-term
 

393
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,780
because that's not really a long-term
method I don't think because it'll take

394
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:54,790
method I don't think because it'll take
 

395
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:01,130
method I don't think because it'll take
four arrows every mob that goes through

396
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:01,140

 

397
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,590

and I'm sure it'll have problems too so

398
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:06,600
and I'm sure it'll have problems too so
 

399
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,910
and I'm sure it'll have problems too so
gravity is still the winner in my

400
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:08,920
gravity is still the winner in my
 

401
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,540
gravity is still the winner in my
opinion some of you suggest I should use

402
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:12,550
opinion some of you suggest I should use
 

403
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,560
opinion some of you suggest I should use
slow sand and do a setup like I had last

404
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:16,570
slow sand and do a setup like I had last
 

405
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:21,450
slow sand and do a setup like I had last
episode with the horizontal thing with

406
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:21,460
episode with the horizontal thing with
 

407
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,840
episode with the horizontal thing with
the lava I don't think that's a good

408
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:24,850
the lava I don't think that's a good
 

409
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,500
the lava I don't think that's a good
idea either because if the mobs bump

410
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:28,510
idea either because if the mobs bump
 

411
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,380
idea either because if the mobs bump
each other around it's going to change

412
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:31,390
each other around it's going to change
 

413
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:37,000
each other around it's going to change
things quite a bit

414
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,010

 

415
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,190

so yeah gravity seems to be the winner

416
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,200
so yeah gravity seems to be the winner
 

417
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,030
so yeah gravity seems to be the winner
at the moment someone also suggested

418
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,040
at the moment someone also suggested
 

419
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,390
at the moment someone also suggested
that I have like water block a lab uh

420
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:47,400
that I have like water block a lab uh
 

421
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,250
that I have like water block a lab uh
that they have to swim up and then water

422
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:49,260
that they have to swim up and then water
 

423
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,790
that they have to swim up and then water
to put out the flames I've actually

424
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:52,800
to put out the flames I've actually
 

425
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,669
to put out the flames I've actually
tried that before they can almost make

426
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
tried that before they can almost make
 

427
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,010
tried that before they can almost make
it all the way up but they died in the

428
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,020
it all the way up but they died in the
 

429
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:04,669
it all the way up but they died in the
lava and flames don't work as this cows

430
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:04,679
lava and flames don't work as this cows
 

431
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,940
lava and flames don't work as this cows
about to demonstrate they always kill

432
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:07,950
about to demonstrate they always kill
 

433
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:15,500
about to demonstrate they always kill
the the mob unless you distinguish it

434
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:15,510
the the mob unless you distinguish it
 

435
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:21,770
the the mob unless you distinguish it
but yep so gravity is a winner let's go

436
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:21,780
but yep so gravity is a winner let's go
 

437
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,200
but yep so gravity is a winner let's go
check on us wits if they made it to the

438
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,210
check on us wits if they made it to the
 

439
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:30,140
check on us wits if they made it to the
collection points and yeah I'm not gonna

440
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,150
collection points and yeah I'm not gonna
 

441
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,860
collection points and yeah I'm not gonna
use cactus either because cactus are

442
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:33,870
use cactus either because cactus are
 

443
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,470
use cactus either because cactus are
almost always a bad idea

444
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,480
almost always a bad idea
 

445
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:44,330
almost always a bad idea
oh it's probably the worst time little

446
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:44,340
oh it's probably the worst time little
 

447
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:50,690
oh it's probably the worst time little
squid hunting especially when you can't

448
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:50,700
squid hunting especially when you can't
 

449
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:59,470
squid hunting especially when you can't
find your collection point others I

450
00:19:59,470 --> 00:19:59,480

 

451
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:13,510

think I see some squid yep we caught two

452
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
think I see some squid yep we caught two
 

453
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,250
think I see some squid yep we caught two
and that was only probably fifteen to

454
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:19,260
and that was only probably fifteen to
 

455
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,590
and that was only probably fifteen to
thirty minutes

456
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:22,600

 

457
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,900

I see there's one over there still let's

458
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:27,910
I see there's one over there still let's
 

459
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:37,500
I see there's one over there still let's
go see why he didn't want to come looks

460
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:37,510
go see why he didn't want to come looks
 

461
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:42,630
go see why he didn't want to come looks
like there's a hole in my floor yeah so

462
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640
like there's a hole in my floor yeah so
 

463
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:51,000
like there's a hole in my floor yeah so
you got stuck in a hole Hey oops gotta

464
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,010
you got stuck in a hole Hey oops gotta
 

465
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,100
you got stuck in a hole Hey oops gotta
fill those all up otherwise you'll have

466
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,110
fill those all up otherwise you'll have
 

467
00:20:53,110 --> 00:21:01,080
fill those all up otherwise you'll have
that problem some more holes here and is

468
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,090
that problem some more holes here and is
 

469
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,070
that problem some more holes here and is
our other guy over here still yes how's

470
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,080
our other guy over here still yes how's
 

471
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:13,770
our other guy over here still yes how's
it going down there I'll probably just

472
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:13,780
it going down there I'll probably just
 

473
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,470
it going down there I'll probably just
leave them there it's nice to have a pet

474
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
