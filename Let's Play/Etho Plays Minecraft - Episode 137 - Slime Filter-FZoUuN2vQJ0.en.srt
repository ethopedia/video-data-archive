which is excellent I might try do a
little bit with this today yeah okay let

94

me think about what I want to do now
 

97
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,520
me think about what I want to do now
probably from top of my head I think

98
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:00,530
probably from top of my head I think
 

99
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,440
probably from top of my head I think
I'll make this go up then I might make

100
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:05,450
I'll make this go up then I might make
 

101
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,360
I'll make this go up then I might make
it do like a switch plate so it a little

102
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,370
it do like a switch plate so it a little
 

103
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,670
it do like a switch plate so it a little
left then back to get some height for

104
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:12,680
left then back to get some height for
 

105
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,840
left then back to get some height for
the slimes and then I'll drop them into

106
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:16,850
the slimes and then I'll drop them into
 

107
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,840
the slimes and then I'll drop them into
three different holding chambers maybe

108
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:18,850
three different holding chambers maybe
 

109
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,430
three different holding chambers maybe
one for the big ones one for the mediums

110
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
one for the big ones one for the mediums
 

111
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,910
one for the big ones one for the mediums
and one for the small ones kinda what

112
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:24,920
and one for the small ones kinda what
 

113
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,160
and one for the small ones kinda what
I'm thinking it should be really easy to

114
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,170
I'm thinking it should be really easy to
 

115
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:33,790
I'm thinking it should be really easy to
separate them - so give me a sec to get

116
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:33,800
separate them - so give me a sec to get
 

117
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,710
separate them - so give me a sec to get
prepared here and we will do something

118
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:37,720
prepared here and we will do something
 

119
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,300
prepared here and we will do something
okay let's get started here now I am

120
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,310
okay let's get started here now I am
 

121
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,310
okay let's get started here now I am
going to be changing this around quite a

122
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,320
going to be changing this around quite a
 

123
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,880
going to be changing this around quite a
bit I originally I wanted to keep that

124
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:48,890
bit I originally I wanted to keep that
 

125
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,180
bit I originally I wanted to keep that
like this just so they would match and

126
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,190
like this just so they would match and
 

127
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,800
like this just so they would match and
this is just going to be for small

128
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:53,810
this is just going to be for small
 

129
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,840
this is just going to be for small
slimes but now I kind of want to try

130
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:55,850
slimes but now I kind of want to try
 

131
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,150
slimes but now I kind of want to try
separate them just for just for the

132
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,160
separate them just for just for the
 

133
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,410
separate them just for just for the
kicks of it for fun and I don't really

134
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:02,420
kicks of it for fun and I don't really
 

135
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,880
kicks of it for fun and I don't really
need to copy this one here this needs to

136
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:06,890
need to copy this one here this needs to
 

137
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,350
need to copy this one here this needs to
be like this for the cave spiders

138
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:08,360
be like this for the cave spiders
 

139
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,420
be like this for the cave spiders
because of their annoying climbing

140
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:10,430
because of their annoying climbing
 

141
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,630
because of their annoying climbing
ability and ability to sneak out of

142
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:13,640
ability and ability to sneak out of
 

143
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,110
ability and ability to sneak out of
small areas this works very well for

144
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
small areas this works very well for
 

145
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,960
small areas this works very well for
them but we don't really need it for for

146
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:19,970
them but we don't really need it for for
 

147
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,920
them but we don't really need it for for
the slimes here so let's tear this out

148
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:22,930
the slimes here so let's tear this out
 

149
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,670
the slimes here so let's tear this out
start fresh and I got an idea I want to

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,110
good I tell you efficiency five it's too
 

161
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,589
good I tell you efficiency five it's too
good you just end up breaking everything

162
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:44,599
good you just end up breaking everything
 

163
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:50,140
good you just end up breaking everything
with it I actually almost prefer

164
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,150
with it I actually almost prefer
 

165
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,310
with it I actually almost prefer
efficiency for just because of that okay

166
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
efficiency for just because of that okay
 

167
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,060
efficiency for just because of that okay
get rid of this glowstone well see it

168
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,070
get rid of this glowstone well see it
 

169
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,100
get rid of this glowstone well see it
went through two blocks there did not

170
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,110
went through two blocks there did not
 

171
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,279
went through two blocks there did not
want that well I did but that's not what

172
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:03,289
want that well I did but that's not what
 

173
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:07,740
want that well I did but that's not what
it is trying to do okay so we will have

174
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:07,750
it is trying to do okay so we will have
 

175
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,810
it is trying to do okay so we will have
the small slimes here maybe we'll put

176
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:10,820
the small slimes here maybe we'll put
 

177
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,659
the small slimes here maybe we'll put
down glowstone just to mark it right

178
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:13,669
down glowstone just to mark it right
 

179
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,279
down glowstone just to mark it right
there and I guess we'll do these walls I

180
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:17,289
there and I guess we'll do these walls I
 

181
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:21,180
there and I guess we'll do these walls I
guess we're going to do a quick two

182
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:21,190
guess we're going to do a quick two
 

183
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,589
guess we're going to do a quick two
something like this that will be the

184
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:23,599
something like this that will be the
 

185
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:29,820
something like this that will be the
holding area

186
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:29,830

 

187
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,080

I'm going to be making this up as we go

188
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,090
I'm going to be making this up as we go
 

189
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:37,570
I'm going to be making this up as we go
along here something like that glass in

190
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:37,580
along here something like that glass in
 

191
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,550
along here something like that glass in
front so they'll fall down into this one

192
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:39,560
front so they'll fall down into this one
 

193
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,019
front so they'll fall down into this one
by one thing I'll probably set up

194
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:43,029
by one thing I'll probably set up
 

195
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:45,879
by one thing I'll probably set up
something to get the drops out too but

196
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:45,889
something to get the drops out too but
 

197
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:50,200
something to get the drops out too but
what I want to try do will have the

198
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,210
what I want to try do will have the
 

199
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,170
what I want to try do will have the
medium slimes over here let's give her

200
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:53,180
medium slimes over here let's give her
 

201
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:01,320
medium slimes over here let's give her
this water okay and we'll have it

202
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,330
this water okay and we'll have it
 

203
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,999
this water okay and we'll have it
similar I should probably get some more

204
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:04,009
similar I should probably get some more
 

205
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:08,879
similar I should probably get some more
glowstone will have a 2x2 area here Oh

206
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:08,889
glowstone will have a 2x2 area here Oh
 

207
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:12,219
glowstone will have a 2x2 area here Oh
sounds like we just got a new one a big

208
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:12,229
sounds like we just got a new one a big
 

209
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:13,390
sounds like we just got a new one a big
one let's check it out

210
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:13,400
one let's check it out
 

211
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:21,490
one let's check it out
oh it's at least yeah two big ones in

212
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:21,500
oh it's at least yeah two big ones in
 

213
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,550
oh it's at least yeah two big ones in
here without dying wanna want to see one

214
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:27,560
here without dying wanna want to see one
 

215
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,290
here without dying wanna want to see one
of these guys through the obstacle

216
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:29,300
of these guys through the obstacle
 

217
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,740
of these guys through the obstacle
course get up here

218
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:32,750
course get up here
 

219
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:39,820
course get up here
I just we have to kill one of them -

220
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:39,830
I just we have to kill one of them -
 

221
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,079
I just we have to kill one of them -
tomatoes to make this okay I'll check

222
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,089
tomatoes to make this okay I'll check
 

223
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:49,360
tomatoes to make this okay I'll check
the water get up here

224
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,370
the water get up here
 

225
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,019
the water get up here
get up here and we will make them run

226
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:53,029
get up here and we will make them run
 

227
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:58,540
get up here and we will make them run
over here just want to make sure he gets

228
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:58,550
over here just want to make sure he gets
 

229
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:04,550
over here just want to make sure he gets
around a corner

230
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560

 

231
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,800

everybody's having a good time

232
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:12,810

 

233
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:22,140

beautiful yeah that works good okay

234
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,150
beautiful yeah that works good okay
 

235
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,980
beautiful yeah that works good okay
let's sit back there yeah so this is

236
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:25,990
let's sit back there yeah so this is
 

237
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,500
let's sit back there yeah so this is
what I was wanting to try here don't

238
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:28,510
what I was wanting to try here don't
 

239
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,730
what I was wanting to try here don't
don't look at this is the final thing

240
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:31,740
don't look at this is the final thing
 

241
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,410
don't look at this is the final thing
I'm doing here this is just a test that

242
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:34,420
I'm doing here this is just a test that
 

243
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,070
I'm doing here this is just a test that
I'm setting up what I want to try to do

244
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
I'm setting up what I want to try to do
 

245
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,470
I'm setting up what I want to try to do
is have a chamber here for the small

246
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:40,480
is have a chamber here for the small
 

247
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,640
is have a chamber here for the small
slimes and then a 2x2 one for the medium

248
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:44,650
slimes and then a 2x2 one for the medium
 

249
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:49,280
slimes and then a 2x2 one for the medium
ones and then 3x3 for the large ones so

250
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,290
ones and then 3x3 for the large ones so
 

251
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,030
ones and then 3x3 for the large ones so
there's a two block gap between them and

252
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,040
there's a two block gap between them and
 

253
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,280
there's a two block gap between them and
the idea I kind of want to try out is

254
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,290
the idea I kind of want to try out is
 

255
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,830
the idea I kind of want to try out is
first off automatically separate them

256
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:58,840
first off automatically separate them
 

257
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,960
first off automatically separate them
into each of their appropriate sizes but

258
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:03,970
into each of their appropriate sizes but
 

259
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,640
into each of their appropriate sizes but
then I want to see how this works out if

260
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:05,650
then I want to see how this works out if
 

261
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,730
then I want to see how this works out if
I have them self separating thing as

262
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:08,740
I have them self separating thing as
 

263
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,310
I have them self separating thing as
well so for example if I have a medium

264
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:11,320
well so for example if I have a medium
 

265
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,300
well so for example if I have a medium
slime in here

266
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,310
slime in here
 

267
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,530
slime in here
and I manually kill it it's going to

268
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:15,540
and I manually kill it it's going to
 

269
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,240
and I manually kill it it's going to
drop some XP which I would like to

270
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,250
drop some XP which I would like to
 

271
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,860
drop some XP which I would like to
collect and then it's going to split

272
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:19,870
collect and then it's going to split
 

273
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,790
collect and then it's going to split
into small ones and I want to see if I

274
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:23,800
into small ones and I want to see if I
 

275
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,500
into small ones and I want to see if I
can get a manual or a separator here

276
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:28,510
can get a manual or a separator here
 

277
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:34,080
can get a manual or a separator here
that they will use themselves so in this

278
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,090
that they will use themselves so in this
 

279
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,839
that they will use themselves so in this
holding area for the medium slimes

280
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:38,849

 

281
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,100

there's going to be a little staircase

282
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,110
there's going to be a little staircase
 

283
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,270
there's going to be a little staircase
here and it goes up goes over here and

284
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:45,280
here and it goes up goes over here and
 

285
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,730
here and it goes up goes over here and
then falls down into the small slime one

286
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:47,740
then falls down into the small slime one
 

287
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,610
then falls down into the small slime one
so when I when I separate them they're

288
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:50,620
so when I when I separate them they're
 

289
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,500
so when I when I separate them they're
pathfinding should make them go up here

290
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:52,510
pathfinding should make them go up here
 

291
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,120
pathfinding should make them go up here
and then they'll fall down and then they

292
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,130
and then they'll fall down and then they
 

293
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,110
and then they'll fall down and then they
can't get back into that chamber and I'm

294
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,120
can't get back into that chamber and I'm
 

295
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,850
can't get back into that chamber and I'm
gonna do the same thing over here or at

296
00:08:59,850 --> 00:08:59,860
gonna do the same thing over here or at
 

297
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:08,629
gonna do the same thing over here or at
least try to so if I do something like

298
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:08,639

 

299
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,530

this medium slides can get up here and

300
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:13,540
this medium slides can get up here and
 

301
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,730
this medium slides can get up here and
then they'll get up onto this glass here

302
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:17,740
then they'll get up onto this glass here
 

303
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,769
then they'll get up onto this glass here
as well and then they will fall in and

304
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:22,779
as well and then they will fall in and
 

305
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:27,660
as well and then they will fall in and
they won't be able to get back up this

306
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:27,670
they won't be able to get back up this
 

307
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,970
they won't be able to get back up this
is what I'm trying to do just to see how

308
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:29,980
is what I'm trying to do just to see how
 

309
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,189
is what I'm trying to do just to see how
it goes I'm I'm curious

310
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:34,199

 

311
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,250

so yeah this will be another brick over

312
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:38,260
so yeah this will be another brick over
 

313
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:56,360
so yeah this will be another brick over
here okay and here just experimenting I

314
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:56,370
here okay and here just experimenting I
 

315
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,579
here okay and here just experimenting I
will probably want to use glass somewhat

316
00:09:59,579 --> 00:09:59,589
will probably want to use glass somewhat
 

317
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,769
will probably want to use glass somewhat
with this so the final thing so I can

318
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:01,779
with this so the final thing so I can
 

319
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,150
with this so the final thing so I can
see it from an angle because the way I

320
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,160
see it from an angle because the way I
 

321
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,740
see it from an angle because the way I
had it before you pretty much have to

322
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:04,750
had it before you pretty much have to
 

323
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,650
had it before you pretty much have to
look straight on to see the slides in it

324
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:07,660
look straight on to see the slides in it
 

325
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,269
look straight on to see the slides in it
like if this isn't glass here because if

326
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:12,279
like if this isn't glass here because if
 

327
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,400
like if this isn't glass here because if
if you look at it like this you won't be

328
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,410
if you look at it like this you won't be
 

329
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,110
if you look at it like this you won't be
able to see anything really

330
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,120
able to see anything really
 

331
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,629
able to see anything really
unless it's glass or something else

332
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:18,639
unless it's glass or something else
 

333
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:28,259
unless it's glass or something else
transparent okay yeah okay I'll finish

334
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:28,269
transparent okay yeah okay I'll finish
 

335
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,139
transparent okay yeah okay I'll finish
setting this up and then we'll hopefully

336
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:31,149
setting this up and then we'll hopefully
 

337
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,590
setting this up and then we'll hopefully
do some water canal systems get them up

338
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:34,600
do some water canal systems get them up
 

339
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,009
do some water canal systems get them up
here and separate them and I'll see you

340
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:38,019
here and separate them and I'll see you
 

341
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:42,180
here and separate them and I'll see you
in a little bit again so this is what

342
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,190
in a little bit again so this is what
 

343
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,340
in a little bit again so this is what
I'm planning at the moment for the water

344
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:44,350
I'm planning at the moment for the water
 

345
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,439
I'm planning at the moment for the water
canals you can make it go up here it's a

346
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:49,449
canals you can make it go up here it's a
 

347
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,490
canals you can make it go up here it's a
half slab and then these are stairs

348
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:52,500
half slab and then these are stairs
 

349
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,949
half slab and then these are stairs
there and there and it's going to go

350
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:55,959
there and there and it's going to go
 

351
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,050
there and there and it's going to go
this way and then it's going to do a

352
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:58,060
this way and then it's going to do a
 

353
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,030
this way and then it's going to do a
u-turn and start going this way I got to

354
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
u-turn and start going this way I got to
 

355
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,910
u-turn and start going this way I got to
get this up oh yeah and the water is

356
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:05,920
get this up oh yeah and the water is
 

357
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,850
get this up oh yeah and the water is
going to go in the corner here so it

358
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:08,860
going to go in the corner here so it
 

359
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,220
going to go in the corner here so it
should push the slides up these stairs I

360
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,230
should push the slides up these stairs I
 

361
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,949
should push the slides up these stairs I
got to get this up to I think why fifty

362
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:16,959
got to get this up to I think why fifty
 

363
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,820
got to get this up to I think why fifty
three or so that's the whole point of

364
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:19,830
three or so that's the whole point of
 

365
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,450
three or so that's the whole point of
doing the switch switch back or whatever

366
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:23,460
doing the switch switch back or whatever
 

367
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,180
doing the switch switch back or whatever
it's called

368
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,190
it's called
 

369
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,540
it's called
so was it at about 39 40 there I'm going

370
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:29,550
so was it at about 39 40 there I'm going
 

371
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:36,970
so was it at about 39 40 there I'm going
to get it all the way up to here

372
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:36,980

 

373
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,560

46 over here I think it's going to go

374
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:42,570
46 over here I think it's going to go
 

375
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,150
46 over here I think it's going to go
three blocks above here so all the way

376
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
three blocks above here so all the way
 

377
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,410
three blocks above here so all the way
up to 52 is how high we have to get 51

378
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:48,420
up to 52 is how high we have to get 51
 

379
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,480
up to 52 is how high we have to get 51
or 52 to make this work the way I'm

380
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:53,490
or 52 to make this work the way I'm
 

381
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,160
or 52 to make this work the way I'm
thinking and let's see what is our X or

382
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,170
thinking and let's see what is our X or
 

383
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:05,090
thinking and let's see what is our X or
Z that is 178 it's hard to do this

384
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,100
Z that is 178 it's hard to do this
 

385
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,190
Z that is 178 it's hard to do this
because I can't see how far this thing

386
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,200
because I can't see how far this thing
 

387
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,340
because I can't see how far this thing
here is away from the waters canals

388
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:13,350
here is away from the waters canals
 

389
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,850
here is away from the waters canals
below all the lands in the way when I

390
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:19,860
below all the lands in the way when I
 

391
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,320
below all the lands in the way when I
say 178 this is 190 so I have 12 blocks

392
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,330
say 178 this is 190 so I have 12 blocks
 

393
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:30,400
say 178 this is 190 so I have 12 blocks
or so to work with isn't a whole lot

394
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,410

 

395
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,120

okay so at maximum we can make them go

396
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,130
okay so at maximum we can make them go
 

397
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,880
okay so at maximum we can make them go
up one block every two blocks out we go

398
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:37,890
up one block every two blocks out we go
 

399
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,950
up one block every two blocks out we go
if we do the stairs oh no my efficiency

400
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:42,960
if we do the stairs oh no my efficiency
 

401
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,410
if we do the stairs oh no my efficiency
five pick now I don't think I have any

402
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:48,420
five pick now I don't think I have any
 

403
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,040
five pick now I don't think I have any
good ones left

404
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,050

 

405
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:59,900

Jenna finish Iblees farm man okay yeah

406
00:12:59,900 --> 00:12:59,910
Jenna finish Iblees farm man okay yeah
 

407
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,290
Jenna finish Iblees farm man okay yeah
like this so goes block then stair

408
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:03,300
like this so goes block then stair
 

409
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,540
like this so goes block then stair
blocks and stair that's a the quickest

410
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:05,550
blocks and stair that's a the quickest
 

411
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,430
blocks and stair that's a the quickest
way of getting them up ah that's not

412
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:10,440
way of getting them up ah that's not
 

413
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,560
way of getting them up ah that's not
counting ladders so the thing about the

414
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:12,570
counting ladders so the thing about the
 

415
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,660
counting ladders so the thing about the
ladders it only really works with the

416
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:14,670
ladders it only really works with the
 

417
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,880
ladders it only really works with the
small slime some of you might have seen

418
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:16,890
small slime some of you might have seen
 

419
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,170
small slime some of you might have seen
that I'm trying to not use them because

420
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:21,180
that I'm trying to not use them because
 

421
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,020
that I'm trying to not use them because
I want to move the big ones there and I

422
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,030
I want to move the big ones there and I
 

423
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,600
I want to move the big ones there and I
have played around with trying to make

424
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:25,610
have played around with trying to make
 

425
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,190
have played around with trying to make
big slimes and medium slimes go up

426
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:28,200
big slimes and medium slimes go up
 

427
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,560
big slimes and medium slimes go up
ladders in the past

428
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:29,570
ladders in the past
 

429
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,999
ladders in the past
don't turn out too good so with upcoming

430
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:34,009
don't turn out too good so with upcoming
 

431
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:38,949
don't turn out too good so with upcoming
patch and ladder is not having closure

432
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
patch and ladder is not having closure
 

433
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,960
patch and ladder is not having closure
to ask the small slimes might not be

434
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:40,970
to ask the small slimes might not be
 

435
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,879
to ask the small slimes might not be
able to climb up them anymore either so

436
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:42,889
able to climb up them anymore either so
 

437
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:47,379
able to climb up them anymore either so
I'm trying to prevent using them what I

438
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:47,389
I'm trying to prevent using them what I
 

439
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:52,180
I'm trying to prevent using them what I
need to pick okay

440
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:52,190
need to pick okay
 

441
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,309
need to pick okay
I'll give you an update a little bit

442
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:54,319
I'll give you an update a little bit
 

443
00:13:54,319 --> 00:14:00,850
I'll give you an update a little bit
here yep things are going good here I'll

444
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:00,860
here yep things are going good here I'll
 

445
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,579
here yep things are going good here I'll
show you these the idea behind these

446
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:03,589
show you these the idea behind these
 

447
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:06,519
show you these the idea behind these
pathfinding separators again so the big

448
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:06,529
pathfinding separators again so the big
 

449
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:08,879
pathfinding separators again so the big
slimes go here they are two point four

450
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:08,889
slimes go here they are two point four
 

451
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,569
slimes go here they are two point four
blocks in all three directions in size

452
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:12,579
blocks in all three directions in size
 

453
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:17,410
blocks in all three directions in size
so the big slimes can't get to this

454
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:17,420
so the big slimes can't get to this
 

455
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,199
so the big slimes can't get to this
smaller chamber here because it's only

456
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:20,209
smaller chamber here because it's only
 

457
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,110
smaller chamber here because it's only
two blocks in there 2.4 in size so they

458
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
two blocks in there 2.4 in size so they
 

459
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,949
two blocks in there 2.4 in size so they
can't fit through here the smaller or

460
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
can't fit through here the smaller or
 

461
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,470
can't fit through here the smaller or
the medium slimes will and then they'll

462
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:29,480
the medium slimes will and then they'll
 

463
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,660
the medium slimes will and then they'll
fall down but it's a 2 block drop so

464
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:31,670
fall down but it's a 2 block drop so
 

465
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,110
fall down but it's a 2 block drop so
they can't get back this way the medium

466
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
they can't get back this way the medium
 

467
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,500
they can't get back this way the medium
slimes or small sliders can't make it

468
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:38,510
slimes or small sliders can't make it
 

469
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,189
slimes or small sliders can't make it
back this way either when I split them

470
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:42,199
back this way either when I split them
 

471
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:44,259
back this way either when I split them
here then we'll have nothing but small

472
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:44,269
here then we'll have nothing but small
 

473
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:48,309
here then we'll have nothing but small
signs left and they make it they can hop

474
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:48,319
signs left and they make it they can hop
 

475
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,519
signs left and they make it they can hop
up here hopefully we'll see how it goes

476
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:50,529
up here hopefully we'll see how it goes
 

477
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:52,689
up here hopefully we'll see how it goes
again I don't know how useful that's

478
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:52,699
again I don't know how useful that's
 

479
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:54,939
again I don't know how useful that's
going to be or anything just doing it to

480
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:54,949
going to be or anything just doing it to
 

481
00:14:54,949 --> 00:15:00,879
going to be or anything just doing it to
try it I got the nel path thing I think

482
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:00,889
try it I got the nel path thing I think
 

483
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:04,780
try it I got the nel path thing I think
figure it out pretty good here so this

484
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:04,790
figure it out pretty good here so this
 

485
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,509
figure it out pretty good here so this
is it this is the path I can take it and

486
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
is it this is the path I can take it and
 

487
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,590
is it this is the path I can take it and
go like this and we got a big slime here

488
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
go like this and we got a big slime here
 

489
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,660
go like this and we got a big slime here
you will actually be very useful to help

490
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:16,670
you will actually be very useful to help
 

491
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,030
you will actually be very useful to help
us see if there's any spots where you

492
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
us see if there's any spots where you
 

493
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,069
us see if there's any spots where you
stuck so the first one now you can get

494
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079
stuck so the first one now you can get
 

495
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:36,009
stuck so the first one now you can get
higher let it stuck here higher oh baby

496
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:36,019
higher let it stuck here higher oh baby
 

497
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,660
higher let it stuck here higher oh baby
this is getting pretty fancy here

498
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:38,670
this is getting pretty fancy here
 

499
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,910
this is getting pretty fancy here
I got rid of all the crummy walls and

500
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:40,920
I got rid of all the crummy walls and
 

501
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,000
I got rid of all the crummy walls and
replace them with stone brick this is

502
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,010
replace them with stone brick this is
 

503
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,250
replace them with stone brick this is
perfectly shaped so the large slimes

504
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:46,260
perfectly shaped so the large slimes
 

505
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,660
perfectly shaped so the large slimes
and get up here over here we have a

506
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:50,670
and get up here over here we have a
 

507
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,960
and get up here over here we have a
little viewing window area I'll probably

508
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:53,970
little viewing window area I'll probably
 

509
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,440
little viewing window area I'll probably
make this whole wall here glass so you

510
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:57,450
make this whole wall here glass so you
 

511
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:04,960
make this whole wall here glass so you
can see it from outside possibly and

512
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:04,970
can see it from outside possibly and
 

513
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,070
can see it from outside possibly and
goes up and this is where we'll start

514
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:10,080
goes up and this is where we'll start
 

515
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,300
goes up and this is where we'll start
separating them right around here

516
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,310
separating them right around here
 

517
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,280
separating them right around here
I'm going to put alternating glowstone

518
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,290
I'm going to put alternating glowstone
 

519
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:22,940
I'm going to put alternating glowstone
for looks and light on the way up here

520
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:22,950
for looks and light on the way up here
 

521
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,930
for looks and light on the way up here
so yeah I'm liking this a lot it's

522
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:26,940
so yeah I'm liking this a lot it's
 

523
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,380
so yeah I'm liking this a lot it's
perfectly shaped so the large slime can

524
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:30,390
perfectly shaped so the large slime can
 

525
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:37,130
perfectly shaped so the large slime can
get up with just enough space and yeah

526
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,140
get up with just enough space and yeah
 

527
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,290
get up with just enough space and yeah
this will all be water canals pushing

528
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:39,300
this will all be water canals pushing
 

529
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,630
this will all be water canals pushing
them up here too so I'll have to have

530
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:41,640
them up here too so I'll have to have
 

531
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,330
them up here too so I'll have to have
the signs lots and lots of signs in here

532
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:44,340
the signs lots and lots of signs in here
 

533
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,580
the signs lots and lots of signs in here
or I could use fence gates but I'll

534
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:46,590
or I could use fence gates but I'll
 

535
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,820
or I could use fence gates but I'll
probably do signs and I'll see you guys

536
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:49,830
probably do signs and I'll see you guys
 

537
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,040
probably do signs and I'll see you guys
in a little bit when I work on this some

538
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,050
in a little bit when I work on this some
 

539
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,270
in a little bit when I work on this some
more again yeah so the slime project

540
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:56,280
more again yeah so the slime project
 

541
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,010
more again yeah so the slime project
kind of added a little bit of a bonus to

542
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:58,020
kind of added a little bit of a bonus to
 

543
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,630
kind of added a little bit of a bonus to
this part of the cave we have a little

544
00:16:59,630 --> 00:16:59,640
this part of the cave we have a little
 

545
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,270
this part of the cave we have a little
viewing area here now so you will be

546
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:02,280
viewing area here now so you will be
 

547
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,780
viewing area here now so you will be
able to see the slimes coming up and

548
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:04,790
able to see the slimes coming up and
 

549
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:10,610
able to see the slimes coming up and
going to the top there ah let me know

550
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:10,620
going to the top there ah let me know
 

551
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,100
going to the top there ah let me know
what you guys think of this I'll have to

552
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,110
what you guys think of this I'll have to
 

553
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,330
what you guys think of this I'll have to
have some better place to stand here to

554
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:17,340
have some better place to stand here to
 

555
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,470
have some better place to stand here to
see it because when you're down lower

556
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
see it because when you're down lower
 

557
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,860
see it because when you're down lower
you don't see a whole lot to be honest

558
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:23,870
you don't see a whole lot to be honest
 

559
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,420
you don't see a whole lot to be honest
but I don't I kind of like it let me

560
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:26,430
but I don't I kind of like it let me
 

561
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,860
but I don't I kind of like it let me
know what you guys think there's any way

562
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:27,870
know what you guys think there's any way
 

563
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,140
know what you guys think there's any way
to improve it or if I should just

564
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,150
to improve it or if I should just
 

565
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,050
to improve it or if I should just
completely block it off had to trim away

566
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,060
completely block it off had to trim away
 

567
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,460
completely block it off had to trim away
a little bit of the stone this is pretty

568
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:37,470
a little bit of the stone this is pretty
 

569
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,590
a little bit of the stone this is pretty
much set up for the water now I start

570
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
much set up for the water now I start
 

571
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
much set up for the water now I start
adding some already

572
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:42,610

 

573
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,750

and I haven't seen any slimes come up

574
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:45,760
and I haven't seen any slimes come up
 

575
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,320
and I haven't seen any slimes come up
yet

576
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,330
yet
 

577
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,940
yet
but probably pretty soon I'll get one

578
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:49,950
but probably pretty soon I'll get one
 

579
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,509
but probably pretty soon I'll get one
for the corners I just put one two three

580
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:54,519
for the corners I just put one two three
 

581
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:57,870
for the corners I just put one two three
by three things so and there's three

582
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:57,880
by three things so and there's three
 

583
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,330
by three things so and there's three
stairs over here put the water in the

584
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:00,340
stairs over here put the water in the
 

585
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,970
stairs over here put the water in the
corner and they're forced to flow into

586
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:02,980
corner and they're forced to flow into
 

587
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,149
corner and they're forced to flow into
the stairs and I'll do the same probe

588
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:06,159
the stairs and I'll do the same probe
 

589
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:11,149
the stairs and I'll do the same probe
for this corner Oh No

590
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:11,159
for this corner Oh No
 

591
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:14,310
for this corner Oh No
dang it dang it dang it dang it dang it

592
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
dang it dang it dang it dang it dang it
 

593
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:24,080
dang it dang it dang it dang it dang it
dang it oh that hurts

594
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,090

 

595
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,450

but yeah despite what just happened it's

596
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:27,460
but yeah despite what just happened it's
 

597
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,090
but yeah despite what just happened it's
going pretty good

598
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,100
going pretty good
 

599
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,350
going pretty good
so I'm just starting to work on the

600
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,360
so I'm just starting to work on the
 

601
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,879
so I'm just starting to work on the
slime separator here the automatic one

602
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:34,889
slime separator here the automatic one
 

603
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:38,549
slime separator here the automatic one
the idea is pretty simple only small

604
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:38,559
the idea is pretty simple only small
 

605
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,320
the idea is pretty simple only small
slimes will be able to fit down here

606
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,330
slimes will be able to fit down here
 

607
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,610
slimes will be able to fit down here
because they're 0.6 blocks in size all

608
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:44,620
because they're 0.6 blocks in size all
 

609
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,629
because they're 0.6 blocks in size all
three directions while medium ones are

610
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:47,639
three directions while medium ones are
 

611
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:50,399
three directions while medium ones are
1.2 blocks in size and all three

612
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:50,409
1.2 blocks in size and all three
 

613
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:52,019
1.2 blocks in size and all three
directions so they just can't fit down

614
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:52,029
directions so they just can't fit down
 

615
00:18:52,029 --> 00:19:00,840
directions so they just can't fit down
here too fat too fats so what I'll do is

616
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:00,850
here too fat too fats so what I'll do is
 

617
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:06,990
here too fat too fats so what I'll do is
I'll have signs here that the water will

618
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll have signs here that the water will
 

619
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,899
I'll have signs here that the water will
be able to flow on top but since slimes

620
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:09,909
be able to flow on top but since slimes
 

621
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:12,960
be able to flow on top but since slimes
don't swim in water they should just

622
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:12,970
don't swim in water they should just
 

623
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:18,870
don't swim in water they should just
sink down here I would imagine into

624
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
sink down here I would imagine into
 

625
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,080
sink down here I would imagine into
another water currents now we're going

626
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,090
another water currents now we're going
 

627
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:28,060
another water currents now we're going
to set up

628
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,070

 

629
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,790

so another water current will be below

630
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:30,800
so another water current will be below
 

631
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,420
so another water current will be below
I'll push them this way and we want it

632
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:35,430
I'll push them this way and we want it
 

633
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,670
I'll push them this way and we want it
to push them down into their little

634
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:37,680
to push them down into their little
 

635
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,070
to push them down into their little
holding chamber we have setup which

636
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
holding chamber we have setup which
 

637
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,300
holding chamber we have setup which
should be right here we got to go to

638
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:44,310
should be right here we got to go to
 

639
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:56,660
should be right here we got to go to
there one two three four five six seven

640
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:56,670
there one two three four five six seven
 

641
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,860
there one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten eleven Oh might not work

642
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:00,870
eight nine ten eleven Oh might not work
 

643
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:06,410
eight nine ten eleven Oh might not work
like I hoped we can extend this using

644
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:06,420
like I hoped we can extend this using
 

645
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,160
like I hoped we can extend this using
the stair inside stair and sign trick

646
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,170
the stair inside stair and sign trick
 

647
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,980
the stair inside stair and sign trick
anyway so yes that's what we'll have to

648
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:12,990
anyway so yes that's what we'll have to
 

649
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:19,160
anyway so yes that's what we'll have to
do just about done here we got all the

650
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,170
do just about done here we got all the
 

651
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,380
do just about done here we got all the
sign filters set up so this is for the

652
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:21,390
sign filters set up so this is for the
 

653
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,080
sign filters set up so this is for the
small ones then this one here is going

654
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,090
small ones then this one here is going
 

655
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,600
small ones then this one here is going
to be for the medium ones and we don't

656
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:26,610
to be for the medium ones and we don't
 

657
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,370
to be for the medium ones and we don't
have to worry about slope the small ones

658
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:28,380
have to worry about slope the small ones
 

659
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,710
have to worry about slope the small ones
getting in here because they already get

660
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,720
getting in here because they already get
 

661
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
getting in here because they already get
sifted out at this point so that's why

662
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:32,730
sifted out at this point so that's why
 

663
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,630
sifted out at this point so that's why
we do the small ones first do so that

664
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:35,640
we do the small ones first do so that
 

665
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,740
we do the small ones first do so that
there's none at the medium ones

666
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:36,750
there's none at the medium ones
 

667
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,180
there's none at the medium ones
otherwise they would fall down there too

668
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,190
otherwise they would fall down there too
 

669
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,170
otherwise they would fall down there too
and then over here we don't need to put

670
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:42,180
and then over here we don't need to put
 

671
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,230
and then over here we don't need to put
signs above for water because there's

672
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:45,240
signs above for water because there's
 

673
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,600
signs above for water because there's
nothing further this is the last one so

674
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:47,610
nothing further this is the last one so
 

675
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,890
nothing further this is the last one so
this is where the big ones will fall

676
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:48,900
this is where the big ones will fall
 

677
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,890
this is where the big ones will fall
down and then we just got to get them to

678
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:51,900
down and then we just got to get them to
 

679
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,210
down and then we just got to get them to
their drop points down here ideally I

680
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:56,220
their drop points down here ideally I
 

681
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,090
their drop points down here ideally I
should have had this water canal thing a

682
00:20:59,090 --> 00:20:59,100
should have had this water canal thing a
 

683
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,870
should have had this water canal thing a
little bit further this way I guess but

684
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:01,880
little bit further this way I guess but
 

685
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,730
little bit further this way I guess but
whatever we'll make it work and I did

686
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:07,740
whatever we'll make it work and I did
 

687
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,200
whatever we'll make it work and I did
have a couple slides come through here

688
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,210
have a couple slides come through here
 

689
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:14,570
have a couple slides come through here
and it seems to work okay so far okay

690
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:14,580
and it seems to work okay so far okay
 

691
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,890
and it seems to work okay so far okay
we're just going to put the rest of the

692
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:15,900
we're just going to put the rest of the
 

693
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,670
we're just going to put the rest of the
water in here

694
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:17,680
water in here
 

695
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,350
water in here
I think this part is all done and we

696
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:22,360
I think this part is all done and we
 

697
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,260
I think this part is all done and we
just need to work on the separate water

698
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:25,270
just need to work on the separate water
 

699
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:31,590
just need to work on the separate water
canals put one here careful not to fall

700
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:31,600
canals put one here careful not to fall
 

701
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,970
canals put one here careful not to fall
down whoa

702
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:37,980
down whoa
 

703
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,660
down whoa
that scared me must be close to the

704
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:42,670
that scared me must be close to the
 

705
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:49,710
that scared me must be close to the
surface yep okay so the medium ones will

706
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:49,720
surface yep okay so the medium ones will
 

707
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:56,299
surface yep okay so the medium ones will
fall down there big ones will go there

708
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:56,309
fall down there big ones will go there
 

709
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:59,460
fall down there big ones will go there
they will fall down into a stream here

710
00:21:59,460 --> 00:21:59,470
they will fall down into a stream here
 

711
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:09,160
they will fall down into a stream here
and then we need one more yet over here

712
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,170

 

713
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:14,110

awesome day hopefully I still have a

714
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,120
awesome day hopefully I still have a
 

715
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,340
awesome day hopefully I still have a
sign on me nope darn yeah make one

716
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:20,350

 

717
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,350

alright we got a sign so for the small

718
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
alright we got a sign so for the small
 

719
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,190
alright we got a sign so for the small
slimes over here is their water canal

720
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:26,200
slimes over here is their water canal
 

721
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,470
slimes over here is their water canal
and I'm going to make it so there's a

722
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:29,480
and I'm going to make it so there's a
 

723
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:37,120
and I'm going to make it so there's a
sign right here and it's replaces with

724
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,130
sign right here and it's replaces with
 

725
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:46,480
sign right here and it's replaces with
stone brick and water right above there

726
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:46,490
stone brick and water right above there
 

727
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,330
stone brick and water right above there
should do the trick

728
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:48,340
should do the trick
 

729
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:58,050
should do the trick
awesome yeah and I'll fill the city oh I

730
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:58,060
awesome yeah and I'll fill the city oh I
 

731
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:04,990
awesome yeah and I'll fill the city oh I
guess we should place that and that's

732
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,000
guess we should place that and that's
 

733
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,990
guess we should place that and that's
good that one's done this medium ones

734
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,000
good that one's done this medium ones
 

735
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,260
good that one's done this medium ones
pretty much done just have the large one

736
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:19,270

 

737
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,930

alright

738
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:21,940
alright
 

739
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,310
alright
replace all these walls with stone brick

740
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
replace all these walls with stone brick
 

741
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,680
replace all these walls with stone brick
and the floor okay with the big ones I'm

742
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:29,690
and the floor okay with the big ones I'm
 

743
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,030
and the floor okay with the big ones I'm
going to cheat a little bit here I have

744
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,040
going to cheat a little bit here I have
 

745
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,760
going to cheat a little bit here I have
pressure plates because this is at nine

746
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:33,770
pressure plates because this is at nine
 

747
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,340
pressure plates because this is at nine
blocks long this thing and water only

748
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:36,350
blocks long this thing and water only
 

749
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:42,190
blocks long this thing and water only
travels eight blocks so that way I don't

750
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,200
travels eight blocks so that way I don't
 

751
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,640
travels eight blocks so that way I don't
have to have two streams here do it like

752
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:45,650
have to have two streams here do it like
 

753
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,070
have to have two streams here do it like
that

754
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,080
that
 

755
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,029
that
and if you take them right to the end

756
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:50,039
and if you take them right to the end
 

757
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,430
and if you take them right to the end
close this off I think that's everything

758
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
close this off I think that's everything
 

759
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,350
close this off I think that's everything
here so now all I have to do is watch us

760
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:58,360
here so now all I have to do is watch us
 

761
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,109
here so now all I have to do is watch us
make sure it works and we'll have to fix

762
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:04,119
make sure it works and we'll have to fix
 

763
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,850
make sure it works and we'll have to fix
this front here because I'm not going to

764
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:05,860
this front here because I'm not going to
 

765
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,310
this front here because I'm not going to
keep it like this this is pretty pretty

766
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,320
keep it like this this is pretty pretty
 

767
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,249
keep it like this this is pretty pretty
darn ugly if you ask me I have to try

768
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:11,259
darn ugly if you ask me I have to try
 

769
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:12,570
darn ugly if you ask me I have to try
figure out something that looks cool

770
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:12,580
figure out something that looks cool
 

771
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,729
figure out something that looks cool
we'll probably integrate some Pistons

772
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:14,739
we'll probably integrate some Pistons
 

773
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:18,539
we'll probably integrate some Pistons
into this and other things as well but

774
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:18,549
into this and other things as well but
 

775
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:21,450
into this and other things as well but
for for this time I'm just going to

776
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:21,460
for for this time I'm just going to
 

777
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,039
for for this time I'm just going to
watch it well it looks like we've got a

778
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:26,049
watch it well it looks like we've got a
 

779
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,820
watch it well it looks like we've got a
few slimes here and they're behaving

780
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:28,830
few slimes here and they're behaving
 

781
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:34,409
few slimes here and they're behaving
he's not getting out so I guess what I'm

782
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:34,419
he's not getting out so I guess what I'm
 

783
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:37,859
he's not getting out so I guess what I'm
going to do is just try see what happens

784
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:37,869
going to do is just try see what happens
 

785
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:45,389
going to do is just try see what happens
if we split them see if they'll make

786
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:45,399
if we split them see if they'll make
 

787
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:48,779
if we split them see if they'll make
their way up you can do it buddy oh

788
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:48,789
their way up you can do it buddy oh
 

789
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:52,680
their way up you can do it buddy oh
you're so close oh you know what they're

790
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:52,690
you're so close oh you know what they're
 

791
