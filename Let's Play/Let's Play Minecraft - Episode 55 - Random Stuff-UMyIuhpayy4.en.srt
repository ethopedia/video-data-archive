00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:14,310
never know and another thing I'm worried
 

45
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,730
never know and another thing I'm worried
about is if I built my base low enough

46
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:16,740
about is if I built my base low enough
 

47
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,609
about is if I built my base low enough
because if it's not low enough when the

48
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:19,619
because if it's not low enough when the
 

49
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,350
because if it's not low enough when the
tnt goes off down there I'm gonna

50
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
tnt goes off down there I'm gonna
 

51
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,320
tnt goes off down there I'm gonna
receive damage up on the platform here

52
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,330
receive damage up on the platform here
 

53
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,569
receive damage up on the platform here
and I might have to lower the base

54
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:28,579

 

55
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:34,609

anyway it's fully loaded and hopefully

56
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:34,619
anyway it's fully loaded and hopefully
 

57
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:35,749
anyway it's fully loaded and hopefully
there will be no problems and I can

58
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
there will be no problems and I can
 

59
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,679
there will be no problems and I can
finish it up then so here's to the first

60
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:39,689
finish it up then so here's to the first

another 360 cannon a normal-type and

another 360 cannon a normal-type and
I'll use this timer here so I'm not

I'll use this timer here so I'm not
 

89
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,150
I'll use this timer here so I'm not
gonna remove this until I do that and

90
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
gonna remove this until I do that and
 

91
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,699
gonna remove this until I do that and
then I'll make the tutorial as I built

92

then I'll make the tutorial as I built
 

93
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,280
then I'll make the tutorial as I built
that cannon as well for you guys so

95
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,890

that's something I'm gonna do one

that's something I'm gonna do one
 

97
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,720
that's something I'm gonna do one
question you guys had was how to handle

miss loaded TNT in the nether cannon
 

101
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,310
miss loaded TNT in the nether cannon
that's a pretty good question something

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:13,320
that's a pretty good question something
 

103
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,020
that's a pretty good question something
I never really thought about while I was

00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,030
I never really thought about while I was
 

105
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,640
I never really thought about while I was
building it but definitely became an

106
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:19,650
building it but definitely became an
 

107
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:26,690
building it but definitely became an
issue once I had it all done I don't

108
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:26,700
issue once I had it all done I don't
 

109
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,640
issue once I had it all done I don't
know if this still works but in the past

110
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:28,650
know if this still works but in the past
 

111
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,009
know if this still works but in the past
there was a really cool trick you could

112
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:31,019
there was a really cool trick you could
 

113
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,490
there was a really cool trick you could
do I think it might have been fixed

114
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:34,500
do I think it might have been fixed
 

115
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,130
do I think it might have been fixed
though

116
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,140

 

117
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,760

before if you had a soil block and say a

118
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:42,770
before if you had a soil block and say a
 

119
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,870
before if you had a soil block and say a
TNT above it I'll just use a cobblestone

120
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:46,880
TNT above it I'll just use a cobblestone
 

121
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,930
TNT above it I'll just use a cobblestone
for this test and this cobblestone is

122
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:49,940
for this test and this cobblestone is
 

123
00:03:49,940 --> 00:04:00,310
for this test and this cobblestone is
TNT you were able to use your mum on the

124
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,320
TNT you were able to use your mum on the
 

125
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,470
TNT you were able to use your mum on the
soil and then plant a seed if you aimed

126
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
soil and then plant a seed if you aimed
 

127
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,809
soil and then plant a seed if you aimed
like right here on top of the soil block

128
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:07,819
like right here on top of the soil block
 

129
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:13,090
like right here on top of the soil block
I guess it doesn't work anymore but that

130
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,100
I guess it doesn't work anymore but that
 

131
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,759
I guess it doesn't work anymore but that
used to destroy the block above it even

132
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:15,769
used to destroy the block above it even
 

133
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:18,159
used to destroy the block above it even
if it was bedrock any block they would

134
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:18,169
if it was bedrock any block they would
 

135
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:26,040
if it was bedrock any block they would
destroy but I guess that's fixed now so

136
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,050
destroy but I guess that's fixed now so
 

137
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:37,680
destroy but I guess that's fixed now so
some other ideas I had for let's say

138
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:37,690

 

139
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,940

let's pretend this torch here is

140
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:39,950
let's pretend this torch here is
 

141
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,020
let's pretend this torch here is
redstone and you miss loaded by placing

142
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,030
redstone and you miss loaded by placing
 

143
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,960
redstone and you miss loaded by placing
the TNT above the redstone what do you

144
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:46,970
the TNT above the redstone what do you
 

145
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,930
the TNT above the redstone what do you
do you remove the redstone near it and I

146
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:52,940
do you remove the redstone near it and I
 

147
00:04:52,940 --> 00:05:00,309
do you remove the redstone near it and I
think use place slabs all around it

148
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:00,319

 

149
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,249

top I think that will absorb most of the

150
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:04,259
top I think that will absorb most of the
 

151
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:10,790
top I think that will absorb most of the
blow okay I have four torches here let's

152
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
blow okay I have four torches here let's
 

153
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:19,309
blow okay I have four torches here let's
see how many get destroyed yeah just the

154
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:19,319
see how many get destroyed yeah just the
 

155
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,219
see how many get destroyed yeah just the
one so I think it blows out like a three

156
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:22,229
one so I think it blows out like a three
 

157
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:25,969
one so I think it blows out like a three
by three by three area so that's a

158
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:25,979
by three by three area so that's a
 

159
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:30,129
by three by three area so that's a
pretty safe way of getting rid of TNT I

160
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:30,139
pretty safe way of getting rid of TNT I
 

161
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:37,960
pretty safe way of getting rid of TNT I
want to see what happens if you do solid

162
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:37,970

 

163
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,890

see if it makes any difference

164
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:43,900

 

165
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,570

I just I need some way to detonate it

166
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:48,580
I just I need some way to detonate it
 

167
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:55,980
I just I need some way to detonate it
there okay and then I'm gonna play soil

168
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:55,990
there okay and then I'm gonna play soil
 

169
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,530
there okay and then I'm gonna play soil
around it so we can visualize what

170
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:58,540
around it so we can visualize what
 

171
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:12,990
around it so we can visualize what
happens better they'll probably work the

172
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,000
happens better they'll probably work the
 

173
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,260
happens better they'll probably work the
same I'm guessing but it's always nice

174
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,270
same I'm guessing but it's always nice
 

175
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:33,060
same I'm guessing but it's always nice
to try things out damage me oh okay well

176
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,070
to try things out damage me oh okay well
 

177
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,540
to try things out damage me oh okay well
that didn't work nearly as well actually

178
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:36,550
that didn't work nearly as well actually
 

179
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:42,240
that didn't work nearly as well actually
blew up part of my timer here so stick

180
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,250
blew up part of my timer here so stick
 

181
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:51,450
blew up part of my timer here so stick
with the half slabs I guess darn it now

182
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:51,460
with the half slabs I guess darn it now
 

183
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,880
with the half slabs I guess darn it now
I need to fix that okay I'll do that

184
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:56,890
I need to fix that okay I'll do that
 

185
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:03,900
I need to fix that okay I'll do that
I'll clean this up later okay so this

186
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:03,910
I'll clean this up later okay so this
 

187
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,490
I'll clean this up later okay so this
might be a little bit confusing but if

188
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:05,500
might be a little bit confusing but if
 

189
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,010
might be a little bit confusing but if

198
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:25,720
point four and I've already recorded an
 

199
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,480
point four and I've already recorded an
episode in 1.5 so what happened is I

200
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:30,490
episode in 1.5 so what happened is I
 

201
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:37,020
episode in 1.5 so what happened is I
recorded those five minutes from first

202
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,030
recorded those five minutes from first
 

203
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,540
recorded those five minutes from first
five minutes of this episode from the

204
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:39,550
five minutes of this episode from the
 

205
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,110
five minutes of this episode from the
one point four patch still I record a

206
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
one point four patch still I record a
 

207
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,270
one point four patch still I record a
whole episode and then I scrapped

208
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
whole episode and then I scrapped
 

209
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,270
whole episode and then I scrapped
most of it because I had an issue with

210
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,280
most of it because I had an issue with
 

211
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,400
most of it because I had an issue with
something and before I could finish up

212
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:53,410
something and before I could finish up
 

213
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,100
something and before I could finish up
the episode with more footage the 1.5

214
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,110
the episode with more footage the 1.5
 

215
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,930
the episode with more footage the 1.5
patch came out and I wanted to cover a

216
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:00,940
patch came out and I wanted to cover a
 

217
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:08,910
patch came out and I wanted to cover a
whole episode on it and I did and so I

218
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:08,920
whole episode on it and I did and so I
 

219
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,800
whole episode on it and I did and so I
still have some footage from before that

220
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:12,810
still have some footage from before that
 

221
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,350
still have some footage from before that
and what happened is I was working on

222
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:16,360
and what happened is I was working on
 

223
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,080
and what happened is I was working on
this road thing here I'm about to show

224
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,090
this road thing here I'm about to show
 

225
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:24,120
this road thing here I'm about to show
you as a possible concept for SMP

226
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,130
you as a possible concept for SMP
 

227
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,230
you as a possible concept for SMP
servers instead of having the regular

228
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
servers instead of having the regular
 

229
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,110
servers instead of having the regular
paths that interconnect all the houses

230
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
paths that interconnect all the houses
 

231
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,070
paths that interconnect all the houses
with each other and direct people around

232
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,080
with each other and direct people around
 

233
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,360
with each other and direct people around
the server you know how you have those

234
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,370
the server you know how you have those
 

235
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,290
the server you know how you have those
paths they're usually five four or five

236
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:40,300
paths they're usually five four or five
 

237
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,210
paths they're usually five four or five
five blocks wide and I thought hey why

238
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:45,220
five blocks wide and I thought hey why
 

239
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,220
five blocks wide and I thought hey why
not put water on one side going one way

240
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,230
not put water on one side going one way
 

241
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,050
not put water on one side going one way
and water on the other side going other

242
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:49,060
and water on the other side going other
 

243
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,660
and water on the other side going other
way and you can get around a lot faster

244
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:51,670
way and you can get around a lot faster
 

245
00:08:51,670 --> 00:09:04,260
way and you can get around a lot faster
right that was the idea and you can make

246
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:04,270
right that was the idea and you can make
 

247
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,850
right that was the idea and you can make
it go up till you can make it go down

248
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:05,860
it go up till you can make it go down
 

249
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,860
it go up till you can make it go down
hill and do all kinds of stuff with it

250
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:07,870
hill and do all kinds of stuff with it
 

251
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:14,010
hill and do all kinds of stuff with it
right yeah so I did a test and I found

252
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,020
right yeah so I did a test and I found
 

253
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,030
right yeah so I did a test and I found
out walking with the water is actually

254
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,040
out walking with the water is actually
 

255
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,490
out walking with the water is actually
slower than walking just normally I

256
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:22,500
slower than walking just normally I
 

257
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,270
slower than walking just normally I
figured that out at the end of the

258
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:24,280
figured that out at the end of the
 

259
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,430
figured that out at the end of the
episode so this whole idea was stupid so

260
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:28,440
episode so this whole idea was stupid so
 

261
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,560
episode so this whole idea was stupid so
it's a waste of an episode I found out

262
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:31,570
it's a waste of an episode I found out
 

263
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,890
it's a waste of an episode I found out
that walking in water you travel roughly

264
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:36,900
that walking in water you travel roughly
 

265
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,830
that walking in water you travel roughly
3 and 3/4 blocks per second

266
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:40,840
3 and 3/4 blocks per second
 

267
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,030
3 and 3/4 blocks per second
and walking normally you travel a four

268
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
and walking normally you travel a four
 

269
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,440
and walking normally you travel a four
and a quarter blocks per second so

270
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,450
and a quarter blocks per second so
 

271
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,190
and a quarter blocks per second so
walking is slightly faster than walking

272
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,200
walking is slightly faster than walking
 

273
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,780
walking is slightly faster than walking
with the water currents which is very it

274
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:57,790
with the water currents which is very it
 

275
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,820
with the water currents which is very it
doesn't make sense but that's not logic

276
00:09:59,820 --> 00:09:59,830
doesn't make sense but that's not logic
 

277
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:03,680
doesn't make sense but that's not logic
for you right and I also found out that

278
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:03,690
for you right and I also found out that
 

279
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,270
for you right and I also found out that
if you just sit in the water like this

280
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,280
if you just sit in the water like this
 

281
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,440
if you just sit in the water like this
and have it pull you you go about 1.8

282
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:10,450
and have it pull you you go about 1.8
 

283
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:18,390
and have it pull you you go about 1.8
blocks per second but yeah I decide not

284
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:18,400
blocks per second but yeah I decide not
 

285
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,480
blocks per second but yeah I decide not
to spend the whole episode on this since

286
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,490
to spend the whole episode on this since
 

287
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,510
to spend the whole episode on this since
it didn't work so that's what I figured

288
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:24,520
it didn't work so that's what I figured
 

289
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,430
it didn't work so that's what I figured
out I'm gonna show you what I've been

290
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
out I'm gonna show you what I've been
 

291
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,670
out I'm gonna show you what I've been
doing with the minecarts all right this

292
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
doing with the minecarts all right this
 

293
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,230
doing with the minecarts all right this
is something I was messing around with

294
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:37,240
is something I was messing around with
 

295
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,970
is something I was messing around with
today I still have I have a whole lot of

296
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:38,980
today I still have I have a whole lot of
 

297
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,560
today I still have I have a whole lot of
time at the place and sip a CH came out

298
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:42,570
time at the place and sip a CH came out
 

299
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,430
time at the place and sip a CH came out
but last episode I was messing around

300
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
but last episode I was messing around
 

301
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,460
but last episode I was messing around
with the door booster because I some

302
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:50,470
with the door booster because I some
 

303
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,130
with the door booster because I some
reason I think I've read it or I either

304
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:53,140
reason I think I've read it or I either
 

305
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,350
reason I think I've read it or I either
watched a video on it but someone said

306
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
watched a video on it but someone said
 

307
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,770
watched a video on it but someone said
that you can't have these power rails on

308
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:58,780
that you can't have these power rails on
 

309
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,840
that you can't have these power rails on
slopes or on curves and silly me I

310
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:03,850
slopes or on curves and silly me I
 

311
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,120
slopes or on curves and silly me I
didn't even try to see if that was true

312
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,130
didn't even try to see if that was true
 

313
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,600
didn't even try to see if that was true
so I've got a lot of feedback on this

314
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:09,610
so I've got a lot of feedback on this
 

315
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,470
so I've got a lot of feedback on this
thank you everybody

316
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
thank you everybody
 

317
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,350
thank you everybody

318
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
yes it is possible and that's a good way
 

319
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,430
yes it is possible and that's a good way
to launch karts makes things a lot

320
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
to launch karts makes things a lot
 

321
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,490
to launch karts makes things a lot
simpler I won't bother to show you this

322
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:20,500
simpler I won't bother to show you this
 

323
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,810
simpler I won't bother to show you this
I was working on making like a buffer

324
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:24,820
I was working on making like a buffer
 

325
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,660
I was working on making like a buffer
kind of like a PEZ dispenser except the

326
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:27,670
kind of like a PEZ dispenser except the
 

327
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,650
kind of like a PEZ dispenser except the
spread out horizontally that

328
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:33,660

 

329
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,590

doesn't require the old boosting style

330
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:36,600
doesn't require the old boosting style
 

331
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,990
doesn't require the old boosting style
to get going because you can hook up you

332
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
to get going because you can hook up you
 

333
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,910
to get going because you can hook up you
can't mix these new booster rails with

334
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
can't mix these new booster rails with
 

335
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,460
can't mix these new booster rails with
the Pez dispensers which is cool but it

336
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:48,470
the Pez dispensers which is cool but it
 

337
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,920
the Pez dispensers which is cool but it
requires both the boosting styles to

338
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:51,930
requires both the boosting styles to
 

339
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,020
requires both the boosting styles to
work so I wanted to make one that holds

340
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,030
work so I wanted to make one that holds
 

341
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,910
work so I wanted to make one that holds
each of the carts individually spread

342
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:58,920
each of the carts individually spread
 

343
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,060
each of the carts individually spread
out horizontally each one of these is

344
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,070
out horizontally each one of these is
 

345
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,090
out horizontally each one of these is
four blocks apart so it's it's not super

346
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,100
four blocks apart so it's it's not super
 

347
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,410
four blocks apart so it's it's not super
compact but it's it's nice and they look

348
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:09,420
compact but it's it's nice and they look
 

349
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,440
compact but it's it's nice and they look
really cool when they go I like that

350
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:11,450
really cool when they go I like that
 

351
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,040
really cool when they go I like that
what is going on here is there's a

352
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,050
what is going on here is there's a
 

353
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,820
what is going on here is there's a
there's a detector here okay well the

354
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:19,830
there's a detector here okay well the
 

355
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,040
there's a detector here okay well the

rail here at this cart song and then

364
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:39,480
rail here at this cart song and then
 

365
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,840

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,230
this cart triggers this detector and on
the opposite side same thing goes here

368
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:45,240
the opposite side same thing goes here
 

369
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,210
the opposite side same thing goes here
to the next power rail and so so on and

00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:50,220
to the next power rail and so so on and
 

371
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,530
to the next power rail and so so on and
so forth so you can keep doing this

372
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:54,540
so forth so you can keep doing this
 

373
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,620
so forth so you can keep doing this
basically infinitely for as many carts

374
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:57,630
basically infinitely for as many carts
 

375
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,380
basically infinitely for as many carts
as you want I thought this was a good

376
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:00,390
as you want I thought this was a good
 

377
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,390
as you want I thought this was a good
idea but it has some serious flaws that

378
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:04,400
idea but it has some serious flaws that
 

379
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:11,540
idea but it has some serious flaws that
I overlooked if you send out due cards

380
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:11,550
I overlooked if you send out due cards
 

381
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,230
I overlooked if you send out due cards
at once

382
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
at once
 

383
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,450
at once
you got problems

384
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:15,460

 

385
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:21,980

because this is off so that messes it up

386
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:21,990
because this is off so that messes it up
 

387
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:27,420
because this is off so that messes it up
and it starts going the wrong way just a

388
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:27,430
and it starts going the wrong way just a
 

389
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:35,570
and it starts going the wrong way just a
total disaster

390
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:35,580

 

391
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,190

same thing if you add carts like if I

392
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:38,200
same thing if you add carts like if I
 

393
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,570
same thing if you add carts like if I
have four cars phone in here and then

394
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:39,580
have four cars phone in here and then
 

395
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,600
have four cars phone in here and then
have problems so ideally what I want

396
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:42,610
have problems so ideally what I want
 

397
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:53,100
have problems so ideally what I want
just to be doing just to set here is how

398
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,110
just to be doing just to set here is how
 

399
00:13:53,110 --> 00:14:01,620
just to be doing just to set here is how
you load it ideally what I would like

400
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:01,630
you load it ideally what I would like
 

401
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,240
you load it ideally what I would like
this to be doing if there was no cart

402
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,250
this to be doing if there was no cart
 

403
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,070
this to be doing if there was no cart
here okay let's let's say there's no

404
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,080
here okay let's let's say there's no
 

405
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:18,960
here okay let's let's say there's no
cart here this should be powered no it's

406
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:18,970
cart here this should be powered no it's
 

407
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,790
cart here this should be powered no it's
only one cart here no carts here ideally

408
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
only one cart here no carts here ideally
 

409
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,620
only one cart here no carts here ideally
this one should be powered on and this

410
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:25,630
this one should be powered on and this
 

411
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,620
this one should be powered on and this
one should be off because this one

412
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:28,630
one should be off because this one
 

413
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,329
one should be off because this one
should detect that there's no cart here

414
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:30,339
should detect that there's no cart here
 

415
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:32,610
should detect that there's no cart here
and Beyond and when the cart moves to

416
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:32,620
and Beyond and when the cart moves to
 

417
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,000
and Beyond and when the cart moves to
here it would go off that's what I would

418
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,010
here it would go off that's what I would
 

419
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,600
here it would go off that's what I would
like it to do but there is no way I've

420
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:39,610
like it to do but there is no way I've
 

421
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,820
like it to do but there is no way I've
messed around with this there's no way

422
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:41,830
messed around with this there's no way
 

423
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,150
messed around with this there's no way
to have a minecart on one of these power

424
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,160
to have a minecart on one of these power
 

425
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,400
to have a minecart on one of these power
rails and one of these detectors at the

426
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:47,410
rails and one of these detectors at the
 

427
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,540
rails and one of these detectors at the
same time without getting launched off

428
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:50,550
same time without getting launched off
 

429
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:55,350
same time without getting launched off
and there's no wave even to have it's my

430
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
and there's no wave even to have it's my
 

431
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,380
and there's no wave even to have it's my
cart on them power rail and a regular

432
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:58,390
cart on them power rail and a regular
 

433
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,370
cart on them power rail and a regular
pressure plate at the same time either I

434
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:01,380
pressure plate at the same time either I
 

435
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,960
pressure plate at the same time either I
tried lots of different ways and I just

436
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:03,970
tried lots of different ways and I just
 

437
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,980
tried lots of different ways and I just
couldn't get it to work so the only way

438
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:07,990
couldn't get it to work so the only way
 

439
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,560
couldn't get it to work so the only way
to do this properly is to use RS nor

440
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:10,570
to do this properly is to use RS nor
 

441
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,560
to do this properly is to use RS nor
latch --is for each of these and it

latch --is for each of these and it
 

443
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,569

would just take up so much wiring and

444
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:15,579
would just take up so much wiring and
 

445
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:19,260
would just take up so much wiring and
become so complicated that it's I'm just

446
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,270
become so complicated that it's I'm just
 

447
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,470
become so complicated that it's I'm just
gonna use a Pez dispensers for the

448
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
gonna use a Pez dispensers for the
 

449
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,030
gonna use a Pez dispensers for the
storage room

450
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,040
storage room
 

451
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,670
storage room
here's what I figured out I'm gonna show

452
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
here's what I figured out I'm gonna show
 

453
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,199
here's what I figured out I'm gonna show
you this next thing it turned out a

454
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:29,209
you this next thing it turned out a
 

455
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:37,620
you this next thing it turned out a
little bit better let's go to day though

456
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:37,630

 

457
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,910

seems like everything I try to make with

458
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
seems like everything I try to make with
 

459
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,280
seems like everything I try to make with
mine carts doesn't turn out for some

460
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,290
mine carts doesn't turn out for some
 

461
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,829
mine carts doesn't turn out for some
reason and like everything I make with

462
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:44,839
reason and like everything I make with
 

463
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,530
reason and like everything I make with
boats always works no matter how

464
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:47,540
boats always works no matter how
 

465
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:52,749
boats always works no matter how
ridiculous it is but this turned out

466
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:52,759
ridiculous it is but this turned out
 

467
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,410
ridiculous it is but this turned out
kind of it's a little bigger than I

468
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:56,420
kind of it's a little bigger than I
 

469
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,530
kind of it's a little bigger than I
hoping it would be this is actually one

470
00:15:59,530 --> 00:15:59,540
hoping it would be this is actually one
 

471
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,579
hoping it would be this is actually one

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,519
start it here right now it's this torch
is on it's a counter is what it is and

482
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:27,529
is on it's a counter is what it is and
 

483
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,650
is on it's a counter is what it is and
so when you press the button it's going

484
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:29,660
so when you press the button it's going
 

485
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:36,519
so when you press the button it's going
to advance forward one now when we check

486
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:36,529
to advance forward one now when we check
 

487
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,460
to advance forward one now when we check
here it set the second one press it

488
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:39,470
here it set the second one press it
 

489
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:48,189
here it set the second one press it
again it'll be at the third one and you

490
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:48,199
again it'll be at the third one and you
 

491
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:49,780
again it'll be at the third one and you
can keep chaining them for as many as

492
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:49,790
can keep chaining them for as many as
 

493
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,490
can keep chaining them for as many as
you want and ideally you would have it

494
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:51,500
you want and ideally you would have it
 

495
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,509
you want and ideally you would have it
loop back and start over this would be

496
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
loop back and start over this would be
 

497
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,269
loop back and start over this would be
very useful for making 7-segment

498
00:16:58,269 --> 00:16:58,279
very useful for making 7-segment
 

499
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,400
very useful for making 7-segment
displays the Xbox nut actually made

500
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,410
displays the Xbox nut actually made
 

501
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,120
displays the Xbox nut actually made
something very similar to this out of my

502
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,130
something very similar to this out of my
 

503
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,370
something very similar to this out of my
boat memory thing I gave them the

504
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:09,380
boat memory thing I gave them the
 

505
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,449
boat memory thing I gave them the
suggestion to to make a base 10 counter

506
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:13,459
suggestion to to make a base 10 counter
 

507
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,210
suggestion to to make a base 10 counter
memory unit and it turned out pretty

508
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:16,220
memory unit and it turned out pretty
 

509
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,520
memory unit and it turned out pretty
good it's a little bit bigger than this

510
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:18,530
good it's a little bit bigger than this
 

511
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,520
good it's a little bit bigger than this
would be if you use Maya carts now I'll

512
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:21,530
would be if you use Maya carts now I'll
 

513
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,230
would be if you use Maya carts now I'll
I'll link it in the description in this

514
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:23,240
I'll link it in the description in this
 

515
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:32,620
I'll link it in the description in this
video so I might make a tutorial on this

516
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:32,630

 

517
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,230

I'll try to explain this the best I can

518
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
I'll try to explain this the best I can
 

519
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,750
I'll try to explain this the best I can
so so one application for this is to

520
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
so so one application for this is to
 

521
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,320
so so one application for this is to
represent numbers if you set up ten of

522
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:45,330
represent numbers if you set up ten of
 

523
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,460
represent numbers if you set up ten of
these pressure plates unit things

524
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:48,470
these pressure plates unit things
 

525
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:53,930
these pressure plates unit things
they're four blocks each apart so if you

526
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:53,940
they're four blocks each apart so if you
 

527
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:59,240
they're four blocks each apart so if you
made ten of them it would be ideally you

528
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,250
made ten of them it would be ideally you
 

529
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,240
made ten of them it would be ideally you
would have five on one side of this

530
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,250
would have five on one side of this
 

531
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,740
would have five on one side of this
inside track and five on the other side

532
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:03,750
inside track and five on the other side
 

533
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,490
inside track and five on the other side
and you would make a goal loop around

534
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:06,500
and you would make a goal loop around
 

535
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,040
and you would make a goal loop around
inside track and you would move this

536
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,050
inside track and you would move this
 

537
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,500
inside track and you would move this
holding thing to the side or something

538
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:14,510

 

539
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,920

yeah you could represent a number from 0

540
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:18,930
yeah you could represent a number from 0
 

541
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,660
yeah you could represent a number from 0
to 9 like this would be 0 so be 1/2 all

542
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:23,670
to 9 like this would be 0 so be 1/2 all
 

543
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,720
to 9 like this would be 0 so be 1/2 all
the way to 9 when it gets to 9 it would

544
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:26,730
the way to 9 when it gets to 9 it would
 

545
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:32,660
the way to 9 when it gets to 9 it would
loop back to 0 again and if you had 2 of

546
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:32,670
loop back to 0 again and if you had 2 of
 

547
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,850
loop back to 0 again and if you had 2 of
these base 10 units you could represent

548
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:34,860
these base 10 units you could represent
 

549
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,630
these base 10 units you could represent
a number from 0 to 99 3 you could

550
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
a number from 0 to 99 3 you could
 

551
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,280
a number from 0 to 99 3 you could
represent a number from 0 to 999 and so

552
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:43,290
represent a number from 0 to 999 and so
 

553
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:50,800
represent a number from 0 to 999 and so
forth and so on so it's pretty cool it's

554
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:50,810
forth and so on so it's pretty cool it's
 

555
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,030
forth and so on so it's pretty cool it's
it's not an easy thing to do in

556
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,040
it's not an easy thing to do in
 

557
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,940
it's not an easy thing to do in
Minecraft so what happens is I don't

558
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:58,950
Minecraft so what happens is I don't
 

559
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,500
Minecraft so what happens is I don't
know why this is powered right now it's

560
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:00,510
know why this is powered right now it's
 

561
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,230
know why this is powered right now it's
not supposed to be the power rails are

562
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:03,240
not supposed to be the power rails are
 

563
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:12,500
not supposed to be the power rails are
still pretty glitched but yeah so the

564
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:12,510
still pretty glitched but yeah so the
 

565
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,540
still pretty glitched but yeah so the
cart would go around once and it would

566
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:14,550
cart would go around once and it would
 

567
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,140
cart would go around once and it would
push the cart from this pressure plate

568
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,150
push the cart from this pressure plate
 

569
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,190
push the cart from this pressure plate
when the carts on this pressure plate

570
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
when the carts on this pressure plate
 

571
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,240
when the carts on this pressure plate
that lights this up and then it would

572
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:23,250
that lights this up and then it would
 

573
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,440
that lights this up and then it would
fall down to here

574
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:24,450
fall down to here
 

575
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,510
fall down to here
and get stuck on this slope and then

576
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
and get stuck on this slope and then
 

577
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,460
and get stuck on this slope and then
when the cart goes around to this

578
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:31,470
when the cart goes around to this
 

579
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,680
when the cart goes around to this
detector it sends a signal to all if you

580
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:36,690
detector it sends a signal to all if you
 

581
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,940
detector it sends a signal to all if you
had 10 of them it would send it to all

582
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:37,950
had 10 of them it would send it to all
 

583
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,030
had 10 of them it would send it to all
10 of the power rails down here on the

584
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,040
10 of the power rails down here on the
 

585
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,049
10 of the power rails down here on the
slope

586
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:46,059

 

587
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,570

and then it shoots the minecart up to

588
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:49,580
and then it shoots the minecart up to
 

589
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,680
and then it shoots the minecart up to
the next pressure plate and stops and

590
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:53,690
the next pressure plate and stops and
 

591
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,899
the next pressure plate and stops and
it'll go again the next time the cart

592
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:55,909
it'll go again the next time the cart
 

593
00:19:55,909 --> 00:20:01,720
it'll go again the next time the cart
goes around so a pretty cool counter I

594
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:01,730
goes around so a pretty cool counter I
 

595
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,909
goes around so a pretty cool counter I
will also be using this in my secret

596
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
will also be using this in my secret
 

597
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,580
will also be using this in my secret
project which will I'll hopefully get to

598
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:06,590
project which will I'll hopefully get to
 

599
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,060
project which will I'll hopefully get to
soon I'm not going to tell you what it

600
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,070
soon I'm not going to tell you what it
 

601
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,590
soon I'm not going to tell you what it
is but it's going to be very complicated

602
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:14,600
is but it's going to be very complicated
 

603
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,380
is but it's going to be very complicated
and very cool hopefully if it turns out

604
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:19,390

 

605
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,320

maybe a collection of so many

606
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,330
maybe a collection of so many
 

607
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,159
maybe a collection of so many
complicated things mine carts boats

608
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:26,169
complicated things mine carts boats
 

609
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:35,220
complicated things mine carts boats
redstone music TNT it's gonna be crazy

610
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,230

 

611
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,690

I'm gonna check the time and we might do

612
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:37,700
I'm gonna check the time and we might do
 

613
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,549
I'm gonna check the time and we might do
some other stuff yet mmm I think it's

614
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
some other stuff yet mmm I think it's
 

615
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,000
some other stuff yet mmm I think it's
about 20 minutes in but it's late here

616
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,010
about 20 minutes in but it's late here
 

617
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,130
about 20 minutes in but it's late here
so I think I'm gonna pretty much end it

618
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:48,140
so I think I'm gonna pretty much end it
 

619
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:53,440
so I think I'm gonna pretty much end it
here so that I can get the episode up

620
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:53,450
here so that I can get the episode up
 

621
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:58,360
here so that I can get the episode up
today we're just gonna do something

622
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:58,370
today we're just gonna do something
 

623
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,220
today we're just gonna do something
really simple

624
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,230

 

625
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,860

you guys have commented that the stairs

626
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:05,870
you guys have commented that the stairs
 

627
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,430
you guys have commented that the stairs
do not let light pass through anymore

628
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:08,440
do not let light pass through anymore
 

629
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,580
do not let light pass through anymore
and let's say we're there before the

630
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:12,590
and let's say we're there before the
 

631
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:18,210
and let's say we're there before the
patch not too happy about that

632
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:18,220

 

633
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:26,799

what do you want but like like a lot of

634
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:26,809
what do you want but like like a lot of
 

635
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:28,690
what do you want but like like a lot of
things I should probably test it myself

636
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:28,700
things I should probably test it myself
 

637
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:49,060
things I should probably test it myself
just so let's see if it's true or not

638
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,070

 

639
